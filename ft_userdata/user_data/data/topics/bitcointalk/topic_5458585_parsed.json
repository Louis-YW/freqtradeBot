Dis wan na good development and I hope say oda banks too go follow the same pattern so that the prices go move swiftly. And I just hope the exchange fee wouldn’t be that high that will discourage people from using this service. Good development by Gtbank and I applaud their courage for this.",

If you want to get dollar, it is still through the former means those people are using because they can only convert dollar to naira, not naira to dollar.",

Na better market dem dey open so and before people begin dey realized wetin dey sup GTB (abi wetin dem dey all their self now because I hear say dem dun change name) go dun make better block. Why dem no allow us covert Naira to dollars that's because dem no value to hold Naira na only dollars dem wan dey buy.To make you understand better, you go see many vendor willing to buy your BTC but not many willing to sell BTC to you. This one na personal vendors matta oh no be exchange matter. If any bank wey do this kind thing make dem make am wey be say you fit buy and sell and not only one way thing. Dollars still never dey everywhere and no wonder dey wan make una give them the dollars make dem give you Naira wey who knows what next will happen to it as e fit just crash down totally as people dun dey doubt tinubu government as e just belike him wan just reward only those wey work for am to enter office and not using those that are trustworthy and competent.",

We have move on because other innovative ways to get money for dollars, change am to Naira or convert your Naira into dollar don dey and this one you nor need to do bank waka, or submit plenty documents. Two of the the most prominent alternatives na - Chipper Cash, Barter by Flutterwave. I sabi say the concern wey people get na say these companies no get physical office wey be say if anything happen dem go sabi where to go but that one no correct.

Many people go see this one as welcome development, while some others no go take I'm likely because eh go be like big competition to their business especially those aboki peope wey dey change money, OP like you done talk, eh get better possibility to spoil business for them because a lot of people wey dey leave far from them due to distance no go wan drive that far or pay money to go meet aboki  when them go fit easily go open account with Gtbank then change their dollar from the comfort of their home. And this new development from Gtb go attract new customers to their bank. Well the only thing wey I feel say fit hinder this development na the rate, and if the rate a which them they buy they fair or almost equall to the price of that of the aboki people them then na big gbas gbos to their business because i no see reason why I go dey waste time they journey far to go meet aboki to exchange dollar when I fit do I'm from the comfort of my house and all eh go just cost me na an account  with Gtbank, a good device and data connection. But if these Gbank really mean business, that is if they want attract many customers to their bank make them also create options wia people fit buy dollar too, and no be only them buying from peope eh for even better if you go fit convert your naira to dollar for the app. Well na only time go tell if them go include that option but eh for make better sense.",
