  "content": "Got new windows pc and installed ledger live on it.  My old windows pc also still has ledger live on it.  I do not plan to use the old pc for a while and will not have access to it.Is the best thing to just remove ledger live from add/remove programs in windows?  Or is there any other method?  Of course you still need the password to access ledger live but having it on the desktop screen doesn'ts seem like a good idea.I don't plan to wipe this laptop though.  I should definitely wipe out ledger live right?  And add/remove programs or can you do something on ledger live to remove it?  But I still wouldn't want ledger live on the older laptop since I won't have access to it.",

This will prevent most adversaries from even knowing Ledger Live was installed, although I'm sure Windows being as it is will have left over temporary files or registry keys which a determined attacker could find to ascertain that Ledger Live was once installed.Even in the unlikely scenario someone was able to recover all the files they would not be able to see your accounts unless they also had your Ledger Live password or could brute force it. The only way to erase all traces of Ledger Live will be to format the drive and reinstall the OS, which I'm guessing you don't want to do and seems like a bit of overkill to me unless you are selling or giving away the computer (in which case you would definitely want to format your drive for other reasons).Note that Ledger also have an uninstaller .exe you can download from here: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live",

      "body": "1. If you only need additional free storage space on old PC, you can uninstall it normally through \"add/remove programs\" feature on Windows OS.2. If you have very serious privacy concern, you need to eitherFormat the drive and install the OS again. But take note quick format still give possibility Ledger data could be restored, unless it's overwritten by OS files.Use third-party uninstaller software (such as Revo uninstaller) which can find and delete all leftover data. Afterwards, you need to either write zeros on free space (if you HDD) or trigger TRIM (if you SSD).3. Otherwise, there's no need to do anything unless you have free time to spare. P.S. This suggestion apply to any unused software on your computer or smartphone.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 23, 2022, 07:55:40 AMNote that Ledger also have an uninstaller .exe you can download from here: https://www.ledger.com/ledger-liveI find it's weird they make separate uninstaller rather than including it on the installer.",

Then again some software definitely needs a separate full uninstaller like ddu.OP, if you still plan on using your last pc you can also lock your account and add a new one for another user. A guest account or something like that.",

But too late for that for you now. In your case, I would either just uninstall it normally and then delete any files left behind, which will hide the fact that it was installed from most people. Or if you want to hide it from even the most determined attacker, then use ETFbitcoin's suggestion of Revo Uninstaller. I can't vouch for this program since I don't use Windows, but it seems like it will remove as many traces of the program short of formatting your drive (which you've already said you don't want to do).",

But it will be better if you add some more steps to this.Did you read what I wrote in my last post in this topic? It's just in case to remove all Ledger Live files for sure. I hope after that your questions will disappear.Quote from: m2017 on October 23, 2022, 08:52:17 AMIf I'm not mistaken, then the files may remain in the directory (or somewhere there, therefore, it will not be superfluous to check the folders with the Ledger Live name and delete them): Computer/Disc/Users/YourUserName/AppData/Local/Temp More or less like this.
