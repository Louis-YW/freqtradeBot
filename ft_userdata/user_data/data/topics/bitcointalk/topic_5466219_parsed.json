  "content": "Hello bitcointalkers!Our launch at PancakeSwap was a success!We practically doubled the value of the launch, which was US$0.0003. Take a look at the graph below:https://ibb.co/CHS5TTwLet's update the news!We've partnered with Ivendpay, which is a Binance partner.We have a partnership with Bembit, an instant payment company where users buy cryptos by paying directly from their bank account and receiving the tokens immediately in their wallet.It's been a sales success in this category.Our marketplace, PaycoinShop, is already in the final testing phase and will very soon be available to buy and sell by traditional means of payment and by our Pspay token with discounts of up to 29%.On September 14, Pspay will be listed on Melega.Finance and on September 21 on the Mintme.com exchange for trading.Soon we will have the launch burn and monthly burns to increase the value of the token even more.Users who bought in the first pre-sale have already seen an appreciation of almost 300% in just 2 days.We are working on more listings on new exchanges, focused on gradually increasing the liquidity of the Pspay/USDT and Pspay/BNB pools.We remind you that the liquidity of the pools is locked.The next steps include updating the token on Bscscan, listing on CoinMarketCap and Coingecko.We are also working on the development of the payment app that we will bring to physical stores throughout Brazil.We invite you to get to know the project that is making a splash in Brazil and soon worldwide.www.paycoin.solutionsDo you want to buy Pspay and take advantage of the fact that the token is still in its infancy? You choose!
