Bitcoin's price is not a stable current that you could easily discern the flow of at any given time. It's a little rash sometimes and there will be times when you'd think it's the end of all things bitcoin as we know it. That's why I don't really suggest solely relying on bitcoin as your retirement plan cause there's no telling where bitcoin will be ideally forty years from now. You could always go for a little diversity when you're investing for your retirement though, a major portion of it in fiat, and a sizable part of it in bitcoin. Retirement plans are one of those things where it's better to be safe than sorry. There's nothing that would beat a comfortable life, and while bitcoin could really give you that provided that you strike gold, its volatile nature is just too risky to play around with especially with the money you'd be relying on for the rest of your life.",

If you can provide the answer to that then you've already provided an answer to the question you asked, if you're planning for retirement, then you can have some of your money in bitcoin and hodl instead of putting them in banks, but i dont think there's a particular stage you may wish to retire your bitcoin except you feels ok to exchange it when needs arises and still buy the dip after and hodl, you will always make profits in doing so, your cash out plan is to hodl and sell when the market pumps and continue buying the dip, it's such an amazing way to extend your retiring fund in bitcoin.",

      "body": "Determining the exact amount of Bitcoin needed for retirement is a highly subjective question that varies from person to person. It relies on factors such as the price of Bitcoin and an individual's financial situation. For instance, taking into account the current price and my personal financial condition, I would feel content with owning 3.5 Bitcoin for my retirement. This amount would provide me with a satisfactory level of financial stability for the remainder of my life. Therefore, it truly hinges on individual needs and cannot be determined by anyone else.",

You can save or hold any amount that you can actually invest. You might one feel a certain amount is enough but with the growing inflation affecting prices of commodities, plans like this can be difficult to predict. But if you solely Sceptical about how many bitcoin you need then it should be based on how many you can hold comfortably till then and then probably invest the other retirement funds into other assets.",

In my opinion, this approach might not be the wisest choice for one's overall well-being. Diversification seems like a more prudent strategy, particularly when it comes to investments that generate a regular income and provide the freedom to manage one's time effectively.",

This is why i do agree on some points above that you should still have that job and at the same time you would really be having that accumulation of BItcoin as much as you can or even on other crypto which you do seem that it would really be having the potential to make yourself that financially free.Actually this is really that a broad topic considering that each person does have their own level of preference when it comes to money and what amount would be enough for us to see that it would be sufficient even if we dont work but honestly when it comes to sustainability then there's no doubt that it would really be wise that you should be having at least those known traditional investment like on real estates on which you could somewhat have that assurance aside from your crypto portfolio and i could say that it is really that risky on having this kind of consideration or you wouldntreally be that confident that you are on a good situation.",

      "body": "IMO, this depends on the person's financial ability, not just their wish. Most Bitcoiners will not be able to even accumulate up to 3 bitcoins before they get too old to think of retiring; some can accumulate more than that, but this all depends on their financial capabilities. It's very easy to say that you want to have up to 50, 50,000, or more Bitcoin before you retire, but the person might not even get up to 10 Bitcoin. I just think one should keep accumulating until they really feel satisfied with what they have. For setting cash-out plans, it could be for different goals, and you might not be the only one spending all the Bitcoin you have accumulated, depending on the amount you hold. For example, if one has 10 bitcoins and the person is so old that they cannot really spend all the money, it will definitely be passed on to their children.",

But if you live or planned to retire to more advance and economically stable countries like the United States or Europe it then means that you will be needing more Bitcoin than just 7 BTC to be able to sort your bills all through your retirement age.",

If you want to live in the US when you retire then 10 BTC wouldn't be enough but if you live in Türkiye 10 BTC is more than enough with right moves.Your expected life standards also affect this hypotethical number. If you are someone who lives in luxury, you should own a lot more coins. Based on the future price of Bitcoin at $1 million, 10 BTC would probably be enough for you to live and die in a high standard of living. If you live an average life, you can retire with much less coins. Of course these are all assumptions, there is no guarantee that there will be Bitcoin tomorrow, just like there is no guarantee of anything in life.",

What kind of living you are looking forward to when you retire?Just couple of questions that you need to ask yourself.

At best, you'd want to use only a percentage of it to buy Bitcoin. Buying and holding bitcoin is key but you'd have to remember that participating on the speculative side of things.- How many? Depends on individual goal.- Cashout plan is also based on individual goal.There's no one size fit all in this kind of things.",

In my opinion, you could make Bitcoin your investment but not a retirement thing since this is not a guaranteed cashout like some kind of insurance where you save money then you could just use it when you get old plus you gain some kind of interest. Bitcoin is a risky investment compared to some insurance agency stuff.For me, you should make Bitcoin something like a bet since even though Bitcoin is a great investment and most people are making trading daily as a source of income, only invest money that you could afford to lose. Also, you might end up selling your Bitcoin at an unfair price if you're going to sell it on your retirement, its better if you're going to watch the market and sell if the market skyrockets.",
