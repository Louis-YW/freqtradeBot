That's how they create demand and push price up. it's mix POS, MN and POW-you can sell the mined, and make a profit. but you don't want to sell the deposited coins, because you want to continue mining, so supply on exchange decreases",

Maybe someone remembers?Bit Free Cash, I remember watching it blow up.Never heard of that one, but it seems somewhat similar to what happened with Ravencoin once ETH went PoS.  You say a lot of people buying in to get ahead of the blow up in price when everyone started mining them and thus needed higher profitability.  Then, it crashed leaving all the people who bought in thinking the price would jump up to maintain profitability as bagholders.  A story as old as time...  Buy the rumor, sell the news.  Unfortunately, for many of these \"new\" coins, they don't have the liquidity available to survive the sell the news phase, so it turns into a rug pull.",

So many decided to scam a bunch of miners because they knew they would be desperate for any miner income and hence why the scam was so successful.I have a feeling that something similar might pop around this time. Imagine making $5/day/gpu as long as you bought a coin for $25/gpu. Many miners would probably go for that scam out of desperation.",

Based on this, we can assume that the hashrate of 4090 will be similar to or slightly higher than the RTX 3090 Ti on the memory-intensive algorithms. This means around 140MH/s on the ETChash algorithm.Because RTX 4090 has about 60% higher core count and about 100% faster core clock speeds, we can assume that the hashrate on the core intensive algorithms will be around 50%-80% higher than on the 3090 Ti. https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/nvidia-rtx-4090-specs-and-mining-hashrate?lang=enThe new generation will not make life much more difficult for miners.",
