  "content": "MuskyDoge is nearly 3 years old now. It's still going. Started out as a meme and now turned into a business. There's a few \"MuskyDoge\" themed games but decided not to limit it there. With the release of Backyard Paintball which is in beta testing on google play, soon for iOS after it's approved. MuskyDoge is also exploring e-sports with it's creation. Check out MuskyDoge.net for more information. All profits from ads and in game purchasing will go to the charts. Operating like a stock.EDIT: When this was first posted it was at 40K marketcap, rightfully so everyone said it was basically trash and will die soon. It's still very low 100K marketcap with the foot on the gas. This won't be the last time you hear about these guys.",

There's more than one game. Even an FPS game. Your missing the point of Ads bringing in money to the charts from outside sources. Not just new investors to pay old investors LOL. The competition is slowly growing. Actually interesting enough, the people playing this game don't hold any crypto but are intrigued with winning crypto to play a game. There's definitely something here. Your right with low follower, community is weak, was really good in the bullmarket at 3M marketcap. This game is pretty basic, any developer can do it. But it's far from dead!!!",

MKD Climber just launched on the app stores. The competition ends September 1st. Pepe is a meme token that cracked 1 Billion marketcap with nothing special going. These guys at 36K marketcap. I am a holder but feel you are wrong about it being dead when the team is very active. Community is weak but most projects start out with a weak community. They have more plans and keep getting better. Community primarily on telegram. t.me/muskydogearmy and twitters growing at twitter.com/muskydogecoin Not saying it's going to be the next Pepe but I predict it gets to 1M marketcap at the end of the year. It's a scrappy little project that's been alive over 2 years. Most these 'meme' tokens die in a week. Just my 2 cents. Everyone loves an underdog story.",

So I advise everyone to stay away from this coin because the ops are just trying to promote a dead project aiming to waste people's time in playing the so-called game.",

Please DYOR.Still going, would recommend checking out muskydoge.net they've been working hard during the bear market. The products aren't just limited to musky themed games. They released a paintball game and are doing e-sports. It operates like a stock with 100K marketcap (microcap) right now. E-sports keeps getting bigger. Mobile gaming is in the multi billions. Buying into this project would be like investing in a startup company with a solid future. But as I said at 40K marketcap, we can circle back to this. So 100K right now. Lets see how much fun we can have with this post. I get it, all the other projects are sketchy. This will bring money from in app purchasing, and ads. There will also be free and paid tournaments. Not sure where your from but paintball is a very competitive sport. So having tournaments with cash prizes, people are going to want to buy top of the line equipment. It's not a clear pay to win, can play and grind. So pretty happy with what's going on. Will report back with bigger news",

Â  Â  Â I'm not aware or familiar with that meme coin, I looked it up on coingecko and he didn't have \"not found\" so it's probably a dead coin and has been forgotten by time. Its competitors who are crypto assets in the market could not handle it. So it is better to choose coins that are in the list of top listed in the market, like coinmarketcap and coingecko.Â  Â  because usually all the top50 coins listed on those two platforms, we can easily choose coins that we want to hold long-term or short-term.",
