How much bankroll can you afford to start with?5% of my weekly income.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM2. With your bankroll, how much expected profit do you anticipate in a year?I am expecting losses, not profit. But I do my best nit to lose but to gain.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM3. Will you be content with your profit?

How much bankroll can you afford to start with?[I usually just start small though, maybe around $50-$100 as a start for a bankroll and do sports betting.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM2. With your bankroll, how much expected profit do you anticipate in a year?In a year, that's too long in my opinion, for me a month will do, probably a conservative 2x - 4x returns of your first bankroll might do it for me. It could be difficult to accomplished do as I usually do single bet and not parlays.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM3. Will you be content with your profit? If not, have you considered increasing your bankroll, even if you cannot afford it?That is the big question, sometimes even if you reach your desired return, I have those days that I will still continue to play and then lose some. Then regrets set-in, so I guess it could be case to case basis or at least we should take care of our emotions. Yes, if my chance my first bankroll will be swept from me, then I might do and deposit again and continue to bet on sports that I like.",

How much bankroll can you afford to start with?For long term purposes, I think I could start a maximum of $1000, but I won't be able to produce that money upfront or deposit all of that in a casino. $1000 is just my limit, if I lose all that money, I would stop gambling and wait for the next season. Quote2. With your bankroll, how much expected profit do you anticipate in a year?In a year, this is kinda long term so I needs long term answer. In figures, maybe for $1000 bankroll, I'd be okay with $5000 net profit in a year. Quote3. Will you be content with your profit? If not, have you considered increasing your bankroll, even if you cannot afford it?No one would be contented in gambling, if we are consistently winning, we would be more aggressive in betting our skills, so most likely I would increase my bankroll on the next season, so I could expect a bigger profit, that if I would still enjoy the same outcome I had in the past.",

It only applies to something like poker, otherwise you're likely to just be slowly depleting it every time you play. If you are playing poker then the recommended amount is likely 100-250x the big blind if you're only playing one table at a time. It's much larger than people might expect, but you can rapidly burn through even that amount. Most people are unlikely to have enough if they're just starting out.",

How much bankroll can you afford to start with?Not more than five percent of my monthly earnings will be a comfortable allocation for gambling. Sometimes I can increase and decrease it based on the projected monthly expenses. Quote2. With your bankroll, how much-expected profit do you anticipate in a year?I don't really project my wins for the month because gambling is an insignificant revenue source to me. If I win, that's great and when looses comes, I take it with all pleasure. I gamble more for pleasure than the returns, but this shouldn't mean that I don't like wins. Quote3. Will you be content with your profit? If not, have you considered increasing your bankroll, even if you cannot afford it?An increase in bankroll might not necessarily lead to more wins. If you are not also content with your profit, it might lead to chasing losses and gambling more than you can afford. Therefore, I am always comfortable and content with my profit. It might not be pleasing sometimes but there is nothing one can do about it because you can't compete with the house.",

How much bankroll can you afford to start with?For now, I don't have any affordability to do that. With the recent research that I've seen or let's just say quick reading from the experience of the actual bankroll investors, it's not worth it. But if you have spare money to invest there, that's much better with movement than to be stagnant and have no gains at all.Oh, going to the point where I'll be starting to invest with the bankroll. I won't start with a small one because gains with that starting capital is so much little so mostly if I can afford more than a thousand buck.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM2. With your bankroll, how much expected profit do you anticipate in a year?This varies and depending on the revenue of the casino but with that amount, I expect no less than 3%-5%. This is just a guess percentage and more likely close to reality.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM3. Will you be content with your profit? If not, have you considered increasing your bankroll, even if you cannot afford it?Yes, if that's just a spare money of mine. As I've said, that's so much better than to gain nothing by being stagnant or deposited in a bank.",

With your bankroll, how much expected profit do you anticipate in a year?I'm mostly doing it for entertainment purposes and not because I anticipate yielding an income from betting. I don't think it's supposed to be that way unless you're constantly analyzing odds, teams, performances, etc., something I'm not willing to do. If I manage to yield anywhere from $400 to $600, I'll be satisfied. As long as I'm not at a loss, I'm fine.Quote from: mirakal on December 11, 2023, 06:16:59 AM3.

That's why they can't be the same, because you can lose money in investments too, but it is going to happen once, you learn from it and choose a better investment later on, but gambling is gambling, nothing but betting on pure luck. Anyways, as a gambler, I have no expectations from gambling, no amount per se, I just gamble and if I win anything at all I will withdraw straight away, any win is a win for me, this is just one of the ways I plan to always over power gambling addiction, don't have a goal at all, just do it and see what comes up, also with only what you can afford to lose.",

I don't really target my winnings so I don't count on profits for a year, because for me enjoying the game and feeling the adrenaline rush in sports betting is fun, apart from that the important thing is that reducing expenses from gambling would be better because it wouldn't be good if I continued to pay for gambling every week, so every win I get I will roll back to play the following week.3. I am satisfied because I am entertained, depending on how each person views it, if I personally only view gambling as just entertainment, not just looking for profit, I don't think about increasing my income from gambling because I don't make money from gambling, which is different from the perspective of other people who might Their target is victory and profit, while I don't care about it because I know that using a mindset like that will not have a good impact on me in the future.",
