Still learning.If I am receiving some small bitcoin donations - 15,000 to 35,000 sats per donation, then how do I know if that donation is from a KYC exchange or a non-KYC exchange?Does the answer depend on the address of the sender? I'm still a bit confused about this. I don't want to mix up my KYC and non-KYC coins.Thanks",

I’m still curious though what is the real purpose of having to separate kyc to non-kyc donated bitcoins? If not tax evasion then what are you doing with separated bitcoins? Anyway maybe you can provide different wallets each for kyc and non-kyc donations so that you don’t have to separate each donation yourself. Just let donators donate to a specific wallet based on what wallet they use.",

I don't want to mix up my KYC and non-KYC coins.ThanksWhen the bitcoin is donated you will understand yourself if the exchange is kyc or not then you will be asked to kyc. As far as I understand both wallets you can use all wallets for donation are same capacity or don't want to mix kyc and non-kyc coins so using separate wallets for kyc and non-kyc donation can keep donation in different ways.",

If bitcoin is yours, it makes sense not to want to mix it up. You can have a bitcoin that you bought in an exchange with kyc and another bitcoin bought in another way without kyc (that because it was without kyc does not mean that you are not going to declare it later). But it is not good that someone who observes the blockchain can know all the bitcoin you have, so it is better to keep it separate. But as for the donations, as you say, he should declare them all. The fact that some come from exchanges with kyc and others from other sites without kyc is not relevant.",

Yes, I might be wrong that OP isn't doing anything illegal but my point still stands, OP doesn't want the bitcoin donations that they're getting to be taxed, I mean I too wouldn't want the government to benefit in my work when I know that it's not going to go anywhere but the pocket of officials, but still even if the cause isn't wrong or that you share the sentiments with it, the law will not, in the eyes of the law, if you help that person evade their taxes then that means you're an accomplice to the crime.",
