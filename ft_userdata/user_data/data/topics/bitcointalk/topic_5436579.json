  "content": "Get a free and cool designed Bitcoin Genesis PlateGenesis block stainless steel plate 120x120x8mm weight approx. 900gA great gift for all Bitcoin fans for the desk or mounting on the wall or put it with the other stuff in the Crypto showcase area of your home.Genesis blockA genesis block is the first block of a block chain. Modern versions of Bitcoin number it as block 0, though very early versions counted it as block 1. The genesis block is almost always hardcoded into the software of the applications that utilize its block chain. It is a special case in that it does not reference a previous block, and for Bitcoin and almost all of its derivatives, it produces an unspendable subsidy.I will announce the block number when we are full.Your forum account must be have minimum of 100 postings and more than 10 Merits.We may, at our discretion, ignore applies (including inactive posters, etc).How this will work:Choose a number between 00 - 99 (no random)After I choose a block, the last symbol of the hash will determine the winner.Shipping is free in Germany and shipping out of germany has to cover from the winner ~$20-25 0: sam001: PeakDK2: GazetaBitcoin3: FattCatt4: 5: 6: 7: krogothmanhattan8: Thiago0079: Real-Duke10: The_Crypto_Kid11: Mitchell12: Remsjack13: geophphreigh14: YodasRedRocket15: tread9316: 17: CARIBBEAN_TREASURES18: 19: 20: Timelord206721: mx12.levins22: 23: Woodie24: 25: NeuroticFish26: 27: Humble Bitcoiners28: bct_ail29: 30: 31: 32: Jambo USA33: Fortify34: examplens35: 36: buckrogers37: Dernoste38: 39: 40: 41: 42: tweetious 43: AlpenCoin44: 45: Darker4546: 47: xSlyy48: anonymousminer49: bullrun2020bro50: Helena Yu51: BitcoinPenny52: digicoinuser53: 54: BTCOVERFIATS55: Kryptowerk56: 57: 58: 59: bestcoin_5960: 61: 62: 63: bitcoiner24h64: henkcryptotank65: 66: Mauser67: 68: 69: Hookzup170: Markzellers71: 72: 73: 74: MagicByt375: minerjones76: MoparMiningLLC 77: QuakerBull78: 79: Crytocanuk80: 81: CoinageMint 82: 83: haloxon84: pmq85: 86: 87: 88: Buchi-8889: 90: 91: 92: 93: NeilLostBitCoin94: 95: 96: CoinEraser97: 98: 99: JanEmilHave a look in my other offers to save shipping cost  Stainless steel Bitcoin Recovery Seed Platehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5323755.040mm x 3mm 30g Bitcoin Coin (loadable and customizable coin)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5382457.0Bitcoin genesis block stainless steel platehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5432879.0Have fun and best regards,Willi",
