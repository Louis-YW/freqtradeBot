Pelosi Brought in Daughter, Camera Crew to US Capitol Before the Riot, Son-in-Law Was Set Up Outside to FilmQuote from: https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/10/staged-pelosi-brought-daughter-camera-crew-us-capitol-riot-son-law-set-outside-film/It was all a setup.From Ray Epps – to opening the magnetic doors from the inside – to the dozens of fed operatives in the crowd – to Ginger Gun – to firing flash bombs and gas canisters on unsuspecting grandmas and seniors – to the mass arrests of hundreds of innocent Trump supporters who were waved into the US Capitol.Now we have the proof that it was all a setup and the entire thing was filmed by a pre-staged camera crew.On Thursday CNN released never-before-seen footage of Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell inside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 — the two people who refused to call in the National Guard prior to that day and during the rioting.@CNN·FollowWhat do you know about what lawmakers were doing during the January 6th Capitol attack?

Now that these investigations are started, I wonder how long it will take for the American public to understand that Pelosi and loads of Dem leaders are against the USA.Coincidence? CNN Shows Footage of Provocateur Who Was Filmed by Nancy Pelosi's DaughterQuote from: https://needtoknow.news/2022/10/coincidence-cnn-shows-footage-of-provocateur-who-was-filmed-by-nancy-pelosis-daughter/Epps has long been suspected of being an FBI operative, informant, provocateur, or asset after he faced no repercussions despite being filmed repeatedly encouraging others to engage in criminal activity. People in the crowd called him out and chanted \"Fed\". Epps has not been arrested or charged for his involvement that day and the FBI has refused to answer whether he works for them. There are still 14,000 hours of footage from January 6 that the Department of Justice won't allow the American people to see, presumably because it would damage its ability to prosecute J6 political prisoners in court.Why was Pelosi was so prepared for the chaos of this day? She, along with Mayor Bowser, rejected Trump's request for 10,000 National Guard troops.A familiar face appeared in a CNN propaganda piece aired Thursday that followed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during the January 6 protest.In footage shot by Pelosi daughter Alexandra Pelosi for an HBO documentary, excerpts of which were aired on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 Thursday, provocateur Ray Epps is prominently featured waving a Trump flag and talking on a phone atop a scaffold....",

The point isn't the march or who called it. Rather, the points are who turned aspects of the march ugly, and who made up those ugly parts.Loads of people have been held in government jails for over a year without any proof that they did wrong or were part of the ugliness. This includes Stewart Rhodes, leader of Oathkeepers, who was actually supporting and helping Capitol police during the riots. The obvious answer is that there are a whole bunch of 'ugly' people right in government. And presently, Trump isn't one of them.",

In our entire 233 year history operating under the US Constitution, this mono-partisan makeup and appointment has never happened.No serious lover of law, in either its making or adjudication, would dream up a process of getting to objective facts without an adversarial process in the calling and questioning of documents and witnesses. However, that's exactly what Pelosi, Chairman Bennie Thompson, and Liz Cheney (who has been expelled by voters) have schemed up at great detriment to the republic.Now, the entire premise of this specially-empowered committee was to \"investigate the facts, circumstances, and causes relating to the domestic terrorist attack on the Capitol\" and draft legislative recommendations to prevent a future collpase in security....",
