He's nothing better than a thief. One day the pirates will come hunting the same people who think they're beneficiaries of the evil act. Are you saying in regards to Robinhood methods, where the stolen money would be used to help the poor? You need to know that stolen money doesn't help the economy of any locality. Rather it diminishes the economy. How do you expect a local area depending on thieves to survive. That locality will face abject poverty. Because thieves don't help the society. They only take away money meant to be circulating in society and waste it on a lavish lifestyle. What the pirates do, ain't good for the society, despite the fact the goods aren't headed to their nation or country. The owners of the hijacked goods, families of the kidnapped will suffer and cry for their loss, while some are happy believing it's a great service to their society. First, they won't be able to manage the stolen goods and money, hence it won't circulate properly. Second, the price of things in that locality will skyrocket, because vendors believe they're dealing with thieves, and they won't bother buying things at any price. Generally, every human in that society will suffer huge losses for supporting stealing. Then taking it on a more realistic aspect, the way you want to see it, is it possible for money derived through kidnapping and stolen treasures to feed millions of people in a society? remember the pirates will take their share of the money, and hoard huge amounts, for weapons and armories. If that locality doesn't produce weapons, the utility of the pirates, how is the economy going to be helped? How many times will those Pirates patronize the food market, compared to the bullets and weapon sellers? It makes no sense, however, that Navy officials don't put more effort in endeavor to reduce such problems, as it's bitter to hear that so many businesses crumble due to their ship being hijacked.",

Some governments resort to negotiating with them because the most they may ask for is 10 million dollars, while Insurance costs and tracking the movement of tankers can cost companies trillions of dollars. Piracy is sometimes linked to politics, as is happening now on the right, where some groups there are closing the Bab al-Mandab Strait.",

I think pirates will not take it easy if their neighbor loses his job and, for example, hijacks a relative of a pirate and surrenders her organs explaining \"I am a surgeon, I am out of work, don't worry, everything is fine\". All terrorism and criminal violence must be destroyed. The problem is that \"you can't play by gentleman's rules with criminals\", they don't understand the words law, right, value of human life. They are the cancer of our world. The only cure is annihilation. PS Yemen and Russia should be added to the list - countries purposefully engaged in maritime terrorism against civilian ships.",

Saying the impact of ships on the sea led you to be a pirates is just an excuse to do it. Saying lack of job opportunities is just an excuse. So if everybody who doesn't have a job opportunity in the region decides to go into piracy, there would be no jobs for some pirates. There should be a proper system and proper security in the seas of the affected region. The problem with issues like this is that governments are so nonchalant about these issues. And most times security agents and governments are part of these pirates one way or the other. Either by giving information or protection. Things like this derail an economy. Shipping companies might decide to stop shipping to that region or make their services very expensive because of the heavy security they have to pay for and the risk involved. This will in turn make the prices of goods very extension the region and gradually, many businesses would begin to go out of business. Foreign companies that do not feel safe and can't afford to protect their staff may leave and all these hurt the economy.",

Do you think I am correct here?Proceeds from crime cannot be considered a means of wealth distribution because it will cause more destruction to the economy than growth. An increase in criminal activities will discourage investors from coming to the country which will create unemployment. These criminals don't really spend on items that contribute to economic development, they spend money mostly on arms and ammunition, hard drugs and prostitution. Most of these pirates are security threats to the local community they live. They end up my terrorising the local community until the people end up in poverty and death. There is nothing economically good about criminal activities.",

Even people in these places might not want piracy to end because of the indirect benefits on their local economy. Do you think I am correct here?If we look at history in 1715 piracy at sea became active again because of peace between England and Spain, both of whom created pirates so that it was not much different from what Somali pirates do today because sea access had to be via the Indian Ocean. Ship routes Traders from England, Spain and France are among those who definitely feel this way every time they make a shipment. There was nothing that could be avoided but to arm merchant ships and military escorts It costs more but saves a much larger investment.Piracy carried out by Somali pirates was born to show resistance due to the economy there not being able to move well.  So looking for ways to speed up the economy by criminal means. If you want to stop piracy the only way is for every country involved in trade  transactions in these waters to unite and use their respective military strengths to go to sea to provide a warning and offer to the Somalia pirates as the  British government did in 1718, offering acquittals for crimes, protection and cooperation to develop the economy. In essence the Somalia pirate camp split into two like Woodes Rogers offer to the Nassau Republican pirates, Benjamin Hornigold, Edward Teach, Charles Vane and Anne Bonny.",

The Zionist regime is internationally recognized as an apartheid regime and as the aggressors that has invaded Palestine has to be punished same as Russia if not worse. But because the so called international organizations such as United Nations are rigged and actually American organizations, they can not act according to international laws.

The countries even mentioned are more poor than many countries in their region and with the absence of good jobs that pay well, we have had to see the interest rates rise tremendously. Criminality cannot be a better way to improve the economy of any country and that's why more military border patrols are being developed including using drone tech for surveillance in these regions. As sailors are learning to arm themselves, they also try to avoid these routes that the pirates can attack from and unless the consignment they carry is too valuable, then the need for escorts at almost every nearby ports is also one way to protect and reduce the effort of sea piracy.",

Piracy became prevalent for a time, especially off the coast of Somalia, but it is now a lot more in check and infrequent because there are international naval patrols in the area. It was almost an inevitable mix, as fishermen with lots of boats and weaponry but living in a very poor country with few options to sustain themselves, have these large targets going past every day which had no protection at a certain point in time. After a crackdown and improved defenses, things became a lot harder for them and many gave up on this option.",

Ultimately, piracy is having a very bad impact because people don't want to invest in a region where it's happening, don't want to risk going on a holiday there etc. Investing in those environments is rare, because they stay far from the main town of any state. Although their natural ways of fishing may be affected, piracy isn't good for the economy. Ships are expected to be equipped with few naval officers to guide goods from pirates. Fighting the hijackers is better than paying those huge ransom. Pirates are also heavily equipped and fight well at sea, but when intercepted by the military Navy, the hijacking won't be simpler for them. Thereby reducing the rate of kidnapping and stealing of people's properties. Whatever it is they're fighting for, the innocent businessmen shouldn't suffer for it. Lots of money goes into those imported goods, meant to be marketed in the local market. Pirates spoil the market for many and hike the price of commodities due to scarcity. Imagine a country where a cargo of car tires gets intercepted by pirates and hijacked, there'll be a limited supply of car spare tires in the region where it's meant to be delivered. So, ship crews should figure out a way of preventing pirates from evading their ships. There are multiple precautionary methods for preventing pirates from hijacking a ship. Coupled with the security, most ships will be able to bypass the pirates. When ships don't travel too close to the shores like you suggested, what exactly would it prevent? because these pirates move with boats and are better swimmers. That part of the sea is mainly their territory and they grew up there. Hence, shooting will be easier for them, increasing crime. So, they'll have fewer people visiting such environments, for safety reasons. Due to such acts the government is favorable to the locality, and the poverty will increase, causing people to migrate to a greener pasture. Many kids around such vicinity, will grow up looking to join pirates since it's part of their livelihood. Only a few of them would cherish formal education.",
