Genesis mining offers mining contracts for various cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins, ethereum, litecoin , and more. You can choose between different mining plans with varying hash rates and durations.https://www.genesis-mining.com/while Hashflare is another cloudmining platform also offers mining contracts for various cryptocurrencies including also bitcoin, ethereum and i think zcash is included. you can also purchase hashpower contracts for fixed duration and mine cryptocurrencies without having purchse and maintain their own mining hardware.https://hashflare.io/lastly, Nicehash is a marketplace that connects buyers and sellers of hashing power. You can rent out their own mining hardware or purchase hashpower from other user to mine cryptocurrencies. Nicehash also supports a wide range of cryptocurrencies and algorithms, and you can choose between different mining contracts with varying hash rates and durations.https://www.nicehash.com/Reminder from a friend that while these platforms are popular and reputable, cloud mining can be a risky venture and there is no guarantee of profits. ; )",

It is just a prediction based on previous historical data if their claim is to be trusted[1]. Basically just a number for promotional material. Don't use them to predict your earnings. Not really surprising in my opinion. If they claim it is a guaranteed reward I'd be worried they're running a ponzi instead.That being said, I'd advise OP to think twice before you use your coins and lock them on a third-party platform where you can't even see their daily operation. Who knows, maybe they are not mining and are using your funds to do insider trading or something similar. Even if they do mine, they'll always earn the bigger share while you risk a lot of your coins.[1] https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-use-binance-cloud-mining-45849cb6f3a84663b2ffbc5ca3dca716",

Because the main reason why this is less profitable is the electricity bill to run the miners, unless the cloud mining is Ponzi like so many cloud mining companies in 2017/2018.Some of them end up scamming people while some announced that they are ready to close down the business because it's not profitable anymore. If a company is running a cloud mining service today, it's either they are scammer who doesn't have any mining equipment or they have wind or solar energy with incredible lithium backup to run the whole setup. Be careful, there is a 95% chance that every cloud mining is a scam, they never have any asic miners or any mining farm.",

Mining in general has slowed down, in terms of profit, not sure what applies to cloud mining and its options, as it's generally frowned upon.Binance recently launched a cloud mining service and looks quite decent, it doesn't guarantee you specific returns while it warns you about any potential threats, but provides you with an estimate of your profit. I'd try it with a small amount of money if I were you, use $100-$200 and see how it works out.",

I am not sure if the genuine one is good or not, but the availability is very slim. Because they can only provide a few. So in this competition, it is really hard to find one. Genuine ones are out of reach, and those which are available are possible scam. Better to stay away from them as they will only harm your pocket and scam you. Just a suggestion. Do Your Own Research. Also, don't deposit in any online mining services. If they have a tax and fee on the mining asset, only then choose it. Because if they can provide you free money making process, then they can take the fee from it and give you what they are willing to give you. They will never as you to deposit or anything. Be safe and stay away from scam like this. Invest your time in other things. You will earn more than these cloud mining.",

That's correct, I tried a couple of cloud mining sites a few years ago, but all of them turned out to be scams within a few months. Since then, I have never invested even a single 1$ in any cloud mining site. For instance, many members here might recall HashOcean, which was one of the famous cloud mining sites that paid in BTC. It was later revealed to be a Ponzi scheme and shut down in the summer of 2016, scamming almost 1 million members. I believe they ran away with over 10 million dollars' worth of Bitcoin by that time.While a few cloud mining sites might be safe, I wouldn't expect to make significant profits from them, so I haven't even tried that no more and I'm not even thinking about it.",
