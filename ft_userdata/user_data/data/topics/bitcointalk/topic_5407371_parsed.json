He still struggles fighting with Arreola while he wasn't that fat anymore. He always have the excuse whenever he lose. A reason that he may win this match is because Kingkong is already old and fat. This is like a battle of big guts actually but yes Ruiz still have the faster hands between them.",

      "body": "I think this will be an exciting match-up for both Andy Ruiz and Luiz Ortiz has a good record both have more than 30 wins and both have only 2 losses, this is the 1st time these two would fight, to simply put it Andy Ruiz for his size has the speed in those punches and has accuracy as well that would like to be his advantage but for me, Luiz Ortiz got the power, he can simply put out Ruiz with just a good combination this could be very difficult to predict fight in my opinion Andy Ruiz's great fight in my opinion was his win against Anthony Joshua back on Jun 1, 2019, it was a very great fight from Ruiz Anthony Joshua has the height and reach advantage but Andy Ruiz is pushing Joshua away, and I think that is very legitimate, that Andy Ruiz surely has the upper hand, on their rematch that could be a win for Ruiz but yeah he underestimated Joshua in their rematch, Luiz Ortiz's great fight was with Charles Martin king kong was knockdown by Martin in the 1st round and so Charles Martin thought he can get the upper hand but Luiz Ortiz was having the advantage over rounds 4 to 6 but in Round 4 Ortiz was dropped down again but was smiling again it's like he is saying OK good job while on round 6 Ortiz got a good shot on Martin he was wobbled on the 2nd knockdown of the round 6, then the referee stops the fight For me based on their performance, I think I like Andy Ruiz's technique with that fast pace shots I think he can get a clean hit on Luiz Ortiz,",

Of course, as we all know, with heavyweights and equal boxers like Ruiz and Ortiz, anything can happen. But in my opinion, Ortiz has a better chance. I'm not making a decision yet and will read the experts opinions first, but today I'm more willing to bet on Ortiz.",

He looks really fit for the fight following a strict diet. I don't now how else he could be more completely focused than that. He also said in his interview that he's been watching a lot of King Kong fights. We already know his hand speed and the power he has in his punches but yet to see his movement with a much lighter body. I'll take him over Luis.",

But then again, Ruiz is also a hard hitter, we've seen what he has done to AJ on their first fight.Yeah, most likely under 10.5 round for this fight. As both will try to make a slugfest early, contest as to who will hit the homerun first. So I also see Ruiz winning by stoppage maybe in the mid to round 10.",

Although I will agree that he won his two last fights after he was KO by Wilder in 2019, but those two fighters also hit him hard. Against Charles Martin he was twice, rounds 1 and 4. Imagine what will a power puncher like Ruiz will do to him if he hits him solid in the chin with all the force, it will be quick KO win for Ruiz.",

IMO, Ortiz is well aware of his age before opting for this fight, he knows what is at stake and knows very well that his age may be considered as a weakness. He will be working hard to prove those who think he has no chance in this fight wrong. He has a good shot at winning against Ruiz.
