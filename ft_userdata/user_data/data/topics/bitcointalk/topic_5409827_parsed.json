They form governments and police the world for their own profit.If they were strong enough to have real control, they would send in government killers to kill off the homeless who litter the streets with themselves and their feces. Then they would execute the old people who are living off society via Social Security.There are two reasons shy they would do this, and why they are pushing as hard as they can to get themselves into this position. Guess what the reasons are.",
