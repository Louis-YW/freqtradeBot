  "content": "I believe everyone into cryptocurrency is familiar with the term Bull Run and when we hear the word all that comes to our minds is making profit and since the market is moving positively during the bull market some of us tend to be blindfolded with making gains hence acting carelessly but with the appropriate knowledge i think there is nothing to worry about. Scammers anticipate the next bull market and are ready for it in order to con people for profit, just as we anticipate as well but the only difference is that they make profits illegally. During the bull run, there is a significant amount of profit to be made in this industry, but if you are completely new, it's not as simple as you might think. Scammers would want to take advantage of all the money invested during this time and steal it for themselves. Also many newcomers would also want to join the cryptocurrency market during this time after hearing about how people are making money, even though they have no prior knowledge about it. Therefore, at this time  we should expect an increase in fraudulent activities and different scamming strategies when the bull run arrives so i urge everyone to be cautious during this time and not be blinded by making profit and invest with due diligence. My advice for beginners is to invest in Bitcoin rather than taking a risk to invest in alts. However, i am sure they will have their eyes fixed on alts and new projects because of the profit involved. Before investing in new projects or any kind of alt they should carryout proper research so they don’t invest in scam projects. This post serves both as a helpful reminder for others who may not be as experienced as me, as well as an opportunity to raise awareness on what the cryptocurrency market will look like during a bull run. This is the time of profits but also it is the time we need to make use of our head to survive the industry. Whenever you invest, you should invest sensibly and always DYOR.",

      "body": "You try bringing up advice like this for people to know, not only for beginners but also for others. This can serve as a reminder to people, especially those who have never witnessed bull run before, as we all know that by that time scammers will always be on alert for any careless move by any investor; they will find a way to scam them. Therefore, it’s very important for us to know what to do and how we will secure our funds by then to avoid being scammed.Quote from: Abbatty on November 04, 2023, 03:53:20 PMMy advice for beginners is to invest in Bitcoin rather than taking a risk to invest in alts.

Before investing in new projects or any kind of alt they should carryout proper research so they don’t invest in scam projects. Bitcoin is the safest coin we can invest in. We always advise people to invest in bitcoin, not only because it is the most reliable coin but also because of its security and other things that are needed. We are also supposed to understand that we need to invest and have peace of mind, which I believe we can get from bitcoin investment, unlike altcoins, where we will be scared of getting scammed or losing our funds due to the market or other related problems that always come up with altcoins.",

The best idea for any newbie out there should be to stay away from alt coins and invest only in Bitcoin. Yes Bitcoin with a BTC symbol. Don't be deceived by any one who claims to have a project that is better than Bitcoin as they only want to make profits of you. True we are marching gradually into the bull season and so many new project will tend to be on the rise so as a newbie you should do your research and not just invest in any crypto but Bitcoin only. It's 100% garanteed to be the safest and smartest investment during this period.",

Bitcoin's been around for a while now and lots of folks use it, so it's definitely a safer way to invest than newer coins.  Tons of scams out there trying to take advantage of crypto newbies.  Best thing is do your homework if youre thinking about jumping into some new coin.  How long's it been around? Who's behind it? Get on Reddit and BitcoinTalk and see what people are saying.  It's all about trying find that sweet spot between risk and reward. Bitcoins maybe not as sexy but less likely you'll lose your shirt.  Anyway, just gotta be smart if you're getting into this stuff especially if you're new.  Easy to get blinded by promises of 100x returns.",

Before investing in new projects or any kind of alt they should carryout proper research so they don’t invest in scam projects. Investing in alt can as well be attributed to gambling where you don’t know the outcome of a game placed which mostly end up to be wrong and basically leads to loss of money. Indeed in the upcoming bull run, new projects will be coming through and many of them will be to scam people off their money. This projects wont just be like the normal ones we use to know but rather they will come with a lot of juicy offers that even those that are not newbie will be attracted to. Beware that a scam project is very enticing to the eye but if you take your eyes off it, you’ll benefit very well from the investment you must have made in bitcoin before the time of bull run. It does not matter the quantity of bitcoin you have accumulated overtime, you’ll profit from it at the time of bull run. If you’re so sure of profiting, then why invest in other projects that you’re not so sure of them increasing overtime as bitcoin does after every halving has passed.Quote from: Abbatty on November 04, 2023, 03:53:20 PMThis post serves both as a helpful reminder for others who may not be as experienced as me, as well as an opportunity to raise awareness on what the cryptocurrency market will look like during a bull run. This is the time of profits but also it is the time we need to make use of our head to survive the industry. Whenever you invest, you should invest sensibly and always DYOR. Both beginners and experts are always advised to often go for research on their own, not for anything but for the safety of their money they’re putting into this market and which scammers use as hub to rob off their victims. The scams in bitcoin are always known and can be mostly avoided if you follow the due process of keeping your wallet safe. Most of the scams happening in cryptocurrency are mostly attributed to alt coins which they always find a mean to infiltrate your wallet and get away with your savings. You’ve brought up a good topic and an enlightening one for all to know as the bitcoin bull run approaches day by day.",

Before investing in new projects or any kind of alt they should carryout proper research so they don’t invest in scam projects.  Investing in altcoins is also a great idea, but I will emphasise and also encourage them to invest in bitcoin because when you focus on investing in altcoins, you will end up putting your funds down for a scammer, which might even affect you even more than you think because there is some mentality that we all have, though some call it greediness, but I believe it is just a mentality because almost all are ready to give out some of our private information in order to achieve a huge amount of profit, which has made many fall into the hands of scammers. If we can reduce our expectations, I think we should invest in bitcoin and some sure and trusted altcoins.",

Scamming happens any time and anywhere so learn to be more cautious as much as possible to avoid regretting and blaming other people for your unexpected losses.However, seeing this post is also a good reminder not to be blinded by these too good to be true projects most especially that we all think that bull run is only about profits, but in reality this most awaited bull run can also make us lose instantly most especially if we chose to trust altcoins more than bitcoin. Seeing altcoins are cheaper than bitcoin, so its not surprising that people will be tempted to buy more altcoins than risk their money in an expensive bitcoin.",

There are many scammers even in Bitcoin using avenues like like Ponzi, faucet, airdrops, giveaways, Bitcoin telegram (social media) groups",

Investing blindly is just like we are feeding these scammers.

Ordinarily as a newbie your mind should not be fixated at just making investment and wanting to get profit almost immediately, it does not work that way. newbies should always be ready to learn and get knowledge first before thinking about investment, there are so many altcoin that have potentials that you can invest too, but that shouldn't be the goal as a newbie, you can learn now and gain later. As for the bull run, like you rightly said scammers will be scavenging for who they will defraud. that is why I always emphasize people to always learn on their own so nobody can come and start telling them stories. Because if you understand the market and what your doing as an investor or a trader, no spin doctor will try to convince you on what you already know.",

Even if they do their own diligence to research, that will never guarantee that they will be instantly free from scams. Scams are part in any investment, as losing is sometimes inevitable as well. The best remedy to fight scams is to gain experience and invest with caution. And definitely focus on bitcoin. There's no safest investment here than to stick with bitcoin and hold it for long term until you find the perfect time to sell and make decent profits. Altcoins are somehow good but investing in altcoins takes a lot of research and patience for you not to end up with scam projects that offer highly promising profits.",

The bull run period is more like the market day where everyone would be present at the market (buyers, sellers, investors) as well as thiefs (scammers) so everyone wouldn’t want to miss out thats why the number of scammers are usually high during this period. Quote from: Abbatty on November 04, 2023, 03:53:20 PMTherefore, at this time  we should expect an increase in fraudulent activities and different scamming strategies when the bull run arrives so i urge everyone to be cautious during this time and not be blinded by making profit and invest with due diligence. Scammers with old techniques will be present and also the ones with new innovatives will be present increasing the number of threats to investors. We just have to be very cautious and careful even when it is not the time of bull market because there are scammers everywhere patiently waiting for the right moment to strike and steal our assets when there is a mistake. Our security is much more important than the profit we are so eager to make because there won’t be anything left for and both your profit and capital will gone. Investing in alts is far more risky than investing in bitcoin even though they have a high potential to generate profits, we shouldn’t be blinded by these profits and risk losing everything.
