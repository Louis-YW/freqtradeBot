Those who sold at 24–25k are already to be considered regretting their action right now.But why sell to a company when you can sell individually or to an exchange? Why does Blackrock not go into an exchange to buy instead of buying privately from individuals? Was there some kind of discount or something?",

There could be some circumstances that they're facing and that's their very option which is to sell.

Regardless of where you sell it, it goes to the market and these are the takers which is BlackRock is one of them.",

They are not tradersBlackrock will be custodians of the BTC in an ETF. They make money through administration fees, which will range from 0.03% - 2%, depending on the product.They are not selling BTC to us. This is not how they make money.For example, take a look here, SP500 etf:Quotehttps://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239726/ishares-core-sp-500-etfFees as stated in the prospectusExpense Ratio: 0.03%",

But that does not rule out that some of the top managers at the company or their employees took this opportunity to increase their bitcoin investment. Because after all, the average employee at BlackRock is an individual interested in a wide variety of investments, and it's possible that most of them invest in Bitcoin.",

Now, you are regret to sold it to big company which will be resold back to you with high price in the next years.It's normal to sell, depending on the situation and the person's decision, but the act of selling wrongly occurs when the person decides to sell because of panic or the pressure of price volatility. In a normal sense, a Bitcoin investor is only supposed to buy Bitcoin if they are fully convinced that they can hold it for a very long time until they make some profit, instead of selling when the market is down, which can cause them to lose some funds from their original asset. But well, everyone has their own decisions, and the truth is that, after a bull market, comes a bear market too. So anyone who doesn't buy now should wait for another bear market and hope that the price can get low like the previous best season.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

I will fight that corporate, I won't sell my btc for them. never!!That's good if you don't want to sell your Bitcoin now and will not sell it to the company's traders. But when the price goes up high and you want to sell it, you won't know who bought your Bitcoin, especially if you sell your Bitcoin on an exchange.And the company's traders can buy Bitcoin from other people, especially those who are panicked to see the price drop, which happens often. I suggest you don't need to think about that because you better think about how to accumulate more Bitcoins now.Collecting a lot of Bitcoin will be an advantage for you because you can get big profits next year or when the price of Bitcoin goes up. So it's better to just think about that than to think about the company's traders or negative news about Bitcoin.",

The point of an ETF is to be balanced for the issuer. Such structures operate in a risk-neutral way: money in from the customers, money out to buy Bitcoin. There is no need to front-run the customers trying to profit from directionality.",
