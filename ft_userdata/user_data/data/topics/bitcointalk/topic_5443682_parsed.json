      "body": "That raises the pros and cons.  Because cartoon NFTs that are generated by AI do allow content creators to create unlimited possibilities regarding their works of art.  AI assistance greatly helps NFT artists to find and define fresh ideas and makes it easier to create many digital works.  But the existence of AI will also make the value of the NFT decrease because almost anyone can make similar cartoons using the help of AI.  I think these positive and negative things should be well thought out.  But if asked for my opinion, I choose to support this ongoing trend.",

Thus, NFTs popularity were already gone and why is it that there are still some people are into it? Maybe there's still the little market that it has got.Quote from: rahulzx on March 06, 2023, 08:42:18 AMDo you participate any of these projects which backed by reputed organizations?Nope. So this means that these organizations that you prolly seen have been generating AI images and making it as NFTs? is that right?CMIIW.",

      "body": "Well, I just hope the person who generates it knows what they're doing. At least, they'd be producing good-looking NFTs now, compared to the monkey age we had back then. Though ig it'd honestly just look better, I don't think anything can top what some of the stable diffusion results that I've seen people make, and they do it with a big passion, I reckon more than these projects that are just riding in the hype. Even with the help of AI, if they can't make anything unique at all that could possibly last, I don't think they're going to come back up.",

Do you participate any of these projects which backed by reputed organizations?Lol! No! Never! NFTs are anyways useless! But when it is generated by AI, that literally means no effort has gone into creating that particular piece of shit. No human effort at all which makes it a bad investment already. Regardless of the backing, that's useless and AI can generate the same image once again. So there's no guarantee about it's uniqueness as well. So I would not invest in such NFTs ever.",

So holding an NFT for any of these are not valueable for me because everyone will able to have their own.I don't think any reputed organizations will have these kind of business but it depends or the market needs.",

Do you participate any of these projects which backed by reputed organizations?Yes. I participated in a few BNB chain projects including lifeform and Second Live projects. In both cases, we have to create an avatar.  I think they are targeting web 3.0 and the metaverses. So there will be a lot of use cases including like create to earn and stake-to-earn scenarios. If you minted an avatar, then you can participate to live quizzes and AMA sessions.",

What ever it is it doesn't sound like i would join into something like that. I follow NFTs and haven't seen this trend, or haven't seen that in a way that ai art would interest anyone as it takes zero effort. Cartoon avatars for sure there's some demand for those i mean starting from BAYC, but ai generated is garbage.",

Even AI generated NFT that is supposed to be valueless since quite literally everyone could just generate one could be used for NFT kinda speaks volume that NFT itself is actually just a trend that's like meme coin which might be a good thing for some that speculate even though certainly it might be waste of time and money.",

Even though if those NFT are issued by a reputed organization and then it doesn't mean those NFT will be priced so high like some garbage NFT that are priced at tens ethereum. NFT was pretty much the same like token as it can be easily issued anytime to be sold to the public by create a minting campaign. The users can paid money to mint it. I have ever participated a few times but all of my NFTs worthless. It has not value and token is far better compared with it. I just say the truth",
