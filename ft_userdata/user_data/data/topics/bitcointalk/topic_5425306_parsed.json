      "body": "The best money advice I received when I was younger and just starting out was \"spend less than you earn\". I took it to heart and have lived it ever since. It is easy advice to remember, but harder to put into practice. First of all, start by making a budget. Break down your income into categories to see where everything is going. Make sure to set aside some money for savings, and put that money in a separate account. Your choices will always be better if you plan ahead rather than simply reacting to every situation that comes your way.",

So now is a good time to offer your two cents worth of financial advice.Ty question-  Based on your cumulative life experiences, can you share your best money advice with us?I'd go first -  Stay out of debt as much as you can. Talking about financial advice is certainly quite difficult. Because definition questions are sufficient to meet personal needs and can manage them well, they cannot be categorized in the same container. So depending on who takes care of it, in my family, of course, I leave everything to my wife. So far he is the only good financial advisor and knows my needs.Furthermore, if I may share according to experience, of course the most important thing is the fulfillment of basic needs (no more and no less, so \"enough\"). For example, we can stockpile food for a whole week (food, non-perishable drinks, coffee, and cigarettes). like it or not, it should be enough in a week and it is proven that I am satisfied with the management. Second, saving, whether it's cash savings in an account and of course in Bitcoin once every 2 weeks (my wife has allocated it every month, instead she prefers to save in Bitcoin she says in Bitcoin she can control and monitor her movements at any time).Keep in mind that this is my experience, so far everything is working fine, and effectively and no issues at all. But back to each other's needs, and how simple it is for you to live your daily life. The point is not to be rah-rah, there is no need to show who we are in front of other people because the most important thing is to be prosperous according to the portion, reduce the vacation schedule at least once a month, and of course be financially stable (at least have a basic salary).",

Your advice is good but I will probably be a little bit more specific, I would probably say stay away from bad debt completely and use good debt sporadically, but what is good debt and bad debt? Bad debt is simply debt you get for useless consumption, like buying a TV on credit or similar as with the interests you will pay that TV two or three times over, good debt is for example getting a mortgage to buy a house as very few people have the money needed to buy a house with cash and it is something you can leave to your loved ones once you pass away.",

      "body": "My experience with money is If you want to grow your money then don't leave it in the banks. Invest your money and make it work for you this is the best way of becoming rich, you can make money round the clock while you are sleeping only if you do the right kind of investment and allow people to manage it. This is about growing your money and it requires you not to spend money unnecessarily. Doing extravagant expenditure is not a good money management skill. Back sometime ago some people I knew felt that when you spend money that it will increase more but this is just faith and faith without work is failure. So I believe in working hard and diversifying your source of income. You need to build wealth channels so that you don't go back to dark days of financial lack, this is important.",

Another big and major advice is that you should not act like you have when you do not have, that is, don't act rich when you are broke. You should not be ashamed to say you cannot afford something out of embarrassment. Another major reason why you should not act rich when you are broke, is so that people that intend to help you, will not look at you like you do not need help because of your act, when you truly do. I have met persons that their situation needs helping, but they are still too proud or not true enough to themselves to act sincerely, instead they keep telling lies and acting okay, truth is, nobody will force help on you, before someone can help you, you have to help yourself by accepting that you need help.",
