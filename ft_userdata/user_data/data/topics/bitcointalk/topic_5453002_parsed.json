Today they are issuing a certificate to people the participated on a blockchain program while they still ban us from associating our details with bitcoin or cryptocurrency. Does this looks normal if I am to ask because no reasonable government will restricts her citizens from bitcoin and yet issuing a certificate to is being used to power bitcoin.",

The ministry will have paid for the scholarship and that is \"importanter\". I don't know if anybody has a connect in the new Aso Rock regime. I can write the proposal. This scheme must not end just like that.",

Nigerian government is using youths empowerment programmes to deceive us and person like me e no go fall for dem. How someone go learn blockchain that is not working in the country. The workability of that domain is not clear yet. Lookat what they said about the blockchain, Domineum Blockchain. Why Nigerian government is dozin cryptocurrency blockchain and going for something dat is not relevant. Well we go see how dem go do am. And e fit be sae na from there dem wan take enter cryptocurrency blockchain.",
