Ain't the admin of this coin, I just like how the project presents itself. Sorry to see some pessimistic people in the crypto world. I'm not an expert in this field so I won't say anything else about this coin. I just hope it gets pumped cause I have a lot to sell and I wanna cash out as any human being. Have a great day!",

How can you have a lot to sell when this project has just started ?BTW If crypto is for you about pumping and selling then you are just human trash (yeah.. like many others).And I am not pessimistic ... I'm realistic. This project is utter shit (its basiclly clone of raptoreum).Raptoreum at some point gained a bit of attention and its price went up for a moment ...and since that happend we have constant attemtps to make that again with another clone of ratporeum (but of course it always fail).",
