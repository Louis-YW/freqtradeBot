  "content": "Tesla billionaire Elon Musk has issued a $35 trillion US 'bankruptcy' warning - predicted to trigger a bitcoin price boom.Bitcoin fell to around $60,000 per bitcoin, erasing much of the gains it made after the China bombshell.Now, after Elon Musk revealed details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayeb Buquel, the Tesla billionaire has warned of bankruptcy for the US after US debt jumped $204 billion in one day.\"The federal debt exploded on Day 1 of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to a new record of $35.669 trillion, but it got worse: The Treasury also had to reduce its cash balance by $72 billion — more than $275 billion in red for just one day,\" EJ Antony, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted.Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president, Naib Bukele, who made history when El Salvador accepted bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, Bukele predicted that the U.S.'s days could be numbered.here is the full news: https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/03/tesla-billionaire-elon-musk-issues-35-trillion-us-bankruptcy-warning-predicted-to-trigger-a-bitcoin-price-boom/",

      "body": "There’s something missing in the thread title — without it, it can be misleading. You need to add the word \"Warning.\"At first, I thought it was about Tesla going bankrupt, but it turns out the title refers to the US economy facing potential bankruptcy due to massive debt. If this happens, it would hurt the US economy, but it could actually be good news for Bitcoin, as people might use it as a hedge to protect their money from inflation. So, the story is that Elon is giving a tip to the president of El Salvador to invest more in Bitcoin, as its value would likely skyrocket if this scenario plays out.",

      "body": "The huge domestic debt of the USA is, of course, a big problem. However, can we say that the USA is threatened with bankruptcy in the near future? In my opinion, this is not so... The financial and economic situation of the USA is far from ideal, but the paradox is that in other countries the situation is much worse. There is a famous joke about two tourists who met a tiger in the jungle. One of them suggested that the other save himself from the tiger by running away. The other noticed that the man runs slower than the tiger, so there is no chance of salvation. However, the first tourist told him - yes, you have no chance, but I am young and fast, and I have a chance to save myself. After all, I do not need to run faster than the tiger. I need to run faster than you. Because when the tiger catches up with you, it will definitely stop to satisfy its hunger. The USA does not need to have an ideal economy either. The main thing for the USA is not to be worse than other countries. In addition, part of the US domestic debt is debt to American companies.  And most importantly, all American debt is denominated in US dollars, which virtually eliminates the possibility of bankruptcy.",

Personally I don't think bitcoin will explode if the US defaults and I don't think they will default either even though I don't like the US.It is a valid warning because America's debt has kept growing and interest payments have grown to over $1 trillion.  But I suspect that there is a political reason for Elon Musk's alarm. He has openly supported Donald Trump for the US presidency, this might be a plan to give Democrats a bad name. But the US debt has always been increasing even when Trump was president. Trump has openly acknowledged that Musk will be part of his government if he wins. In fact, Trump called Elon a \"cost-cutter\" who will save the US Trillions. Elon's ability to reduce Twitter staff from 7,800 to 1500 made Trump give him that title. I don't also think that America's bankruptcy will be good for the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin price is highly connected to the US economy, bankruptcy will affect the market adversely. I also doubt if the US will go bankrupt.",

I too agree to the point that he should stay away from price predictions but his warning about the US bankruptcy is very well intended. US is actually standing on a pile of debt beyond any healthy measure. US can anytime increase its so called debt celling and print more money. But in long term, that will have a bad impact on its economy. You need to understand that the dollar power of US has slowly started fading off.",

It's only when he is been talking with experts, when most people started to notice the fact that he is avoiding detailed questions.
