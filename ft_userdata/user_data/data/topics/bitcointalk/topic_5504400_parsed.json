It doesn't look as if those wallets had issues. What I'm beginning to see is that there's always a loophole only if the hacker looks closely enough or if the owner is careless enough.",

So long there aren't standard wallets, they will always have issues. And I will go with what @Charles-Tim said. Use only standard wallets to store your coins. All these social media were meant for entertainment and anything relating to funds or cryptocurrency should be avoided. They don't give you total control over them. It's just like a Centralized system, controlled by people. If you must use a wallet use the well known ones and store your keys in a place where you alone will know about and offline.",

Not always. This is exactly one of the main reasons why we prefer open source wallet solutions. While no system is completely immune, open source allows for extensive scrutiny by the community, making it harder for vulnerabilities or exploits to hide.Besides, this case has nothing to do with hacking. Adding a backdoor to wallet software with the intent of stealing user funds is clearly a criminal activity, but not hacking.",

It was an intentional act by Zhank because he wanted to steal their funds that was why he made a back door to have access to people's private keys.This is why open source wallets are the best wallets for storing bitcoin because it is open for all to look into the source code and improve the security. It is only a closed source wallet that a back door can be created unknown to the users. An open source wallet can not be compromised only if you expose your private keys or malware and Spyware attack your system unknown to you, because there is no back door.",

But even if you lock it all down, the exchanges themselves make too nice a target.  Essentially massive online vaults begging to get cracked.  Keeping your own keys is the only real protection.",

What I'm beginning to see is that there's always a loophole only if the hacker looks closely enough or if the owner is careless enough. The best way to have enough security is to have a low profile because if you become a target of hackers they will find a way to access to your coins, there are a lot of ways to do this with some advanced tools or even with social engineer. So, while you are not a target you can feel in the safe zone. And security is not only about Bitcoin, is important to have good security practices in life, like not having the same password on different services, or using complex passwords with special chars, upper case letters and numbers.",

Generate your keys using a trustworthy open-source tool on a safe air-gapped device, never let your private keys connect to the internet and your wallet will be completely safe. It's not that hackers will definitely find a way to access your wallet. If that was true, all users who hold big fund would have been hacked and bitcoin would have failed.",

Yeah, it was non-custodial and huobi's actually --\"iToken (the original Huobi wallet)\"I noticed there has been a rise of CEXs making their own non-custodial wallet as well and promotions are launched as well to get more people to install it. Let this be a reminder not to as they are closed source. Don't give in to promotions lol.Good thing the police were able to caught the perps before they use the drained funds. Perps were being careful and wanted to wait for 2 years before they use it so victims are likely to get their money back.Although we're not exactly talking about their custodial exchange service. This also says a lot about how malicious people can always linger around CEXs so let's not use them as a storage.",

When choosing a Bitcoin wallet to use, it has to be a reputable and open-source wallet. Also, I think that a crypto enthusiast should understand the need to have a cold wallet and a hot wallet because if you have your wallet in your device (like a phone or laptop) and you are always using those devices to browse the internet, chances that you might get attacked are there, so for you to prevent such, you need to have a cold wallet that doesn't go online all the time. You can get a hardware wallet to be safer. Keep your private keys offline and in a safer place, and then you will not be compromised.",

Speaking of private keys, I was always skeptical about Houbi products when the last time the community found a phishing link on their sites and the team was unaware of it. Some members from this forum reported that issue to the team and they said we would look into it. And now after reading the article, I can say again, if you don't own the keys, then you don't own the crypto. Always prefer dexs although people are using CEXs all the time so if they want to, then I prefer to use a good one like OKX, Binance, ByBit, etc. These are doing good at the moment Robinhood and Bitstamp are also good",
