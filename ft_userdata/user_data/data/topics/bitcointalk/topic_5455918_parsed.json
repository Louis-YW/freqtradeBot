All of the concepts has been developed into smart contract where we had shared it in Github. (https://github.com/firedaolab)Now we're looking for our first group of OG that support this project. Only OG can get the whitelist to purchase our OG-FDT token. OG whitelist can be obtained by earning points in Zealy (https://zealy.io/c/firedao/questboard). Points in Zealy can be exchanged for our incentives token FLM too.",
