Instead, choose a niche that you are passionate about and that you know something about. If you cannot say \"I am not an expert but I want to learn about it\" then it is probably not the right niche for you. AI has the potential to completely change our world, and with so many promising blockchain-based AI projects out there, it is easy to get swept up in the excitement. But do not let all that noise distract you from considering which ones have a legitimate chance of mass adoption. After all, if you cannot tell who the real experts are, how will you know which one to trust?",

Now talking of metaverse its yet for us to understand the usefulness of it, i believe as time goes we may understand more better about its futures just as today everyone talks about Bitcoin. I could remembered then when bitcoin was less than a Dollar and we never pay attention to it and today those who went into it are really enjoying the best of it so it will be with metaverse.",

I also think that's why these people are talking negatively to Metaverse because they don't understand it or we are still early.People also must not think always of money, maybe some of them started to think that if you are in the metaverse or use some metaverse project, it's easy money.",

AI is not a 2020+ thing that just show up and is about to explode in this year. We have crypto winters, AI lovers have AI winters too:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winterFrom time to time people talk a lot about AI and than nothing for next few years. It may explode in 2023 it may explode in 2033. Its hard to guess and even harder to invest. I would NOT look for a good AI investment during and inside blockchain bubble. Its just not make sense. Its a multi billion $ thing and you need a huge database to even start. Its not that a 3 clever dudes will collect 10 mln $ from ICO and dominate AI with it. You have google and other big companies that knows everything about us. They will be first with usable AI. So if you want an AI investment buy nvidia, alphabet stock. Maybe intel, ASML, samsung for hardware site of this industry.Metaverse will not hit mass adoption without good and cheap VR sets or neuralink chips that can stream 8k with other 5 senses (touch, hearing, smell, etc) into your brain - like braindance in Cyberpunk. We need a decade or two for this. And its a big companies deal. Not \"3 clever dudes will collect 10 mln $ from ICO and dominate metaverse\". Tencent/blizzard/EA have billions $ for investments and thousands of well-qualified programmers.",

Why not? We already have different AIs and many of them are useful for the humans as it can help us do some things consistently. I think those who think negatively are just paranoid and have watch too match of those AIs in the movies that kill people, something like the terminator.Those that we see in the movies are mostly fictional and can't possibly occur in real life so you guys shouldn't worry a lot. Instead why can't you just think about the positive things that they can bring to us? Metaverse is like a virtual reality so yeah it is not the same as the AI but there are still dangers on them because sometimes it requires you to wear a head gear and you won't see what is happening in the real world.",

Of course, anything can happen, maybe new technologies are too early for us, or maybe we still don’t know much, and there are projects and products that use artificial intelligence, and also already have a practical application of the metaverse. All this will clarify the near future, but for now it has not yet arrived, we can simply follow the information about artificial intelligence and metauniverses, or help our participation in their publication. Oddly enough, but a lot depends on us, because people, that is, you and I, determine trends and directions in development, which means that if we want, we will probably have both artificial intelligence and the metaverse.",

Just focus about what happening for now, no need to worried about that AI. For sure few kind of jobs might be get replaced by them, but that will make us to more compete with other people. Just see how Facebook/Meta tried to change world by their metaverse, in the end they lost lot of money because it's still very far from what people inagine",

Will this use case faces the same fate? I am worried that we are too haste into the future like we won't be needing this until some several years later, is this something to be worried about? Few questions:What exactly are you worried about? Have you invested into AI and Metaverse? And if so to what exactly. Both of these contain huge spectrum of different projects and different ways to build them. You talk about AI blockchain adoption, so ask yourself, why would AI NEED a blockchain when it's still very much experimental field and will be so for a long time. All the succesful AI projects right now require huge companies and fast data processing, so why would decentralized ledger do anything for it? And what kind of AI are we talking about?What comes to metaverse, it's a buzz word. Some of us remember similar buzz about virtual reality, and this has similar feel to it. Tech is not yet good enough for it being meaningful. And the fact that they try to force not polished projects on this virtual sandbox seems just cringe and lame. The idea of metaverse is good, but we are still decade a way to even know how to implement it in a way the gui seems intuitive.",

I would say that this is the biggest challenges for now, developers will have to find a way to integrate AI and make it to work.Just like in Metaverse, even one of the biggest company in the world have difficulty developing their own Metaverse even if they have spent billions already. Imagine spending 22 billion on R&D and nothing concrete and their product has no legs?So I understand the OP frustration, but as I have said, there are challenges that needed to go over in the beginning.",

Bro, all these things you are talking about are still new, evolving and advancing, so I would not give up at this early stage, A.I, Blockchain, and Metaverse will get the adoption when the time is right. It is true, the process is a bit slow but I feel a lot of progress has been made. A.I is used in big companies and organizations, blockchain and metervase are catching up. These are new innovations and people needs to gradually get used to using them and fitting them into various business, i don't see why anyone should be worried.",
