In Africa, we can say the falling or disintegration of family system is one of the reasons, hardship and unemployment as another factor, the drive for greener pastures and brain drain where one party consent to contract marriage and afterwards it goes into divorce.Modernity has dealt a great blow on the marriage institution where sex is most dignified and sacred but now, you can get sex just anywhere. Women now see themselves as object of beauty and are easily triggered to anger and hungry for divorce and nothing holds her back unlike in the past where the family is an integral part of marriage. In fact, some women prefer to stay as single mother than living with a man as husband and once they have had a baby, they are good for divorce.The reasons for divorce is enormous and with difference based on jurisdiction.",

      "body": "I think what most people fail to understand about marriage is marriage is a Union and not a contract. Most people fail to understand themselves individually before getting married, I think the fall of marriages is people fail to know themselves first like the example you made a man divorce his wife after seeing her without makeup that shows that there is no love for each other, all what the man wants is a beautiful face and not a wife. People now rush into marriage forgetting that marriage is forever and needs time first. For example in my country women rush into marriage because they are not financially stable so they need someone to take care of them and that's a wrong impression, before getting married both parties need to be independent financially. Secondly most people lack the process to take before getting married. Let me talk about one, courtship; this is the dating period where two individuals get to know about themselves better. Thirdly most marriages lack a healthy communication, I feel communication in every marriage is important and any marriage that lacks communication will not last",

Economic independence has grown allowing individuals to support themselves outside of marriage. The stigma around divorce has decreased making it a more accessible option for unhappy couples. Changing gender roles & expectations have also impacted relationships. These factors among others have contributed to higher divorce rates compared to the past.",

Who is really the problem ? The man or the woman? Infidelity is the major cause of divorce in my location. Couples are no longer faithful to their marital vows and this has led to so much problems. Another reason is social media influence. Many people are now been influenced by the lives or marriages of celebrities. People tend to copy the lifestyle of these celebrities which has given rise to intolerance and lack of respect. Most women want to handle their homes like these superstars without considering their cultural background. You shouldn't also compare this generation with your forefathers. Before now, women were treated like second-class citizens so they were forced to endure oppression and molestation in marriage. Currently, women have started getting the right attention due to various awareness campaign and favorable legislation. So a woman will no longer be forced to remain in an abusive marriage due to cultural and religious beliefs. It is now easier for them to report domestic violence to relevant authorities and even to get a divorce.",

It was not the legal system which changed as much as society and the minds of the people did. In school I was taught that being someone's boy/girl friend was supposed to be a long relationship stage, so the couple could know each other as much as possible, before taking the big step of marriage. It would seem that today there is no so much difference between marriage and being someone's boy/girl friend, beyond the legal aspects of it and the paperwork involved in the process.",

Who is really the problem ? The man or the woman? Both parties are at fault when they divorce because they cannot maintain their commitment. In my opinion, divorce is acceptable when one party is physically or mentally violent, but if you divorce only for the reasons you mentioned, it is stupid, and maybe when examined by a psychiatrist there is already a mental disorder. because before marriage there is of course an introduction and courtship phase, so how can he realize that his wife is not beautiful after marriage?What happens in your environment may be different from other environments so it cannot be concluded that divorce is increasing. In my country, divorce cases are indeed increasing and the percentage increase is quite high, which is quite sad, but the number of divorces in each province is different, but overall it is increasing, so if there are a lot of divorces in a region A, it doesn't necessarily mean that region B will suffer the same fate.

Who is really the problem ? The man or the woman? In my country's law deception is a justifiable ground to seek divorce. But if you marry because of physical beauty you will be disappointed because it can be faked. Get married to somebody you are comfortable with or without makeup. I am not comfortable with girls who wear markups because they don't look real to me. A good character is far better than physical beauty, We all know people can change later in life but as much as the relationship is not abusive, criminal, or violent, it is better to endure. You will not have a perfect spouse if you know he/she is not indulging in any criminal activity and doesn't molest, disrespect, or act violently, such a spouse can be managed",

Changing gender roles & expectations have also impacted relationships. I totally agree with you here. The stigma around divorce has decreased greatly. This is the reason couples are no longer committed because they can always exit if need be. Growing up we were told marriage is \"for better and for worst\". The current generation do not believe in that phrase.  Once marriage becomes a burden,  divorce becomes the next option and it is being celebrated. In Africa (especially my country), marriage used to be held at high esteem. Divorce was something to be ashamed of. In Africa, the man is the head of the family and his decisions stands, but today civilization has made everyone wise. Both partners share equal rights and responsibilities.  Where one partner faults,threats of divorce spring up. We have lost our values.",

It's not just a piece of paper, it's a whole journey that requires maturity to handle the ups and downs together. Quote from: Peter Faith on October 23, 2023, 08:56:43 AMBut our forefathers has been with same women for decades, is it exposure ? Who is really the problem ? The man or the woman? That’s because reasons for divorce has always been there like abusive partners. Blaming just men or women isn't fair. Maybe the did love each other but it is  more about adapting to new challenges and finding deeper connections. Real, open communication and understanding each other’s flaws can make a huge difference. It's about evolving together but not to the extent that marriage becomes inhumane.",

Husband and wife relationships are not like those with typical girlfriends, where you can break up at any time. A complete understanding between you and your proposal is worthy of marriage. Prior to accepting each other, one must be aware of the other's habits and character. You can just approach a female you see today, ask her to marry you and even say that, \"Let's get married next month.\" What are our predictions for the conclusion? Therefore, it is not necessary for us men to rush into finding marriages.",

In divorce cases there are different factors that constitute divorce in the whole world. Some couples divorce because of financial, some cheating, some unsatisfied sex habit, some commitment as you said which can also lead to poor communication and unfertilized marital status etc. And because of all those factors, African men decided to marry more than one wives in those days but when the civilization came to the African countries, monogamous relationship and family was introduced and when a man and a woman married and above mentioned are found then marriage is dismissed. Op yours example is even better. I have seen 3hours marriage. The marriage ended at the alter of the wedding. It was genotype that end the marriage. And that is when you are about to marry follow all the due process and make sure you marry someone you like and love. Marry someone that can give you sex the way you want. And before you marry prescribe all your likes and dislikes so that when you people are coming together, there will be no argument.",
