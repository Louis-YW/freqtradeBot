Th few that do noy support bitcoin may still in one way or the other allow their citizens to be able to hold bitcoin. Just like China, but just not considering it as a currency, but instead as a property.Is Bitcointalk a forum for scammers or for criminal activities? No, it is a forum to know more about bitcoin and beyond as you can know others things, like how to avoid scam.",

There are several governments in this world that could stop bitcointalk in it's current form... either by targeting the DNS, or by targeting cloudflare, or by targeting the hosting company... And by targeting i mean: using legal means to stop these services being provided to bitcointalk.Other governments might be able to hire hackers to attack SMF (or the lamp? stack), or by DDos'in (eventough we're behind cloudflare, which is so big it's ~basically safe).Even other governments could target the user's isp's or by putting their whole country behind a firewall.But once again, i don't see this happening anytime soon... If a western government would do this, the press would have a field day... Sure, governments and banks FUD the hell out of our community, but completely blocking a forum would probably backfire (due to free speech restriction and so on).",

US can only restrict their residents to use exchange but they can’t force exchange to closed globally. Unless the forum is illegal worldwide, there’s no way that this will happened.",

You may have the impression that this community is bigger and more important than it is.2. The crypto related noise on Twitter, for example, is much more visible and much more toxic imho; that could be a much easier and much more likely target.",

Mods and admin are just like any other admin & mod on other forums, would be weird if they started judging them as criminal just because they manage a bitcoin-focused forum. As others have mentioned, they'd better off looking for a Twitter scammer instead.Controlling exchanges is also a better choice if they want to control crypto. Not to mention it is definitely more profitable that way. They can just lay some regulations, get some taxes when somebody trades, fine them when they report their tax wrong, and so on. It is definitely more effective and profitable compared to blocking some websites that can get bypassed easily with VPN, DNS encryption, and so on.",

However, these tools are getting actively banned too, so, with every passing day, it is becoming harder and harder to access the website. Of course, those who lost access to the forum do not necessarily lose interest in bitcoin, but the inability to communicate online with like-minded people may adversely affect the rate at which cryptocurrency adoption is spreading. Also, it may negatively impact the quality of knowledge transferred because many experienced and technically-savvy members have lost interest in this forum because of these inconveniences.",

I am also of the opinion that the governments of the world have much bigger problems than dealing with forums, so don't worry too much about such things.Quote from: witcher_sense on February 08, 2023, 03:45:03 PMSome local communities (Russian board for example) have already been banned from accessing this forum.

However, these tools are getting actively banned too, so, with every passing day, it is becoming harder and harder to access the website. I did not notice that members from Russia (at least those who are active outside the RU board) disappeared from the forum because of that ban - and I would not agree that VPN or TOR are something sophisticated that every average user could not use. The latest report on the activities of the local boards does not really support your thinking.Source",

Day by day we are passing the modern world step one by one. In the past the countries did not accept bitcoin /crypto, they are now accepting or becoming more flexible day by day. So in this modern world bitcoin is getting more popular, and some enthusiasts are saying crypto could be future money. So there is very less chance that a country can target bitcointalk like what you have mentioned in OP. But yeah if something bad happens, and a country starts to be more serious about crypto they just can ban the website like what are doing for gambling sites for some countries.",

They can assign their agents to register as members and use the opportunity it spread false information in the forum. They might also use hacking or cyberattack to try to attack the forum.
