Thanks.1. There is a list of good mixers, you have to just search a little. Here you are: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2827109.02. I didn't find anywhere info on bitcointalk that would say that Mixabit is legit. I found 2 onion addresses marked as scam, and that's all. I have no idea how you guys find the shadier and less used services on the internet, really...3. Not much relevant, probably, but still: there is a bitcointalk user mixabit, but it's inactive for some 6 years.I don't know where you found that mixer and I don't know if it's scam or they have difficulties, but I'd assume the worse, especially if they're not answering (although it's not uncommon to get slow answers from support).PS. I think that Service Discussion would have been the place for this topic.",
