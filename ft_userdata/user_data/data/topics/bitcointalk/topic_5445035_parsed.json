  "content": "Hi,For some reasons I need to receive a transaction from a Bitcoin wallet that has an amount of 2000 or at least 500 Bitcoins. The sending wallet also should have total outgoing transactions less than 1000. (i.e. should not be from an exchange).it can be a small amount. at least 1 satoshi. I can pay for that by crypto or Paypal.Is there anyone who can help me?this is important for me because it can help me to get a new job. Thanks",

They may be aiming for having a dormant wallet and not carrying anything, but that's a big ask IMO. Why would they even do it in the first place? Maybe look for addresses with that kind of amount and find the owner of it and ask them. I'm sure there are tools that you can use to search if they posted the specific address or not. I highly doubt it, though.",

That would only prove that you are capable of finding someone who has that number of BTC, and to me it all seems like someone trying to identify owners who have 500 BTC or more.It doesn't seem like any honest business to me, and in any case, the request is strange to say the least.",
