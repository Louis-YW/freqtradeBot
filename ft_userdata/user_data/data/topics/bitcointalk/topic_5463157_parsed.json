I don't know, maybe I lived in a time when when you wanted to acquire knowledge about a specific topic you had to physically leave home and go to a library, or to buy books maybe previously having talked with someone so they could guide you on how to get the information, while today you can get a lot of information that the wise men of antiquity could not have even dreamed of at the click of a button.My advice, OP is to be as autonomous as possible to acquire knowledge of the topics discussed in the forum and in general. Of course, if you have a specific question when you are learning, ask in the forum and we will help you.",

I do too. Sometimes I think it's sheer laziness that makes them ask questions that are staring them in the fact right there. I believe anyone genuinely seeking knowledge will be voracious in reading and researching and when I don't find it in these newbies, I summarily conclude they just want to be here for the grab; so to say. Recently, we've seen a preponderance of \"I'm a newbie\" threads pop up here and there. They can lurk around, study and read comments in the forum and form answers to some of the questions they might have asked in a haste, without screaming they're here.",

A few members that commented above me already gave you the necessary information that you need, so I don't have to send the same link again. But I notice that every newbie joining the forum is creating a similar thread making an introduction, which I think is not really making sense. All the necessary information that we all need to post on the forum has already been pinned, so I see no reason to ask for the links again, and I am sure even after posting the link here, most of those newbies won't still read it. Maybe a thread should be created in case any newbies decide to make an introduction. They can do it there, but it's annoying seeing newbies introduce themselves every week.",

The term \"smart\" seems to be quite popular these days I agree with your reading that the OP probably many of the newbies we see around here are undeclared alts. In principle, even if they don't say they are alts, we don't have to assume they break the rules and alts are allowed, but in most cases we end up finding out over time that they trade merits with each other or join the same signature campaign, things like that.Quote from: Lucius on August 14, 2023, 10:00:35 AMOf course I'm not saying that the OP is someone's alt account, but the methods people use to build alt farms on this forum are getting more and more cunning.
