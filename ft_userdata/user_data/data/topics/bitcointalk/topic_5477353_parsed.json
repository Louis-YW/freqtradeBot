Financial advice is needed if your uncle has been able to save but is confused about what to use it for. Meanwhile, from the story you told, your uncle always spent money on parties, drinking and women. I think your uncle needs more advice on changing his lifestyle. Your uncle needs to start improving himself, I am not forbidding your uncle from partying or drinking as long as he doesn't spend all his income on it.",

He is a contractor, not a business man, so he just live by paycheck to paycheck from his clients. But what if the clients dried up? He doesn't have saving in bank for sure. So once he stop that partying, then the next thing is to go bank and save those money.Now, if he wanted to make more money out of the money he got from being a contractor, then he needs to invest his money. So as a rule, invest what you can afford. And since you are in this community, maybe the best investment is Bitcoin. You can guide him how to be investor, for sure you should have known the how's on how to become a investor in bitcoin (wallets, safety and others).",

So, before the financial matter, I'd rather say that he needs to look first for his well being. Because given that there are a lot of beautiful and admiring financial tips that will be given to him. What's next? Is he going to follow them all? I doubt it because of those vices that he's got and that's why it is essential to remove them first and seek professional help like what I have mentioned that are good in that treatment.",

I think what he needs is where to invest and be getting his return to spend rather holding the capital",

This is why it would really be pointless or rather uselesson making yourself trying out to talk or convince your uncle on what are the things he should supposed to do. Come to think that even his wife cant really be able to controlthen how much more on your part? You would really be just that rejecting you automatically.Just let him be on what are the things he would be doing. Consequences and unfortunate events are the things that would really make you realize in the end of the day.As long you do have the money then you wont really be thinking up well on the things that must be done. You would really be spending like a madman untilyou would be finding yourself get broke.",

Basically, his uncle has no priorities with his money which allows it to be spent on different things. Well, he has the rights to do so but being concerned to him is valid. He may still engage with those activities and buy the things that he want but with moderation; everything which is too much is bad. Now, how will it be delivered to his uncle without hurting his feelings? OP should just initiate a talk and explain himself why he needs to have self-control over his funds. Things will just change if regulation with expenses and cashflow will be tracked to assess which one is necessary and which one is helpful on a daily basis.",

He is already a family man and is getting old for that matter, he needs to get his shit straight if he wants his kids to still let him meet his grandkids. Your uncle's youthful exhuberance must end and the only way I see that happening is if he actually experienced poverty for once. Make him experience at least a whole month despite him earning contracts a month without any lavish luxury. Make him live within the means of a regular 9-5-er and he's probably going to realize just how much he's spending on these parties adn these hoes. He needs more than financial advice, at this point i'd be the one to say it but he definitely needs a drop kick in the head.",

If the woman is unemployed and has an idea to manage a business, then your uncle can use some of the money to start up a business and put his wife in charge of managing the business. If he is business-oriented too, he could set up a business for himself too. In my country, with $5k, you can set up a mini grocery shop or a polybag-producing company. Lastly, if he can be a patient holder, discuss with him the idea of investing in Bitcoin, but let him be aware of the risk of holding Bitcoin. That's my opinion.",

He should not waste that kind of opportunities in life.

That way, instead of thinking of going out to parties or spending his money for luxury items, he will learn to control his expenses because he has other priority now. And that his interest will be focused on his investment which is a good thing so he won't end up using up all his money into unnecessary expenses.However, educate him first before he decides to invest. He will never succeed from any investment without knowing and understanding his investment well. And never go all in, only invest what he can afford to lose. And lastly, invest with caution since bitcoin is known to be a high risk asset.",
