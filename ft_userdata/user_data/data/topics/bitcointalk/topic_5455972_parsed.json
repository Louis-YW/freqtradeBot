Any other platform claiming they are selling genuine Ledger wallets is either a scam or compromised. Depending on your requirement choose the version that you need. If your condition is only to hold your crypto assets then buy Ledger Nano S. If you trade quite frequently then buy S Plus.",

That's a nice comparison between the 2 devices and it seems Nano S would be sufficient for me since I don't do much transactions.Nobody involved in crypto would ever buy a hardware wallet from Amazon or Flipkart. Official website and their trusted resellers are the only best options.Quote from: Bureau on June 12, 2023, 08:09:44 AMWhy do you specially need a Ledger wallet or a hardware wallet?

Airgapped PC is a good alternative but it still doesn't provide the same level of security as a hardware wallet.Hardware wallets are the most secure option to store cryptocurrencies as of current date.",

      "body": "Quote from: pawanjain on June 10, 2023, 04:54:48 PMWhat is the most secure way of buying a hardware wallet in India ?I have purchased almost 5-10 hardware wallets from different sellers and dealers globally. When it comes to purchasing a secure hardware wallet to store your coins, you should probably purchase a Trezor as opposed to Ledger. Ledger has been notorious in leaking KYC data over the past years and in addition to that their recently introduced backup feature is quite risky if you hold a significant amount of crypto. The only reason why Trezor is lagging in hardware wallet space is that, they have been primary designed for Bitcoin Maxis and they don't have the best shitcoin support & NFT support out there while comparing it with Ledger. Other than that, they are considered superior to Ledger in terms of transparency, cost and trustworthiness.While you are ordering directly from Ledger/Trezor website, you need to undergo customs charges where they tear open your wallet from the packaging bag and check manually (happened in my case). Through this, you never know if your wallet has been tampered or has been intact as you can never trust Indian customs when it comes to crypto related items. Etherbit, OTOH eases this procedure as they import the wallets for you and sell them through their site by adding a minor charge for customs. Also, Etherbit is an official partner of Ledger & Trezor Wallets, so you never need to worry if they are selling legit products.On top of that, when you are ordering directly from Etherbit you will have an edge over to your data because your data stays within Etherbit servers and never reach Ledger/Trezor and even if hackers target the latter your data would be safe with Etherbit.Quote from: pawanjain on June 10, 2023, 04:54:48 PMI am kinda paranoid when it comes to hardware wallet. What if the seed is leaked or tampered.When it comes to usage of any crypto wallets be it hardware or software, there are varying levels of trust which must be kept on the creator/programmer of the wallet. Considering software wallets such as Electrum, you need to know to compile the source and read the code to know if there aren't any backdoors added in the code. When it comes to hardware, you need to know Chip Design, build your own wallet from scratch based on the github repo of Trezor. If you do not want to go along all these shits, then a minimal trust is required for you to start using your HW wallet.Quote from: pawanjain on June 10, 2023, 04:54:48 PMLedger Nano S costs 7k INR while the Ledger Nano S Plus costs 10k INR.Nano S is deprecated and you should not purchase that as there won't be any future security updates to the wallet. Please check this blog post for reference : LEDGER NANO S SUNSET FAQ Additionally, S Plus has NFT support which isn't available in S. So, my opinion would be to move over to S Plus.",
