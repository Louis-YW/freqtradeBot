The euro value will go lower then zimbawe dollar if this process wht going on dont stop.",

If other countries did not start using this same strategy, it would most likely put them at a disadvantage on the world stage. because they face stiff competition from outside the eurozone in terms of exports and move elsewhere.",

Germany alone exports goods for about 1.37 trillion euro annually. The European Union exports a lot of goods and services, but it imports a lot of goods and services as well. The trade balance is what's important. Anyway, the Euro is going down in value because:1.The insecurity regarding the war in Ukraine and the Russian oil and natural gas supplies, which are about to stop(or maybe not).Europe is way more dependent from Russian natural resources than many other countries. The USA doesn't have this problem.2.The European central bank isn't increasing the interest rates. The Federal Reserve finally did some rate hikes and many economists criticized this move as being \"too little, too late\". The European central bank is even slower than the Federal Reserve.",

You have no idea how the world economy works apparently, the collective economies of all EU countries rival the size and scale of America, if not bigger. Europe produces some of the finest medical, tech and hardware of all countries. You're an absolute joke if you think Russia produces much of anything besides extracting minerals / gas and oil out of the earth, which requires very little skill - even the technology for that they have to purchase from companies in Europe and America. Besides that, Europe is full of culture and is one of the premier destinations for tourism because of both it's natural beauty, wide range of interconnected countries and general governmental stability.",

The European Union exports a lot of goods and services, but it imports a lot of goods and services as well.It is not far-fetched, OP is just wording it badly.EU depends a lot on energy, specifically countries like Germany that heavily rely energy imports. These are industrial countries that would seize all productions if their energy like gas was cut off or was disrupted in any way. Another big problem is that even if their energy is not cut off, EU still heavily relies on cheapness of it to be able to compete in international markets. (This is what Russia capitalized on over the past decades.) When energy prices shoot up (like gas and oil prices these days) those industries would end up with high production costs so they have to increase the price of their products.Now we have inflation in most countries in the world, people in those countries that for example used to import goods from EU can not afford to buy goods anymore, they definitely can't afford to buy them if the price of them is also higher. So their markets are slowly taken over by competitors like China that have access to cheaper energy compared to EU and much cheaper production costs.It's the same with services.And that's the main reason why euro is dumping and Europe is facing a lot more inflation to come in the coming years.",

I love the narrative of some, everything is made in China....well, no!Europe alone exports more than China, just Germany, Netherland and Italy export the same as China does, out of the biggest 10 exports 5 are from Europe, and speaking of Germany, as you mentioned, Germany exports more than the entire GDP of all but top 14 countries, or more than the entire GDP of Nigeria, Malaysia Philippines, and Vietnam combined!The other narrative I love...The euro is going up, this will be bad for their exports it will ruin the economy!If the euro goes down, it will be bad, they need expensive energy imports, and it will ruin the economy.The USD goes down, the petrodollar is going to be destroyed!If the USD goes up, it will ruin everything as it makes stuff more expensive, the petrodollar is going to die!The Turkish lira or the rial dive 80% in value, everything is fine, the petrodollar is going to die!",

Let's see what will happen during the course of the year as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine intensifies. Just my opinion Gas supplies are dwindling, if Russia really cuts off supplies completely then I think Europe will be in a recession quickly. Russia may have been preparing for this war for decades, and Europe has been too dismissive of Russia when it comes to sanctions. Russian gas and oil revenues have tripled from pre-war levels, which the US and EU have miscalculated. The war not only pushed the European economy into crisis but also caused division within the EU, so I still believe that the euro will fall even further in the near future. It doesn't stop here.",

On top of that they control almost all the world's energy amongst themselves.This is why it backfired.
