  "content": "hello everyone, to start I need to give you a little context to explain what I consider a mature account in a casino these days.From January 2019 to June 2020 Luckygames was my main casino, this was because Luckygames had very good things that I did not find in many competing casinos but as many people already know Luckygames closed in June 2020 so in my case I had to search alternatives with competing casinos to continue betting and the same thing happened to my friends at Luckygames.In January 2020 I signed up for Stake and to date it still seems like a good casino to me, Stake is one of the 3 casinos where I have my 3 mature accounts, the other 2 casinos where I have my mature accounts are BC and Wolf, in the last 2 I registered when Luckygames closed.Now I will tell you what I consider a mature account in a casino, as many people already know, many casinos have a VIP program and you enter that program after having bet a certain amount, among BC, Stake and Wolf casinos I see that in BC it is more It is easy to enter the VIP program, in BC with 1 usd wagered you can enter the VIP program but at level 1 you are in bronze rank and I do not see benefits of being at level 1, I consider that in BC to start having good benefits in the VIP program you have You have to be in the gold rank and you reach the gold rank at lvl 22 with 49k usd wagered, in my case I started in BC with lvl 30, this is because I transferred the lvl I had in Luckygames to BC, with respect to Stake and Wolf I can tell you that these last 2 casinos have a very similar VIP program if we talk about the amounts bet they ask you to reach each rank, in Stake you reach the Bronze rank with 10k usd bet and in Wolf you reach the Hunter rank with 10k usd bet. in Stake I have a bronze rank and in Wolf I have a hunter rank.To summarize what I said before, a mature account in a casino is when you are in the VIP program and if you can receive weekly and monthly bonuses it is better.now I tell you how I get some benefits in BC, Stake and Wolf, In BC I can get benefits with spin, rains and coco, In Stake I can get benefits with weekly and monthly bonuses and in Wolf I get benefits with weekly bonuses, As many people already know, each casino has its way of offering incentives for users, I mean that something that we can find in one casino, it is possible that we will not find it in another, for example in BC you only need 1000 usd of historical wager to receive rains while in Stake you need 3000 usd weekly wager to receive rains, with this example I mean that in BC it is easier to receive rains.What I mentioned before are the advantages offered by each casino that I use on a regular basis in terms of incentives that they offer to users, now I will tell you how we can take advantage of the issue of betting and this applies to the casinos that I have mentioned as well as to others where you play, I say this because apart from BC, Stake and Wolf I have tried other casinos but in others I have less mature accounts, as many people already know, cryptocurrency casinos offer instant withdrawals and I try to take advantage of this and I will tell you how, it does Approximately 3 days I won 0.25 bcd in BC with the spin and with this I went up to 11 bcd, I changed the 11 bcd for usdt, I made a little wager and sent the 11 usd to Stake, BC charges 1 usdt commission for withdrawals then in Stake I got 10 usdt, I raised the 10 usdt in Stake to 16 usdt and I withdrew this to my bank account to enjoy them at a personal expense.I know this topic is long but I wanted to tell you about my experience trying to get a little bit of profit from casinos and this is something that works for me, I would like to know if someone applies this to comment and if they have questions I stay tuned to answer.",

But those VIP benefits and perks and other exclusive privileges require that you have the money. After all, you can only rise through the VIP ranks if you are spending big time. If you are an occasional gambler with only a small amount of money prepared each time you log in or enter a casino, you probably don't even have to desire having multiple mature accounts.",

You get more benefits when you rank up and increase your level in these casinos. But to be honest, a high roller doesn’t at all care about the ranks. He is a high roller, so he definitely has plenty of money to gamble, and hence he doesn’t care about these hourly reloads of 1-2 dollars.So yes, I think what the OP has mentioned isn’t at all required for all gamblers. It’s just his way of thinking and getting bonuses from the casino.",

If you mean going out with profit on a certain day, OK, but that's not what you mean. When you reach VIP levels, what happens is that the HE is reduced (or the RTP is increased). But there is always an HE, or in other words, the RTP is always less than 100. You may go from an RTP of 96 to 99 if you are a VIP (HE from 4 to 1) but you will always lose in the long run.Quote from: danieleche on June 21, 2023, 08:09:23 PMAnd it is true that you can place all your bets in a single casino to reach a very high rank but what I am saying I think it works well if you like to play original games like me, in the example I gave where I made bets in 2 casinos I think that I would have risked a lot betting in only 1 casino because the more you bet you have the more risk of finding a long streak of reds and losing your balance.This is another fallacy. To begin with, streaks do not exist from a mathematical point of view. They are reconstructions that we make a posteriori. If you play red or black at roulette, each spin has an approximate 48% chance of one outcome or the other. Betting in one casino or another has absolutely nothing to do with any supposed streak.",

      "body": "This is a very interesting way to go for a hardcore trader. However, I barely think that it is the applicable option for the gambler who is just using gambling for fun or to try out his luck now and then. Plus how many gamblers might be maintaining such high transacting accounts? It also seems to be risky over a period of time. Gamblers have complained about how their accounts have been confiscated due to minor errors, KYC issues, and high transactions, and thus they have been blocked out without payout. I think it's safer to keep the gambling limits for \"online casinos\". So instead of having highly matured accounts with a lot of gambling in it, one should have accounts over different casino's and try out luck on different sites. This way one can also end up putting segregated investments. Let us say on a bad day one ends up with the blocking out of their own account in any casino then they would at least lose less funds.PS: I think well-known casinos have lesser issues like this but one should always follow their own responsible statement.",

But most people will think long and hard before trying it because they don't think it's worth a try.It isn't worth it for me. From your story, it requires a lot of money before it can reach a certain level. So I guess I'd rather play gambling as usual and not think about the problem of reaching a certain level because gambling is entertainment and nothing more.But for people who already understand the rules, as you explained, they will try to gamble and level up slowly or quickly, depending on the amount of money they use. But whatever it is, you should have financial records to see your good progress. And I see you can get it without difficulty.",

But maybe having 3 different accounts in 3 different sites with the same level can be an advantage as well because maybe the rewards are different to each others. Of course to have these 3 accounts with good standing level requires a lot of money to spend. Only those who have big bankroll who can have 3 high level accounts in 3 different casinos.",

It's clear you've done your homework with BC, Stake, and Wolf, but arent you spreading yourself too thin? It sounds to me like your time is divided across these three platforms, chasing VIP programs, bonuses, and incentives. Have you considered focusing on just one casino? Optimizing your strategy for that particular platform might yield better results. Also, how are you handling the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies? Market trends can swing wildly, affecting the value of your winnings. This aspect seems missing in your account management strategy. Do you have any risk mitigation measures in place to manage these fluctuations?",

The amount that you had wagered on three casino, if spent on a single one would have given you more benefits and perks. What you did in earning $16 could have ended with $0. You did paid the $1 withdrawal fee so actually you would have ended with a negative balance. I may be wrong here as I only play for enjoyment, haven't thought about VIP perks till now.",
