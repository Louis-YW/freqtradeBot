In investment, it is called unrealized loss if you are losing little amount and never sell, buying at low price is what investors would think about, so that when the price increase, it would be a profit for them. 2023 is going to be a good year for bitcoin with bull and bear market while the real bull run will start in 2024. I expect bitcoin to first get about $30000 or $40000 in 2023 though which would be followed by another bear market. All-time-high in 2024 is highly likely if I should not use certain that fit more for the possibility.",

Just remember that we are in a bear market so the price is going to be at a discount no matter how you look at it. You can either buy today and hold and then buy more when the price plummet to $10k in the future. At least instead of waiting for something that we don't know will happen (hitting $10k), at least you can start your accumulation phase right now.",

      "body": "I think Bitcoin will continue to be in a bear market in the year 2023.  If we look at the prior four-year cycle of Bitcoin, the Bitcoin market is always in a bear market a year before it halving event.  So basically, the halving is in 2024, and 2023 will be in the bear market so we probably can see bitcoin price hovering around $17k-$22k and will start to break out at the end of the year of 2023 transitioning to bullish sentiment then eventually to a bullish market a few months before the halving event.Looking at the internet, there is an interesting article I stumbled upon.  It is somehow a crazy prediction, an insane one where Billionaire venture capitalist and serial blockchain investor Tim Draper speculate that Bitcoin will reach $250k in the early months of next year[1].  I like the positivity of Tim Draper but I hate the fact that he is just uttering some insane speculation without any fundamental nor Technical analysis backing it.  Just being positive is good but saying insane unreasonable speculation will make us look the same as our prediction... being insane.  [1] https://cointelegraph.com/news/tim-draper-still-positive-on-250k-bitcoin-price-prediction-in-2023",

Nobody can predict if such event will happen again. Who knows how many similar scammers are there in the space. One thing is certain - we're flushing them out and if there are some left there's not many of them. Eventually they'll be gone and a new cycle will begin.",

In my opinion, 2023 is still a year of the crypto winter cycle and looking at the economic situation as well as the war between Russia and Ukraine is not over yet, I would not be optimistic about bitcoin, meaning my prediction is still a bearish year. I can't predict, but I hope bitcoin falls more than the current price. I am not afraid of bitcoin falling further because this is an opportunity to own cheap bitcoin and I believe bitcoin will always recover when the bears disappear.",

Because if you look at the current running price of around $17K in the market, I'm more sure the price will increase again next year rather than decrease. Even though a decline is something that could happen in the next year, if the amount of Bitcoin demand volume can increase even more in the next year than supply at a lower price, maybe an increase in price will become a more dominant thing to happen to Bitcoin in the market in the coming year.",

So, dreaming about anything below $16k may remain as a dream forever in my opinion.I am one of the bitcoiner who believes into that fact 'history repeats itself'. It means bitcoin market may get affected by the current world economic situations of inflation, employment crisis and government regulations which may influence bitcoin markets to lead us to have some changes in usual bitcoin market scenarios.",

I think we have reached the lowest point of decline and this is a pretty good entry point to make a purchase. I support what @filipma1957 said you can buy using the DCA strategy every week or every month. you should enter every round as this will make it more effective for you to find the lowest price on your purchase.maybe I don't think we will see $5k or $10k price next year because big cycle of dips already happened in this year of course the expected opportunity is big spike in 2023.",

If calculated according to the winter cycle of the market lasting up to 4 years and 2023, we have only gone 2/3 of the bear season, so the possibility of a bull season is very difficult.
