As we all know, once you’re caught up with idealization of winning that jackpot no matter what, that is when you would be having problems to quit. Best thing is to have discipline however, it won’t be simply implied to oneself. Gambling has indeed its own risks but the one who gives weight to that risk is no other than ourselves. We are too fascinated of instances wherein some players are winning big time without considering how many have lost huge amount of money from gambling.",

That was a wrong belief based in wrong assumptions. It seems you wanted that to be true, because it was a confortable mean to make income, much more enjoyable than working several hours a day for a minimum wage or so in the end of the month. Gambling isn't for people looking for a way to improve their financial status, but a hobby for people who already belong to a superior financial status and has money to spend without compromising their expenses later.",

It is when you think that you can make profit from gambling that you will end up chasing your losses and become an addict along the line.Set aside your gambling budget and don't gamble more than that amount so that you don't regret your actions. People who don't understand gambling are the ones think they will hit it big and they will end up losing everything in their bankroll.

I do not go beyond my gambling budget which is small and can not affect me at all financially if I lose all.There is no way better than to have a business or a job, rather than thinking of gambling to make money.",

It’s not true that you need to lose first before you win since chance works in random basis while casino typically can’t modify the result not unless the casino is rigged. But you can huge amount even without losing money first.

No matter how much you lost in gambling over the years, in the end, you are out of the addiction with only losing your money but still having your life. I am saying this because I have seen people never coming out of this addiction until they themselves get so stuck that they commit suicide or take their lives themselves to an end by all this stuff.If someone teaches the reality of gambling, no one will make false hopes of getting quick rich. This is only for short term entertainment, that's it.",

However, there are gamblers that are doing gambling everyday with their skills and strategy but few in number.QuoteFast forward to yesterday when I go into a betting shop to see someone, I was shock to see some of my guys in the neighborhood which I knew they where doing well, now looking wreshed an tattered.One one thing I have noticed about gambling is that before you win a thousand box, they might have milk you of more than that.[I just want to use this medium to appeal to the younger generation, please stay off gambling, if you must do so, gamble responsible, don't take it as your only source of living so it wouldn't milk you dry.Let me tell you something. Betting platforms look at many factors before they launch that businesses and you know why, it's because they know that people don't have Jobs and means to make a living, even the ones making the money aren't making enough to pay bills and other stuff, the job factor alone is enough reason for gambling platforms to keep having customers because man must eat and they see gambling as an alternative to risk their available money. It's good that you are airing voice to the young ones but they will do anything legit to have money if there is no any other way and gambling is just one of them, so if you want t lend voices for people to stop gambling, lend it to government officials to provide jobs for the people, atleast that alone will reduce number of gamblers around the globe.",

Playing gambling can't  make you rich but owning a gambling shop or casino can. This is the difference between the player and the owner.The player should understand that he can always get the optimum satisfaction of entertainment and fun from gambling but can never get rich from it. If you are to stuck your guns on getting rich through gambling you will like a mishap ship get sink to bottom, wasted.",

Trading also is a risky business also buying and holding some coin is as well risky but people prefer to see gambling as the devil when there are close similarities with other things we do for financial gains.What I have come to learn is gamble with your emotions in check, don't gamble with what you can't afford to bear if lost and finally learn to call it a day.",

The appeal is nice, but in reality young people who are not gambling, or just starting by betting popular sports, or spending a few bucks a week on dice, will not come here to read your post. Beginner gamblers don't have time to read gambling forums and you won't be able to tell them anything. Hardcore gamblers will read your advice and understand they should be more careful and gamble less, but most of them won't do anything about it.",

But I want to remind you that there are many people who practice gambling as a hobby and have not been victims of addiction. According to psychology, behavioral addiction is the most dangerous type of addiction because it does not need chemical reactions in the body to stimulate it to do it, such as cigarettes, alcohol or drugs. The most dangerous types of this addiction is addiction to gambling because it drains huge mental energy in addition to the resources, which does not leave time for the gambling even to do other activities, so it is a purpose of his behavior, and it can easily harm those around him as well.",
