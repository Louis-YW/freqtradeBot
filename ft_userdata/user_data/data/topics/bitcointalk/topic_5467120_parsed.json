I really hate meme coin which I know that still hot today since this is a ponzi token that most crypto traders really like due to get quick rich nature.Forget about those earn-earn features because most of them are likely going to end up in the pit no matter what trend they keep on sustaining. While meme coins are still a choice of many because of its vast community, if you're for a meme coin I'd suggest Dogecoin only. Quote from: dimonstration on September 17, 2023, 05:18:30 PMDo you knew something new that has the potential to trend?They say RWA (real world asset) tokens but that's just still a rumor and we haven't seen yet a big move from the known companies that can easily start this trend. Aside from all of these possible trends, we might see some other forms of it being made prior to the bull run.",

      "body": "Government tokens I guess are being noisy these past few days but if it is trend, then meme coins are still having the interest of many investors such as the new ones because of $PEPE. No matter how we tell them that there’s no guarantee of same fate for new meme tokens, people are just too hyped to see that. On the other hand, it could be a good indicator but never expect for a long term progress with such tokens in this industry. Most of the time there’s no utility for meme tokens as we all know therefore there won’t be a lasting and progressive demand that would reflect on its market price; it’ll all be dependent with popularity and market manipulation caused by big investors in this industry. On my end I am avoiding it as well due to the risks involved with sudden dump upon its listing on big exchanges. There are projects who are trying to create ones with utility but that would separate it from its original concept. But if you find its volatility at advantage then that would be good on your end.",

Because we all know its gona crash.Friendstech is also quite hot but its cooling down now, markets in a pretty rough spot tbh.Overall i feel like we are in a wait and see kind of a phase, really need something new to pop up to ride the new wave.",

I really hate meme coin which I know that still hot today since this is a ponzi token that most crypto traders really like due to get quick rich nature.Probably AI coin? I think that it's very hard to guess it as there was no new trend become hottest topic right now. It's caused by the market is quite stagnant at this moment. I think that you can stick into the top 300 CMC. This will be far better caused by it's hard to guess what trend is booming right now. Quote from: dimonstration on September 17, 2023, 05:18:30 PMDo you knew something new that has the potential to trend?I would prefer to take L2 blockchain for the future. Ai coin may become a potential trend but the hype has been going down so much after the launch of worldcoin. Everything is still remain stagnant at this moment.",

If you are serious about the future of your portfolio and want to invest in something that can give good returns over time, bitcoin is still the major coin that I recommend to anybody. The new ideas that are coming up every few days, will take time to catch up and most of them are only having that hype that drives them but no substance that can generate a market demand.I have seen play to earn and defi for some time now and they haven't improved much over the months. Hence I only observe but don't invest in them.",

However, there are still a lot of things that have been built recently such as L2, web3, AI,... although the hype about it is always present, I think these fields really have great potential for development if as bitcoin enters a bullish phase.In the current market context, I observe that there are a number of altcoins that are pump/dump in a short period of time, which is probably part of a new signal to escape the gloom in the current space.",

I really hate meme coin which I know that still hot today since this is a ponzi token that most crypto traders really like due to get quick rich nature.Do you knew something new that has the potential to trend?The hot topic in my opinion is the gradual dumping of Solana held by FTX. The total amount of solana held by FTX equals to 15% of total solana supply. The dumping would not be outright but a systematic ranging a large time frame. That means solana could be a good option to grid trade at the moment. And not a good option if you plan to hold it longer. The current price trend seems to be a bull trap and we could get solana at a discounted price starting next week.Another hot topic today was the coin RSS3 available for cheaper than the ICO price.",

Some are expecting AI projects to come next but I wasn't sure if this will gain hype as well like meme coins. But must be careful in dealing with this new trend, can't say it stays as usually it ends shortly. If I were you, take advantage of the situation while potential coins are cheap rather than chasing new projects that are in hyped. Better choose an investment that is long-term rather than choosing those projects that the future is uncertain.",

So, it is most probably going to be the next big thing in crypto. For now, we are still seeing the same projects like the P2E and everything along the line of earning while doing something. I'd rather have bitcoin and top 10 alts in the market right now while everyone is looking forward for the halving next year, for sure a lot of alts will follow suit when bitcoin begins to have a bull run.",
