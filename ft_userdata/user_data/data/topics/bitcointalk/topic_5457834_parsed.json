Or maybe there could be another reason behind it. But I found only this. To what extent it could impact the market, as there is other news in the market that will disappear this news in some pile of news? Or is there any catch in this news that i am not able to understand then please help me i am all ears.",

We don’t know when will it go down but it will go down sometime in the future that’s for sure. The best thing we can do to protect ourselves from such a catastrophe is to hold real crypto currencies like bitcoin, eth, ltc… and we should hold the private keys of these funds. That’s because when a stable coin goes down, some exchanges will go down with them. (And with their customer’s funds) I cannot take that risk, nobody should.Will tusd go down anytime soon? I don’t know. However I know that I don’t want to hold it for a long time. Not worth the risk.",

TUSD marketcap may not be growing like those of USDT and USDC, but the marketcap is still growing and not falling. All you said about it is true, but I do not think this is related to what could lead to the coin to be depegged because its marketcap is not affected and nothing heard yet that can decrease the marketcap to the point of affecting the coin price.",

Binance is not directly linked to tusd (like it was to BUSD), from what I know all they did, that might point at potential partnership is fee reduction while trading on BTC/TUSD and TUSD staking in lauchpools. But it seems to me more like a desperate attempt to move the volume from USDT to avoid a situation where the entire market (and thus binance's business) depended on 1 stablecoin rather than proof that they are connectedAnd as for trying to keep BNB above $200, binance is burning $600M in BNB every quarter, which is 7% per year. And its only a 20% of their profits which they claim are mostly in BNB. Binance officially gave up the rigid 20% it guaranteed during ICO, but when I talked to a binance employee from the Polish telegram, he said it was due to the legal problems that such a fixed target caused, and 20% is the value they try to stick to. So from pure profit they can buy all existing BNB @200$ in 3 years so I don't see a reason why should they protect 200$. its not a highly indebted company that needs additional financing by issuing new shares at the best price. Its not a shilled shitcoin like luna that will collapse if price drops.Also there is no increased volatility on BNB today. it's pretty much flat for last 2 weeks.",

So there is still a big risk for some of the stablecoins in the market right now.So far upon checking, it seems that it is still depegged, although it's close to $1.But still, it's better to stay away from TUSD until they somewhat become stable.",

You can't just say if a stablecoin depegged because the price isn't went to deep, that's a sign if the stablecoin might deppeged in the future.

My main concern is that we resorted to stablecoins as a means to secure our funds without turning them into fiat, and we're constantly subject to similar incidents; even the giants USDT, USDC, and BUSD have suffered similar issues before, but fortunately were quick to recover their parity. Until one day they don't, which isn't as unlikely as we want to believe, especially those algorithmic stablecoins such as TUSD, USDD, and many others.Personally, while I don't worry too much about losing my money on a possible depegging of a stablecoin, although I've already lost a decent sum when Terra crashed (UST), it's frustrating to see FUD and price fluctuations on something that's supposed to be stable.",
