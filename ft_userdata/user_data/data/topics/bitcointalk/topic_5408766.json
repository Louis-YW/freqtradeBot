However, some things should be returned to where they belong. because a lot has changed in a positive sense in those countries.I hope that visitors will not misunderstand such exhibits, because some still think that Bitcoin comes in physical form, and I believe that there are many physical coins on the market that are completely worthless considering the cheap materials and large quantities in which they are made.",

This exhibition has the potential to influence and affect positively people's opinions about bitcoin first and then crypto in general. The long term effect is that it will also facilitate it's adoption amongst many British men and women who had an unaccommodating opinion about bitcoin.",

I begin to have doubts about the cultural level of participants if no one don't visit The British Museum for decades. Over such a long period of time, someone should have noticed these coins much earlier.Quote from: crwth on August 05, 2022, 06:03:47 AMI'm curious about the Casascius coins that one is missing now. Maybe someone cashed it in or something, lol. Both of these coins can be cashed it in long time ago. As far as I understand, private key or qr-code (what should be there) is on the reverse side of this coin and it is not visible whether the security sticker is damaged or not. But it seems to me that the \"used\" the Casascius coin would lose its historical value, although visitors to the museum can't check or \"touch\" this in any way. Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency. Even without a protective sticker, the administration of the British Museum leave the 2nd coin as a showcase sample.",

Many famous works of art looted by the Nazis still hang in museums today as their heirs fight to get them back, 75+ years after the end of World War II.",

When visiting big museums like that, it's hard to see all of the stuff because it takes way too much time, but now I'll know the specific thing to look out for and where to find it.Regarding TheNineClub's comment, I've been to several museums in the UK, and I was surprised by how much they've stolen from their colonial times and now basically present it as theirs, even though it's clearly not.",
