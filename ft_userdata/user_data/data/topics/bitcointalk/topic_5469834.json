  "content": "A new public blockchain, based on Bitcoin with a slight modification to the Proof of Work (POW) consensus mechanism, the nonce value is directly calculated using hash functions, meaning that nonce verification does not need to Hash again, just xor is ok.Advantages:1. Dual Mining Support: this modified POW mechanism allows miners to participate in dual mining with other POW chains (e.g., Bitcoin miners).2. Cost-Efficient Parallel Chains: With this approach, low-cost parallel chains with comparable computational power can be easily established.BitcoinCode:HASH(hashNoNonce, nonce) < targetNewChainCode:hashNoNonce ^ HASH(nonce) < targetThis modification brings greater flexibility and potential for interoperability to the world of POW blockchains, offering new opportunities for miners and developers alike.",
