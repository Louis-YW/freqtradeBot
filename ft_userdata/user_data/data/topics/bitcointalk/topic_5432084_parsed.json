In the case of physical lotteries, which are drawn with balls, it might not so much be due to an intention to cheat as to an imperfection, but if a lottery system is well done, both online and physical, the appearance of the numbers is perfectly random and no matter what analysis you do, it doesn't matter.Some people confuse things like, for example, in a five-number lottery, the numbers in a row are not usually wanted by people because they think they are less likely to appear, like 00000, 11111, 22222 and so on. But in reality they have the same probability of appearing as any other, but people fallaciously confuse that there are fewer combinations of repeating sets of 5 numbers than non-repeating ones.",
