I also don't think BTC is 'common people's' money, it is 'everybody's money'. You are referring to the current situation. I am referring to the future. Imagine if every country starts approving Bitcoin related exchange traded instruments, how much Bitcoins will be controlled by these big corporates! That's where the concern is. The amount of money these big corporate have, common people cannot beat them. It will be very easy for the corporates to control a majority of the supply which will allowed into control the Bitcoin market at their will.",

(moonshine people got arrested, underage people get caught, retailers selling it to underage people get caught) alcohol has no eyes or brain, but laws still apply to humans that want alcoholwhere by the alcohol producers control what % volume the alcohol is and the rate of distribution, where by a user cant just get 100% proof alcohol unless they ask for permission from breweries or fork off their own distillery which then is not using the branded brewerys alcoholthus users of a alcohol brand are subserviant if they want to stick with a alcohol brand, by being a follower of breweries rules... or government rules that apply to a brand or the whole industry.. so there are permissionsthings have changed since ~2013. its time you update yourself on the current situation..Quote from: Z-tight on March 12, 2024, 06:22:09 PMQuote from: franky1 on March 12, 2024, 05:42:34 PMhaving/wanting to have bitcoin does not void a human of a countries lawsAnd who said it does?you are trying to suggest people can freely use bitcoin..

BUT..being a gym user/member is different to permissionless access to a gym..core no longer needs consensus of its users to change bitcoin(they softened many aspects of cores rules).. but users cant change bitcoin without cores permission(reference: REKT)things have changed since ~2013+. its time you update yourself on the current situation..",

Bitcoin stopped being what Satoshi had in mind a long time ago, but we can't blame companies, funds or governments for that, but the real blame lies with ordinary people who didn't accept that idea. There was enough time for ordinary people to own most of the Bitcoin in circulation before powerful people and companies started buying them, but even if that happened today, those same people would be very happy to exchange their BTC for good old fiat because the profit is simply irresistible.There is no doubt that over time millions of BTC will end up in the possession of those who care about nothing but profit, but I also think that it is the responsibility of each of us to prevent them from buying everything.
