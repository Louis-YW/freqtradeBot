Some people have complained of being scammed on such platform and reported some account which have been flagged. Facebook is a centralized social media platform and I believe they will want to clean up the space so that the customers will have confident and rebuild trust with them so I'm not surprised with this.",

      "body": "It's difficult to decide who to suspend, and who not to suspend. We don't want scams and crime to spread through use of the social media. But we ALSO don't want to be suspended because somebody at the media organization misinterpreted what we were doing.Let's just listen to the FBI, and suspend all the kinds of accounts that they tell us to. That way THEIR guy will have a better chance of getting into office.",

      "body": "By the way, Facebook just doesn't suspend or ban accounts because of scam. In fact, I used to see so many scammers in the platform and would barely get banned even when you reported them. They are so fast acting if it's spam, racism, promoting pornography, or anything near anti-LGBTQ or even just offending someone.There is a lot of censorship in the platform, and you could have been banned for anything against their community rules and not necessarily scam. Twitter is a little more friendly, especially since Elon Musk took over",

And on your case, you have the idea already, are you sure that you haven't done anything within that day after opening your account? Facebook has rules that every account must obey. Disobeying any of these rules will attract some level of sanctions. If the platform observes that an account is fraudulent, it will be placed under investigation and a ban can proceed if evidence shows that the account has the intention or is used for crime. In some cases these allegations are untrue but the account owner has the right to ask for a review. Nevertheless, the platform is centralized, an account can be banned for other reasons such as ideological, religious, or political orientations. In recent times some politicians have accused some social media companies of censorship.",
