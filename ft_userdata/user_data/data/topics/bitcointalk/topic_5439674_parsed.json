I bought many accounts.In order not to suspect or think badly of you, imagine that you are looking for an account in 1xbit that you want to buy and that you should be able to see its sensitive information.Did you know that the 1xbit gambling platform here on this forum is a scam that many people complained about on that platform that was never resolved and ended up taking the money of their players after depositing a lot of money?What will you do with the account you buy? will you play gambling at 1xbit? if yes, just create your account, not the one who will use another account to create an account there.",

This is raising my curiosity about how desperate some people could be for their personal gain.Wait a minute, is it possible you lose your ID with a custodial company and are not able to retrieve it back? Why are they custodial? I don't get it. Well, this offer seems like a cruise to me, even though the company mentioned is such with questionable service.",

I never force someone to sell me or contact me. Its just post that i want to buy. If anyone interested i can buy.Lol, then what's going to happen if those accounts won big?You said that they are going to suspend if you make huge profit, then how can you withdraw or make money from it? What if they flagged your account becasue you are making big amount?I really don't understand the reasoning here by the OP. In any case, good luck on your strategy.",
