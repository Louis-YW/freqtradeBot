Also, do not invest more than what you can't afford to lose.And you yourself should do some research and always try to find out negatives more instead of just false hope.",

And I think your mother has done a pretty wise thing by rejecting your invitation even though you have explained to her quite fully about Bitcoin. Because maybe after your mother heard about Bitcoin through her own children, she should take the time to find out about Bitcoin herself through the people she knows around her and through the internet or other supportive environments.Quotesome months ago my mother called me that she now have interest on investing on Bitcoin with some amount of money, I ask her what happened!  I thought she rejected the idea when I introduce it to her some years ago, and it have been long we talked about it. she said to me, I have make some research and ask questions about Bitcoin after all my mother invested huge amount of money $5k on Bitcoin which she's benefiting from it today.This means that after several years, your mother finally believes in Bitcoin and immediately makes the decision to invest in Bitcoin. This is indeed a bit of influence and encouragement from the research and questions he asked other people about Bitcoin so that he started to become enlightened about things related to Bitcoin. That's a pretty wise decision and it doesn't mean your mother didn't believe you before because she just wants to have time to find out for herself what you've told her through other people.Quotethere was a lesson I lean from here. when you are preaching to someone about Bitcoin, you shouldn't talk too much, and you shouldn't stay long and you should also allow them make some research and ask questions about what we are preaching to them, to avoid loss at the end.That is indeed a very extraordinary lesson in your life and also your own mother, because she was able to arrive at a very good belief after hearing a lecture from her own child. And another lesson I can learn from your story is don't immediately tell other people to invest in Bitcoin after we explain more about Bitcoin to other people, because basically everyone needs time to believe, to understand and to make decisions in their life. on what he already knows from other people or his own relatives. Because when someone has started to believe in what we said before, he will look for ways to be able to invest in what we have said or suggested before.QuoteI don't know, how you see it.I see this as a story that I have never come across in my life before.",

Pressuring people to invest in anything tends to backfire badly, and even worse if they are family members. If they make money they will think they were right to invest in it and if they lose money they will blame you. The worst part of your story is that you only focus on whether the price goes up or down, not on the real good things about bitcoin, like not being dependent on third parties to hold it or send it to the other side of the planet.And what makes the possible veracity of your story very weak is that you say she invested a few months ago and is now enjoying the benefits. The price in recent months has been flat or even falling.",

I don't think it's enough time for her to already start enjoying her investment proceeds as the price of Bitcoin has not really been doing too well over the past few months. If it's to be calculated very well, she might likely still be losing some figures out of her invested amount. And how has she been enjoying it? Has she been making some kind of withdrawal every time? I think she will enjoy her investment more if she can hold on to it for a longer time until the next bull run comes.",

And when we start talking about bitcoin as a way to increase your wealth, this involuntarily creates an analogy with a scam in their minds. Therefore, you don't need to put pressure on talling about btc and you need to do it very delicately, that the person himself made his own decision, of course, warning him of the possible risks and disadvantages associated with investing in bitcoin.

There are many theories written in books about how to convey and convince others of the targets we want to achieve. In practice, it's up to us. Furthermore, there are two sides of the answer that we will meet after efforts to convey something have been made, namely rejection and acceptance.Both (rejection and approval/acceptance) are reactions that are born as a result of a conscious process and that is as natural as your mother's refusal to choose to refuse after you told her to be willing to use her money to invest in bitcoin.Always remember that conveying something that contains risk must be explained thoroughly both positive and negative and never hope that after trying to convey something to others, they must accept and agree with it.

Basically I have the belief that your mother did not get complete information about bitcoin, so there are still doubts in her heart to invest and so on that is faced by many people regarding doubts about bitcoin. If we live in a country that is not friendly with bitcoin it will be much more difficult to introduce it and even the level of technological progress also indicates how far someone has known bitcoin before. So there is a little picture that they get before we introduce bitcoin to him and I see that bitcoin does not need to be introduced in the investment system first but rather provides education about its journey from the beginning until now.Quote from: Smartgoat on August 27, 2023, 05:45:53 AMthere was a lesson I lean from here. when you are preaching to someone about Bitcoin, you shouldn't talk too much, and you shouldn't stay long and you should also allow them make some research and ask questions about what we are preaching to them, to avoid loss at the end.The approach taken must indeed be adjusted depending on how a person's character is and provide space for them to find out what their abilities are, strengths and risks in bitcoin that must be avoided.
