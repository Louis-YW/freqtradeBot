      "body": "It's indeed a good reason to encourage Bitcoin adoption. I have already faced similar situations too, where the bank forbid me transacting the amount of money I needed to send, even though I had the amount on my banking account. They forced me to wait few days until being able to make the transaction I had to do at once, and as quick as possible.They also create a lot of bureaucracy when you want to start investments through their services. What annoys me the most is when you need to wait several days until they give your account permission to have access to determined features.These are big issues of centralized financial platforms. It's a shame that at the current technological level we have reached, simple permissions still take a long time until being given, and that such limits on transactions are imposed to free and autonomous individuals. But what can we do about that? We can't live transacting only with Bitcoin...",

The governments issues orders on the banks to keep users on track via their incoming and outgoing transactions.They lies using the language \"upgrade of account to account such a huge amount of money\". Why the restrictions of accounts to accommodate as much amount of money? They only wanted you to come in person, enrolls on some data captures so that they could get some new updates about you since you have also increased in the amount of money in your account in other for them to get you whenever they wanted.So, the minimum amount per bank account to accumulate without an upgrade is nonsense.So cares about that in bitcoin? Of course non. So let us keep to appreciate the invention of the decentralization of bitcoin where users are self custody and self moderated of their funds.",

I mean you know that you are transferring a huge amount of money. Why didn't you ask the limits of his bank including the amount of money that he can receive on a daily/monthly/yearly basis? That's being irresponsible on your part. Take note that you're transferring a huge amount of money (huge enough to make an account freeze), so at least put the limits into consideration.Quote from: Familian on July 31, 2024, 08:50:41 PMWhile I was with a feeling of  disappointed I recalled I have been stacking a few unit's of bitcoin in my wallet and have never experienced this crazy shit neither have I heard any bitcoiner make such a lousy complain about bitcoin whatever the amount of bitcoin transfered into their wallet. I don't think there's anyway the fiat system can be compared to bitcoin, the more experiences I encounter the more I see how advanced and greater purposes bitcoin serves.Well, that's the power of decentralization. Nobody can freeze your account (in this case, wallet) even you transfer billions of Bitcoins. The thing about these banks is, they can just freeze your account anytime they wanted to as long as they have seen suspicious transactions on your account. They might saw your transaction as somewhat \"suspicious\" because of the fact that it's a huge one hence, they froze your friend's account.At the end of the day, there are still things that only Bitcoin can do but at the same time, there are also things that only the current fiat system can do.",

That is really an unpleasant experience.what is more often experienced by fiat users today is when making large cash withdrawals, the bank asks for the reason for using the funds. does that happen to banks in your country?people who are increasingly aware of the more efficient use of Bitcoin can certainly compare. Bitcoin's problem may only be the costs that can be very expensive. Bitcoin can be used as a substitute for fiat for better payment for services and goods.",

That is one of the important of bitcoin or blockchain technology. It's unlimited in Bitcoin transaction except in centralised exchange that you didn't complete the whole kyc process.but apart from that Dex is unlimited. Blockchain technology does not only solve the problem of limited transaction but also solve the problem of sending fund across the globe within few minutes. And it is totally effortless compared to traditional banking system which takes a lot of process to help you send fund across the globe. I will say bitcoin is really the best as @retreat may say.",

They can freeze accounts, place restrictions, or even seize funds without any form of restrictions. In some countries, you cannot withdraw or deposit more than a certain amount. Some deposits from outside the country are tracked to check if they are from illicit activities. Sometimes, a bank's KYC procedures can be very complicated and worrisome. But Bitcoin breaks all these barriers because there are no restrictions or regulations that limit the transactions that one can carry out. You are your bank and can operate it the way you want. Bitcoin can be sent and received from any part of the world without any form of surveillance or restrictions. In Bitcoin, you don't need any form of registration or submission of any personal documents. When it comes to freedom to use your funds, Bitcoin is far better than banks.",

I have never heard of such a case in the Bank because of the reason that the amount of money does not match the account. As far as I know, the Bank has never made such a rule and there is no withdrawal limit when you withdraw money from their teller. Unless you use an ATM card, it is true that the withdrawal limit is adjusted to the model of the card we hold. So I don't have the problem like you said and even I have withdrawn money from their teller in large amounts for one process it went well.We always try to compare, but like it or not, banks are still quite necessary and I see bitcoin as another step where it is only for investment matters. When faced with business, I still need a bank to transfer the amount of money needed and that still helps me quite a bit.",

And how many times we say that we are own bank, or BYOB (Be your Own Bank). Unlike banks wherein they can freeze our account or we don't have control as there could be limits on our withdrawal and even if we have a lot of money from them, for sure they are running on fractional reserves. And worst, like this story, Lebanon man hailed hero for holding Beirut bank hostage over savings.QuoteAn armed man who held a bank hostage for more than six hours in Beirut because he could not withdraw savings has been hailed a hero by the public.Banks in Lebanon have put tight rules on how much money people can access, amid a deep economic crisis.You don't want to go that length just to be able to withdraw your money, do you?",
