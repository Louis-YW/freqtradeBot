  "content": "I am a trader who has a shop in one of the major markets in my country. I have always held on to the believe that business is between two physical parties, one wants to buy and the other wants to sell. The buyer sees what he wants, gives money to the seller and the seller delivers the goods to the buyer. The two parties leave happily. Until recently, and before knowing this place I always thought that anything trading or business online is a fraud. I always see them as ponzi and that one day they will make enough money from the people and shutdown, defrauding many people of their hard earned money.I remember a colleague of mine when I used to work before I ventured into business, he used to do forex trading then, he will always encourage me to learn the trade, but I always told him no. Some few years back, I started to look for a new business and some friends began to tell me about bitcoin. I was very skeptical then saying that even if bitcoin is genuine that it's probably one of those online businesses that you will invest all of your money and in an instant you will lose everything.I continued to have that fear until a few months ago when someone sent me the link to this Bitcointalk place, that I decided to try it out. I concluded that it is time for me to put my fear of online investments on hold to see if I can have a better understanding of it and bitcoin. In this few weeks that I have joined this forum it has been a very big eye opener for me. As someone new in this I know I have much to learn, before I start investing, so I don't make mistakes. Although so many things sound strange and confusing to me. And I hope to quicken my process of learning soon enough to start investing and trading like others here. Overcoming that fear of online investments, especially bitcoin is what I'm tackling right now and it is a wonderful experience for me so far. I am learning new things every time I come here and it is a new type of experience for me.Here are some of the things that moved my decision to finally consider studying bitcoin now. Number 1 : The first is I don't have to continue in the shadow of my fear and continue to run away from it. Fear is in the mind and no where else. I have to confront my mind to tackle this. As I'm doing this I also encourage anyone having fear of anything to confront it.2: The second is that I get confused when people around me talked about Bitcoin. I envy them because I see them as intelligent and want to be like them. I also want to be seen as someone who is intelligent and can contribute my views to discussions.3: Thirdly I want to learn how to trade Bitcoin and also get into other online investments.My observation so far in the few weeks that I have spent in bitcointalk, I have noticed that there is willingness by senior members to give directions and corrections to newbies who seek it. I hope to be teaching newbies too one day. Any more advice by members on how to increase my confidence level and learning will be humbly received by me.",

Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency that allows you to purchase and store it in your own digital wallet. By holding Bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet, you become the sole custodian of your funds, acting as your own bank. Based on your post, it appears that you may consider acquiring a hardware wallet, which offers enhanced security for your assets. With a hardware wallet, your funds remain fully secure, and unauthorized access is virtually impossible unless your private keys or seed phrase are compromised. Therefore, apart from the inherent price volatility associated with Bitcoin, there is little to fear when exploring this cryptocurrency.",

Many people may yet approach you for investment but be wise and ask questions. On your own part, there are things you need to do to secure your financial investment like you don't have to compromise your wallet address, keep every password away from third party. Bitcoin is a decentralised digital currency and so you don't need third parties interference. Don't oblige email messages requiring your response or reply when you don't know the sender or not expecting any email. You can check to read more about bitcoin  here",

Your fears of having these ponzi schemes get the best of you have been all that have kept you safe all the while. You could just as well not lose that fear or rather, learn to identify what it is that makes a project a ponzi scheme. Some of its basic features is that, they are referral based and operates a pyramidal scheme.May I remind you although, I feel you already get the picture, the forum isn't some online business but, somewhere you come to learn about cryptocurrency. These you can apply where related and maybe get what you seek out of the knowledge you've acquired.",

Learning is a continuous process, it has no end. Even the most knowledgeable people here still have room to learn. The good thing about the forum is people are always open to to give you guidance. This is the only ranking system I've seen where the rank does not determine how people are treated or respected. One thing I'm sure you already know is that Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme. Only ponzi and other scam investment offer a get rich quick scheme. So just keep doing what you're doing and keep learning. I can only speak for myself and I know how much I've learnt about Bitcoin from this forum. You can join the forum as someone who knows nothing about Bitcoin and with the right mind you'll begin to learn things daily.Also try to carry out research.

This led me here, where I have tried and I know I have grown in the aspect of joining discussions I understand and trying to understand the more ambiguous topics being discussed too.It has been really insightful for me and I know you will get a hang of it sooner than you think. One way I did overcome my fear was by picking out new terms I found confusing and researching them. This opened my mind to the various concept, technicality and strategy of investment or trade or innovation that is ongoing and I better understand the market in that if I decide to begin my trading journey today, I wouldn't be scared to face the risk.",
