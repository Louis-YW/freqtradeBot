But that is the work of blockchain explorers. There is also another one that I do use but not included up there which is https://blockstream.info. If the block is searched for on the blockchain explorer, he will also see what he is looking for there.",

Those coins were created with the block",

It is for Pool distribution.You will have a table of Bitcoin mining pools. Click on a pool, like Foundry USA you will see a list of Bitcoin blocks found by that pool and block hash including the Coinbase transaction.Like this block hash: https://explorer.btc.com/btc/block/0000000000000000000234bb67003ad648f9bb953c9b6d45dd9429bb8651f5d3",
