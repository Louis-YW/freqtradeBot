There may be no private keys so there could be nothing to encrypt.It does not randomly crash - it does crash when finishing rescan, at 100%.I suspect it can be forged wallet, as any wallet cannot have rescan at block 0.

While it says it starts rescanning more or less from the start of the blockchain, the blockhash in the log line \"Rescan started from block 000000000000000000cd74d3024470a4e206096e3a6ce5091bcfae787d5d32df\" belongs to block height 490509 (counting from height 0 for the Genesis block).What happens when your abort the rescan (execute the command \"abortrescan\" in console tab of your Bitcoin-QT)? Does it crash again?If not, you could then try to limit the rescan range with command \"rescanblockchain start end\", where start and end define the block height range to rescan.mapWallet.size() tells the size of the wallet in KiB and only 2 KiB is too small for a key pool size of 100. I wonder why it says it has only 1 address in address book, while with a key pool size of 100, there should be also 100 in address book.But I might be very wrong as I'm no expert for Bitcoin Core interna. I'm currently playing with a wallet full of descriptors and teaching myself.When I had to restore an old wallet from 2014 it didn't work to feed the wallet.dat file into a recent Bitcoin Core version. There are Core versions where the wallet file interna changed in such a way that you can't skip those versions. At least that was my experience. I upgraded Bitcoin Core incrementally and updated the wallet.dat file with every incremental version. This tedious way might not have been necessary, but at least it worked for me.",
