One of the topics mentioned is how technology (=blockchains/DAOs/etc) can change society and the way we think about it.  Not sure if this is reasonable. It's a great financial system but I feel like sometimes people are putting way too much hope in it. https://youtu.be/wqhExnIRLZc",

As it gives people more opportunity to change their life by being rich or poor. Since there's still no guarantee you'll succeed in this industry. If this technology spreads to every people for sure it could also change the society's perspective and a lot might enter the market. Too much hope for you to be rich is not enough, you have to exert effort for you to gain what you want to achieve like studying, experience and emotion.",

It isn't invented to make people rich. You are talking about speculative trading/investing, when you buy SOMETHING and hope it will go up in value, even though most of them are backed up by nothing else then promises, hopium and greed. This could have happened with trading cards. Downside of speculative trading/investing is that it might as well get you rekt. That's pretty much same as gambling.Blockchain tech can change society but it isn't doing that by making people rich.",

At this point I don't know, it will take grace for blockchain to make a enough changes of making the lives of people rich according to OP, except the bulls runs way heavy. But as for impact bitcoin has already the societies but not necessary making them rich but the knowledge.",
