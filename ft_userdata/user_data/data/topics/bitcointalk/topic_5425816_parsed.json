If an investor invests in real estate having used the Fiat currency for such investment, he has a projected gain to make in years to come but this projection is no more than an assumption because there are external and internal factors which can affect his investment; reducing or increasing the projected gains. The analogy therefore is same with cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) investment. Andrew Bailey has been skeptical about Bitcoin.Quote from: Pillsike on December 05, 2022, 09:20:59 AMMyth 3: Crypto is one big scam and ponzi scheme:Honestly I found this funny, do people still think crypto is scam?

This is an interesting approach to some criticisms regarding bitcoin's intrinsic value and purpose. Most outsiders see bitcoin as a long-running massive pyramid scheme where no one sits at the top sadly. The fact of the matter is that it cannot be any farther from the truth as bitcoin's mostly pegged to the dollar and other strong currencies in spirits. The statement regarding the dichotomy between bitcoin and fiat supposing that the former is of no intrinsic value is just stupid to say the least. It has stood the tests of time, more over have made a lot of people even beginning traders profit greatly. If bitcoin doesn't have any value, then so will the fiat currencies that it supports. All in all apart from a couple of creative stretches you've made to make the list sound, I would agree with it.",

Most transactions in real life are now done through cashless transfer of fiat currencies, all means the same thing, the currency used in the transfer is still fiat.Quote from: Pillsike on December 05, 2022, 09:20:59 AMI didn't really understand this point. Is he talking about crypto being based on speculative investments? I'm hoping someone here would explain this better.It is simple, what the article meant is that BTC isn't used by too many people as a currency that it is, but for speculation with the price in order to make return on investment. BTC is volatile, and even though it is useful as a currency, many people do not want to spend it that way, they want to hold it so its price can increase and they then convert it to fiat and make more money.Quote from: Pillsike on December 05, 2022, 09:20:59 AMHonestly I found this funny, do people still think crypto is scam? If it we were still in 2010 then no problem you're right to be skeptical about it. I don't think crypto can even be classified as a Ponzi scheme Most cryptocurrencies are scam and ponzi scheme, or pump and dump cryptos, that is correct, there are so many cryptocurrencies and how many of them do you think have any value or utility. BTC is different from all these other cryptocurrencies because of its usefulness and security, it is neither a scam or ponzi, but the most of the other lot that make up the many cryptos in the network are mostly scams.",

Any asset that has a lot of offer and demand can be used for speculation, so in that sense Fiat and cryptos are much alikeMyth 3: Crypto is one big scam and ponzi schemeFiat is the biggest fraud and the biggest Ponzi ever created but everyone trusts it... so why do we are constantly pledged by inflation??Myth #4: Crypto has no intrinsic valueOf course Bitcoin has intrinsic value. Saying that it doesn't it is the biggest fallacy you can hear. As long as it can be used as a means of exchange it has an intrinsic value. Anything that has utility also has intrinsic value",

Yes i understand most of the news are sponsored news in other to scare away investors and benefits whales. however have it in mind that bitcoin is alternative form of money which can be used as a means of transactions, to buy, sell and do whatever just as fiat is but will not replace fiat definitely you need both.

Crypto is one big scam and Ponzi scheme: I think everyone on here must have heard about this one. This is an old and presently an ongoing propaganda being told to all who would care to listen.
