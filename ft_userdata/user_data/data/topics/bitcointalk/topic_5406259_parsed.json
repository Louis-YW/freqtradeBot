  "content": "Not  really sure where to drop this thread since it's a compendium of gambling and trading as it seeks to make clearer a blur end. Which is.Like the game of chance gambling. Can trading in anyway be likened to gambling and how so?But before you delve in for contributions, let me throw some light below for a better understanding of the idea behind the thread. Example:For when we want to gamble, let say in sport football specifically, we look at certain criteria that aid us to a good bet, such as:1> Head to Head 2> current form of the club and position on the table.3> The strength of the opponent, etc.Likewise in trading before we trade we look as certain measures such as: 1> Market trend and direction 2> The price level, market news and some other criteria too.Now we all know that before going into trading or gambling its advisable to be emotionally stable and to involve a certain sum you're willing to risk etc, all these are similarities shared both in gambling and trading too.With  these few above I think a clear discussion can well surface to clear the air about a likelihood or not.",

Both gambler and trader do take risks for each trade and bet that they take. The key takeaway from this article from Investopedia is a really good comparison of gambling and trading.

      "body": "In gambling, no matter how good you are, underdog can win a strong team, which means there are chances that the bet may go wrong way and result to lose. Gambling is all or none, if you lose, you lose all. Please never quote to post about cashout, I have used it several times without any useful help. In trading, the market may first not favour but later favour, you may be losing before and later profit may come. Nobody can be professional in gambling, we should not deceive ourselves. There are professionals in trading, if indicators and market are well studied and also using low leverage, trading is better.I opned a 1x short position day before yesterday when bitcoin price was $21000, bitcoin got to $22000 and I increased the leverage to 2x, the mark price increase from $21000 to around $21500. I was losing before but the market corrected to the position I opened and I gained. I couldn't see that in gambling. Both are very risky, but for professionals that are both gamblers and traders, they will choose trading.",

I am just hearing about this, what I know sport punters do say and that I do say is that it require analyses which makes it different from other type of gambling, but sport betting is beyond educated guesses, it is also driven by chances. People that gamble often can expatriate more on this. The sport gambling sites make odds in a way it will be hard for anyone that bet often to have a positive net profit, that is why the industry is growing, they are making the money from punters.Quote from: Adbitco on July 14, 2022, 01:13:58 PMBoth are not the same sometimes gambling make it worse if you bet or gamble you stand a chance to either win or lose and that is final your funds can not be recovered on like the trading, in sport trading, you can trade and make some profits or currencies in which you are trading with might lost value (depreciate) and you still have some left behind and can be liken to increase at any given time.

Can you enlighten me about this.In theory, it can be like that, but in real life, it is not. The most dominant type of gambling in my country is football, after checking prediction sites and after making your own analyses, if you gamble more, you will notice losses. There is no perfect thing than to take gambling as fun and never use the amount of money you can not afford to lose to gamble. But the fact remain that professional traders still use more money to trade, especially if they earn profit often, but they will always also still advice people to use the amount of money they can afford to lose to trade because they know it is also risky, especially for beginners, beginner traders always lose and they do not know how to manage risks.",

On those type of gambling, whatever strategy or analyzation you do, you need luck to win.

Can you enlighten me about this.Let's say there's a football match between Liverpool FC and Huddersfield Town (taken from this list)If you would do betting (like in high/low, or maybe roulette) you would maybe bet on Huddersfield Town. But since you do an educated guess and know a bit about football, you'll bet on Liverpool and will probably win. (PS. Educated guess is related to how much you know about that topic, not about general education.)Of course, there's a risk factor there too, but not that big.This is what I was saying.Why included in gambling sites? Because they love to diversify. On the other hand... did you see sports betting in a Vegas casino?",

Looks at the LUNA case where it drops more than -99% of its value. Even if you buy it when it was around $1, the coin still drops down as low as $0.00001. For gambling bets, there were certain games where you can get your money back without losing or winning too. So it isn't like 50 wins: 50 loses odd, either lose your money or win big. If you're irresponsible with your money and invest randomly without any reason then you're gambling with your money.",
