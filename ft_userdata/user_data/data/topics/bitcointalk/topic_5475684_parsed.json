Created following the untimely death of our founders sister who was a lifelong animal advocate and “pet parent” to a dozen rescues, Arm The Animals would serve as a living tribute and means of carrying on a legacy that was ended too soon.Over the past 8+ years, ATA has worked with 150+ animal welfare organizationsproviding donation funds, supplying low-cost website development, graphics and marketing services in order to help other organizations increase their impact.ATA is the epitome of a \"Mom & Pop\" business; everything is done by hand with a small, dedicated team that loves what they do. The company runs like a family business and strives to make a work environment where everyone is happy, stable and motivated.The company founders believe ALL animal welfare organizations are ultimately striving toward the same goal, so providing assistance to them can do nothing but more good.EcosystemWe have created another option to support our charity campaigns.We created the collection with PEPE the Frog and the corresponding MEMES for the animals but also for the reigns.To give owners this absolute \"Feels good\" feeling. Now everyone can identify with the frog.In addition to the other collections for our already known supports, the campaign can now also be used \"Save the Frog\" will benefit from the new collection.With every purchase of the PEPE ANIMAL CLOTHING collection, 15% of the proceeds are guaranteed to go to the respective Non-profit organizations and 10% in the liquidity of the token. This buy back feature will run once a month carried out manually and announced accordingly beforehand on Twitter and Telegram. The tokens thus acquired will thereafter of course burned and thus a continuous growth of the project is guaranteed.https://i.postimg.cc/25zh9g3s/pepe-animal-clothing-pac-token-0x8c420a81786935-DD4-A90ff0-B40083089-Bce1535-C-3-buy-contest-fairlaunch-p.gifPinksale:https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0x1b1451Daeb7D14314EfBA6e4CE965352de4D4932?chain=BSCPresale Start Time   2023.11.29 14:00 (UTC)Presale End Time   2023.12.01 14:00 (UTC)contract:0x8c420a81786935DD4A90ff0B40083089Bce1535Cexplorer:https://bscscan.com/address/0x8c420a81786935dd4a90ff0b40083089bce1535csource code:https://github.com/PepeAnimalClothing/source-code/blob/main/PAC%20codeWhitepaper:https://github.com/PepeAnimalClothing/whitepaper/blob/main/whitepaper-pac-pepe-animal-clothing-0x8c420a81786935DD4A90ff0B40083089Bce1535C.pdfAudit:https://blocksafu.com/audit/0x8c420a81786935DD4A90ff0B40083089Bce1535CTokenomics:https://github.com/PepeAnimalClothing/tokenomics/blob/main/pepe%20clothing%20tikenomics-0x8c420a81786935DD4A90ff0B40083089Bce1535C.pngWebsite:https://www.pepearmtheanimals.comofficial Mail´s:contact@pepearmtheanimals.comsupport@pepearmtheanimals.comhttps://i.postimg.cc/fywZcMDH/pepe-clothing-tikenomics-0x8c420a81786935-DD4-A90ff0-B40083089-Bce1535-C.pngTeamCEO - Benjamin Woodhttps://i.postimg.cc/06yWNX1C/IMG-20231127-155043-866.jpghttps://t.me/benjamin_wood_pachttps://twitter.com/Benjamin_WoodPC?t=7cmGmOewOGRw2jYOla3uQw&s=09https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092746115937https://www.reddit.com/user/PepeclothingCOO - Steffi Deloruhttps://i.postimg.cc/nsWkhHkH/IMG-20231127-155043-796.jpghttps://twitter.com/Steffi_Deloru?t=Ei7IXR95mrBAmN3N0mZzXg&s=09https://t.me/Steffi_DeloruCTO - Tom Richardhttps://i.postimg.cc/JH5ZZmbH/IMG-20231127-155043-823.jpghttps://twitter.com/Tom_Richard_PC?t=Nqu4QYSBA-th6wFEVwAr3g&s=09https://t.me/TomRichard_PCsocials:Twitter:https://x.com/pepeanimalPAC?t=wCnDqojX_CuN3k2vOZd4Fg&s=09Telegram:https://t.me/pepeanimalclothes_Pepegithub:https://github.com/PepeAnimalClothingMedium:https://medium.com/@pepeanimalclothingFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100092445202392Reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/Pepeanimalclothing/Linktree:https://linktr.ee/pepeanimalclothingtiktok:https://www.tiktok.com/@pepeanimalclothes?_t=8hiFxTz6z3p&_r=1Youtube:https://youtube.com/@pepeanimalsclothing?feature=sharedBitcointalk:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3592891;sa=showPostschart:https://pancakeswap.finance/info/tokens/0x8c420a81786935dd4a90ff0b40083089bce1535chttps://pancakeswap.finance/info/pairs/0x6a2579b40bd1546dc0ecb4861f73d797bbc438f0https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/bsc/0x6a2579b40bd1546dc0ecb4861f73d797bbc438f0/https://www.dextools.io/app/en/bnb/pair-explorer/0x6a2579b40bd1546dc0ecb4861f73d797bbc438f0https://poocoin.app/tokens/0x8c420a81786935dd4a90ff0b40083089bce1535chttps://www.dexview.com/bsc/0x8c420a81786935DD4A90ff0B40083089Bce1535Cother links:https://presale.world/crypto-presales/view/bsc/pepe-animal-clothinghttps://www.coingabbar.com/en/crypto-ico-details/pepe-animal-clothing-pac-token-latest-ico-presalehttps://icoholder.com/en/pepe-animal-clothing-1066721https://icolink.com/ico-pepe-animal-clothing.htmlhttps://tokeninsight.com/en/coins/pepe-animal-clothing/overviewhttps://www.livecoinwatch.com/price/PEPEANIMALCLOTHING-___PAChttps://coinranking.com/coin/tAfrp2Ll6+pepeanimalclothing-pachttps://coincheckup.com/coins/pepe-animal-clothinghttps://coincodex.com/crypto/pepe-animal-clothing/https://i.postimg.cc/P5M7D1Pk/IMG-20231127-155048-628.jpg",
