I hope we can all meet again with the month of Ramadan next year.Eid Mubarak to all the Muslim faithful and the entire bitcointalk community. It was indeed a blessed month of Ramadan and I am happy to be alive to see this year's Salah. But I am saddened by the war in Sudan. The war has affected the country that the end of Ramadan and the Salah celebration turned into a time of mourning and sorrow.Instead of pursuing the path of peace Generals Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo have been blinded by the quest for power. This struggle has led to the injury and death of many faithful and millions are now homeless and have no access to water and food. We must keep praying for the mercy of God on Sudan so that negotiation and compromise should lead to peace and stability.",
