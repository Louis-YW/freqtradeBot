Social media has its own positive side, but I believe some persons use it negatively, you can spend precious hour's on social media without knowing how far you've gone. This are precious lost times that cannot be regained.  So let's learn how to be focused on goals and not be distracted.",

Social media is the number one global time waster among youths and others.

Yeah, for someone like yourself @OP and very much me, it's  a typical waste of my time but there are those who don't see it that way. Besides, they've got such hours to spare and one can't go about working or being engaging in what would earn him money all through life. There is room for relaxation, amusement, fun, hubbies and whatever is out there and some of that, you ca find on social media.The bulk of time spent there by some users could be due to building a channe that could be used in some active communication which could benefit them. That way, you just might not be wasting some good quality time.When it is otherwise, when you come to surf the social media without a goal and you end up spending hours of your time, you just might be doing it completely wrong.",

I can only say that it can be reduced to a bare minimum but not completely stopped. Those who have experienced this type of scenario are mostly unproductive and could spend the entire day on social media viewing and following other people's success and trends. In my opinion, such people require total rehabilitation.",

Unfortunately, it's not easy to contain yourself from overusing social media; I continuously catch myself killing way too much time on them. One of my largest regrets is not taking advantage of the free time I had during the Covid-19 quarantines. Free time was almost infinite, and I spent most of it watching TV series and movies when I could have started learning a new foreign language or taking up a hobby. The most productive thing I did was rejoin BitcoinTalk and cryptocurrencies, and I'm thankful for it.",

Social networks, bitcoin... all are man-made products, and you use them for what you decide, it's useless to you, doesn't mean it's useless to others.
