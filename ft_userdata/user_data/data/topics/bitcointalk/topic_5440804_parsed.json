As a matter of fact, day traders are akin to tightrope walkers. These individuals must be able to deal with high trading costs, a volatile market, regulatory risks, and other unpredictability.

If you are the type that trade with $1000 or lower amount, the trading fee is not high. Trading fee is on percentage, and on the exchanges that I have used, it is around 0.01% to 0.05%. but trading with huge amount of money, the higher the fee.Regulation is not a problem for some people because they do not see providing their identity document for verification purpose to be a problem, but there are still some no KYC exchanges, they are centralized though.Current list of exchanges without KYCAlthough I only have more confidence on Kucoin.Unpredictability like exchange hack and data breach are the main problem for crypto traders.Some traders can trade using decentralized exchange which I have seen before on exchanges like PancakeSwap which you can go up to 200x leverage, but I have not used a decentralized exchange like that to trade before, so I do not know the risk involved.Quote from: Davidvictorson on February 22, 2023, 08:39:43 AMAs a day trader, how would you describe yourself? Are you risk-seeking or risk-averse?All I have known is that trading is not easy, it can be a means people can lose what they have earned. The best is to trade in the trend direction and having more long term trades like swing trading can be the best, or even just hold. Some people want to scalp or day trade, but losses chased them to be a swing traders or holder.In day trading, I have noticed one thing, that you need to use the amount of money you can afford to lose, do not see it s a means of making money until it turns out to be like that for you naturally, because thinking like that can get you to an extent of you seeing trading as risky as gambling because naturally it is.",

And if the market conditions are uncertain, I prefer not to trade for a while and will watch the market movement to find my way into the market. But if the market situation reverses in the middle of my trading and I get stuck in that situation, I will hold on and not continue trading because it will not be good for me. I can't afford to take too big risks, especially since my capital for trading isn't that big either. So playing it safe would be better for me.",

We can't avoid any risk, maybe if you don't want to get the risk of trading stop trading. If you are trading then you must be disciplined, technical and fundamental. That applies to day trading or other types of trading. Actually, the type of trading is just an adjustment to everyone's comfort. So the term day trading, weekly or long-term trading appears. You should not insist on overwhelming all because it will only make your trading not optimal. So I trade on the basis of a sense of comfort and with the risks that are always there. So I always approach the risk in trading.",

Actually, the type of trading is just an adjustment to everyone's comfort. That's what this whole discussion is about. Everyone has their own customization of the type of trading they are good at. The types of trading that exist are actually based on different strategies and goals. Some are more suitable for short-term traders, while others are more suitable for long-term traders, and there are trading types that emphasize technical or fundamental analysis, as well as those that rely on risk and capital management. Each type of trading has its own advantages and disadvantages, and traders should choose the type of trading that best suits their goals and strategies.Quote from: Luzin on February 22, 2023, 10:34:59 AMSo the term day trading, weekly or long-term trading appears.

So I always approach the risk in trading. Finding the right type of trading will certainly be more comfortable and better at trading, can minimize losses and know the risk limits that will occur. Never impose a strategy that is actually not suitable for yourself, but if you want to learn it, then use a stop loss and do management properly.",

For newbies who are just trying to get some profits or learn about trading, they can kickstart with day trading to see how the market works and how constantly everything do change.

Back when I was a newbie day trader, I had a bit of a daredevil streak in me. I was so thristy to make bank that I frequently brushed off the risks and went all-out. Clearly, that wasnt a smart move, and I discovred that the hard way. One time, while tradin the futures market, I got cocky about my position. The market was goin against me, but I kept slappin more and more contracts onto my losing position, believin it would eventually turn around. It didn't, and I wound up losing a small chunk of cash. Since then, I've become more risk-shy and learned to handl my trades with more caution. Yet, I still think that havin a sense of humor is key for any trader. It helps me keep my cool, even durin the most nerve-racking moments, and not take stuff too seriouss. I mean, if you cant clown on yourself, then who can you clown on, right?",

A day trader can open a position and his analysis may favour in few minutes to just one or two hours, normally that is scalping if he close the trade, but still he is still a day trader. It is hard to differentiate between a day trader and scalpers at times because day trader may scalp while scalpers may leave a thread for a long time than minutes and hours just like day traders.",

Not just on trading actually but in everything that we do, we only need to be calm so that we can perform the task better than compared to when we are rushing because mistakes can often come there.
