I am not sure if it will get back anywhere near its all time high again but if it was to only get back to £100 that is a 20x from current price.

Even a £50 price would be a 10x which would be great considering you would only have to wait a year or so to see this return if it does well in the bull run next year.",

It looks attractive but it is safer if you wait till before Bitcoin halving in 2024 to start buying altcoins like ICP. During a bear market, many bad things can happen and you can not control. In bull market, it is safer to buy altcoins.Don't chase for x100 profit from $5 as your entry price. You can wait till 2024 and buy ICP around $10 or even higher but it is safer and you can expect profit like x3 x5. Honestly, when you chase for x100 profit, you will probably take big risk.",

Is anyone invested or know anything about ICP and if its worth it? If i remember correctly, then ICP had a very successful investment round in which they have raised 195 million $. Then they also did a pretty big airdrop bag then. I also got a few (i think 28 or something like that), ICP from that airdrop. So it is definitely a big project that still should have more than enough financial reserves to keep developing for many years even if we are in a bear market for a few years longer.If you buy a few ICP now and hold it for some time, then i think you can definitely make a profit with it. I don't know though if ICP will be able to outperform the market as a whole. Like i said, they had a very successful seed sale so those very big investors are holding a huge amount of tokens and if a certain price level is reached i think they will sell off a part of their holdings.",

If I were you, I would increase the accumulation of coins or tokens that have stronger fundamentals, such as assets that are in the top 15 of CMC.",

Sincere advice, if you are considering investing in altcoins other than ETH or BNB, then it's best not to reinvest in old altcoins. Find yourself new and more potential altcoins. The altcoin market is a constant replacement market after each bear season, and I also believe that new projects will replace the top altcoins in 2021 in the next bull season.",

It is still not suitable for anyone to invest unless the team delivers what the promised. I won't recommend it. Back in those days after BTC has a promising high than a shot low, this project came up. Since then their is zero development as this project is too old for 2023.

It's all over the place without a focus, and that makes me think that devs themselves didn't even know what they want to build. And i really don't think that general all-purpose blockchain is a good idea. I rather see a focus in a problem it solves.As an investment, i can't say if it's a profitable or not. I guess that depends on the fact that if i am wrong or not. As a disclaimer: i was wrong about eth when it was still $12",

Is anyone invested or know anything about ICP and if its worth it? If I remember correctly, after the coin was listed on the BINANCE floor, its value continuously decreased from the peak of $ 450, and now its price level is around $ 5 or $6. Is it worth investing in a coin that was once in the top 10 but whose value has dropped by nearly 100 times? Above all, this coin has been entangled in drama with suspected signs of breaking the law (due to being deceived on the island due to ICP dumping), and I found that their developers also did not keep their promises, implementing what they said. Instead of choosing it, you can look at some of the new projects that came out this year because they are much better than ICP.",

Most altcoins have lost about 95% in their value since the last bull market, and ICP is no exception. And I am skeptical that they will restore their value to the level of the past ATH. But if we take more modest goals, then we can assume that in the next bull market, the value of ICP will be able to increase to x20.",

It costs a lot of time to plot and start to mine this coin but without mining pools, a single small miner will gain nothing from spent cost for equipment, electricity, etc.At least it holds its price better than ICP.",
