After halving, what is the motivation to let more and more power to come into mining BTC?The motivation? To make money.More efficient gear will get you more hashrate for the same power costs while also driving up the difficulty. That is how the system works. Some miners with older gear that is less efficient or miners with more expensive power will drop off. Will others take their place is the question. And that will not be known for a while.Also, there are people with deep pockets who are speculating. Loosing some money today thinking that BTC will 2x in price will also keep people mining or bing in new miners.-Dave",

After halving, what is the motivation to let more and more power to come into mining BTC? That's not the right time to make people realise that mining can be profitable especially when after halving BTc performance was not upto the benchmark that most of the people had set for it.Now people are more attracted to meme coins because of their capability to given sudden and huge profits. So in these situations its better to stay quiet and wait for the market correction before saying anything.",

It's less than three days into the adjustment, and things can change petty fast, we had 156 blocks in the last 24 hours but an insane 171 blocks in the previous 24-48 hours interval, that pace was 18% up, it's clearly because of luck, not actual gear.Quote from: God bless u on May 25, 2024, 10:46:11 AMNow people are more attracted to meme coins because of their capability to given sudden and huge profits.

After halving, what is the motivation to let more and more power to come into mining BTC?The Bitoin's market price is the motivation for the distribution of the Supply and the immense demand in the future. The main point will be the supply and demand ratio which will determine the market valuation and the surge in the market value will be the motivation for the winners to put more investment into mining Bitcoin.Not always does the market hash rate increase in the bear market always there is a significant decrease in the hash rate. Not always we can buy the Bitcoins from the market mining can be highly profitable with the gas fees and block mining rewards in the bull market you can makesignificant accumulation there.",

Mining has conditions that have to be considered which is dependent on where you live, how much you can get electricity and how easily you can get equipments. If the odds are stacked up against you; buying and hodling is more straight forward and does not have any surprises that can affect your earnings.",

At the moment if you don’t hold a very large amount of funds setting a mining rig to mine bitcoin to me wouldn’t be that profitable, i will definitely just buy bitcoin and hodl for long",

After halving, what is the motivation to let more and more power to come into mining BTC?Same motivation as always. All miners are competing with all other miners to earn more bitcoin. Only way to do that is increase your hash power. Halving doesn't change anything about that. Halving might kick out the least efficient miners, that's it. Of course hashrate is going to increase.",

Passion for mining/adventure2. Possibility of hitting a jackpot. I think you have heard cases of miners ripping big.3. Taxes? Some countries probably don't have a tax framework for mined crypto.4. The purchased mining gear still remains your asset as it helps you to mint more coins. Can be sold off at any time to recoup some of the funds.5. Somebody has got to do it. You can't all be traders, other people will choose to be miners, brokers etc.",

Halving does not relate to blockchain difficulty that can remain the same if there is no new demands from current miners to expand their mining farms or newbie miners who exposed to Bitcoin because of news on media about Bitcoin and its halving, then decided to join Bitcoin mining industry after the halving.Difficulty increases when the network hashrate increases and it's more like one of consequences of Bitcoin network hashrate growth.",
