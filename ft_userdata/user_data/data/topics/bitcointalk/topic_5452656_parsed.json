  "content": "Hi, I need to exchange some USDC polygons for BTC, I normally use Binance for exchanging. But Binance withdrawal fee is now 0.001 BTC which is too much for a little amount. Can someone suggest to me some exchangers which charge low and I can change it quickly? The exchanger must be trusted. Thank you in advance.",

I used this service. Quite easy, simple, and faster with less fees. To be honest I really did not know PNNV has the exchanger/swap services. I knew this only for live crypto price monitors. Even I can not find and hyperlink on the Landing page from where people can go https://pnnv.com/exchange, The pnnv team should highlight their swap service URL so that people can easily find out it.You guys still can share some other trusted swap services with less fees, so that other people also can use them once they will need it like me.

      "body": "Looks like many people are having the same problem as the OP. And Binance apparently hasn't lowered the withdrawal fees for Bitcoin. Because some time ago I was also looking for the same solution on this matter.But I found fees on Mexc at least 66% lower than on Binance ie on Mexc BTC withdrawal fee is only 0.0003. But the cheapest is still held by OKX cause there is a withdrawal fee for BTC-Lightning and it's even free. And for ordinary BTC withdrawals normally it is also only 0.00011. So I started accumulating Bitcoin from OKX. At first I changed the stable coin I had on Binance to TRX and then sent it to OKX. So with this step I save more on shipping costs. because the TRX shipping fee is only 1 trx. It was only then that I changed my trx to a stable coin on OKX and started buying bitcoins there and withdrawing them to my Wallet when finished.",

At the moment he can't use FixedFloat from USDC Polygons, its network is temporarily suspended for maintenance. Btw Bitcoin transactions are repaired but USDC polys have problem.One trick that I can teach you is to visit bestchange.com and choose the coin you Give and choose what you want to Get. I did that for you and here is the list of exchanges with their rates, click on the image to go on actual Bestchange page where you'll see this ready list:It's not in the list but another option for instant exchange is to use Easybit.com. Keep in mind that spend specific amount of USDC, sometimes their system doesn't detect if you spend more or less than expected and in this case you have to contact their support.",

You never know when your fund will be frozen and ask you submit KYC. Here's pnnv offering better service. PNNV is also using changelly (possibly) and it's also listed on bestchange. But if they ask for KYC, it will be handled by pnnv itself as they mentioned. So, we aren't required to go through KYC. Afaik, PNNV owner (agentF) has KYC submitted with changelly. That's the advantage with pnnv.",
