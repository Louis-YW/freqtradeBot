If that so then I will not suggest this to anyone because of so many scammers before who also offer the same deal. Anyway, if you are winning with your futures strategy, then why there’s a need to look for a partnership? Futures is very risky, and if you let someone to manage your portfolio then that could be more risky for you.",

If your making much returns on your trading, while convincing someone or in pursuit to persuade me do something so desperately. Any trader that feels he or she is capable to stand fully balance in the market, should also remember that there's always a bad day for all traders. That bad day doesn't come or happen to all traders at the same time, rather it selects days for each traders and investors, always look forward to always overcome the bad and sad days with gigantic profits.",

Do you know why? because first, you only created this account yesterday, and you're going to have a hard time gaining anyone's trust here. Second, the service you offer is the signal you give on this matter I really doubt, what your up to is for the money only, that's the truth. Isn't you entered the wrong forum platform dud? Also, Future trading is not advisable for newbies in cryptocurrency, because it's a bit confusing to do compared to spot trading, which is fine even for newbies because it's easy to understand anyway, it's just based on my knowledge dude.",

You can use other exchanges to be able to start as a lead trader, if your activity in trading is good there will be traders who follow you, the advantage is that you will get profit sharing, but before that you have to build your account properly so that the total ROI and Win Rate are good will attract many users to follow you.Because what you say here doesn't prove anything other than numbers without evidence.",

It’s either he will sell his signal or do a commission based on the profit user have on his signal. I saw this kind of scheme on telegram about random guy offering signal service which charge customer a membership fee or commission on there futures trading.Also he is providing a literal future trading because his target price is the all time high while he didn’t provide leverage multiplier on his call. Definitely this is just a spot trading with a target future price.",
