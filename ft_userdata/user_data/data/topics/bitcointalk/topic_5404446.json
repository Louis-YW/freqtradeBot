I don't think any company has yet taken an initiative to include bitcoin or crypto wallet into a closely guided voice or braille system so thay physically challenged people can use it. The market size of cryptos is very limited. So crypto education is good. But if someone is struggling financially, it makes no sense for them to invest into crypto because of the volatility. It will make them financially vulnerable.",

Crypto investment is stressful and they don’t deserve that kind of life. I know that your intention is to help them but most them usually don’t care and just being swayed by sweet words of return that’s why they become interested.Even normal that invest Bitcoin sometimes turn there life miserable so what’s more for these people that needs special care?I'm one of those physically challenged and don't have a stable source of income. But that doesn't mean we will only be interested in cryptocurrencies just because of its increasing value over the years. As for myself, I'm into crypto because of its huge innovation in financial system. People like me find it difficult to have our own bank account because they need many requirements like proof of income etc. so bitcoin was a great help to save some money on my own when it's possible for me to earn sometimes from freelancing.",

They can do jobs that pay in Bitcoin.  Financially challenged people do not need to invest in crypto with their money.  They can find jobs that fit them online and get paid with cryptocurrency.  It is there where crypto education comes in.Physically challenged people, I believe are not exempted from Bitcoin.  There are apps and programs develop for visually impaired people.  Deaf and Mute shouldn't have a problem dealing with Bitcoin transactions.  Bitcoin embraces everyone who is willing to pay or work to have it, and being physically challenged should not be a barrier to participating in the cryptocurrency industry.",

CIt's called a physical disability, and despite what some might think there are a lot of persons with such actively working, not on apr with persons without but still pretty high:Quoteat European Union (EU) level, only 50.6 % of persons with disabilities are employed, compared to 74.8 % of persons without disabilities.",

Well, it may not be a matter of right, but I agree that they should also be given access to Bitcoin and enjoy its benefits despite their challenges. But I must admit that they'll probably be having a hard time especially the blind and the dumb. The deaf and the mute can easily make use of Bitcoin, though. In general, however, while there are laws especially made for this particular sector, many of which are like lip service, at least as far as my actual observations are concerned.",

That would not only harm bitcoin itself but also harm the financial situation of the person in question. And at what point do we start drawing lines and where do we draw them?
