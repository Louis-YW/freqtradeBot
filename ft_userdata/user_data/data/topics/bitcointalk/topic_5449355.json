The reason why they do not allow plagiarism is that it would also affect the forum in the future sample if Google detected that there are lots of plagiarism on this forum then they penalize all content/posts that were recently indexed, will be removed from the SERP or the forum will be banned for indexing any content to Google.",

Specifically, I would like to address the following questions:What qualifies as plagiarism on the forum?Copying part or all of someone's writing without acknowledging that the work doesn't belong to you by referencing it. It is like claiming that a piece of information belongs to you while you copied it from somewhere.QuoteWhat are the consequences for violating the plagiarism rule?The punishment for plagiarism is a permanent ban. You will not be able to post on the forum or create another account except it is for the appeal of the ban. The forum bans individuals and not accounts so if you create another account after a ban, it is called ban evasion.QuoteHow can users ensure that their posts are original and do not violate the plagiarism rule?Creative thinking and inspiration are the birthplaces of originality. The forum promotes originality but you don't necessarily need to only post your ideas, just ensure you quote or reference the source of your information and that will be fine.QuoteAre there any exceptions or nuances to the plagiarism rule that users should be aware of?Plagiarism cases and handled differently by moderators. But the best exception is to avoid plagiarism.",
