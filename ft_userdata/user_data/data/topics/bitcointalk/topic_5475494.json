Someone who has all this challenges you mentioned should be thinking about stacking bitcoins. A gambling addict who is trying to quit should avoid investing in bitcoin by all means because he might likened bitcoin investments to gambling and we know how that goes. Eventually you start to search for coins that can give you x5 your capital. Same thing applies to a person who can barely make ends meet, they will definitely see bitcoin as a get rich quick scheme and ultimately make mistakes that may cost them their investment.",

If you manage to even invest in Bitcoin without making provision for these things, there is no guarantee that you can hold those precious coins. I usually advice anyone interested in accumulating Bitcoin to first of all get a good cashflow that can support his needs, then investment can be made. We can say it is a privilege to invest in Bitcoin because many things about life itself are privileges and not right. Those who have the means can enjoy the privilege and those who doesn't need to work smarter to be able to.",

Even investing a small amount several years back could yield significant returns today.  There is no guarantee history will repeat itself down the road, but then again, whos to say it wont?

They'll never get able to succeed with that because the impractice of handling money is on them.So even if they try hard to accumulate sats, they'll just get bored because of their debts that are unpaid and the addiction in gambling or any other vices that they have.

Many traditional investments like bank deposits or real estate only go up and up, so if you put money in them you can reliably pull them out at any moment if you have an emergency. But with Bitcoin's volatility you might be forced to take a loss, sometimes a very significant loss if you bought during the bull run and the price crashed in the end. Bitcoin is only a great investment for those who can afford to not touch the money they invested in Bitcoin for as long as necessary to see the profits, sometimes for many years.",

For this set of people investing in Bitcoin is a luxury or a big dream. My position comes from my personal experience and what I see around me. There was a time when I was in a bad place - no job, mad debt, barely scrapin' by to eat and keep the lights on.  But I never asked for a handout or nothin.  I knew I had to pull myself up by my bootstraps.  And before you think I'm from someplace with a boomin' economy, I ain't.  Even so no matter where you are, you gotta find opportunities and just hustle harder and  when youre down bad, you do what you gotta do, whether it's collectin' cans or mowin' lawns.  Nothin wrong with hard work to feed yourself and get by.  Bit by bit anyone can climb outta whatever financial hole they fall into if they put their nose to the grindstone.  It ain't easy, but it's gotta get done.There's definitely parts of the world where folks are going hungry and even dying from tough money situations.  I'm not trying to deny that.  But that's not what were even talking about here.  People dealing with that level of hardship probably don't have internet access or technology, let alone access to Bitcoin and  what I'm getting at is, the places where Bitcoin stands to make the biggest difference right now are more developed areas grappling with high inflation rates and crashing currencies - countries like Argentina, Venezuela or Turkey... or some countries of the African continent, such as Ghana or Zimbabwe.  Your average resident there likely does have some form of internet and a smartphone.  So they're in a position to potentially leverage Bitcoin to shield their savings from rapid inflation thats destroying the value of their domestic currency.",

It's not everyone that has the patience to hodl and there can be matters that will warrant you use that funds to settle them .Some people have misunderstood that concept and as such have taken money set for something else to invest, and what if the market isn't favorable?
