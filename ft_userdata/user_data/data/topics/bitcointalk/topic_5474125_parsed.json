But your screenshots are totally blurry so I think you should take them again and then share it again.Second about you question so keep in mind the crypto market is highly volatile and and prices can fluctuate rapidly. It is possible that the price of XRP dipped below your stop limit of 0.6263 triggering the automatic sell order. By the time the order was executed the price had already rebounded to 0.6298.Not even Mexc I have experienced it in Binance and kucoin too. So don't worry this is a common thing particularly in crypto market.",

Sometimes due to high volatility we will not be given times to observe properly and 1%-3% change in price occur in very short time and your stop loss/limit buying will hit in no time. Yesterday btc dumps little, due to which all altcoins including XRP price down in fast speed. I think this limit hit at that time.",

Did you take it from MEXC or from Trading view?Sometimes it happens on exchanges and they will have many reasons to say sorry about that like price is just not displayed correctly, whatever reason. As a small user, you will not go hard to bring them to court and lawsuit so make sure you won't use leverage and lose money on centralized exchanges.",

You may use market order and think that it is limit order. Make a trade like that again and use little amount of money. You can also contact Mexc customer care to find out what happened.But I think the mistake will be from you.",

But I think you have only seen in some cents. As crypto is almost volatile so we cannot do anything if these prices fluctuates and changes in other prices. Same thing happens to me as mostly when I try to change the price of the  coin.When I put a limit order then it had given me a loss even due to the fluctuation of prices. So, leave it if you can and better luck next time to watch through the coins when you have enough time.",

A trend is a friend, with Spot trading.If it is a position in Margin, Futures, it will trigger very terrible loss. Liquidation will almost eat up major part of collateral so that it's hard to buy again and enjoy profit even the trend will continue to be bullish.With small users, no way to complain and get money back. Their voices, complains through support tickets will be void and small users have no money to bring those cases to the court. Exchanges with too many 'bugs' like this will gradually self harm their reputation and they will lose customers with time. Many years ago, Poloniex lost their users this way to Bittrex then Binance in 2017.",

      "body": "As most of the members pointed out above this is a common type of error due to severe market fluctuations, the price may have reached the point where the stop loss order was executed instantly and then went back up.Perhaps the reason why the price at which it was executed is not clear on the chart is either because the time interval is too small to notice (it is possible that there is only one order), or there is a technical defect in the chart that did not cause the price to appear even though the order was executed.Another possibility is that you are not using a price chart to exchange MEXC in which case the price at which the order was executed will not appear on the chart.",

So The Mexc trading platform needs to change the way the History is displayed as it would confuse a lot of new traders.It's not only on Mexc, it's also applied on almost all exchanges. The reason (imo), it is not possible to put executed dates in one field. Your orders may not be filled all at once, especially in large quantities, trading bots usually play with lots of small amount orders.",
