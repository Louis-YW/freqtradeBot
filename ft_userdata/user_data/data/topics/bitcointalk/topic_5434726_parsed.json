  "content": "I was thinking to write about my journey with Type-2 Diabetes but didn't knew where to post it until I read yahoo62278 post My story and where it is now..... It was start of 2021, when I was accidentally diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. My Hba1c (a blood test that gives average profile of your blood sugar over three months) comes out to be 9. At that time I was not feeling any symptoms of Diabetes except the frequent night urination, which I was ignoring.I went to the doctor and he advised me Metformin twice a day. My only question was, \"can I get rid of this disease?\". The answer was NO. I went to second, third and forth doctor and all said take Metformin and there is no way you will ever get rid of this disease.I started taking Metformin and with that my Blood Pressure also start going up. I went back to doctor and he said take medicine of Blood pressure also. This was really surprising and worrying for me that I am diagnosed with Diabetes and I have to take medicine for both Sugar and Blood pressure.One day I was in this tension in office when one senior guy in my office said to me, don't take any medicine for Diabetes. This just struck in my mind.From that day I stopped taking Metformin. I started learning what is blood sugar (and Diabetes) and how it is controlled by body and medicines . Though majority of doctor says it can be controlled with diet, exercise and medicine (the billion dollar pharma industry), there are few that advocates it can be controlled with diet and exercise only. One such doctor on Youtube is Jason fung. Meanwhile I was also able to find a doctor in my city that told me that I got Diabetes because of obesity and he advised me intermittent fasting along with few medicines (I didn't took the prescribed medicine) but followed intermittent fasting. With dietary precautions my Hba1C come down from 9 to 6.6 in just 2 months.I wont take much of your time and comes to main point which is Blood Sugar is not a chronic progressive disease rather it can be controlled by changing life style only. Limit your daily carbs intake and you will see how your Diabetes values are going down. I take tea along with 2 boil eggs in morning, I have my lunch and dinner that has very limited carbs. Other then that I don't eat bakery items, junk food (like pizza, soft drinks) etc. I lost 23 kg in my first three months of diabetes diagnose and since then I am maintaining my weight through diet and exercise.My Hba1c these days is around 5.6. My doctor says its fine, as long as I wont let it go up.Key Point which I want to highlight. Have your blood sugar and Blood pressure checked at least twice a year and if you can go through a complete body scan its a bonus. I started this thread to share my story about how I am controlling my blood sugar with diet only. The sole motive is to tell people suffering with this disease that its something that can be controlled through diet only. If you have any thing to ask you can write here I will try my best to answer it and you can also contribute by sharing your experience.",

Its easy to control blood sugar, if you are prediabetic since your beta cells are not completely gone. People with T2 diabetes think that if they are taking medicine then they are free to eat everything, which is not true. Even if you are on medicine you have to take care of your diet.",

Probably an occasion that you will eat something sweet. But this can easily be solved with control, so it's really up to you.The best way to check progress is by monitoring blood sugar levels regularly.

He has had to make changes to his diet, cutting out sugary and processed foods, and increasing his intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. He also had to start exercising regularly, aiming for at least 30 minutes of physical activity each day. In addition to lifestyle changes, my father has also had to start taking medication to help manage his diabetes. He has been using insulin injections and oral medications to control his blood sugar levels. With the help of his healthcare team, he has been able to adjust his medications as needed to find the right balance for his body.Managing diabetes is not easy, and there are still days when he struggles. But, he is determined to take control of his health and live a long and healthy life. My father's experience with type-2 diabetes has taught me the importance of self-care and self-management. He has shown me that with the right mindset and the support of loved ones, anyone can successfully manage their diabetes and lead a full and satisfying life.",

Everywhere there are indicators of normal weight for height and age, and if your weight exceeds these values, then there is probably a health disorder.Type 2 diabetes just happens in obese people, and it is very strange not to notice your excess weight. Diet and the restriction of food after 6 p.m., as well as the complete absence of sugar or its restriction to a minimum, provide some insurance against this insidious disease. But people remember their health only when they have pain, as a signal that something is wrong.High cholesterol, and as a result, high blood pressure, are always waiting for fast food lovers. It is rather strange that knowing all the ways to maintain their health, people are still \"fighting\" how to destroy it by using soda and fast food. It can be seen in this way that states are freed from stupid people by allowing such a business, as well as developing the pharmaceutical industry.",

It is similar to saying that only overweight people experience cardiac arrest or that only smokers contract lung cancer. It is not accurate and oversimplifies the issue. While it is certainly a contributing factor, there are other factors to consider such as genetics, family history, as certain genetic predispositions can increase the likelihood of developing the condition. Additionally, age and race also play a role, as people of certain ethnicities are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, and the risk increases as one gets older. If anything, from my personal experience, I can confidently say that my father never struggled with weight issues, in fact, he led a very active lifestyle and was quite athletic throughout his life. It is safe to say that obesity was never an issue for him.",
