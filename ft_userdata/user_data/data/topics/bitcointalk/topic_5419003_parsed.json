What is impressive is that it has been listed on some major exchanges like crypto.com, okex or kucoin. Investing in memes is not bad, just keep in mind that the higher the return, the higher the risk, as for the potential of the meme, I think no one can predict it because it has no utility or usecase, the meme is only pumped and dumped, so you guys should research and make your own decision.",

Anyone else invested or know anything about Dogelon Mars and what levels it could reach next bull run?I don't invest to meme coins. I have my feeling that they're no longer going to be a thing in the next years. But if you insists and you like investing there, that's your decision that you may regret or may be happy with the result.Investing into that coin is like a gamble.I mean, almost every investment is a gamble so, invest with money that you're fairly okay to have it there and it sit it around for a long time if it's not making you profit.",

I will start to DCA into it now and hopefully it goes lower for a while before it shoots up in price. I will not invest much but in something like this you don’t have to, you just hope one day it shoots up in price and if it does I can then use the profit to invest into safer crypto.",

Are names of meme coins now limited to Doge, Shiba, Elon, or other dogs?  Another meme coin that has a zillion supply. I advise you to be careful with this type of investment, they are always prone to scams or rug pulls even though they are listed in premium exchanges.Just like Shiba and Doge, buy and sell could be profitable but it may not be worth holding a long time to avoid being rekt.",

I just know that if this dogelon was a garbage token. What you have been saying above was actually BS. Since when this meme token linked to the doge coin? it has nothing to do with doge coin.",

It's hard to speculate on this one since it dropped -98% from its ATH and for sure there are just whales that tries to manipulate the market and that they can dump it on retailers. This is the way even before and I wouldn't be surprised if someone called crypto is just a scam if the market gets in turmoil again with this dead cat bounce.",

You may have a point in what you said that you may have a higher chance of earning more with dogelon compared to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu.And it's good that you know the risk you're going to take if you want to invest in Dogelon, although I also found out that the coin is already around 16-17M$ from what I can see on coinmarketcap. the cycle of his volume in one day, which after all is not bad either.I've been wondering if I'll take the gamble of investing here in Dogelon like you. But even so, we should always be careful. Buy what we can afford to lose.",

I suspect that you are one of the weak hands who regret buying a coin when it was cheap but when its price falls would also not buy for feeling too fearful that it might continue to fall. Dogelon Mars is a wrong investment. By the name itself it is very clear that it is nothing but a meme coin trying to take advantage of another meme coin.",

And even if that doesn't happen, at least you have followed your intuition and I think you must have your own analysis in determining the choice of coins.But it would be even better if you could analyze it more deeply so that you really know whether to keep investing in Dogelon Mars or look for other coins.

And then suddenly it was copied up to this day.But I guess for me, they are going to fail.I mean the rule of thumb here is who got to be the first one, Bitcoin did it, Axie did it and then we have Doge. So I don't see this coin being the next big thing or at least a good investment. Sorry to burst the bubble here.",
