  "content": "The intention of this discussion is to put together random tips from qualified users (Full Members - Legendary) tips that were useful to them in their growth, and can be beneficial to newbies here, to facilitate their growth and to help guide them in establishing themselves as useful and important members of this forum.PS- Newbies and members are not expected to share any tip but can only make comments and ask questions for clarity. Some of my tips are;-Adopt the habit of revisiting a topic that you started for the purpose of wanting to get knowledge. Say for instance you ask a question make sure to come back and drop a response whether you are satisfied with the answers you have gotten or you are not.-Develop consistency; as a new forum member it is expected that you post regularly say even one post a day and slowly build up the number from there. Posting occasionally like this week and then nobody sees you for like 2 weeks and then you come back in 3 weeks time doesn't speak well of you.-As a newbie you should a more for visibility so going to post in threads with over Eight pages of response already is pointless (with the exception of some mega threads), A new forum member should ensure that he is always among the first say 50 users here to share opinions on topics constructively. It goes on but I will love to give the more experienced users here the opportunity to air their opinions and share their tips, Please add your contribution as a guide to new members",

In that topic, you can find a lot of useful observations that will help every beginner to better fit into the forum and start in the right direction from the beginning.Some annoying things that beginners do (but also some old members)Quote from: Rruchi man on July 31, 2022, 07:43:36 AM-Adopt the habit of revisiting a topic that you started for the purpose of wanting to get knowledge. Say for instance you ask a question make sure to come back and drop a response whether you are satisfied with the answers you have gotten or you are not.We already had a discussion on that topic, and I personally thought that it would be good if anyone who asked for help with something came back with feedback - although then a new aspect appeared in such situations where the OP would appear and write \"Thank you\" or \"Solved\" which someone would report as spam and such a post is deleted. For beginners and everyone else, it's something they need to take a little more into account with their answers.Quote from: Rruchi man on July 31, 2022, 07:43:36 AM-Develop consistency; as a new forum member it is expected that you post regularly say even one post a day and slowly build up the number from there. Posting occasionally like this week and then nobody sees you for like 2 weeks and then you come back in 3 weeks time doesn't speak well of you.Some users can't be active every day even if they want to, whether it's because they have very bad internet that's not available to them every day, or they're forced to work from morning to night and have little free time on the weekend.

I find this disclaimer kind of ironic and adding the red color tag just makes it out to look like a warning.If you want to create local rules, you ideally should make the thread self moderated.I agree a lot with your first tip about users (newbie through to legendary) revisiting threads they created to read up newer discussions and maybe lock up the thread once you've gotten your answer or the topic has been exhaustively discussed.About the posting tips, new members should be on no pressure to reply to topics or create threads. There are tons of previous threads to research on, especially if they are new to cryptocurrencies. They should dive into those to learn more.

I know that many people see this forum only as a way to earn some money and do look at it like a job but it is way more than that and if newbies come to this forum feeling obliged to post every day whether they feel like it or not, it will have counter effect that may drove them away, or even worse like getting banned due plagiarism as they are in rush to farm merit so they can start making money via signature campaigns ASAP.",

You can quote someone's post or part of someone's post by clicking the \"Quote\" button. But your job does not end there. You need to edit your quotes so that the conversation is clean, without unnecessary parts, but still relevant and meaningful. It is also advisable to remove large images, so that your posts do not contain unnecessary big quotes. Sometimes it is good to separate the quotes into several parts and answer each part individually. Also, in replying to the last comment in a topic, you can use \"^\" instead of a full quotation.",
