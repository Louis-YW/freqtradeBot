  "content": "I read an article about an opinion of a university lecturer who believed bitcoin can be used to propagate critical thinking and study culture in students, spending the needed time on their academic work and assignments engagement. His argument is that due to how financially demanding gaining a university degree is and students had to struggle with part-time paid jobs and study which greatly affects their academical development at the end as university graduates.QuoteUniversity education is expensive. Even within the U.K., tales of students leaving with £90,000 (about $115,000) of debt are not uncommon, which raises the question of the value that can be realized by a university degree when offset by this considerable cost.To help manage the scale of this expenditure, it is now common for students to have part-, if not full-time, jobs, with recent figures showing this is the case for the majority of students in the U.K. The same article also stated that the time some students spend on university work suffers as a result of the time they dedicate to paid employment.QuoteThe aim of embedding a bitcoin seed phrase into course material is meant to promote student engagement with material earlier, so they are able to formulate projects while still leaving time to complete them. The indirect orange pilling takes place as students become aware of Bitcoin, learn how they interact with the network and maybe, just maybe, begin their journey down the Bitcoin rabbit hole. If students want to win the bounty, they will have to engage with the material, keeping an eye out for seed words, with every student starting from the same point, hopefully motivating them to engage sufficiently to have the chance of winning the prize. Even those who do not win the prize will hopefully have engaged more than they would have otherwise (a positive for university education).He therefore proposed an alternative approach that can promote students engagements on class modules through provision of cash prize for the best works by embedding a bitcoin wallet seed phrase within module material and for students to have a chance of opening the wallet, they would have to attend specific sessions and taking critical reviews on their materials.Just like bounty hunt, the aim is for those students who won the bounty and those who do not win would have engaged so much in their study than they ordinarily would have done. Two perspectives to grab is that for a bitcoiner it's another method to stage a bitcoin mass awareness and adoption within the university community which could create a bitcoin  business investment interest in students afterwards particularly final year graduating students that gets enthusiastic and passionate about bitcoin.While the second perspective is that,  to an educationist the derivational aim is to get students more engaging and interested in studying and talking about the module.Source:Bitcoin magazine If that is so, then I have a few questions to ask that I'll want us to discuss; what is your own thought on this and this idea if initiated what is the possibility that it can meet both ends of it's aim?  what if the students or a majority get disinterested about the whole idea and method?",

His students must understand Bitcoin basics, explore to use it and should not be taught about Bitcoin as a digital from cryptography that can do everything.It is a lie and not true and his students should not be taught like this because they will teach others around them like brothers, sisters, parents, relatives, friends, neighbors.",

Also, I don't know where bitcoin has anything to do with critical thinking and learning culture. For those who don't like bitcoin, the more they are forced to know bitcoin, the more they hate it. In addition, even someone who is new to bitcoin will not like bitcoin right away, someone who likes bitcoin usually understands how the financial system works, how the hegemony of the dollar is, and how dollars are freely printed without reserves of gold, etc. So to love bitcoin we need to understand the economic and financial system firstI also disagree with the gifting method. In my opinion, the task of students is to study, they must continue to study even though there are no prizes given. Giving gifts will make them pragmatic and willing to learn when there are prizes, if there are no prizes then they will be lazyIn addition, if bitcoin is considered profitable by trading activity, then it becomes a new problem. Bitcoin has a very volatile price, for a beginner it will be very risky to carry out trading activities. If one expects them to invest long term in bitcoins, I don't think students have a source of income to buy bitcoins and hold them for a long time.",

Besides that is not going to stop the students from getting jobs that will eat up the times that they should use to study. I believe people should be taught about Bitcoin. They should have the eagerness to want to know about Bitcoin, not through incentives and rewards. So what happens when the incentives are not there?  Bitcoin shouldn't be forced down on people. If people don't want to use Bitcoin then they shouldn't, we all have our opinions.",

I like his idea to assist his students in knowing the potential of bitcoin so that they can start their bitcoin journey early than expected, but the problem here is that it shouldn't be compulsory to make all of them partake in such class. He should first enlighten them about the basics of bitcoin and give them time to think if they will be interested in such class before he can go on with his plan. If you teach someone what he doesn't have interest on,it is a waste of time. As for prize giving, the idea is cool because it will encourage the students that are willing to learn bitcoin to put in more effort to bring out their best performance. After all in some schools,they do give prize to the best students in various classes at the end of the evey academy session.",

Bitcoin may alleviate this problem for some students, but it is nothing more than an investment opportunity that may increase students' income.Some students solve this problem by working part-time, some by learning additional skills such as programming, some by trading, and buying Bitcoin may be one of the solutions.In some countries student debt is a political problem that is being exploited well before elections. Teaching students about the economy, the importance of saving, investing, and bitcoin may relieve these debts in addition to other roles that governments can play.",

It's just that, first of all, students are maximalists. When you are a student, you are young and full of strength and hope, it seems to you that your whole life is ahead. And that there are a lot of good things in the future. I want to get everything at once, and not work part-time, frantically trying to study at the university. Therefore, I think that many students, after learning about bitcoin, will risk their money without thinking about money management.",

Of course, the teacher must prepare other strategies to get the goals of his learning.I'm sure not all students will be happy with the method used. in the learning strategy of course there will be a failure in some of the interests of the students. we cannot judge whether this will be successful or not, because it is the teacher who can provide conclusions on the success or failure of the method he uses to build the interest of his students.not all students like Bitcoin.

Bitcoin costs money, so a cash prize requires the cash from someone to make it work. If it's a very small amount, I don't think it will encourage students, and if it's big, the financial burden over someone who introduces it can be great. I'm also concerned that there will actually be abuse of the system, one way or another. Some students will just force some AI to analyze the words, and brute force potential seed phrases, without actually studying what they're supposed to be studying.At first glance, it sounds like a nice idea, but I don't think it's very practical and helpful in real life.",

But my question is, how about a student who did not win but is hoping to win because they have some outstanding debt related to their academic work? What will be the fate of those students who don't win? Although every student who participated would gain more knowledge from their study because of the level of engagement, but money is also needed to further the academics. Another question is who will sponsor that idea because the lecture alone cannot do it, and even if he tries, he can only add like 2 to 4 students that will be able to win.",

Obviously the studious one would be leaders in this one as they will crack the code easily but since it's gonna be competitive everyone would want to compete for this and achieve that level. I am really impressed with the idea of this but it has to be planned in detailed to work properly. So much that it should have a plan to release the funds in step by step manner. For example A funds during first semester then B on the second semester and so on.

BTC incorporated learning with rewards for academic participation, introduced even in high school curriculum, would go a long way to grow the economy of any country within the span of 5-7years.
