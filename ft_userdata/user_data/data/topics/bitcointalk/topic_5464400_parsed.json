These countries are Egypt, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Argentina. He also announced a consensus regarding the first stage of expanding BRICS, so that the membership of new members begins on January 1, 2024, while stressing that the doors of membership will remain open to other countries in the future, such as Algeria and Indonesia, which are not yet ready to join.With the accession of these countries, the BRICS bloc now includes 46% of the world's population (almost half), with a gross domestic product of more than the quarter of the global GDP, which will make it a new engine for the global economy.Let's discuss the results of this expansion on the global economy and the possible position of the G-7 countries. And do you think that this is the beginning of the formation of a new world order, especially since in the speech of Russian President Vladimir Putin, he had stressed the need to deal with a common currency among the countries of the group in addition to local currencies ?",

And do you think that this is the beginning of the formation of a new world order, especially since in the speech of Russian President Vladimir Putin, he had stressed the need to deal with a common currency among the countries of the group in addition to local currencies ?The New World Order is already established, it is only becoming more solidified with each major move such as creation of multiple economic, military, etc. blocs such as BRICS. It is simply creating these blocs that are not dominated or ruled by a single power that ends up abusing that power too. Instead it is multiple powers and blocs with the chance of such abuses becoming minimal.There is still a lot of work to be done like establishment of a new payment system to replace SWIFT and possibly even new currency(ies) replacing the US dollar. There are lots of good work being done though. Already lot of countries have bilateral agreements to trade using their own local currencies and gold. Many of such agreements are made in similar blocs like BRICS, SCO, ASEAN, etc.As for the effect this will effectively bring more stability to the global economy so that first of all 2008-like incidents don't repeat where the demise of US economy screws the global economy and affects all countries around the globe one way or the other. And secondly it allows lots of countries be it big or small, weak or strong to grow a lot since in the New World Order they can manage to get out of the US dictatorship preventing them from growth with sanctions and enforcement of laws that were designed to keep them back. Like Pakistan where in order to get a tiny loan from the US controlled IMF they were forced to increase the fuel prices among other things and ruin their economy first!!! In the New World Order a country like Pakistan takes the loan from the new bloc without them meddling in their internal affairs.",

Before the BRICS summit, 22 countries filed formal applications to join the alliance and six applications were granted. Initially, 5 applications were granted, then Ethiopia was added to them for \"geographical reasons\". Officially, membership in the alliance will begin for new members on January 1, 2024, and the alliance itself will probably be renamed BRICS+.",

We know that developing countries in the world are constantly under pressure from developed countries gathered in the G7. They (G7) want to keep these developing countries like that and do not plan to let these developing countries become more developed. The BRICS steps to be able to present a more profitable and inclusive economic cooperation allow the members who are in it and the countries they work with to be able to prosper their countries and possibly get them out of the zone of developing countries into developed countries.",

Knowing that US controlling the trades all over the world didn’t really help those countries in the opposite it’s making things hard for these countries with the wars that are happening now between Ukraine and Russian. The European countries are locking everything for Russia which is the reason why they want to make a change.Unfortunately, Algeria wasn’t in the list of new joiners even after the meetings and aid they spent in this organization. One of the things that all people in Algeria were against is locking the economy and trades with the Europe we have a serious lack in product because of focusing much to join BRICS. I hope our government open their eyes to free the trades between Europe and US finally",

The remaining countries that applied to join BRICS are in waiting list and after some time they will also be invited in the similar fashion. The BRICS is going to expand far beyond our imagination and in future most of the world will be a part of it. Every country knows that and they want to take advantage of it in the early days because in later days there applications would take longer time to be accepted and invited.",

I am pleased to see mainly Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia because they have big economies but I am only sure of Iran. Saudi and UAE can be easily influenced by the West and might fail to facilitate the policies of the alliance. But Iran has what it takes to pursue the BRICS agenda because they have built a sanction-proof economy. Iran will be able to teach these nations how to survive sanctions which is the major instrument of oppression. If this organization wants to achieve its goals, they have to be united and pursue a common goal without fear of intimidation and oppression.",

Are already struggling with their economic situations, and countries facing economic crises always end up with the support of the US.I will not say how things turn out because we are all educated enough to understand that. The point is how much impact this grouping will have on the economy and the US. Which you also asked. Well, long story short, this will have a good impact for those who have to pay huge debt to the US because once the BRICS start to succeed, dedolarization will start and it will become easy for a country stuck in a debt cycle.While it might not be a good thing for a country that has no debt in US dollars but has reserves in US dollars, Because dedolarization will decrease their portfolio. Other than these impacts, there are many others, and shedding light on all of them is going to take too much time.",

We are still observing the developments. Since it is a new group it is expanding. From what has been reported over 40 countries applied. Some interesting things to note about his group is that it aims to reduce reliance on politicized US dollar, enhance trade with local currencies. I think that this is good. Although my country is yet to join(I don't know if she will), yet I have argued in one of my posts in my local board that my country's economy will fare better if we move away from the heavy reliance on the US Dollar. Of course other steps needs to be taken in addition to this but this in itself if it happens will be a game changer.",
