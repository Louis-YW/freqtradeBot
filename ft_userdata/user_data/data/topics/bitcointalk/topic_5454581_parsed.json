I have came to understand that whenever we are heading close to bull or just say nearly we always have new projects launching on a regular basis to stand a chance to enjoy the bull trend as well I often noticed cmc are being flooded with shitcoins in other for them to attract investors, who will invest in their project to enjoy the full wave of bull market  and after which there comes a delisting of many since they can't afford to meet up the exchange standard. Example of those exchange are Binance, any token or coin that got listed in their exchange without meet up to the standard they quickly gets delisted quickly. Now my question is, do we just invest an altcoin to take advantage of the opportunity to make some x in return?Because I know altcoin rarely survive the dip maybe after bull run.",

If you think Bitcoin will be the starter of the bull then invest with and sell if you see profits to your liking or you could just store it because more pumps will happen in the future. When it comes to Altcoins, you may also want to pick the best, the top seeds as much as possible because a bull market always starts with them and not with the coins that are down below. Just because they are cheap doesn't mean you will just purchase them and reap the rewards later. There's a possibility that it will go the other way or worst, you will end up with dust or nothing. It's suicide if you think they will all be pulled up during a bull run, some of them will likely stay in their value and some will go down. Remember, this ain't like the past, we have stablecoins now where they can trade their altcoins unlike before where it will be traded to another altcoin just to maximize the rewards.",

Some projects even old one can do a potential movement on bull season provided they are really working on their development. But if you are a long term holder then investing on bear market just like now would definitely give you an advantage on current prices.New projects are interesting too but you need to pick a good contender and has a lot of room for growth.",

The price showed a continuous increase over the previous years.What is the investment opportunity that I see that no one else sees? It is the only currency that works on the principle of proof of stake, and if it succeeds, it will achieve a good return on investment.What are the new values for that token?

So the chance that altcoin will survive over time is extremely low, but if you properly enter a position before they will leave, the reward is high.

There are projects out there that you can invest in that can mix TradFi with DeFi. When you have a crypto project backed by a fund that relates to the token price then its different. The fund brings in traditional money to the crypto space, so its not a case of just buying an altcoin, handing over the money to the developers and them running away with it.

However, if you want to invest in altcoins, you should thoroughly understand the project, technology, development team, and community of that cryptocurrency. It is important that you invest in a company that has a solid investment and long-term growth potential.Also, just investing in a certain altcoin is not the best way to invest. Instead, you should learn about different industries to find potential projects and invest in various cryptocurrencies to minimize risk. Furthermore, you also need to be wary of cryptocurrencies that don't meet the standards and don't have a strong developer team and community.All in all, investing in altcoins can be profitable, but research and decisions need to be made with a sense of caution.",
