So is it highly personal ? Staff. If they are manually approving bets, then it's going to be a logistic problem if they don't have enough staff. Newer casinos or betting websites aren't going to have the funds to have as many staff a the big dogs. Same as the maximum payout is usually widely different depending on the company you go with. Some have a little leeway because of the vast amount of volume, then others have to put a strict limit on it due to not having the funds. It all comes down to logistics. Some states or countries might actually require them to perform additional checks, like where the money came from, if it was laundered etc. There's a ton of things they need to comply with, as well as checking the location of the user, if they're using a VPN, which are usually not allowed on these types of sites due to the legal issues. Bitcoin gambling websites are a little different, and currently sit in the grey area, I do expect over the coming years things will get a little more tighter.",

Each casino has its own style in their machines (online or offline), AFAIK the casino never loses, because the money circulating there is entirely money from players, from there they get a percentage of every game that players make. This is where %RTP works, there will be times when players lose and there are times when players win in their bets.Is my opinion in line with our discussion? please provide clarification regarding what Payout you mean.",

Even though it's nice to play in a casino with higher payouts you can easily spot them as casinos usually mention the house edge of their game. Sometimes the experience feels better when you're playing in a casino that offers some type of bonus but their payout is slightly lower than their competitors.Isn't it based on the games they offer? nowadays most casinos offer games coming from different software providers and usually, these games have their own different RTP which can slowly reduce the overall RTP of the casino.",

Yes I think about payout ratios from casinos from time to time and try to so some research on it. The problem for me is that casinos offer a wide range of games that have different payouts. For example, I see one casino that has really high RTP numbers for slot games, but then another casino offers better payouts at their black jack and roulette tables. If there was one casino who has the best rates for all games it would be optimal, but I couldn't find it. Also payout ratios are not everything to consider how profitable a casino is for us. If a casino runs special promotions for its regular customers we should also consider that.  A 100 or 200% deposit bonus is huge for example. Especially when it comes to poker these promotions can be quite big. Comparing rake across different casinos is important, but a casino like GGpoker offers a free sitngo voucher every day worth 0.25 to $1. That adds up to a lot of you okay regularly eventhough there are other casinos which are cheaper.",

I think this wasn't a speculation because he seems confident when he said that. Im thankful that I've been playing only on the original games offered by a casino although the results I got are mostly the same, I still rarely win and if I win, it was only small. That's because the multipliers offered on the original games are lower than those on what I saw on games offered by a gaming provider. The only downside is that their minimum bet is high. This is one of the reasons why I avoid them. If we trust the casino then there is no need to doubt that they will do some shady things.
