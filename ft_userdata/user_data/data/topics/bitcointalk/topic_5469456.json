It sound like a SCAM.Kucoin is a serious exchange, one of the industry leaders, and the investment in question does not affect shitcoins. From what I see, this is a return for lending capital for marketmaking (providing liquidity) on the main currency pairs (BTC/USDT). It doesn't look like a scam to me, but as I see it, there is a small catch. \"If daily observation price is higher than the Price Protection and lower than the Auto Take Profit price throughout the product duration, the order will be redeemed as scheduled. You will receive principal + return.\"\"If daily observation price falls below the Price Protection, the order will be early redeemed. Your principal will be converted into BTC using initial BTC price, and the return over the actual holding period will be converted into BTC using the last daily observation price. You will receive BTC + BTC return.\"\"If daily observation price is above the Auto Take Profit price, the order will be early redeemed. You will receive principal + return over the actual holding period.\"https://www.kucoin.com/wealth/product/ProtectiveEarn-BTC-0001/02-01-0029If I understand correctly, this is not an investment without currency risk. If the price of bitcoin starts to fall, we will not get our dollars back, only the bitcoins invested at a local top. And it is this additional risk that gives us high APY.",
