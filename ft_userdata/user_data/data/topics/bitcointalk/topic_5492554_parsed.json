What happens is that if the price of Bitcoin in dollars goes down, or if you prefer, if Bitcoin loses purchasing power, the payment in Bitcoins is the same, so the company actually saves money. And if the Bitcoin price goes up, the rates are adjusted. The only one that endured for a long time without doing this was CM, until it was a scandalous thing, there were jealous people who started to protest and CM ended up paying in dollar equivalence. I am not saying this because of those two in specific, it is what usually happens.Quote from: stompix on April 12, 2024, 01:30:57 PMSo if obviously everyone is still even around here pricing everything in USD, at least in private, do you know the price of one BTC in any other currency than the USD and your own?I sometimes look at it in Euros, but mostly in US Dollars. As we have discussed in other threads, the dollar is a depreciating currency, but most of the ones that try to compete against it are much worse. It is still the world's reference currency and the safe haven currency no matter how much people try to say otherwise. Sure it is not as strong as it was 30 years ago but it is nowhere near as bad as it is being portrayed.",

But I'm not sure because when looking back on binance there is still a lot of liquidity for other stablecoinsmaybe they are not popular or updated on cmc, cgk,... because they are only based on management from the existing platform.",

People who live in third world countries didn't hate USD, instead they choose to invest in USD because their local currency is worse than USD.People who live in first world countries hate USD because they have plenty choice investment that growth better than just hand their money on banks.",

There are many reasons that constituent to why USD has been chosen to be the reserve currency but a few of them would be its strong economy and their demographic.Even though it is the reserve currency, it is not in fact the strongest currency in the world. Anyway the reason why most people use USD as the “default” currency is because it is the reserve currency and it is easier to concert x to usd or usd from x. This still shows the impact of USD to the financial system.",

It was possible for the dollar to be replaced, but the dollar is currently permeated in economies and the attempt to replace it came too late.What happened with Russia made many countries afraid, so alliances like BRICS are realistic and will expand, but they will not change the fact that the dollar will not be replaced except by a world war.",

      "body": "Well firstly, to answer the question of the topic, I kinda have a range estimate for Bitcoin price in my local currency which is naira. However the problem is even when it comes to value fluctuation USD is a better currency at keeping a stable rate compared to Naira. In fact Nigerian naira is so volatile that almost a 100% of major exchanges online especially import and export are based on the dollar. Therefore it's almost unimportant to keep updated on the price of Bitcoin straight to Naira, instead most persons take not of the Bitcoin to Dollar price and then they can make use of the dollar to naira since it's quite easier that way.The undoubtable fact is that a great percentage of the world's exchanges are done using an estimation of dollar price or value. This is mainly because of political dominance and the overall size of the US economy compared to many others. However although USD is quite stable, others like  Kuwaiti dinar and Gibraltar pound are more stable although they are used in almost no global exchanges.",

If you ask me how do I see a dedollarization, I will say it’s something that isn’t close a near future. The only thing I see with brics pushing this is basically just to weaken the US political power and not the currency itself. They fell this is what give them central power and since they use it against countries they place sanctions on, the BRICS might believe by introducing a new currency people will have a way round it. I wouldn’t say it’s not possible but it’s adoption and denouncing of dollar will still take decades from here",
