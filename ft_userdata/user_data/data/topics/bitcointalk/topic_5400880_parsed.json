  "content": "Hello all,I am very new on lending service and I have not created any topic before.My Budget: 10 BTCNote: I may increase or decrease my budget.Terms:-You must have valid collateral. Only, altcoin is valid collateral to me. I will not take bitcointalk account as collateral anymore as it is forbidden by few reputed forum member as well as DT.-If you are Sr. member or above and you have no active loan as well as no negative trust then I may consider without collateral.-As I will not take account as collateral, you have to agree that once you take a loan from me, you will not take/apply for any other loan from anyone until you repay the loan. Also before the repayment, you would not be able to trade any reversible payment. I mean you can't sell skrill, Neteller, Payoneer, PayPal etc. If you break any rule then it will be marked as loan defaulter and I will ask DT to tag you.-I can accept or reject any loan application without any explanation.-If you want to use escrow I have no problem. But escrow fee is yours if required fees.-When I will fill loan application, I will give neutral trust once repaid will remove neutral trust.-If collateral goes below terms amount, I will sell collateral to stop loss. You have to check either your collateral falls or not, I am not responsible to inform you or wait more time to be more loser.-If you fail to repay on time then 1% charge/ as discussed (for extension) will be applicable.-For non collateral loan or loan with bitcointalk  account as collateral, if you need to extension then you have to pay previous interest and take extension time (charge applicable 1% charge/ as discussed).-Once you take loan from me you have to pay full interest even you return that in few minutes latter. Same rule will be applied for loan extension.Application method:Code:Loan Amount: Loan Purpose: Loan Repay Amount: Loan Repay Date: Type of Collateral: Escrow profile Link: Bitcoin Address:",
