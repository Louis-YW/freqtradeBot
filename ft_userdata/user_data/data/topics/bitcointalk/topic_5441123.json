  "content": "For learning and later teaching purposes I am havingÂ  trouble to find a full video or gif example of BTC beings used for peer-to-peer transfers (not commerce) from (this is key) BTC wallet, to opening a LN channel with a peer using a Lightning Wallet, closing then channel, and then re-transdering to a purely BTC wallet (where most self custodians would like to have their BTC). Anyone willing to help?I think that a full example like that will be of much use for later teaching (friends and fellow merchants) purposes. Thanks!",
