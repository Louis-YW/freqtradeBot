And i doubted that they even did. As to my knowledge non-kyc casinos have been illegal for a while now. The fact that they didn't handle stablecoins or fiat money probably slowed the process but from what i gathered they were obligated to kyc for a while now if they encounter suspicious activity. I just thought that they maybe didn't bother to mention it.",

I hope TheQuin or Wetsuit could explain more on this topic as I don't want to loose all that money.Without a doubt this is a problem and it show us why when a platform is looking to make such a major change they should give their clients a period of time so they can adapt to the new set of rules and regulations and stop gambling there if needed be.Your only option is to contact their customer support immediately and ask for the chance to make a withdrawal, otherwise if you start this process on your own without letting them know they may argue you violated their new TOS and forbid you to get access to your coins.",

I hope TheQuin or Wetsuit could explain more on this topic as I don't want to loose all that money.That's a big problem that must be solved as fast as possible before they could close the IP on the restricted countries. I mean, they must inform their customers who have balances in their accounts that they must withdraw as soon as possible or they could give them time to do the necessary steps and take out the money. Not everyone will be online when this is implemented, some, just like you may have been investing their money only and only monitor it weekly or monthly. Very big change from one of the popular dice and lotto sites that I knew. I hope this doesn't affect their business as a part of their customers won't be able to use their service anymore. It's somehow sad but let us wish they could expand the number of countries that they will be accommodating.",

Fortunately for me, I don't fall into this sets of people but it's would be nice to know what freebitco indeed to do about about it.It seems like haven't fully implented it because I went to check my account if perhaps they created a verification section for user, just like how others do theirs but couldn't find one, or am I missing something here?",
