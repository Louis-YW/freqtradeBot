  "content": "Cambridge University just gave us a big update on Bitcoin's energy usage, and it's good news. Turns out, previous estimates were way off the mark. In 2021, we thought Bitcoin consumed 104 terawatt-hours, but it's actually 89.0 TWh. And in 2022, it dropped from 105.3 TWh to 95.5 TWh, about the same as U.S. tumble dryers. The old method didn't consider the efficiency of mining hardware, but now we've got a more accurate picture. According to Cambridge, in 2023, it's around 70.4 TWh. So, Bitcoin's environmental impact isn't as bad as we thought!Source: https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/cambridge-universitys-updated-bitcoin-electricity-consumption-index-reveals-lower-energy-consumption",

      "body": "First of all, thank you for sharing this good news and the link for anyone who wants to read more on this topic. This news is really good for the image of Bitcoin, for as well know there is an existing negative image of Bitcoin that makes it hard for the general public to fully be interested in it. Due to a lot of negative advertisements and issues of scamming, Bitcoin has been receiving a negative image from those who are not fully educated by the actual system Bitcoin operates. Hence, having this news that Bitcoin is not causing such a big negative environmental impact is a form of redeeming thing for it. Those who are always using this argument will be debunked and one less negative point will be erased in favor of Bitcoin. As for anyone who is interested in seeing real-time data regarding the Bitcoin electricity consumption index, here is the link: https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci",

So, Bitcoin's environmental impact isn't as bad as we thought!When you say \"we\", who exactly are you referring to? Those who use their brains and know how to interpret facts from independent research never even thought that Bitcoin has any significant impact on the environment.Various so-called \"experts\" and journalists who are paid to spread lies never cared about this data, as it will not matter to them even now how much energy is actually needed for Bitcoin in one year. Even if the consumption is only 1 TWh and it comes from renewable sources, their lies about how the world will remain in the dark or how temperatures will rise because of Bitcoin will continue.In this way, they are actually covering up decades of systematic destruction of our planet at all levels, and now they are looking for who to blame for all that - and Bitcoin is more than an ideal victim because there are few who will defend it publicly.",

The estimated value is quite higher, at around 120TWh (for 2023). Shouldn't we using this value for reference, or am I missing something?I am pretty sure that mining rig efficiency had not been accounted for before, but at least between the 2023 months there is not much difference - however from 2021 to 2023 there is a big drop in electricity consumption I think is due to efficiency - and the price drop.",

      "body": "It's important to have academic institutions of high reputation because it's great to see that they care about the accuracy of their reports and reviewing the accuracy when new data comes to light. I read through the Cambridge article, and they accounted for the improvement of mining hardware: it became way more powerful and more efficient, so they considered it alongside the increase of hashrate over time, reviewing their previous assumptions that relied on more usage of older hardware. This, it seems, is largely what allowed to readjust the total energy consumption estimates. Keep in mind that even this new number is an estimate, little more than an educated guess that relies on pretty big assumptions, such as \"that miners, as rational economic actors, will avoid operating unprofitable hardware\".",

Analogiies with tumble dryers, Christmas lights, banking industry and all the other uses are bad, because you can't imagine modern society without them, but you can easily imagine it without Bitcoin, since most people are not using it anyway.Quote from: sesterceshop on September 05, 2023, 06:09:43 AM So, Bitcoin's environmental impact isn't as bad as we thought!The estimation only changed by 10%, hardly a groundbreaking reevaluation. What has always been the case though is the fact that Bitcoin consumed a small part of global electricity, and electricity is a small part of emissions. A small part of a small part is a tiny part. Putting all mining to a halt would have such a small positive impact on environment that it could not be even measured.",

The resulting all of this will cause environmental problems.Numbers sources U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)",

With more studies still being carried out, the efficiency problem of these mining machines is being improved upon by either converting the energy from one form to another for usage in homes and offices or developing hypothesis and testing it, such as this bearing on the electric consumption it can afford.El Salvador uses energy produced from its volcanic mountains and as such, energy consumption that involve a theory as this involving electricity, is more useful to countries or regions who rely of constant electric supply or energy supply from a distributed system to function.",

If there is energy created, the nit will be used ,and this is a way that we use it, so it is not going to be an important difference, we can't just say that energy should be given for free to someone, obviously it would be used for something and in this case it is mining.However, how we make that energy is the most important part, it does allow us to get better at it one way or another. If you make it from coal, you are ruining the world, if you make it from hydro or solar or wind, then you are making the world a better place. So focus on how you create it, not how you use it after it's  created.",
