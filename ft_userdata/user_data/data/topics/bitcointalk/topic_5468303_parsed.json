This is not the first time the market has behaved like this. What you call volatility is not still volatile because it is possible that bitcoin may lose $2000 or more in just an hour which makes this volatility to be little. There can be high volatile and that is how bitcoin market is sometimes.Only the affected people are the traders who day trade or scalp. If a scalper or day trader go short position today, they are losing already. But that is what holders will not still consider as loss.",

Relative to bitcoin I have learnt many things about the market totally taking an opposite directional move from our wide expectations.Whales see what we see and they are smart enough to manipulate the market oppositely than what most of the market crowd think. So price can crash surprisingly or pump when we are all thinking the market is boring and has no reason to rise.Models and patterns mostly fail because whales bend price chart to those models and patterns but eventually they make big surprise by bending a chart oppositely than what pattern should be completed.With years in this market and witnessed many shocks, I am now familiar with it and no longer trust any model or pattern.",

So if ever there's a breakout in an unexpected direction it will lower the probability, just like what we saw in the chart. Instead of breaking the support, it breaks the resistance level. However, since I'm not using pattern trading this kind of stuff doesn't matter to me. I'm just looking for a setup that harmonized to the trend in the higher time frame. Example: If the higher time frame is bullish, I will look for a bullish setup in the lower time frame (vice-versa.Weekly time frame for me was still a bullish, so I will ignore all the bearish setup that I saw in the ltf but look for longs.",

The price of Bitcoin before this price fluctuation is playing below the EMA lines which means it is about to go dip again on long timeframe. A strong wick is a sign of struggling which typical indicator that price will start to create a move the opposite side. The chart above is the daily chart which shows that the recent 4h movement that you present is already erased and now a wick. I'm using daily chart for my trade and this sudden price fluctuation is what I expected since the price needs to hit all the EMA lines before it will go more downward movement which the current price chart suggest.",

Such movements will continue to occur and last until an unspecified and often unexpected time, it is not uncommon for some of us as traders to be very surprised by seeing it, especially if we experience losses due to the impact of these fluctuations, mentally and psychologically will definitely be disturbed and of course it greatly affects everyone when they want to start they will have difficulty making the right decision. I hope they will remain cautious and prepare some actions to minimize if it happens again, maybe there are some who take advantage of that moment when the bearish trend dominates as a result of selling bitcoin beyond the limit. and for those who haven't started at all will be quick to take that opportunity in the lowest support area.",

The best thing is to just leave the funds off now till probably months after the halving, this way one could not get unrealistically disappointed with any price. Although the month of October is looking more like a tricky one I expect a little pump if no bad news is received and could even make it touch above $28000. But anything that test the support of $25000 then a price of $21000 to $22000 is expected. But as i said the unexpected will definitely happen before the halving",

We have been down this long already it's really crazy that I'm still holding on to some altcoins but it's too late to also sell. The spike today I think was about Gensler getting roasted in Congress but the excitement also died when he still declined the spot EFT.
