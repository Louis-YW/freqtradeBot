What will lead to the increase is more about bitcoin price increase sentiment that most people has already have for bitcoin halving and spot bitcoin ETF. Even if United States government tried to strengthen dollar, it can not beat the coming bull run.",

The signs of progress in the near term are undeniable it will take time to understand the economics so you are right it is better to invest in bitcoin and gold as it will increase in value as time goes by. The global economy will have no impact on bitcoin. Gold in many cases this precious metal became the determinant of the property and influence-prestige of a large section of the society. But it is also a great way to invest in future protection and savings bitcoin is considered as a long-term investment option it also has guaranteed returns.",

And last time I checked it was predicted to happen this year or next year, what totally matches with the next Bitcoin halving, boosting the growing potential for BTC a lot on the following 2 years. I'm sure speculators and whales are aware about it and won't waste this opportunity to make big profit. So, minor investors like us must be prepared as well, holding most coins as possible to take advantage of the next cycle in crypto market, which may be a life changer for many of us here.",

      "body": "It's slightly more complicated than that. It is true that the increasing interest rates prevents other markets (including bitcoin) from rising but it is a rule. For example the reason why it did this time was because the increasing interest rates first caused recession which means people don't have any money to invest and they also need to liquidate their assets to cover the cost of living they can no longer cover through other means. And second it created an alternative investment option for people to take their money there (the government bonds) to get a decent amount of \"interest\" out of it.Here are the exceptions to that rule:- Increasing interest rate at some point will stop being able to deepen the recession. So we may see increasing interest rate while recession is just as terrible as it gets!- At some point people would stop trusting the government putting its hand in their pocket and would not be interested in buying those bonds as much as they are interested in buying other stuff. Which means other markets would see capital returning to them.- There is also inflation that is happening alongside all of this and inflation causes price of everything to go up (that includes bitcoin) which means even with increasing interest rates we are bound to see bitcoin price go up at some point.",

In any other way, even if the war doesn't happen in your own nation, I feel like your nation may get inflicted about it as well. Just look at USA, we see them as a rich nation and a powerful nation but that is the rich people and not the ordinary citizen.Because of the Israel war and the Ukraine war, they have spent way too much money on military and war efforts to help their allies, and that money went out of ordinary peoples taxes, that tax should have gone back to people who paid it, but instead went to people in another nation. That is not what they wanted, did any American die? Of course not, but they still got a lot poorer because of it. That is just example of one nation, there are many nations and many citizens that got in trouble because of these wars, and that doesn't have to be regarding fighting, they just got into trouble financially because this war is going on and that's a side effect of wars.",
