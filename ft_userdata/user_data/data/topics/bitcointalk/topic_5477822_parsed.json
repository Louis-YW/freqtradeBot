You are unlikely to get the detailed answer you are looking for and it should not be an enigma why this is the case, if you had a reliable method that allowed you to find coins in which you could invest before they do an 100x movement, would you share it with everyone? Would you risk the method to stop working due to too many people using it at the same time as everyone shares the method with others? Or you will keep quiet and make a fortune? I suppose it should be quite obvious which option anyone with some common sense would pick.",

Note; I don't longer participate in altcoin projects or investment is been long i monitored and follow up some new altcoin whatever investment you are making you are solely responsible for any lost.Then my advice is that do not focused on newly launched project because you won't know the sole purpose of the founders or even those projects with low market cap can actual failed if they don't properly focused into marketing to attract more investors as well receiving the necessary visibility and audience.",

Before I disclose the name please do your own research as you might lose everything you invested. I personally have made some profits using these two tools and I have suffered loss. The risk involved is more than the gains you might get using them. The first application is dexscreener, they have an Android application but I prefer their website. You would find all shit coins that are trending on different DEX here. Analyse the potential token after doing all the research and then check X.com, if your potential token is trending. Use these simple steps and you will make good profit. Remember there are many scam projects than those that have potential. Research before investing!",

Well, the answer is NO because we never know exactly what will happen next unless you are the creator of the project and you know already when to pump the price or when to drop. But as a gems seeker, no matter what you do, there is no assurance for that as we just found it when the hype started already. Joining telegram is just a way that leads you to have wrong information and a way to lose (scam). Don't get very close to social media influencers and much more in telegram just to avoid getting scammed otherwise, you'll be their target.",

Can anyone give a detailed explanation on how to find new projects as they are launching before they gain attention. OP I assumed here that you said beginners should invest in small market cap projects to find new gems before going big. I can't go with your opinion because investing in small market cap projects is very risky. And the reason it's risky is because small projects can sometimes die. That's why I would say to always invest in coins with the highest volume by market cap. It is always better to invest in the coins that are listed on the best exchanges and those coins that have a lot of volume with a lot of investors and a lot of traders. Investing all these coins can lead to finding new gems in the future.",

In reality the only solid way is to determine whether a project has enough of a future, a proper marketing team, and a proper road map. These projects tend to take a long time though since, well, nothing beats slapping money out for marketing if you wanted a coin that would sell, not necessarily for a long time, maybe just for a few days. And in those cases, good luck trying to find them beforehand. Unless you have insider news, it's impossible to invest in hype coins and profit off of them purposely. That, or you just invest on any new project. I mean if profits overshadow the costs, it might just be something worth to do no? Sadly you can't even give a prediction in terms of profits so it's really risky, and you;d most likely lose anw due to the sheer amount of new coins that are released.",

I do this often and it could be a very good guide, to say the least. However, without wasting time, the best places I find my new projects are through Coinmarketcap and the Binance app (through the feeds and new listings). This has been so effective for me to get conversant with a new project or the projects that are promising. But this is also applicable to the old coins and listings that are promising. This works more for all promising coins/tokens that are old if the market moves up generally.After detecting them through the Binance app or even Coinmarketcap itself, I moved to Coinmarketcap to study their market capitalization (inflows and outflows), news, community engagement and many more. Which includes how they grow and the number of exchanges that have already accepted them. I watch this in relation to their charts before I make my final decision. This might take time, which could be months in some cases. Nonetheless, as you have been advised before, I will do that again, just make sure you DYOR. Still, I don't think anyone who buys AVAX, SOL, RUNE, ADA, MANA, DOT, OCEAN, FET, AGIX, RAY and the lots of them can regret it.",

Generally you can get some profit if you are able to buy the coin on first news of listing and sell it before the actual listing. So, tracking news and immediate action is a good way to get them. Another way is to wait for a hyped coin to fall so that you can buy them for cheap and wait till they have another pump. I tried and had success with this strategy in PEPE coin.",

It will be difficult to find them because most of them are in secrecy and they will hit the market once many whale investors already bought a big part of the pie. This question has been asked so many times and all I can say is it's not easy to find them because if it did, we wouldn't be talking about it anymore and a lot of millionaires in the crypto field have posted their testimonies about it. But until now, none of those are happening. I only got lucky twice because it's a public sale and it didn't really take that long before the project market went down. I sold it at the right time where it was pumped and reaped the rewards. Never fall in love with a project unless it's a popular one like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you get lucky and find a gem then witness rewards, take it, run, and enjoy the profits. It's a rare opportunity so take advantage of it. When I say rare, it's a needle in the haystack.",

If you are to look for these Gems yourself, wait for the bear market to its deepest dip where in the monthly chart you can find the token to be in the oversold position. This way the price will be at its lowest and then you can invest and then when the bull run begins, it blows up where you can profit exponentially.If you are to look for it while the bull run has started, just wait for the dip. You get lucky whichever the coin is since the bull season will make the prices blow up anyway. But this is if the token you choose is one of the top altcoins.
