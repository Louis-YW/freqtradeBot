  "content": "What happened: Fake Crypto Staking platform.  Website : Code:https://bakerylswap.uno/staking-hook/If you are a member of any popular crypto project's Telegram group, you may receive messages with this tempting offer. I've already received this offer, and I understand what it's intended at first glance. The huge ROI they are offering is unrealistic because no real platform would dare to offer such a huge ROI. So now don't connect your wallet to such website hoping to cover losses quickly in this bear market.Because this is a trap for you, if you connect your wallet to this website, your entire fund will be hacked by scammers. So be safe, and avoid clicking on any link shared by someone you don't know.QuoteDomain Name: BAKERYLSWAP.UNORegistry Domain ID: D340299174-CNICRegistrar WHOIS Server: whois.namesilo.comRegistrar URL: https://www.namesilo.comUpdated Date: 2022-12-26T02:47:00.0ZCreation Date: 2022-12-26T02:40:36.0ZRegistry Expiry Date: 2023-12-26T23:59:59.0ZRegistrar: NameSilo, LLCRegistrar IANA ID: 1479",

This is because scammers use bear market depression to easily scam crypto investors. Now scammers don't create scam websites using different giveaway techniques like before. Now they create fake websites with attractive offers using the names of various popular projects, so that they can get access to the wallets of crypto users.",

They continue to do this things because they always know that there will be a newbie that will fall in their traps. This is why newbie guys should always realize the great rule on investing that if its good to be true its not true this is discuss by many channels or people so hopefully they always value what those people experience because scam will not happen if they will not let those scammers fool them and feed them wrong information which can catch their interest.Its really better to research and have experience on everything since it can take away the possibilities that we will be scam by those scams.",

As a result, even experienced crypto users are often confused, so it is important to remember to avoid connecting wallets to websites other than bookmarked websites. Because once a crypto user falls into the trap of a clone website, that crypto user will lose everything. So being careful is important to stay safe.",
