It could take years you know? How much is your electricity costs? This is also very important too, you can have all the graphic cards you desired and have a hard time running all of them 24/7 because of electricity bills.",

The issue is people only see the good side of this market, never the bad side of it and when shit happens then they learn, I have been in this market since 2010, have seen many things that taught me to become what I'm today, I lost millions in 2014 at mtgox and to this day I'm still trying to get my money back. You trolls should be very careful, even today with all my experience we never know, even I could be scammed without knowing about it.",

Graphics cards are at all time high prices because of the demand and also the supply chain crisis of chips and the shortages. With that being said it can still be profitable if you plan to do this in the long run and or have free/cheap electricity. The card will pay itself off eventually and all the crypto will be pure profit minus costs of electric. Use a search for a mining calculator and set it up with something like nicehash. You can mine the most profitable coin and have it auto converted after the day into whatever coin you'd like to hold after/",
