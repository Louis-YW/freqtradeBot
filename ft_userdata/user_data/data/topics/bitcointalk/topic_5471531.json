And if the IRS comes breathing down their neck they'll drop USA customers like a hot potato.The premise seems to be partly based on “whether a person is in a position to know information about the identity of a customer, rather than whether a person ordinarily would know such information.” The proposal states that this distinction is made because some platforms “have a policy of not requesting customer information or requesting only limited information [but] have the ability to obtain information about their customers by updating their protocols.”",

Raising taxes is not the only option.Regarding what nutildah says, nothing new. In general tax inspectors give preference to large amounts over small amounts, unless they get evidence by someone rerporting or something like that. In the case of other countries the threshold for not being so interesting for the tax authorities is obviously lower, as USA is (still) the country with the highest GDP in the world. But in general things like you earn $70 a week in a signature campaign which is about $3500 a year and you don't declare it doesn't make you interesting for the IRS or the equivalent in other countries, as to begin with they should find out from which country you connect to the forum, if you do it with a vpn, etc. The cost profit ratio doesn't pay off for them.

The automated letter part I believe is possible, though I've never heard of it happening to crypto traders (who knows, it may happen). The audit portion requires actual human intervention. This means resources need to be dedicated and people have to be paid for their work... everyone from the data analyst to the auditor to the collector to the manager. Not to mention travel expenses. Additionally, collectors are often entitled to a cut of whatever they are able to retrieve. The letter part is easy.
