Just delete the app and download new one. It will prompt you on uploading your key store file and create a new password. But I think you need to create a new wallet first since its a new app again. Then after creating the first one, go to import keys and then plug in your save one and thats it.",

If you are still using the old computer and the same browser, it is possible that you have saved the password of your keystore on the browser, try looking at the saved password of your browser.  If you are lucky you can find it there, if not then there is no other way but to remember the keystore password.Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on December 01, 2022, 05:13:59 PMQuote from: 10mahadi on December 01, 2022, 05:10:47 PMI created Myetherwallet for few years ago, and i lost private key but I've keystore file, when i'm trying to log in it’s asking password, but unfortunately i can't remember the password, now there are any way to recover the password?

The MEW application on the phone does not support importing the wallet through the private key or the Keystore file, the private key and the Keystore file are only available on MyEtherWallet.com, and unfortunately there is no way to import the wallet using the Keystore file without the password, so if you have forgotten the password, I see that it is there is no method that will help you with that. You can search for the password in a note or anywhere you have saved it.As @BitcoinPanther mentioned, if you are lucky, you will remember your password from an old browser on your computer, or through your Gmail account, go to Account Settings, then to Security, then click on Password Manager, and you will find your saved passwords.",

The password is the most important aspect here, I mean if you lost it, then how can your recover?Not to burst the bubble for you, you can't recover your MEW if you don't have the password to go with it.Or maybe you can read it here: https://help.myetherwallet.com/en/articles/5449341-lost-private-keyJust try to remember your password, who knows, maybe it will just pop up in your mind one of these days.",

There is no option for \"Forget-password\" you should remember the password has been set-up to the Keystore. If you forget the password, try a few pieces of advice:1. Go to \"Google-setting\" > Autofill > Password Manager > Search MyEtherWallet (In case there has some luck, you saved the password to your browser).2. Try a few password from your (Social Media or anything), could be there has some chance you have the same password with other.",

I have never heard of this method. Does it work? Do you have any detailed instructions for this method? OP, if you really can't figure out your old password, you can follow this method which is the only helpful suggestion I've seen, but I've never heard of it either. Hopefully, @Oneandpure will come back and tell us how.Quote from: Oneandpure on December 01, 2022, 07:00:10 PMDid you try login to Myetherwallet trough metamask add on extensions? not access troughmyetherwallet website but login to your account trough Metamask, first instal add on in your chrome or mozilla browser, then access by using Key Store file and check by using new password its working or not, its seems access trough Metamask add on you can recovering with your Myetherwallet account.As far as I remember, metamask allows you to login with keystore file but it still asks for password which means you need to remember old password not create new one. In this case, it works like myeth wallet or another non-custodial wallet, you still can't login with keystore file if you forget password.",

There's a chance you're send your coins on old address or someone mistakenly send their coins to your old wallet.2FA, password, fingerprint, code are pointless, those just add extra security to make people can't access your wallet only, not add any security on your wallet.",

Unfortunately no, you can't recover your password.And you can't login without that password, because the Keystore file, you have has your private key in it but in an encrypted form. To decrypt you will have to give the same password which you had given while downloading the file.Here is MyEtherwallet's article about it: Link",

You still have a keystore file so you can restore at any time, and for passwords this is not needed, when you want to log in on the metamask that is needed only the keystore file, private key or the other, so as long as you still have a keystore file you can use to login on Many applications such as Metamask, or other applications.",
