  "content": "Quotethis is my friend,, he has 1 child his life is now destroyed in his wife and children..his daily work he collects used goods then at night he uses them for deposits..Once, he got 180 million rupiah inherited from his father for rent, but it was used up to play slots, then he got money from selling his mother's jewelry and used it for slots, even worse, he had 4 cows, he sold all 100 million rupiah to play slots too.now his only assets are a smartphone and a Honda Spacy motorbike (BPKB has been mortgaged). I once asked until when did you live like this, Den (Aden's name)? He replied, until I die I don't care if I want to lose, how can I find money because it's already too deep and I've lost everything, I might as well live like this. I just stroke my chest while watching him play slots, sometimes I give him encouragement and I make fun of him when he buys a spin of 200 thousand rupiahs and returns only 12 thousand rupiahsI got a picture sent from a friend who said there was a slot addict who no longer cared about anything in his life, even his family had left him because of his addiction, luckily he is not a criminal, he doesn't rob to gamble but if you have a friend like him, would you advise him to stop gambling like crazy and return to the family? because there is no way you can stay with him, you have a family to take care of!",

There is nothing like family, better to quite the addiction and go back to them, instead of being someone that family do not trust. If family do not trust someone, that is more that a lot for him to realize and change for better.",

He would really just realize things when he doesnt really have anything left even the money for him to eat. He would literally be sleeping on the streets without something to eat, no family nor having no shelter. If they wouldn't listen then it is really just that sad on what are the upcoming consequences he would be facing on.",

This is why you should really make yourself that fully aware that you shouldn't really make yourself reached out that point.Regret do always come at the end.",

No for sure he continue what abusive thing he do and ignore the advices given to him coming from other people. For now he don't do crime yet since maybe he still have enough money to use but once he can't control his self and all his money are gone maybe he can think about doing it. To bad his family left him since they can do something like seek for help on health experts and put him on rehab since for sure he will be cured there.",

Instead of abandoning his gambling activities, he still pursued it believing that it could help them someday.

Having no other options in life, makes it very difficult for them to gamble responsibly.I think you are quite right on this. Many people who have this kind of problem with gambling are from poor backgrounds, with few qualifications to work, who are unhappy with their lives, mainly because of the economic component, and see gambling as a possible way out, but which in reality ends up being a problem. It is no coincidence that there are considerably more gambling dens per square metre in poor neighbourhoods than in rich neighbourhoods. But I wouldn't take all the blame off him and consider him a victim. There is a component of personal responsibility, and by no means all people in his situation end up behaving like that.",
