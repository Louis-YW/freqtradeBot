      "body": "I don’t understand what you mean by it was sent back. But two things will happen with the stuck transaction, if the mempool gets less congested and the fee set for that transaction is ok it will arrive to that receiving address but if the mempool doesn’t get less congested, the transaction will be dropped back to the sending address, the default time is 14 days but it varies. So all in all your bitcoin doesn’t get lost, so keep the login details of those platforms in tact. The only possibility of you losing your bitcoin is if they are below the deposit limit of the recipient address on that platform it will actually drop but will be confiscated by the platform and would not be seen again",

      "body": "From what game?Add more info about the address where the Bitcoin was sent back to.Cashapp is a custodial wallet if you sent BTC on this app and got rejected and it sent it back to where the BTC came from try to do a CPFP if the game/wallet is capable of making a transaction while the BTC is still unconfirmed try to make a new transaction and this time make sure to increase the fee to cover the previous transaction.Also, I suggest you to try to submit your transaction ID to the ViaBTC accelerator.",

      "body": "If you were sending Bitcoin between different custodians there is nothing you can do. You might not see that money again because CashApp would have sent the BTC back to the custodian's hot wallet and not a specific deposit address associated with your account. Once the transaction confirms you will have to contact the game's customer support to see if they will credit the amount back to your account.",

This is likely to cost a fee on top of the network fee, if they are able to facilitate. Most services will ask for an unreasonable fee though if you argue about it and claim only for them to take the network fee, they will do exactly that. This is considering considering their support is good and it's a completely legitimate service.In the future, use a wallet. Sparrow, electrum, etc. All are good choices for quick. Easy set-up wallets.",

      "body": "What is the fee that has been paid for the transaction? Not the one you made, but the one they sent back.You can find it out by opening your wallet and copying the incoming transaction ID, followed by pasting it into any block explorer.Right now, you're going to struggle to get anything below 60 sats/byte confirmed. It's going to take a while, but it's not permanently stuck there.",
