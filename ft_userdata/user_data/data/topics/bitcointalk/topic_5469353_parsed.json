  "content": "Omor my brothers make una come see tori wey I carry come board today, NASA(National Aeronautics and Space Administration) don  dey plan for  to build houses for moon just the way we dey watch for Hollywood fiction movies but this time around dem wan bring am to reality dem say because the moon get some kind of magnetic property wey dey pool things to itself say e go make the idea dey possible, and na 3d printing dem wan use take make the building. But dem still get some thing wey dey stand as treat to building houses for the moon, dem say the dust particles for the moon dey very toxic, but for me I dey see say that one na just 10% of problem wey dem get because only oxygen for one day for this country na 25,26 thousand, before dem ho com talk about food and other things.But that one no be watin dey make me fear, the thing wey dey make me fear na be say, all of us dey the earth and we dey see the wey the government dey handle virus wey spread across the world matter, if dem com package house for moon you no sure say dem go leave us to die finish for earth? Because the heart of men are desperately wicked l, even after the covid e get one video semina wey some Americans been dey do and dem talk say  by 2023 dem go reduce the world population by 50%. Just imaging how dem wan use take achieve this dream if no be to kill those wey dey exist? If at all say by the 2040 dem don finally build the houses dem for the moon who know the kind of virus wey dem fit release upon us?",

      "body": "This matter no sopoz consan me becos na those rich people wey no get wetin to use moni do nai go go become residents for the Moon. You know, Americans dey easily moved by vain things like this and maybe if this project no get enough partnership and sponsors, NASA fit sweep this one under the rug. To me the successful trip to the moon by Apollo 17 in 1972 launched by NASA nai go be the only achievable feat them fit do.  According to the Op, you believe say them fit slim fit the world population by this half baked plan? I doubt because how many people go like own houses for the moon when them(NASA) don tok say the fine dust for the moon dey very sharp e fit cut through glass. See, the way I see this mata nah say when too much wisdom don dey for person, if cares not taken, some of the creations them go make fit kill them.NASA no just wan build base wia astronaut and civilians alike fit get to call home, but place were them fit explore and conduct more research. I just see this one as news, when e old new one go come up.",

      "body": "Do you know the oxygen required for humans to breathe is not on the moon? If house is built on the moon, it will require very high maintenance and regulation of its environment.If you have a rapid assent to an high altitude like Ethiopia, or more higer place like Himalaya, that will lead to high altitude sickness. How would the moon be? It would be worse. Everywhere humans will be on the moon have to be regulated in a way it would mimic the weather conditions on the sea level on earth. Moon is not a place for humans. You can see how cold just Antarctica is? It is researchers that are going there and population there will reduce more during winter. That is just earth's south poll. If Antarctica is used for research, know that a satellite (moon) is not a place for humans to live.",

I believe say them dey study more and  weighing their options.

The way the world dey go dey get me so worried. Even though say these advancement in technology dey sweet me, one part of me dey fear make them no use these things hold us for work. As time dey go, na so endey clear say even our body no be our own... na some people get power over our own body. The coronavirus of a thing really open my eyes to see wetin dey sup. Na God go help us sha.",

According to biology e say na eath be the center of life which is made up of litosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere which all of them be wetting dey sustain life and it's natural. Plant animal and human depends on Dem for survival so. If dey want to go to the moon e concern Dem because I doubt if they can maintain the cost of living there.  There are things money can not solve. like fertil land constant water air(oxygen) so how long will dey continue to spend money.",
