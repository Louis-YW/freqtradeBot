If you really are paying 12 USD a coin I got a bunch to sell to you, not going to wait for it to hit 100 USD. However, I will only sell if you are using a reputable escrow or send the money first (USDT).",

The Pi coin still has no value, nor is it listed on any exchanges. If you saw somewhere that it is officially traded, it is a fake.

It's being bought and sold for a lot more in secondary market, in my country there's a local market where they buy this for as much as 3 dollars, anyways, my post was to indirectly call him out. He is a scammer as he tried to scam me too in the past.",
