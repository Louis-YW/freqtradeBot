Frankly, I find it hard to place trust in such new websites due to their absence of reputation and genuine member testimonials.When it comes to Telegram bots and making money, I haven't come across a method like that so far, unless one utilizes bots with more rational functions. It sounds like an easy-money bot, doesn't it? Therefore, my advice is to exercise caution. There's a multitude of scam models out there nowadays, and they come in various forms.",
