The miners will (almost) always include the ones with higher fee, since they want to earn more money.And with new blocks being mined every ~10 minutes, sometimes, when the network is more busy, a higher fee can get your transaction mined faster.For a better view you can take a look at: https://mempool.space/The withdrawals from exchanges go \"faster\" because the exchanges overpay the fee.",

I say this because my friend has been complaining about a transaction, that he made from his electrum wallet to another wallet and has been waiting for hours for it to go. While cash and some other crytocurrencies are faster than Bitcoin, Bitcoin is faster than most other forms of payment.Keep in mind that card and bank transactions are not as fast as they seem. First, the merchant isn't credited the money for at least a few days, and even after that they must wait for months before they know for sure that they can keep it. The merchant allows the customer to take the purchased items immediately because they are willing to take the risk that they will eventually receive the money.It is the same with Bitcoin. Once your friend has broadcast the transaction, the receiver of the bitcoins can just assume that they have them, although there is a risk that they will ultimately not receive them, as in the case above. Furthermore, the receiver is free to use the bitcoins immediately even though the transaction has not yet been confirmed.Then, of course there is Bitcoin's Lightning Network that provides instantaneous payments.",

Bitcoin blocks are mined approximately every 10 minutes, sometimes a confirmation can happen within 1 minute of the previous block, other times it can even take more than 50 minutes for a block to be confirmed.But the biggest factor if one wants their transaction to be confirmed in the next block is the transaction fee rate used. I am somehow certain that your friend did not use the Optimal fee rate, thus a delay in confirming his transactionQuote from: Stepstowealth on February 28, 2023, 09:05:04 PMAm I missing something, is the movement of bitcoin from one exchange to another faster than moving bitcoins from one wallet like electrum to another?Bitcoins from an exchange to another have to also get confirmed using the Bitcoin network, so it won't be any different if the same fee rate is used as for a transaction from an electrum wallet to another.  The advantage is that exchanges broadcast the transactions with a fee rate that is even higher than the optimal one in most cases, so chances of the transaction getting confirmed in the next block are very high.Internal transfers (from one account to another of the same exchange) do not involve Bitcoin network confirmations, so these are usually instant.",

For checking the current mempool status few members already posted the links so make sure he is using the right fee for faster transfer.And no worries even if the transaction stuck for longer time period when you enabled Replace-by-fee (RBF) so you can change the feed to higher if mempool gets clogged after you broadcasted the transaction.About exchanges they always use a lot higher fee than current fee required for transaction that is why it gets confirmed soon but its isn't that instant cause they send withdrawals by batch in the mean time you have to wait too.",

Yes bitcoin does have the fastest transactions in the world (that includes centralized payment systems and altcoins)!Unfortunately certain scam altcoins (like ethereum and ripple) have been advertised as \"fast\" just because they have faster block generation. The thing is \"speed\" is NOT defined as the time your transaction is included in a block BUT it is defined as the time it takes for your transaction to become irreversible.In most traditional payment systems (your bank cards, PayPal, etc.) the transaction remains reversible for months.In a lot of altcoins it takes weeks for the transaction to go deep enough in the blockchain to be considered irreversible. Some altcoins it never becomes irreversible because they have mutable blockchains or they are centralized.When it comes to bitcoin because the blockchain is immutable and it is decentralized and it works correctly, with 1-3 confirmation which takes between a couple of seconds to half an hour, your transaction becomes irreversible.This is why bitcoin has one of the fastest transactions.",

I say this because my friend has been complaining about a transaction, that he made from his electrum wallet to another wallet and has been waiting for hours for it to go. The transaction fee rate, which is the sat/bit you pay when you initiate the transaction, determines the speed of the transaction from one wallet to another. The miners are rewarded by the transaction fee we paid during such a transaction, so they process transactions with a high fee rate faster than those with a low fee rate, which is why the transaction takes time to process.QuoteAm I missing something, is the movement of bitcoin from one exchange to another faster that moving bitcoins from one wallet like electrum to another?Third-party crypto exchanges typically have a fixed transaction fee rate for their transactions, so sending Bitcoin from one exchange to another will only be dependent on your device network and will take very little time.QuoteWhat determines speed of transactions?The rate of the transaction fee paid to initiate the transaction in the mempool.",

I did not say a transaction with a lower fee rate will be confirmed ahead of a transaction with a higher fee rate.Fee rate is important but not only this. Transaction fee will be a multiplier of fee rate and transaction size and I meant if two transactions that use a same fee rate, a transaction with bigger size will confirmed ahead of a transaction with smaller size. This happens if two transactions won't be confirmed in a same block.If they won't be confirmed in a same block, a transaction with smaller size will likely confirmed in a next block if mempool won't be loaded up suddenly with too higher fee rates.They (same fee-rated transactions) won't be confirmed based on \"first comes, first serves\" in mempools.",
