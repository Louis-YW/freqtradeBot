Chromia Forcast in coinridersBut I also want to hear humans what your opinion on it? It is definitely not a scam project as it is backed by a well-funded (received $50m investment) company called Chromaway.With its unique architecture - relational blockchain - and interesting NFT tech (a standard that utilizes dynamic NFTs), it will be huge in midterm.In the next bull, one of the bullish narratives will definitely be GameFi/Gaming and L1s which utilized for that purpose will be huge. Chromia will be running on unlimited tps with sidechains and many strong gaming projects will be running on its blockchain (already My Neighbour Alice and Mines of Dalarnia are on this list).Also, Chromia will be one of the main official blockchain solutions for European Union and it has a strong relationship with the South America tech scene - already has a land registry project there.My price prediction in a midterm timeframe (1-2 years) will be around $15-$20 which puts the project around 12b mcap with current inflation (around 10%). I have been investing undervalued L1s since 2014 and Chromia is my next 100-200x project right now.As always, DYOR and check their website/roadmap and gitlab for their development progress...",
