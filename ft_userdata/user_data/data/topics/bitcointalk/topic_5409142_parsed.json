The smartcontract they built only works according to the commands on their dapps. When they want to control user funds like stopping withdrawals, just disable the button. And also, they eventually slowly built a semi-centralized subservices and made it more prominent with a bigger return offer. Using the \"defi\" brand is nothing more than bait for users and a way to make regulation less restrictive and demanding consumer protection.",
