But when I started Reading through Some threads in Economics,politics And society I Was So overwhelmed because the forum is actually vast in scope than i epected And every Topic is treated in details And all the answers are gotten in a giffy then I said To Myslf that this forum is actually an institution of learning or I will rather Say that It is a ‘ CITADEL OF KNOWLEDGE’ . So I Really appreciate all the High ranked members for educating us the newbies And also letting us know that  the forum is not all about bitcoin And cryptocurrency rather the forum comprises every Sphere of life .",

Its not like some are doing only for the purpose of being paid. Also what you meant by garbage isnt that the bounty topics that lingering around? Newbies tend to shift their attention to more related earning topics than focuses on the real idea about bitcoin or any related topics about that.",

The main purpose of the forum being the discussion of bitcoin has the most interest of people because that is where everyone that first comes to this forum aims at and better becoming knowledgeable in that field of study. There are other boards, but I can’t beat my chest fully that informations there are actually correct and exact the way it is, only those that have knowledge about that can say and since no much interest of people there, sometimes there are bunch of scams and unproven facts flying around there. Whatever the case maybe, don’t believe everything there if you haven’t verified it yourself. Overall, you can learn anything here, but know when and when not something is genuine or not, most can be verified through reliable links attached to the topic of discussion.",

      "body": "I have to admit that I was just as impressed as you OP when I first came to this forum. Discussing on social media, we might only get more emojis and short words which make the discussion less constructive. but here all posts are required to always not go off topic. And spam replies will be immediately found by the moderator and deleted or with the cooperation of users who will immediately report to the moderator every time there is a reply that is off topic or just contains spam. But even though there are many boards here that don't look like they are related to Bitcoin, if you look deeper then actually most of the boards are related to Bitcoin, just from a different angle. Like from an economic perspective, of course Bitcoin will always be related to finance. especially after bitcoin is increasingly preferred as a commodity asset and potential investment asset. There are even countries that have made bitcoin a means of payment. Which has even helped the country indirectly after the country adopted bitcoin as a means of payment. like El Salvador which continues to be flooded with tourists who are curious about El Salvador after adopting bitcoin as a legal means of payment. Even the name El Salvador is now becoming better known and that's after adopting Bitcoin.In other forums, sometimes the rules are just a display. but here everything is run well under the supervision of admin, staff, moderators, DT and also users who care and contribute a lot to this forum.",

Many newbies come here to absorb the insights that have been spread on the Bitcointalk forum, generations continue to change and those who are seniors never get bored of directing newbies on paths that can lead them to learning that can broaden their insight.That's right, this forum is very broad, there are lots of discussion rooms discussing different knowledge in the forum. Every quality topic will be pinned on every board, the aim is to make it easier for newbies to learn the content contained in it. The most beautiful thing I have ever seen here is when Newbies greet the Seniors by introducing themselves as newcomers, the Seniors willingly direct them to topics that give them insight.The feeling of mutual care, respect and support for each other can only be found here, even though they never meet each other face to face, forum members are always ready to help anyone who needs knowledge. It is natural to call Bitcointalk a citadel of Knowledge.",

I have personally found trading discussion forum very useful as I used to trader and include some of the ideas share over there. But, we need to be cautious as this forum contains scammers as well and you will find people saying users promoting scam projects which you can see regularly under Altcoin section. Whenever I am unsure of something i usually search for the particular keyword of the topic in this forum and go with the response or information shared by a trusted user. This platform is a boon for us if we utilise it in the right way.",

If you want to learn in the forum you have many useful threads but you have to select among all the garbage. This is certainly true. The forum may look perfect to educate every forum member but if you see it more closely, there are also a lot of post who are not showing rationality and are obviously made only because the signature campaign requires it to do so. While there are various topics that would fit for every newbie in the forum, but there are also series of topics that are just redundantly made just to contribute to the forum.But in general, I would say the bitcointalk forum is still the most reputable and the most reliable avenue when it comes to facts and worthy experiences. Just learn to sort out every topic if it can still be useful for you or not anymore.",

On the forum, you will definitely get wild knowledge about whatever you want to know regarding cryptocurrency, but the thing is that the knowledge of each individual does not depend on their rank, like you talked about high rank. Rank is only measured by the number or activity and merit earned, not specifically because of the knowledge. For example, there are users that get favors from merit sources, and because of that, they can quickly earn merit and rank up quickly.",

What I see is that the Bitcointalk forum is a good and educational forum so that we become knowledgeable and smart people, especially in crypto and others. and op you are in a good place because here you can learn and ask something you want to ask, but in my opinion when we are in this forum we should only be able to take positive things. and of course, if there is criticism, of course we should not despair because according to what I feel, criticism from members here is aimed at educating, don't take it to heart.In essence, this forum is a storehouse of knowledge and discussion, for people who have a lot of knowledge, they can share knowledge here and for those whose knowledge is not yet high, they can absorb the knowledge provided by members of this forum who have extensive knowledge.",

I think it is the oldest forum about Bitcoin so it is an information bank of the ecosystem. Almost everything that affects the bitcoinspace has been discussed here. The discussion on this forum also extends beyond cryptocurrencies to almost every area of life. But my advice is that you don't take everything that you read without verifying it. That means you have to read through any thread that interests you and sample the members to check the validity and reliability. You could also do research beyond the forum because there are also other reliable platforms that could help you to authenticate if the information is genuine. All the high-ranking members that are contributing to the forum were once newbies like you. But they invested time to study Bitcoin and today they can contribute positively to the forum. That is how we are expected to grow in knowledge so that we can also assist other newbies.",
