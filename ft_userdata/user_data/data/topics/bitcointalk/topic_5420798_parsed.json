  "content": "Hi everybody,I am thinking of doing a limited edition of 16 \"Scam Coins\" Inspired by anarcoins, microsoul lucky coin, and the collapse of FTX this coin would be like a lottery. 15 won't have any funds on them (FTX), and one lucky coin will have all the funds of the 16 coins (Sam). If each coin should be funded with 100,000 sats, the lucky one will get 1,600,000 sats and the others get rekt.It's an idea, I am just looking if that could interest someone and if it is feasible. Don't hesitate to comment and show your interest or not. The serial of the coin could be 0-1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-a-b-c-d-e-f so that the winner could be determined by the hash of a block. I would probably take one coin  . Of course there is still a lot of question: material of the coin, design, price,... this is an open thread.Thank you for your attention.If interested, just let me know.Cheers.FrankSCAM COINS1 - Bullion-n-BTC2 - krogoth3 - QuakerBull4 - comit5 - geophphreigh6 - MoparMiningLLC7 - Est20138 - CoinHeated 9 - PeakDK10 - 2stout11 - MrCryptHodl12 - DirtyBirdE13 - Stackinsats77714 - Cryptogreatdane15 - JanEmil16 - minerjones17 - tweetious18 - PreciousMetapsICT19 - heisty20 - hotdog721 - Steeley22 - YodasRedRocket23 - owlcatz24 - Amax1625 -  Frank AlpenCoin26 - mortare27 - sunnybwoy28 - dozerz29 - Markzellers30 - pinky123431 - Agrawas32 - BTCOVERFIATS33 - Kryptowerk34 - bigtimespaghetti35 - Spokanistan5136 - SatsLife37 - ChitBitCTY38 - Primo - bitAnd some anon Swiss bitcoiners..",
