For now focus on yourself!",

You really should take cautions if you get added to any group eventually.",

Regarding creating a group, there's already some discussions in the forum so I don't see the point of creating a Telegram group for discussing trends when there's already something for that already existing, don't fix it if it ain't broke right?",

I was introduced to one of these groups and discussions were going well until the creators of the group gradually started introducing their agenda. The target was to gain the confidence of the group members and lure us to invest in a shitcoin. They introduced one worthless coin and told us to invest in it. That's how I stopped commenting and suddenly they disappeared with people's money. If you also want to create your discussion group, ensure your make rules and watch out for these scammers. Don't hesitate to remove any member or group of members that keep on spreading lies or want to promote any scam project. This is why you need to learn more about the crypto market before starting such a group. You need to know when people promote falsehood or a scam project.",

Joining other groups in social media is not a bad idea, but not everyone likes it. For example, I don't like joining any other groups outside of this forum because doing so has resulted in some people today becoming victims of scams. Similarly, many people use social media platforms like Twitter and Telegram to con others and steal their suffering.I didn't mean to imply that the formation of groups is undesirable, but rather that I am not overly interested in joining one because it is better to be afraid than to take a chance.",

That's possible, highly possible, I never ruled it out. My opening sentence, \"Start by proving yourself first...\" in that same post you quoted from clearly leads OP on the path to genuinely prove themselves if they truly know their onions.Sadly, we've seen these type of cases where those who purport to have a handle on cryptos and then create social media handles end up as average; not so much better than those they want to teach.There was one that started something like this last year and then gave out a Twitter handle. My curiosity drove me to check him out on Twitter. From Twitter he gave us a telegram handle. Dude started well and had a few wins before burning his accounts and those who pooled resources for his trading challenge.",

Dude started well and had a few wins before burning his accounts and those who pooled resources for his trading challenge. In this scenario we ought to be very mindful especially whatever that concerns social precisely twitter. I stopped channeling my efforts on twitter as I believe people often make false news and gives fake signals in other to benefits them, I could also flashed back then when I joined a WhatsApp that shares trading signals as well. That made me to create account in some of those exchange like hotbit and many, but at ending part I noticed I lost hugely because I wasn't that good in trading whatever. So after some loses I decided not to involved myself anymore with either group or channels that gives out signals or shares ideas in common about trading rather devoting myself the do them myself instead of depending on a fellows skills.",

As for me, I'm just neutral because I'm not a fan of any messaging group to discuss things but I'm already contented on what forums like Bitcointalk has to offer. There is still a section here for speculating things",
