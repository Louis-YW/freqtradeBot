      "body": "The main point about a currency is that it is controlled by banks or governments. Before we get a one-world currency, we need to find a method to do it that is totally decentralized, so that nobody controls how it works. Why? Because controllers get paid for their work, like anybody else on a job. But currency controllers can mess with our lives to actually steal from us by adjusting the way that the currency works.Other than that, all it takes is bargaining between people... face to face over computer screens. And, of course, language barrier removal.Note that Bitcoin combined with Nostr just might be the start of something like this. Nostr is about as decentralized as you can get. The trick is trust in Bitcoin, when you don't literally meet the other person in your transaction, and when you have to trust that he is going to send the product you paid him for.",

They don't understand that varying culture creates divergence. Probably rooted in tribal instinct, but who really knows.",

Can the world ever come to such compromise if they had the opportunity to?Not unless there will be one single alliance / government to rule us all. Personally i would see one true currency it causing more problems then current system. I am not sure how we would control it, or more likely who would control it. Right now countries use their own money to manage crisis situations. And inflation is a good buffer for it. But when leaders of these countries couldn't control the supply, that stabilization method wouldn't be optional. And that's just a one problem.",

The way some people view a certain thing might differs from others and they canâ€™t both be blamed for their intuition about it. It would be fantastic if such a thing happened, but have you considered the negative consequences, who will be the regulators, and do you believe that the high-profile countries will welcome this idea to be on par with the low-profile countries? As far as the world is concerned, centralization will continue; it cannot be stopped now, but it can be reduced to some extent. If centralization is abolished today, this will be possible.",

Can the world ever come to such compromise if they had the opportunity to?Tribalism and nationalism will keep on dividing the world along tribal and national lines. Strong and prosperous nations will never want to share the same currency with poor nations because it might not give them the competitive advantage. These first world nations use their currency to influence the economy of developing nations. Greed and the undying quest for power and influence will not allow these powerful nations to have one currency. These are just my thoughts because we have several prophesies from some religious bodies that before Armageddon, the nations of the world will adopt one currency. Some religious fanatics have even predicted without any evidence that Bitcoin is that currency.",

Can the world ever come to such compromise if they had the opportunity to?The world agrees on the value of gold everywhere and at all times, and this did not help unite humanity away from its cultural differences. All systems of exchange between people were human production that differed from one people to another according to the culture of each of them. And the process of unification was never an easy task, especially since the currency is always a tool to impose power within certain geographical boundaries (state, empire, or province).As someone explained to you in the comments above, the problem is with the entity that will work to produce that unified currency, which must be decentralized so that no one succeeds in manipulating it. I think that these characteristics only apply to Bitcoin at the present time, unless we want to start implementing the idea from scratch.",
