You can never sell it to anyone else after you bought that token (so it can't act as a stablecoin)You can come back and buy more of it since I can create as much as I want anytime I want but you can never sell those tokens to anybody else so you'll have to own them forever.Will you buy this token?Feel free to explain and tell me if the price would be a factor (eg. if the token was sold for $20 or $2000).",

Until now it's not clear. I've bought 0.5 eth.then proceed to the airdrop and also buy it occasionally from the website. I don't regret it because I just fomo and join in. but after getting to know the bitcointalk forum at least to have altcoins, I just want to participate in the bounty. You also have the same opportunity, friend. at least it will make you have a new token token. although you can also buy it on the website in any project. I think everyone has a different analysis. if you are not satisfied with the distribution of the bounty you can buy it yourself to have more. to d save. I think you are looking for a new project token?",

Those NFT arts that have been kept by those people that just want to buy like a piece of it because they admire the artist.

If i can never sell that token why would i buy it in the first place. Crypto coins and tokens are mainly bought by investors because they obviously are hoping that those assets will increase in price after they have bought them. So if that possibility is not there for your token there won't be anyone that buys that token.Or are you planning some functions for your token? Like, you get a certain share of the earnings of your project depending on how many tokens you own or something like that? Even if that would be the case though, why would you make that token unable to change it's price and sellable then?",

I will not waste my time investing in nonsense tokens that don't have value, because most likely happen, they will become a shit token even though how good the project it is. Possibly, it will dump the price in the market after there is a massive selling. It is very risky for me if we will invest in the kind of characteristic in the token, it seems we are just burning our money in that way which is not really good. I rather invest in BTC than the useless token.",

It's price fixed mean I can be at a loss with it. Already many speculations has been made on how secured some of this stable coin are, so if you can ensure security as well I believe many would be interested in your proposed token.",
