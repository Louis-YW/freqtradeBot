Haven't this make the whole anonymous and freedom dream of Nakamoto failed? There's no guarantee that everyone's dream will be fulfilled. Every innovation has to go through the test of time and bitcoin is no exception here. Currently bitcoin has reached to such a level where only a handful of innovation can reach. Isn't that enough? There was a coin which aimed to fulfil the vision of Satoshi, but failed miserably! It's good to stay within the limit of law. Revolutionary idea is great but it may not yield great results if you try to execute.",

The bitcointalk room is the place to understand and learn all the information you need, because in this room many relevant things are discussed according to the facts that happened and I'm sure you will definitely understand, if you are serious about studying the discussion threads of this issue in the bitcointalk room.QuoteSatoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as the perfect P2P digital money but today people are forced to pay tax on their holdings. Haven't this make the whole anonymous and freedom dream of Nakamoto failed?  What you need to understand is that Satoshi Nakamoto never failed to create bitcoin as a perfect digital currency, there is no direct relationship between taxes and the correlation of the creation of bitcoins that are run using a P2P system.There are some countries that adopt a low tax system or a tax free country like El Salvador, anonymous is not only with regards to taxes, because many other technical things are related to it and each country adopts a different system in setting taxes on bitcoin travel",

Haven't this make the whole anonymous and freedom dream of Nakamoto failed? Bitcoins remain anonymous, taxes are taken from exchanges, wallets, banks, visas and so on, taxes do not apply to Bitcoins, you can still transact and buy Bitcoins anonymously.Taxes apply to exchanges when Bitcoin is turned into fiat money, taxes apply to fiat transactions, not to Bitcoin, exchanges only deduct Bitcoin transaction fees, governments can't cut taxes on Bitcoin, they can do it on fiat.Satoshi and Bitcoin do not fail when it comes to being anonymous.QuoteAnonymous¬†means: No application or tracker can reveal the identity of an anonymous¬†user(even if they claim they can)!Understand Anonymous, are you currently being tracked by the tax authorities for your identity when buying and selling Bitcoin, of course not, you can be tracked and your identity traced when sending fiat, not with your Bitcoin account or identity.",

That means you're yet not used to having the understanding of how bitcoin works and how to remain decentralized on it, as long as you have your bitcoin on a decentralized wallet there's no how government can regulate you to pay them tax elae the finished work of Satoshi over decentralization and freedom in finances will not be completed with you, p2p cannot be monitored by centralized authorities but centralized exchanges can be monitored and regulated.",

They believe that if one makes an investment, they should receive a portion of the profits. Bitcoin is here to put an end to that, and everyone will have complete control over their money. Only centralized exchanges allow governments to extract taxes from your money, according to findings. Nonetheless, each country has its own taxation prices, which can be favorable in some places and harsh in others.

Governments will always try to tax everything they can, as good as they can.In some countries holding is taxed, in other countries only the capital gains (in fiat) are taxed.People can hide their coins from the government, it's not that hard, but it can be seen as tax evasion and that's illegal.Satoshi's dream was to give the right tools to avoid the banks if we want to. Taxation is, as you see, not necessarily related to this.So Satoshi's dream didn't fail. Even more, the things are actually getting better in that direction, ie the number of entities accepting bitcoins for their goods and services is increasing.",

Haven't this make the whole anonymous and freedom dream of Nakamoto failed? So in your vision bitcoin was developed to avoid taxation? It was never supposed to do that, it was created as a mean of allowing people to send and receive value without the need for a third party, Satoshi never claimed anything about tax avoidance not in the whitepaper, not in his posts on this board.Quote from: NdaMk on December 09, 2022, 05:45:41 PMThey believe that if one makes an investment, they should receive a portion of the profits. Bitcoin is here to put an end to that, and everyone will have complete control over their money. Only centralized exchanges allow governments to extract taxes from your money, according to findings. Put an end, no, no way that's going to happen!Before the bank and centralized exchanges existed how were taxes imposed, in times like the middle ages for example when everything was genuinely peer to peer? Just because you hide your coins in your pocket you think you will avoid taxation, pretty curious about those \"findings\" hat let you believe that.What happens when you buy a car, a hotdog, or a bus ticket, you pay VAT! What happens when your income shows $12k a year but you bought a $100k home or a $10k car, do you think that if the government wants to track you for reel for any sum they won't be able to do so? ¬†You can't eat coins, you can't drink them, and can't live in one, sooner or later you will have to get them from your wallet and purchase things in the real world and that's when taxation will start.Taxations will only end when the government will stop them, you would be amazed how easily they will find ways to tax whatever you own no matter what you use.",
