I can understand why people are thinking like that caused by bitcoin is going back again in the right track. There's no need to feel worry about that. As long as people are sticking only into the major coins and they will not lose their value. The major coins will become first coins to be pumped after bitcoin. Im also feeling if we are heading toward another bullish trend again. So a good deal of news related to the bitcoin ETH has been triggering the bull trend to come. I can even imagine how big the hype for the next halving once SEC will give approval for bitcoin ETF launched by some companies. Im feeling very optimistic about crypto now. Even though some crypto are still stuck in the same place. Let's wait and see what's gonna happen with bitcoin. Bitcoin is likely to increase very soon along with altcoins. It's not wrong to take bitcoin as measurement to determine how close we are toward bullish trend.",

I see some people just follow the trend and are also very lucky to have big profits, but we all understand the playing field is very fair, there will be people who are happy, so it is wise to research everything You can see things in a more positive light. Currently the market is in an uncertain and volatile state because of my personal news I prefer something clear although the long-term vision always believes in the market but maybe for short players limit, they will need a little more risk as well as time to decide.",

Not because we're about to enter the bull run again, it doesn't mean that any choice we make is going to be also included in the bull run.Especially with the new projects, you'll have hard time in dealing with them and likely they're only great with their launching but after that the dumping starts.It's not just coming from the investors but also from the developers that have been entrusted by the investors with their money. This is cycle that keeps on repeating and being seen.",

So far as of writing, the prices of coins are going up. If it breaks that $31k resistance, this will cause a lot of people to go back to crypto and buy back what they have sold. Only to find out, they are going to be buying at a higher price.",

We can always sell some during big pumps and then buy back again when the prices drop. New coins are always very risky so it is better to avoid most of them until the market is clearly bullish which is expected to happen next year. There are exceptions though especially when their platforms are already existing like Arbitrum, Zk, and other projects.",

There's no right entry points in the first place if you are into long term holding as long as it is below ATH 'coz when bullrun comes ATH is believed to be broken. But still there's no assurance and certainty of things. Waiting could also put you at risk of FOMO so just move in your comfort.

Especially every saturday and sunday of market crypto will be more green than before, i thought this the best time for DCA or scalpingIndeed surprising. A top coin of this market having 100% increase within hour/s is something. But is it enough to determine a bullrun? I doubt. So better watch out for those investors who are planning to make a purchase given how fast the increase happened. Consolidation may still occur.",

While making choice we should be very watchful and mindful with the kind of coin we randomly select out there so to avoid mistake.",
