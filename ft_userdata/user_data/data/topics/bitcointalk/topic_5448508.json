You must be a Nigerian, have seen complaints of banking errors both in this forum and online regarding interbank transfer. Even transaction done on the blockchain network sometimes delay, it's all depends how fast and congested the network is. I have sent a Bitcoin transaction before that took almost 8hrs before it arrived at my receiving address, from the receiving side it was showing confirming, that's the transaction was successful but not yet confirmed on the blockchain. Both the banking sector and that of Blockchain transaction due delay sometimes but the difference is that you don't need to launch complaints to any party on the blockchain side because you can see everything from your own end.",

The majority of people tend to go with the idea of \"what the government says or do is always right\" and because the government is looking for a way to bring down Bitcoin they then paint it as a means of committing scams and that has also made some potential bitcoin adopters lose their interest in bitcoin. Op, we have seen some threads of some Bitcoiners implementing Bitcoin as a payment method in their business and with time and consistent awareness creation they'll be an improvement in the adoption of Bitcoin.",

Cryptocurrencies operate on the basis of blockchain technology, which allows direct and fast transactions between participants, bypassing intermediaries such as banks.However, it must be understood that cryptocurrencies also come with their own risks, including high price volatility and the possibility of fraud. In addition, not all companies and stores accept cryptocurrencies as payment, so in some cases you will still need to use traditional banking transactions.In the end, the choice between using cryptocurrencies and traditional banking transactions depends on your individual needs and comfort level with blockchain technology.",

If your tokens or coins are accidentally sent to the wrong address in the crypto space, you will not be able to recover them, and you should be aware of this. So, knowing that, you will undoubtedly be cautious about your sending address, and there is very little chance that you will send to the incorrect address. I recommend that you use Bitcoin as your cryptocurrency. The point of what I've said is that using Bitcoin is not scary if you know what you're doing.",

It's going to be a gradual process and soon every business will be accepting Bitcoin as the advantages would had gone mainstream by then.For now there are still many negative stories been spread by the media and government yet, we have still having success compare to 10 years ago around when Bitcoin just came out. In the future there'll also be a progress in the adoption speed compared to where we are today.When speaking about adoption of cryptocurrency, use Bitcoin instead of crypto because that's the goals at the moment, the community is fighting for the adoption of Bitcoin and not cryptocurrency which involves altcoins and other shitcoins that can't receive global adoption.",
