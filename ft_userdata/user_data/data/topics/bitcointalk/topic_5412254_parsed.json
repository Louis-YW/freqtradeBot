  "content": "Olena Zelenska, the wife of the President of Ukraine told BBC's Laura Kuenssberg at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv on Thursday that Ukraine was not getting strong support from its allies. I began to ponder that maybe if they had gotten the right support they would have defeated Russia or forced Russia to retreat or negotiate. Also, I am in the dark about what kind of support she expected to get from Ukraine's friends. Was she expecting the US and its allies to join the war or is the refusal to declare a no-fly-zone a sign of lack of support? European nations are suffering today because they have sacrificed so much for Ukraine. So many European nations today are going through an economic downturn because they decided to join the sanctions against Russia. The high cost of gas is eating the income of the people and some European nations are not sure of their sources of supply if Russia finally stops the flow.  US and EU nations have been criticized for giving Ukraine the best assistance ever and abandoning other war-torn nations. Ukrainian refugees have been accepted with open arms around Europe. These nations have given Ukraine modern sophisticated war equipment and billions now going to trillions of dollars have been committed to this war. Yes, as the first lady of the nation she is in pain because of the devastation of the invasion. Hence, she might make some statements out of emotional pressures and war trauma. But, is it true that Ukraine is not getting strong support from its friends?    https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62766917?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA",
