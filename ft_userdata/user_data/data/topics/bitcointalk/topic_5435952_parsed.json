They are usually \"pegged\" to the main network. That means any problems in the main network may not completely affect the side-chain. Side-chains can even have their own mining algorithm and a stand-alone blockchain.Example: Rootstock, Blockstream's Liquid,...This difference is the reason why 1 LN bitcoin is exactly 1 bitcoin but 1 sidechain bitcoin doesn't have to be 1 bitcoin, it could be 1000 wrapped-bitcoin or 0.5.",

Because if we would have transaction joining, then it would be possible to join all sidechain transactions into a single mainchain transaction.When it comes to public keys, and regular signatures, it is definitely possible to join them. The bottleneck could be in case of script-based outputs, but since we have Taproot, it is possible to join revealed public keys, and then push on-chain only the latest script.Also, a lot of script operations are perfectly defined in ECDSA, for example if you have OP_ADD, you can just add public keys. That means, some script-based outputs could be rewritten into Schnorr-signatures-based outputs.",

Also, LN is a layer \"one and a half\", because you cannot send coins directly in LN, without touching the first layer, if someone has no channel. The true second layer would allow locking for example 1 BTC, and splitting it between thousands of channels, without any on-chain transactions. Also, because of that bottleneck, you cannot build another layer on top of LN, because it would still require on-chain interaction.QuoteEVM-compatible blockchainIt is not required.

Isn't it more like a transitioning to another currency, rather than just creation of currency?IIRC Counterparty burned bitcoins for the initial distribution of their XCP token, maybe they've burned more coins since then but that's beside the point. When I refer to OMNI and Counterparty creating a currency of their own I don't mean their native tokens (if you can call them that) but I mean the tokens that are created using those native tokens. USDT in the case of OMNI.... and... sigh... Rare Pepes in the case of Counterparty, for example. The denomination, amount, value etc. of these tokens being largely independent of the value of the Bitcoin transactions underneath.Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on January 19, 2023, 12:13:37 PMQuote from: HeRetiK on January 19, 2023, 11:55:49 AMLiquid is just one example though.

Rootstock isn't trust requiring. So, what's the broad distinction between L2 and sidechain?Like I said above: I think the clearest distinction is that sidechains run on separate blockchains while layer 2 solutions in general not necessarily require one.Or another view: Layer 2 can be seen like the layers of the OSI model, eg. HTTP running on top of TCP/IP (I believe that this is even the root of the L2 nomenclature in the first place?) while sidechains connected to a main chain can be compared to LANs connected to the Internet. Fun thing is this analogy even accounts for LANs requiring protocol layers on top of the base layer to function, just as sidechains need more than just basic transactions.Quote from: garlonicon on January 19, 2023, 12:23:32 PMThe true second layer would allow locking for example 1 BTC, and splitting it between thousands of channels, without any on-chain transactions. Also, because of that bottleneck, you cannot build another layer on top of LN, because it would still require on-chain interaction.I believe what you are describing is pretty much what is described in the channel factory proposal for a potential layer between LN and the base layer:https://tik-old.ee.ethz.ch/file//a20a865ce40d40c8f942cf206a7cba96/Scalable_Funding_Of_Blockchain_Micropayment_Networks%20(1).pdfApart from that I believe you can still add another layer on top of LN in the form of colored coins via LN? Though the viability of that seems to be controversial.Quote from: Nefelibato on January 19, 2023, 12:21:29 PMAnd if we also introduce the State channels in the comparison? I deduce that they are pay channels. Are they not the same as an atomic swap?No, atomic swaps take place across blockchains.",

      "body": "Sidechains are not protected by Layer 1 and they have their own consensus, unlike Layer 2.Quote from: HeRetiK on January 19, 2023, 01:05:16 PMNo, atomic swaps take place across blockchains. The Technology Behind Atomic SwapsA valid transaction requires a signature. This signature can only be created by the person that has access to the private key. When you send a transaction you usually sign it and broadcast it to the network afterward. HTLCs are based on a technology called state channels. All you need to know is that they allow you to exchange signed transactions securely. Only once the participants decide they are done transacting, the final state is broadcast to the blockchain.The “Hashed” part of HTLC means that a hash serves as a lock for the contract, to protect it from a third party accessing it. The “Timelock” part refers to the contract having an expiration date.Two conditions must be met to perform an Atomic Swap between two crypto assets: Both assets and their underlying blockchain need to support the same hashing algorithm, like SHA-256 in the case of Bitcoin and both blockchains need to support some kind of programmability that allows an HTLC to be deployed.",
