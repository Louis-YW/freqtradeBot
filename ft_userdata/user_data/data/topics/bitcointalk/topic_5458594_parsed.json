As a responsible seller, my priority is to find a legitimate buyer and conduct the transaction in a safe and secure environment. To ensure transparency and build trust, I am open to meeting in person for a conversation. We can discuss the details of the transaction and even verify the coins if you're open to it.Please contact me on Telegram- Cryptodeskop.
