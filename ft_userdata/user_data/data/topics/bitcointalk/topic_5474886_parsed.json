      "body": "At least they gave a pre information before planning to shut down. This is more reasons why it's not advisable to leave your funds on centralized exchanges as they can wake up one morning and decide they are shutting operations. Although for Bittrex's case, they files for bankruptcy in May after being sued by the SEC for operating a national securities exchange without seeking their approval. From the looks of this news, it seems the CEO, Oliver Linch lost the battle after much huff about dealing with the charges vigorously. I'm wondering if it's the $24m settlement given to the SEC that crumbled the company.",

It could also be the reason mixers are flourishing which is in line with the reason for the creation of Bitcoin. Bittrex is known for having one of the most rigorous KYC process, maybe people just got fed up with such herculean process when there are better alternatives. For instance, to complete KYC in Binance and Kucoin, a Nigeria just need his Bank Verification Number (BVN) and the KYC process will be completed in minutes. Unlike Bittrex where a valid ID and proof of address as well as funds are mandatory. I just hope this does not have negative impact on the entire cryptocurrency market.",

Almost 3 years I have been with Bittrex but finally I decided to leave because of a KYC case. This has never happened before and my friend was not asked for this condition, they can still transact. I have to create a passport for activities on Exchange as KYC compliance. Since then I was disappointed, I had to make a passport. After KYC fulfillment I finally quit Bittrex.",

Now a days there are many exchanges who are going to shut down, what will be the reason for that? Even the market was at the good price though and we have seen some positive moves previously.But the way the exchanges are shutting down is quite harmful for the crypto itself I think, even there are many people who still using those exchanges which didn't have a high volume even but they still doing trade there.",

      "body": "I believe they should have taken some measures to inform their clients to start transferring their funds to their own personal wallets for their own safety, because that is what is available whenever such a thing wants to take place. Sometimes what I believe causes exchanges and casinos to shut down is not really about liquidity but just some basic principles they ignore, which are sometimes as vital or important as the case may be. For instance, when it comes to awareness, publicity is very important, and as such, when it is noticed that the traffic is beginning to reduce, what it is showing is that such an organization would need to strengthen or take a step to do an advertisement or a promotional campaign to revive and make known their presence to be in existence, but they fail to look in that direction but rather decide to shut down. But however, it is good they returned assets belonging to their customers, and that would speak for them whenever they decide or plan a return.",

I stand with you totally on this. Trust wallet is very porus. I know of a colleague who got robbed of her coins last year May without trace till date, like the coin just vanished into thin air, and all attempts to reach their support proved abortive for a while, when they reluctantly replied they didn't give a valid response and at some point stopped responding as well. That singular at set me on my heels away from them.The security is weak compared to Electrum that I currently use.",

Actually they have close operation last several months exactly on May 2023 before deadline day withdrawing fund on the early December 2023. Still not late for user who have fund in this exchange to withdraw to their personal wallet before Bittrex exchange operation close totally and not ability withdrawing again if have pass deadline day. I don't know what happen with my Bittrex account because when opening required with KYC where have pass for long term when first time using this exchange, I don't remember with how much assets in this exchange but looks not enough time due KYC process manually and deadline for withdrawing left few days later.",

It could also be the reason mixers are flourishing which is in line with the reason for the creation of Bitcoin. Increased crypto awareness is now making people know the importance of holding their keys but this is the case of strict regulation by the US SEC. Most exchanges make the majority of profit from the US market. Without the US market, many of them will become bankrupt and I think this was the case of Bittrex Global after its US arm was forced out of the US crypto market.

Exchanges that want to operate in the US will have to comply with the regulatory laws. I think they will be fine if they allow the SEC to have access to all their transactions. Maybe in future will might have exchanges that will operate like commercial banks with the government having total control over them. Bittrex Global has given customers till December 4 to withdraw all their funds, this is the beauty of the winding up.",
