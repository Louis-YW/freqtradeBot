  "content": "Because of the story https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401052.0#msg60271061, until now most people, especially my entire extended family and also people around me, call my child Bitcoin.Actually, most of them don't really know what Bitcoin really is, especially old people and small children because in my area Bitcoin is not very popular and only certain people know about it. And with this story happening, those who know that my child's birth expenses were paid using Bitcoin, want to know more clearly and also want to know what Bitcoin actually is.And after I told them the basics of what Bitcoin is and its benefits, they finally understood and in my conversation with them I did not suggest investing, only that Bitcoin can be used for long-term investments that are profitable from other investments. And it can be used for trading, and can also be used as a transaction tool like money. And both must have a Bitcoin address or wallet that can be done privately, because in the country where I live, Bitcoin or other crypto cannot be used as a means of transaction.And until now when explaining Bitcoin I don't know the developments whether they are involved or not.Actually that's not the purpose of this thread, but more aimed at my son who most people call my son Bitcoin.And at first I felt uncomfortable because my child had a beautiful name, but over time I got used to it and if my child was called Bitcoin he would definitely respond more because he was used to it. And I'm worried that my child will be called Bitcoin when he grows up, and I also feel uncomfortable if there are questions about Bitcoin because I'm afraid of answering it wrong.",

Certainly, many people would be curious to know why he is nicknamed as such and the story behind it. I am sad, however, that it seems to me it is hard to do cryptocurrency business in your own country. This is actually my first time to hear a story on this nature and you should be proud to be the first one in this forum. Now, am planning to get a dog and named it Bitcoin so my pet will officially be a cryptocurrency.",

And I'm worried that my child will be called Bitcoin when he grows up, and I also feel uncomfortable if there are questions about Bitcoin because I'm afraid of answering it wrong.First of all, I can relate to the name calling because it's kind of something popular where am staying, I mean tend to relate a name by something symbolic that doesn't even relate to the actual of that person. From the way I see it your son could actually be the Satoshi of your area üòÅüòÅ and ofcourse you will have to answer because the strange name will bring curiosity and that's what drive questions in human but there is nothing too hard to explain moreover you are in wonderful community like Bitcointalk and you have access to all the possible knowledge in the crypto space so make use of the advantage and beside see it as a way of spreading the word and curiousity about Bitcoin to those who seem willing enough to have an Open mind to your explanation.",

I am not trying to question you but when your family does not understand the meaning of Bitcoin or its existence I think they are just making a joke of you. Regardless of its popularity, you have made a joke of yourself and your family that is my point as Bitcoin is not a name. It is the future of someone who is not anyone known to become financially independence. If you have achieved that peak then it is good if not you have made a mockery of that name.",

So I guess bitcoin is a nickname to his child because of the situation that OP told their relatives. I doubt that it will affect the child so much unless bitcoin becomes illegal and the nickname that the child has is carried by the child in the future. I guess OP can talk with his relatives to stop naming the child bitcoin if he is bothered with the potential risk of it.I think naming your child with bitcoin can have it's advantage and disadvantage, it only depend on the perspective of the parents to be honest. There are people who are named with rich, gold, silver, diamond but I guess that there names doesn't affect them that much.Legality of bitcoin on every country is uncertain right now, just take the safest route on naming your child a normal name and just teach them everything you know about bitcoin. Teach them financial literacy at an early age, it will help them so much in the future for sure!",

I don‚Äôt know the legal stand of bitcoin in your country, I assume it‚Äôs not illegal because if it was you won‚Äôt be able to pay hospital bills with bitcoin. That being said, we live in a world that is constantly changing, no one knows what policy your government might take in the future. It will be difficult for you to stop people from calling him Bitcoin especially other kids, the more you insist, the more they will likely call him Bitcoin. I suggest you let the name fade naturally, as the child grows older, he will be able to make his own identity.",

May your Son have a healthy & Happy Life.",

But if you're live in other country, this will be a problem because you're using Bitcoin as legal tender when your country didn't accept Bitcoin as a currency.Hopefully you didn't went viral, but you need to educate your relatives. That already harms the privacy of the kid and the OP, but fuck it, unless we're living in 2070 I don't expect all my neighbors to have a grasp of what cryptocurrencies are, let alone what bitcoin is. They might think it's something to mock the kid eventually though, which is definitely going to affect the kid's future in school and studies, so I say and suggest that OP teach his relatives and friends to refrain from calling the kid as bitcoin when he starts growing up. Think of a different name they can use to refer to the kid as cause it's going to be dangerous for the kid to retain that Bitcoin moniker one way or another and I'm not even exaggerating one bit here. I've seen and experienced first hand just how stupid and dangerous people can get when money's involved. In any case, that's a cute way to call the kid, it lets him know as early as possible of what bitcoin and cryptocurrency is, not that it would really matter cause at the end of the day it's going to be up to the kid when he grows up whether he wants to take upon his dad's footsteps and enter the world of crypto or explore a new realm of passive income that doesn't force him to degen on a stupidly-named cryptocurrency every now and again. But pretty sure 9 times out of 10 early education about all the life skills he's gonna need including financial literacy is going to get him to heights you wouldn't realize possible.",

Being addressed as Bitcoin does not in anyway change the financial status of anyone, benefiting from Bitcoin depends solely on your ability to utilise every opportunity Bitcoin brings and not by broadcasting to the whole world that you possess a certain percentage of Bitcoin. OP started this whole issue at first, if he didn't tell people about his source of income when the child was born, nobody will call his child that. Even after that, he felt comfortable when his child was being addressed as Bitcoin. Its not too late to stop people from calling his child Bitcoin, he just has to caution all close relatives, friends and neighbours who address his son as Bitcoin. The child might be exposed to danger if the child grows with the name 'Bitcoin '.",

There's no need fighting it or feeling sad, it's just a nickname, what will stand your son out in the future will be his character and accomplishments, not the name Bitcoin, so bring him up with good morals and teach him to be industrious, so he can merit the name. If Bitcoin is illegal in your country, that can pose a problem for him, because the authority might want to know what brought about him answering a name that is illegal, although I'm hopeful that in the future Bitcoin will be adopted in the whole world and he'd be proud of the name.",
