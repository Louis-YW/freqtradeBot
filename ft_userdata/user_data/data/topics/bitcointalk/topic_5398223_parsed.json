  "content": "About YERBYERB - The \"Good Shit\" coin!WARNING! Yerbas is a continuous work in progress...Use at your own risk!Yerbas is a community driven, developmental, grassroots, digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. The Yerbas Coin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Yerbas is a code fork of Bitcoin/Dash/Raptoreum and inherits current and optionally future features such as chain locks, oracles etc. The inspiration for the name Yerbas is derived from the Latin(herba) and Español(hierba) words for herb, grass, or weeds.The mission of Yerbas is to commingle the Cryptocurrency and Cannabis communities by providing an easy to use reward and payment system benefiting traders, consumers, artists, merchants and industry providersThe Yerbas blockchain uses the CPU mineable GhostRider algorithm for it's PoW consensus mechanism. It was built to discourage specialty hardware such as ASIC & FPGA enabling anybody to competitively mine and increase overall decentralizationWe endure to succeed where others have failed by first realizing we are not going to replace fiat any time soon, therefor, our main goal of the blockchain is to simply offer rewards and incentives for all aspects of the Crypto-abis culture Coin Info:Our forkin pedigree Bitcoin >> Dash >> Raptoreum >> YerbasFair launch - No premine - No ICOTotal Supply - 420 millionASIC & FPGA resistant GhostRider algorithm2 minute block time using Dark Gravity Wave Difficulty AdjustmentReward distribution: 75% miner - 20% Smartnode - 5% Development feeCustom block reduction schedule and tiered Smartnode collateralMiningASIC and FPGA resistance through the GhostRider algorithm, currently only CPU mineable.Pools:  https://miningpoolstats.stream/yerbasSoftware:Wyvern CPU miner:  https://github.com/WyvernTKC/cpuminer-gr-avx2/releasesXMRig CPU miner:  https://github.com/xmrig/xmrigBlock Reward Distribution75%   Miner20%   Smartnode5%     Dev fee Block Reduction ScheduleThe block reduction will take place every 1,000,000 blocks, approximately every 3.8 years     Block 0 - 420                                4.20      YERB     Block 420 - 1000,000                   100          YERB     Block 1,000,001 - 2,000,000           80          YERB     Block 2,000,001 - 3,000,000           70             Block 3,000,001 - 4,000,000           50             Block 4,000,001 - 5,000,000           40             Block 5,000,001 - 6,000,000           20             Block 6,000,001 - 7,000,000           10             Block 7,000,001 - 8,000,000             9             Block 8,000,001 - 9,000,000             8             Block 9,000,001 - 10,000,000           7             Block 10,000,001 - 11,000,000          6             Block 11,000,001 - 12,000,000          5             Block 12,000,001 - 13,000,000          4             Block 13,000,001 - 14,000,000          3             Block 14,000,001 - 15,000,000          2             Block 15,000,001 - 16,000,000          1              > Block 16000001                            0.420    YERB                                                   around 420 million YERB total at year 70SmartnodesTiered collateral schedule:     Block 4200 - 69420            10,000  YERB     Block 69421 - 100420         16.000       Block 100421 - 200420        22,000       Block 200421 - 300420        28,000       Block 300421 - 400420        34,000       > Block 400421                  42,000  YERBBenefits of Smartnodes51% / double spend protection.Protection against network consensus manipulation.Removing hyperinflation issues due to coins locked in Smartnodes, custom tiering system for rewards and collateral.Instant spend (no waiting on confirmations), private send.LinksWebsite: https://yerbas.orgExplorer: https://explorer.yerbas.orgGithub: https://github.com/The-Yerbas-EndeavorDiscord: https://discord.gg/XGEp2cKSKFTwitter: https://twitter.com/Yerbas_EndeavorReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Yerbas/Telegram: https://t.me/Yerbas420ExchangesXeggeXYERB/USDT https://xeggex.com/market/YERB_USDTPancakeSwapYERB/BUSD https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?outputCurrency=0x2100591c0b692c53a0E11cc328646309e6ea12eF&inputCurrency=0xe9e7CEA3DedcA5984780Bafc599bD69ADd087D56Nodesaddnode=95.179.181.254addnode=108.61.180.20addnode=149.28.180.9addnode=45.32.140.6",
