Actually vesting on a new project is really risky. I have the same case too. But of course I understand the risk then I go for it and let it be. Investing is also has a chance to lose money and not only to earn from it. But surely there will be time that you get the advantage of it. Its just the market now is down and we cant rely on these projects now cause even its good it still gonna give us false hope.",

Even projects that we consider to be potential, such as blockchain, Defi, Metaverse, and NFTs, most of them have been scammed and become shit tokens.What we are waiting for now is when the market has recovered and the prices of the tokens that we have been holding will increase again, even though the chance is quite small, we must be optimistic.Btw, thanks for the information you have provided, the website is very helpful for people to be able to track token locks on many projects at once.

If there are people that are making a lot of money in altcoins.It's either, they are the developers, early investors that has got too early when it's listed and then those that are patient that has became lucky buying a good project and has got good developers working on it.",

      "body": "No one claims to be an expert at altcoin investment those who walked away with good profit were only lucky with no technical proficiency attached. Before vesting on a token, it is safer to know the marketing strength of the project because sometimes after ICO or IDO the project keep depreciating because there are no demand to push price up and so when those coins get unlocked the value keep reducing and some either remains static or crashes out completely.Investing in crypto requires collaborative research. I have this feeling from my few experience with Altcoin that no one person can make a 100% accurate research and findings on how best to tackle the numerous coins listed on various trading platforms. Some are bunch of traps others are for early birds. It is safer in a duo.",

Profit, when the vesting took place the market, continued to improve, and until the vesting ended the price exceeded the ICO price. I may be lucky enough, but in some cases, a project with long vesting will only torture investors and throw away their money because there is no profit to be made. a vesting system that is too old with a small allocation cannot be applied anymore. But if people don't vest, they throw away their coins and forget about it, leaving the project abandoned and undeveloped.",

Some project has a vesting period of 2 year and above while shit start up project complete the vesting for just a year including the devs funds. Vesting period is really important in determining the future price especially on weak fundamentals project. So don’t expect a new project that will reach again the ATH during its initial release since the circulating supply is inflating overtime.But sometimes the team counter this through the burn mechanism that’s why it’s important to understand first the tokenomics before investing on altcoins. It’s better to invest on altcoins with fully circulated token supply that startup project that already in the mid terms of there token release.",

Especially if it is about GameFi, Whatever-to-Earn tokens, their non-gamers will play such game-to-earn and dump their earned tokens on the market without hesitation.Thank you Onthue for sharing the site which I did not know about.

It was gradual though because 10% were released every monthSame scenario with what I usually saw with projects which has a 'lock in' features. It is quite a form of staking for me but different because you won't be able to pull your tokens out in an instant. As others have mentioned, it is too risky. Reason is lack of consistency with the market value of a token. Also, it has the same logic with fiat. Try to just store an amount of money in bank for decades. Compare how much its value from before up to present wherein you'd be only able to buy a few for that amount in the present because of inflation. But inflation is not the reason with market price downfall of a locked token, but rather volatility. What ties both situation is lsck of consistency with market \"value\".",

      "body": "The inflation will push the price to go down if there would not be enough liquidity in the market. The problem is the developers were taking the advantage by offering venture capital to buy at the private sale which has been sold by the developers with very cheap price. The unlock of new supply will be distributed to the market as the unlocker will have ability to sell their tokens and this mostly happening with the project with so many venture capital. The venture capital itself mostly owned the biggest portion compared with the retail investors. Locking features will not give guarantee if the price can still stand at the high price. The fact that if there will always be token unlock that will push the price to go down. That's why liquidity is very important for that.",

Fact is the release of those tokens will make the value of the token go down \"A1. Token release is not strictly meant to be a dump although in most cases there will be a dump after token release. I have experience with an altcoin called Oasis Network (ROSE), at that time I had a few bags of $ROSE, then I heard that they would release a token in the next 1 month, I immediately sold my token to avoid the dump price impact of the release. But what happened after? I was disappointed because it wasn't a dump that happened to the token but a fairly large pump. It turned out that they had a different agenda regarding the token release, they released tokens for the development of their ecosystem such as creating a Hackathon, of course this was what made the price of $ROSE at that time a pump.Source: https://token.unlocks.app/axelarI mean, apart from when the token release will be, you also have to know for which allocation the token release will go, if it will go to the good side like for project development, instead of selling to avoid dump you should hold your tokens.",

They don't have any technology so they are not worthy to hodl and if you insist to then you will only suffer more losses because the majority is already dumping their tokens. Not all tokens that are being paid in a bounty are shitcoins but there are also a few who are in better quality.I think was only a coincidence that the value of the coins have dumped by the time they distribute the rewards but maybe there are times that it was intentional. It could be the team or the investors are dumping their coins before the distribution phase happens, so that they can still earn good before the hunters dump their coins and then the price dips. If you want to, you can hodl your token and maybe it will recover and rise more in the future.",
