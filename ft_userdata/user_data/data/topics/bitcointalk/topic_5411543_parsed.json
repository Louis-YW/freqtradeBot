  "content": "QuoteNaoya Inoue and Paul Butler have agreed to terms on an undisputed bantamweight championship fight Dec. 13 in Japan, sources told ESPN.Inoue, a star boxer in Japan who is ESPN's No. 2 pound-for-pound boxer, will attempt to unify all four belts for the first time in his career (he holds the WBA, WBC and IBF titles.) The winner of the matchup -- Inoue will be heavily favored -- will be the first undisputed champion at 118 pounds in nearly 50 years.The last goal for Japan's \"The Monster\" in the Bantamweight Division, to unify all four belts here. A mismatch? An easy win for Inoue? Not even a big challenge for Inoue? Can't blame some people's view about the match as the distance between Naoya Inoue and Paul Butler is really that wide and long gap. I can't even think of a way how Butler can survive the wrath of Inoue.No mentioned venue at the moment but it's in Japan. The first time Paul Butler will fight outside the United Kingdom. Almost all advantages are on Inoue.Sources:Naoya Inoue, ESPN's No. 2 pound-for-pound boxer, agrees to title bout with Paul Butler, sources sayNaoya Inoue vs Paul Butler undisputed championship fight set for Dec. 13 in JapanNaoya Inoue set for undisputed bantamweight title fight in December",

Butler could win by out pointing Inoue but that's going to be a huge problem. It will depend on how his body and chin could hold up since we know very well that Naoya has real knockout power and speed hehe.",

This may look a mismatch but I’m sure Butler will take this seriously same thing with Inoue, there’s still time to prepare and let’s see if Butler can really give a good fight against Inoue.",

This is also a mismatch for me and in the first place, it's just because Paul Butler has a title that's why Inoue has to take him to become the unified champion in the bantamweight division. I even think that Donaire at his current age is more powerful than Butler.The funniest comment from netizens while I read some comments, is that Paul Butler should just give the title to Inoue without having a fight. That was funny and partially true.",

It's also unfortunate that Paul doesn't have a secret weapon up his sleeve that could suddenly put Naoya down. Paul could probably not even wobble Naoya. Naoya on the other hand has been knocking out every opponent recently. He is at the top of his career. Paul's is now coming to an end.",

This match is already considered a win by Inoue and I'm sure of that.Even if I agree that under regular circumstances Butler will not be the one fighting Inoue and instead Casimero should be there, Casimero has been a complete mess for more than a year, he insulted the wife of Donaire which caused the fight to fall apart, then he was supposed to fight Butler at the end of 2021 but supposedly got gastritis, got accused of molesting a woman and then failed to follow the medical guidelines on the second chance he was given to fight Butler, so while I would have liked to see Inoue fighting Casimero I doubt he has his mind where he must and as such he could be destroyed by Inoue.",
