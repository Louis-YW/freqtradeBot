Just think of it like you're selling a rare baseball card or a rare sneaker — If it goes up in market value, you don't magically receive dollars on your bank account or your pocket wallet, right? You only earn profit once you've already sold it at a certain price that's higher than the price you bought the item.",

      "body": "To calculate the profit, use this formula:Final price divided by the initial price multiple by the money invested minus the money invested.. Do not forget to apply bodmas.If you invested $100 and the bitcoin increased from $40000 to $5000050000 ÷ 40000 * 100 - 100     Profit = 125 - 100                = $25If you invested $100 and the bitcoin decreased from $40000 to 3000030000 ÷ 40000 * 100 - 100     Profit = 75 - 100                = - $25If you invested $100 and the price of bitcoin increased from $40000 to $50000, you will gain $25, but if it decreased from $40000 to $30000, that means you lose $25. In this second case, you can continue to hold as the price will increase back, it can be long but the price will increase back, for bitcoin, not altcoins as many altcoins are disappointing.

You can buy and hold on noncustododial wallet and have full control over your crypto asset, not even advisable to hold on exchanges.",

What you are thinking is just due to price volatility, if you see that your holdings on your dashboard increase from $1 to $1.2, it's because bitcoin price increase (obviously) but it doesn't mean you make profit $.2. Why? because you need to sell your holding first to USD before you make profit from it.",

For holding, I can not advise people to use even Coinbase Pro which is the coinbase exchange as it is an exchange. I can not also advise anyone to use Coinbase.com for holding because it is a custodial wallet, no full control. I can never also advise anyone to use Coinbase wallet which is a noncustododial wallet because of thesy obvious reasons:Is Coinbase noncustododial wallet recommendable?Also people can get confused and download Coinbase.com, thinking it is Coinbase noncustododial walletBest to use a wallet that is fully noncustododial like Electrum. For large amount of bitcoin, cold wallets like open source hardware wallets and wallet on airgapped devices like this are safer.",

If you want to make a profit from a certain coin from your portfolio, you need to sell it for a higher price than when you bought it. This is the fundamental principle of trading.",

Just a very simple and genuine trading strategy. I think it was very easy to understand, it is just simple math and actually, you can see from your portfolio if the total value is growing or not.Thus, if you want to make more profit then you learn how to hold and wait for the best price to sell. If you are holding it in BTC, then you need to trade it for USD (BTC-USDT trading pair) in order to finally get a profit.",

      "body": "Hi Coded45,Cryptocurrencies might sound like the stuff of science fiction, but they're actually pretty easy to understand. In terms of profits, the key is trading in an orderly way, so learning how to buy and sell at the right time is key. If you don't know much about investing or trading, the cryptocurrency markets can be intimidating and it may be difficult to keep up with the new developments, but there are a number of tutorials to help you in your initial foray. The first thing you need to do is pick a cryptocurrency and learn how to buy and sell it – a process that can feel foreign for first-timers. Once you have picked a legitimate crypto exchange, you'll be able to buy and sell any cryptocurrency that's available to you. The easiest way to learn how to trade in the crypto markets is to watch a live demonstration of the trading process. This will allow you to see exactly how the orders work and how you buy and sell within the system. I suggest you to start by watching an introductory tutorial on how to trade bitcoin with Coinbase.
