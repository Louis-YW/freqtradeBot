The bitcoins \"are\" on the blockchain and copies of it are in a lot of computers all over the world.The amounts of fiat in the bank accounts are written into databases which for most banks I expect to be backed up securely too.In both cases people relying on the technology will have to wait patiently until the internet is restored, the things continue from where they left (especially bitcoin) and they get access to their money again.The fact you compare one forum with a decentralized network like Bitcoin tells that pretty much want this pointless discussion that was started many times before.An attack like you're saying would come from an intelligent race from outer space. And if so, each and everybody will have more urgent issues than their money.",

Like it shut down 2 time in this year. And we was not able to make any transaction either they are from banking apps or from BTC or cryptocurrency apps. We were totally off-grid and only relying on the money that we had in our banks.The internet coverage was down for like 4 days, and everything was total disaster, the life slowed down, as a student I face a lot of problems, in the creation of my assignments, etc. I realize at that time, internet has become a catalyze of our life which increase the rate of it.We all are really so dependent on the internet either for financial purposes or others.

I'm no tech guru or a prophet of doom, but this are my thoughts and fears on the matter, although I sincerely hope that I'm very wrong on these thoughts. Your concerns are legit, but you have to understand that BTC blockchain is totally decentralized, and those who are validators/nodes downloaded the full blockchain in there computers and synchronize there downloaded blockchain with the overall BTC network. And when one TX is made then it is inserted into the network and then updated on all the nodes and then validated and processed by the miner or validators. Then added to the blockchain. Well, if internet goes down, the synchronization will stop, and no one would be able to make any transaction. As we know each TX need specific confirmation and without them TX cannot be confirmed. I hope now you understand it.",

It'll seem as if we've suddenly gone back to the stone age, if these where to happen.Theymos has already addressed that in one of the thread earlier on why the forum keeps going up and down which is always a server down issue. What you need to understand first is how the internet work. For internet to stop working completely, it means all the communication between the earth and the airspace will stop completely and if that should eventually happen, that means we are going back to the 80s and 70s when there was not internet. However, that is not going to happen, if Isreal shut down their internet today because of war, the rest of the world will continue to use the internet because they don't control other air space, their power is only limited to their country and perhaps some neigbouring countries. So, that is how the internet work.There are alternatives today even if internet are shutdown, Elon Musk Starlink works anywhere around the world, you need your internet protocol for it to work once you properly installed it. There are also some decentralized internet on the web were you can use internet without any interruption, so chill.QuoteI'll focus on finance, so I'm thinking what will happen to the bitcoin inside wallets, what will happen to every fiat currency in bank accounts, if everything erases as a result of internet total breakdown?

I think it is because of this kind of possible attack they didn't allow internet to be control by a single country, they made it simple to use and no disturb from other people.",

That means incapability of cashing out from your bank account either, as ATMs use the Internet. - Every business which exists digitally would go bankrupt, completely disrupting the economy.

The internet have developed so far that it cannot be compromised that will lead to the shutdown totally. Before reaching this stage, every possible scenario or case that will lead to the total shutdown of the internet has been put under control and if any will occur in the future, it won’t take long before everything will be restored back. It is okay to have such imaginations but the shutdown of internet won’t take us back to the Stone Age. The eagerness to get back to the internet age will provide fast solutions to this if it ever happens, which is most likely not going to happen because it will be very disastrous if it happens even for a day.",

The Blockstream Satellite network broadcasts the Bitcoin blockchain around the world 24/7 for free, protecting against network interruptions and providing areas without reliable internet connections with the opportunity to use Bitcoin.Blockstream Satellite ground stations, known as 'teleports,' participate in the Bitcoin network and transmit blocks to geosynchronous satellites.Blockstream Satellite teleports and broadcast it across a wide portion of the Earth. Anyone in the coverage area with a small satellite antenna and an inexpensive USB receiver can receive these blocks and ensure that their node is always in sync. It provides privacy too for your IP address.You can read it here - https://blockstream.com/satellite/",

There were still (depending on where you live) Bronze Age, Iron Age, Medieval period, Post-Medieval period, Industrial/Modern Age... So, you could argue that we might regress to the Industrial/Modern Age, but that would not be accurate either because the knowledge would still be around. Just because something suddenly stops working does not mean we cannot rebuild it. Think of it this way, if electric cars suddenly stopped working, would that mean humans never invented the wheel?Quote from: Kelward on October 15, 2023, 01:57:40 PMI'll focus on finance, so I'm thinking what will happen to the bitcoin inside wallets, what will happen to every fiat currency in bank accounts, if everything erases as a result of internet total breakdown? If the internet were to stop working globally, Bitcoin would still exist on the Blockchain in individual nodes. The nodes would temporarily lose the ability to chat with each other, but theyd still have all the data stored up. The devs would have to find a new way to establish communication again, and it doesnt necessarily have to be over the internet. As for the banks, it would be more complicated because we do not know their internal organization. Nevertheless, the databases would still be stored on the servers, but they could not make no transactions or nothing.Quote from: Kelward on October 15, 2023, 01:57:40 PMWho do we hold responsible?

However one can't help but sometimes imagine the possibilities of the internet crashing without  a solution, because of our dependant on it in this computerized age. There's hardly anything that you want to do in this present age that doesn't require going through the internet.

Of course, because we are not connected by satellites instead we are connected by submerged wires, by submerged I mean the wire, under the sea connecting the countries. At first, I also thought that, if all the satellites will go down then we were doomed, as we could not make any TX or use the Internet. But then after researching it. I came to realize that, we are not connected with other countries with satellites, we share the internet with other countries through wires coming from one country to another.It was shocking for me, and it solved some confusion I had in my mind. Well, the Internet can also have glitches like the Social media you mentioned above, but not at a global level, because we also faced a huge lockdown of the Internet which affected my life greatly and also helped me to understand the importance of the Internet for us.When there was no Internet in our country, I came to realize that, the production was so much just due to the internet and when it shut down, life became slower and everything took a huge time.",
