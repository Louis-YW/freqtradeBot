  "content": "Have a look, on this page: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/api/blockchain_apiIn the example for single transaction, there is a \"tx_index\" field for each input of the transaction. What is not clear to me is how I'm supposed to get the transaction ID for this, since the txid is not returned in this API call. There is also no \"tx_index\" number in Bitcoin Core's RPC output as well. So how do I make sense of this parameter?",

As a side note, transaction indexing allows for faster and optimal database queries and correspondingly a faster response from a server. Including database indexes in JSON response allows for more efficient filtering, sorting, and pagination of data, which might be helpful when developing applications because it helps organize data and present it in a more user-friendly format. Another solution would be creating private endpoints with all the neccessary data for development, but it would contain a lot of repetitive and confusing information.",
