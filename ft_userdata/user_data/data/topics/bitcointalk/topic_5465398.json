The three bitcoin address will be connected to each other even if you circle it around even 10 addresses, a careful study will link all together. The best thing to go anonymous with your transaction is to use bitcoin mixers/tumblers for mixing. Check here for the list of mixers available. Do well to research about them before using anyone",

The exchange isn't portraying itself as a mixer, and if you take the time to read their privacy policy, you'll quickly figure out that you have no privacy. On top of that, add that most centralized exchanges work with chain analysis companies, subjecting coins into \"clean\" and \"tainted\", going in the complete opposite direction of what a currency is aimed to be. Quote from: ZeeshanTrade on September 02, 2023, 01:07:28 PMIf i deposit from my wallet BTC to the exchange and then withdraw them to another btc address, will my coins be tracked? They will absolutely be tracked. Exchanges do share that information all the time, there's even a site[1] which takes an address as input and tells you to which exchange it belongs.[1] https://www.walletexplorer.com/",

If you don't want to use mixers for some reason, then you can try to make several wallets (5 or 10) and mix coins by sending transactions between them. It also won't completely protect you from all these companies that sniff and analyze the blockchain, but if you have some coins that you think could be \"suspicious\", then this way of \"mixing\" can give you a certain security in case you send such coins to some centralized platforms that perform deposit analysis. I can't say how deep they go in their analysis, but they probably won't look at more than 10 transactions in depth.",

Mixing coins for privacy reasons and then using exchange is the worst idea but if you just want to break the connection between your address and coins then it's the cheapest way.But the interesting fact is some exchanges used to mix the hacked coins using exchanges which is called chain-hopping, which involves mixing coins through stolen exchange accounts and mixing coins from BTC to Monero like privacy coins in such rapid ways before the authorities or exchanges realize something is happening but now AML procedures on centralized exchanges are tights it less likely to happen.",

That's why mixing through your own wallets isn't recommended; here coinjoin comes, which is essentially grouped consolidation, and achieves that. So, if custody is an issue, I'd recommend to using Whirlpool via Sparrow. There's a great guide: https://sparrowwallet.com/docs/mixing-whirlpool.html",

I think it's too much to ask from a person who was asking to know a basic response of mixing coins to exchange.OP. from which group of people you want to hide yourself? If this is authority/government then use mixers. If this is hiding your coins from regular internet users then I think using exchange is not a bad idea but make sure the exchange has no negative term for mixing coins.",

After you send the coin, just wait for sometimes and be sending the ones in small amount to different addresses which you will not link together. You will not link it if you create each wallet for the coins differently sent or if using coin control on the recipient wallet while sending. But having separate wallet for it will be advisable.",
