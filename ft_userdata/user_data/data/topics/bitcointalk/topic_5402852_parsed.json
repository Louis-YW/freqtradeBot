You are right and there is no reason to deposit on a newly created contract address while the website is almost empty. Till now there is 3 lottery sold all of them is bought by the site creator. So, till now no one interested and I doubt anyone will be interested to deposit until public information on the website.",

The site is very simple and I don't see any design for the site that will make it look like it's made to look presentable for gamblers to see and make the gamblers want to gamble. I see that you need metamask to be able to join the lottery. What I noticed about lottery sites did not survived for too long like lottoshi (what it's called) and now, I didn't see it still exist right now and some lottery game are added on casinos.",

We know the quality of eth when compared to other cheaper chains out there. They won't care about the high fee because they can always afford it.The reason I said it is for professional users is that in version 1, our goal is to release the contact and run an initial round.  The cost per lottery in ETH is very small. The cost of each transaction is currently under $ 5. It is also possible to buy multiple chances by paying 1 transaction fee. To do this, you have to deposit the amount of several chances at once. For example, if the cost of each chance is $ 1, you will get 10 chances by paying $ 10.",
