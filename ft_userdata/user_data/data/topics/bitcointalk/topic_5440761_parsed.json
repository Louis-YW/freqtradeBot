  "content": "This is driving me nuts. Where is the ADC that is reading the power entering the board aka “actural_vol = 0.00”? I’m looking at a S17 but I believe this applies to all bitmain boards. The ADC is short for analog-to-digital converter. It’s what is required to convert a signal like a voltage swing into binary, something usable by logic circuitry.Thanks,J",
