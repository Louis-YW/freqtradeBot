It's just an incentive not to sell because toin loses value if it doesn't stake with a growing supply, so it won't most likely be listed in any cex that won't agree to pay the staked value.Quote from: jovan85 on September 11, 2022, 09:17:18 PMGet high retrns of up to 10x on your investment.[/b][/b]This is just a lie, made up nmber and highly illegal for any legit project to claim something like this and obviously all of this is a HUGE red flag.",

Is there any product profitable enough to justify such returns? Or its just a coin that is made to be a hyperinflation shame to cach newbies on high APY hoping they dont know what inflation is?This kind of DeFi usually get the funds through there reserve tokens for farming. The reward usually in there tokens with low liquidity on there DEX which is the reason this project is too brave to offer this kind of ponzi APY.Usually those APY will become smaller when there’s already many stakers in there farming since there main is to let people buy there token and hold it on farming so that they can use the holders money as liquidity for there own token exit liquidity. Investing on new DeFi farming is so scary nowadays because they usually don’t have enough liquidity to sustain there token economy that surely collapse later on.",

It can entice many people to try to get it so they won't realize that it will eventually become a new scam.But we don't know the truth until we try it and if you really want to try it, don't spend too much money because the risk will also be greater. And be careful and do your research first before deciding to join the program.",

If you like you can invest in it as long as you are willing to take the risk, the higher the return the higher the risk. Projects like these you shouldn't ask anyone because we all know they're scams and you are not new either so i believe you already know it very well.I just want to make a comment about the word on ponzi on basing only to the APY because trusted DeFi platform such as BiFi sometimes offer this high APY or even higher to a newly created pool. It’s normal to see a high APY on pool with less demand on few stakers shares the reward. It will reduce later once more stakers join the pool.I don’t check the project so my comment is not specifically for this project defense but to explain how APY works on DeFi to avoid misconception.",

This is not only continuous dumping but also the trading volume of this coin is almost zero. There has been only one trade in the last 24 hours and that too was a sell trade in this coin. So you don't need to be a pro trader to realize that this would be a worthless investment. Thousands of such projects come to the crypto market with various tempting offers to sell their worthless coins to cash out of the market. So before making any investment one should do proper research and make a decision.",

I see a defi project that promises a high return of more than 300% APY will definitely end up being a scam and that has happened in many defi projects, It is not recommended for anyone to be tempted by a high APY offer because it is certain that your money will disappear over time, a high APY is just an attraction and will not be a long reward.",
