Bitcoin, Ethereum.Quote from: Robert518 on June 29, 2022, 02:13:53 PMDo you ever consider putting a stop to DCA?Not on my mind but I guess it's essential to stop when I don't have anything left anymore and will have to wait for those bought coins that I've accumulated during the bear.",

There is no reason for saving. Fortune saved today will be an equivalet of a car/bike for your grandson. You have to invest. But not only in bitcoin. DCA on Stocks/bonds/reits/commodities/bitcoin and real estate is a way.",

If you decided to stop DCA-ing, why are you DCA-ing in the first place if you're less bullish on the asset just because the price is lower? It means you weren't even that confident with the asset in the first place.",

DCAing is a good strategy when you are not so sure about a coin and want to reduce the potential risk of loosing all your money if it goes sideways, however you may have some regrets if the value of a coin you are DCAing gets unexpectedly high and you are pained because of the huge profit you missed if you had invested bigger. Quote from: Robert518 on June 29, 2022, 02:13:53 PMDo you ever consider putting a stop to DCA?I don't see any end to my DCAing, it is a strategy that works for me sometimes, I don't see any reason considering to stop it.",

I get that the price could be down right now but even with this I am in profit, much lesser profit but still doing it alright and that matters to me.I have done many other methods, I have done indicators and charts and data, everything I could and nothing gave me the profit that DCA gives me in the long run. I do DCA not only on bitcoin but on other coins as well. All of that returned to me with a great profit margin. If there was a bad result then I may have considered not doing it, but since it's in profit then I am doing it.",

With long term investment, basic rule is invest with your own money. If you borrow money to buy something and call it as investment, you are wrong, it is speculation. Because it is for long term strategy, it does not match day trading.Leverage? If you use leverage, you are speculating or gambling, not investing. In addition, a worse part if you DCA with leverage is you will lose you initial capital and the additional capital you use for DCA. In bad case, you will lose double or tripple of your initial capital because you DCA multiple times. Using leverage to DCA more, you will have higher risk and if liquidation comes, you lose more than what you should lose if you don't DCA with leverage.",

Since we're in a down trend/ bear market it's a lot more riskier to profit short term. Only way I've been profiting daily has been via arbitrage. Simultaneously buying/selling a coin in two different exchanges. I've using Coin Arbitrage to find daily new opportunities. I highly recommend it since I've been profiting daily. Check em out: https://coinarbitrage.biglink.to/hrDB2 I think that dca isn't only about buying at a cheaper price and the op says on \"a regular basis\" so it means that you will do that no matter what the price are but as long as you still have a funds left. The obvious reason that can stop us to do a dca is when that fund allocated for dca has run out.We can either wait again for some time to get another funds from our main jobs or other jobs (outside crypto) or we can also sell our coins at a much higher price and then start doing it again. Indeed that dca is the best to do nowadays not only for the sake of earning profit in the long term but also to earn a short term profit as well because the price takes too long to recover but it still fluctuates sometimes.",
