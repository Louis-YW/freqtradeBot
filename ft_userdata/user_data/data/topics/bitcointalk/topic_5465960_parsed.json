You should only use this as your additional confluence. If you don't know how to read naked charts, then there's no reason to use indicators. That's why I could say that there is no best indicators. The only indicators I mostly use are RSI and Volume which is good for confluence.",

So Fibo quantum is not different from Fibonacci and for some traders, fibos are not the best indicators for their forex or stock market.Whenever we do see some claims or line of words telling about being the best but those are just mentioning about technical indicators or tools then it would really be that completely a bullshit thing to believe on.This is somewhat really that kind of deceptive kind specially for those noobs who do easily believe on what are the things that they do really be able to hear out online or on a certain place specially if they are just starting on trading then chances that they would really be able to believe with these false things is high. This is why its not really that something recommendable on having those claims that being the best indicator considering that we do have tons that we could make use of but doesnt mean that it would really be that precise for those things to give accurate results.Whether we do deal up with forex or crypto market on which it would really be just the same on what are the indicators or tools would be using which it would really be that common in MT4 or MT5 platforms or charts.Profitability would really be always mattering on several factors or conditions which is that mixing a bit of luck.",

These type of stuff are very low effort and shouldn't be done, in fact it does hurt your brand to make something like this, you should try to grow some other way. On topic of best indicator, there isn't one, you can't just use a single indicator and hope that everything will be fine, because if it was that simple, then we would ALL be using that indicator and getting rich, since we are not doing that then its quite obvious that we are not going to end up seeing something like that. The reason why bitcoin may go up or down changes all the time and its not really always the same reason neither, that is why I believe that its not going to be easy.",

We may be able to get an idea about trading by watching various YouTube videos but that idea alone is not enough for trading. In addition to getting ideas from watching YouTube, you need to actually take steps to trade. Your trading profit and loss will depend on how much trading skill you have. If you understand trading very well or if you have good trading skills then you can earn good things by trading. Trading can be done but only those who trade in the right way can achieve good things from trading in life.",

I think it is better to keep support and resistance ar the forefront because price have stops and continuations which is best described as retracement. If you are able to spot on retracement with your support or resistance then you can better make more profit and less losses since you can jump out faster than the retracement start coming or you can better put your stop loss or take profit around the area.",

In speaking about indicator then it could freely be used and its available and could really be something that you could really be able to do whatever you want as long you do know on how to make use of it or whats the purpose of those indicators. Just always that bare in mind that no matter how well you do really make those analysis but still it wont really be making out assurance that you would really be getting a profitable trade because this market is really that unpredictable an no matter how well made your analysis whether on technical or basing up with fundamental but still wont really be giving out that sure results or outcome to be positive. This is why its always been good on having those back up planswhenever your initial plan or analysis had failed down.",
