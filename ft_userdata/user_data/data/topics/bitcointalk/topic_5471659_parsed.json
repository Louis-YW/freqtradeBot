It was kind of a competition to Celsius, and if I recall correctly, I think both of them collapsed in the end? If it was the case, then it is kind unfortunate your platform decided to go with a name completely similar to one which did not have anything to do with gambling. Anyways, let us see what you got to offer to our community of gamblers. Good luck.",

I also tried several ways to translate their website language but with no success, even the browser's built-in translator (right-click then \"Translate to English\") is not working with Chrome, Brave, and Edge, and can't detect the language. I already tried to paste their website URL on Google Translate but still it is not being translated.I think this is the first time I encountered a website that it is not being translated using the simple browser's built-in translator.",

In any case, there's a lot of members here that can make you a beautiful and attracted ANN thread.Third, competition in this niche is very tough, so I guess you need to market it like a signature campaign so that you can reach a lot of audience.Best of luck and hopefully we can hear from you soon. And if I'm not mistaken, this is the first time that we have heard a Igaming software company having their own online platform so this is huge for the gaming industry.",

Judging on your domain extension, it is based on Russia and that means that obviously the language is on Russian. Much better if you will have the English language as default for visitors that are not from Russia or its close region.Or you make it visible that someone can change the language that they like as an option.",

Actually we will be expecting to see their productivity in the casino, I do like as different brand is coming into casino and it will make casino to be more competitive, when their is a numerous casino games available I think the chances of seizing some people funds in casino base on kyc verification will be reduced because nobody will to patronise a casino platform that is full of faulty, they will like to test the new  ones, so this IGaming soft company should be good and also attractive with their concepts in their casino, many casino today don't last because of numerous challenges customers face during patronising them, let them take their term to make their brand to be unique I think it will helpful.",

Anyway welcome to BitcoinTalk. I had exactly the same thought in my mind, but i do not think they are related (though op will still have to answer), i think they just got the idea of the name and logo from Nexo just as you have said.Anyways, i visited the site, it does look really great, probably because dark backgrounds have always looked very good on gambling casinos, the site is pretty fast as well, but the only downside for me is that, it's not written in English, looks like its Russia or some sort, but i do believe that as the site gets launched to global users, it will be converted to English for the sake of foreign users, except if op tend to make the site a local casino.Anyways again, welcome to the forum, looking forward to the official opening of the site.",

Are you sure that your casino will mot be limited to Russian citizen since the country have a sanction on multiple country which you might find restrictive when you accept players from country that sanction it.If your platform is a country-based extension that only means that you cater to that country and checking your website I see that it is because there is no embedded translator to translate the website content, I don't know the purpose of creating an announcement on an English-dedicated forum like Bitcointalk if there is no way to understand what's on the platform, I would not play on a platform that I cannot understand QuoteThe default language is in Russian which I’m not where is the translation button for your casino.
