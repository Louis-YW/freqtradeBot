  "content": "The usual theme of discussions we get around here is advice to 'newbies' on what to avoid and what mistakes not to make in crypto; considering you are your own bank. This is in order, as taking responsibility requires one to be responsible for their actions and inactions.This thread was inspired by an error I made when backing up a seedphrase recently and it is to draw awareness that experienced crypto users or those who have been using it for a longer time period should not get complacent as they are open to mistakes and errors which could cost them.Some tips which I consider to be helpful;• Always pay extra attention when backing up a seed phrase,• Always triple check all information about a transaction before signing, this includes address, amount and fee,• Avoid clicking on random links and bookmark important websites,• Your memory is not a reliable backup, for passwords or seed phrase. Have a place you store useful information which you can easily access.This is a short list as more experienced users usually have things covered, just try not to get comfortable.I'm curious to know, are there any errors you've made as a regular user of cryptocurrencies? Do you have tips to avoid such?",

But once I have did a certain error where I transact to a random guy and do a first send off tokens and unfortunately the guy was a scammer and ended up losing the tokens I entrusted with. You are right, dont be too complacent even thr sweet words and proof are look so real cause they are evolving now from a recognize scammer to a professional talker.",

On this particular occasion, I was in a bit of a hurry so I was sort of careless in the backup and did not confirm the seedphrase after finishing up. Fast forward to a few days and I wanted to import that address into a different wallet software and only then realized that I got 11 words and not 12  Thankfully, I had a backup for the password I used on the initial wallet and used that to access the seed phrase directly, which saved me some blushes. I was actually surprised I backed up the wallet as I expected that I would have forgotten to do that as well.Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on June 19, 2022, 06:44:23 AMGet wallet from official source (website)...Great advices you got there.Learning is the only constant and no one goes above that.Quote from: Daniel91 on June 19, 2022, 08:01:58 AMThe hard way, I also learned my lesson, that the seed phase should be kept in different places, not just on the computer.A mistake can happen to any of us, it’s all life.

That's a very rare way of keeping your keys as you keep your money just like that.

The testing usually consists of several steps, which may slightly vary depending on the wallet type you are dealing with. Let us take, for example, the case of hardware wallets, which are devices that both generate secret keys offline and use them to sign transactions without users having to be connected to the Internet. The steps are the following: 1) Generate a seed phrase using your hardware wallet; 2) Write it down on a piece of paper; 3) Add a passphrase to your seed phrase. For security reasons, your passphrase should also be generated offline using dice, for instance. Back it up on a different physical media; 4) Insert a new passphrase to your hardware wallet and generate a new receive address; 5) Send some negligible amount (which you can afford to lose should something go wrong) to a newly created address; 6) Factory reset your hardware wallet; 7) Restore your wallet again using the seed+passphrase you backed up previously;  If funds are still there, then you did everything right and is good to go.",

For security reasons, your passphrase should also be generated offline using dice, for instance. Back it up on a different physical mediaIf using dice, how about just using a seed phrase generated on a reputed wallet, then used as passphrase which is also secure just as seed phrase with 128 bits of security and remain almost impossible to bruth force.Including passphrase along with seed phrase will generate different keys and addresses, I too will recommend this, especially if using hardware wallet like Trezor that has only MCU but not having secure element. Also, if a seed phrase is compromised, adding passphrase will generate different keys that the attacker can not get as long as the attacker do not have access to the passphrase, so the wallet would be more secure to be compromised.",

I hope you don't keep the seed phrases to your crypto stash digitally on your computer or anywhere online at all anymore. Only offline backups on paper or metal should be used for optimum security. Storing these backups in different locations is of course always the way to go.

Take a dictionary or a big book and stick your fingers in 8 different random locations. Pick 1 random word per page without looking. That's a total of 8 words. That should be enough for a secure passphrase. You can even spell them backwards or include a number and/or special character in each word for more security.",
