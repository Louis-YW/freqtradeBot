And in case of an increase in the price, move the stop loss higher, so you will fix the profit. And when this profit reaches the amount that suits you, you can close your order.",

I also have som SHIB bought at a higher price sometime ago, I think there’s still a chance for SHIB as long as the market enters into another bull market, just watch out for the hype.",

Seems like a lot is going on - what price you think it will hit realistically next bull run? Are you following Shiba Inu developments so that you will know more about why this increase is realistic because there will indeed be updates to come, I only saw the news at a glance but I am not a Shiba Inu token holder.Within 24 hours this token is up 35% maybe you have earned a decent profit to take or sell some and put it back in part so the decision is yours.If sure in the next few months about this hike then hold on to Shiba, they have a strong community to trust this token.",

So if you are willing to invest into something that is going up only because people like it and there is absolutely no other reasonable logic to buy it, then you should buy it. All those mainnet, game, etc etc stuff are just hype creation tools, all that they are working on are things that have been done a million times before and nothing special, boring old stuff and not a big deal. But many gets hyped about it because they like it, even love it. So thats it, people love it, and thats why it goes up, and if you love it too, hold it.",

This is what I am thinking also, if the OP is already in profit, why not think of selling it? You'll never see if this opportunity will come again. In my opinion, in another 2-3 years, I believe SHIB is barely surviving, as people may be tired of hyping up this token. But as a holder, it is always your own prerogative when to sell, just follow your own instincts as it is your token.",

Getting some listed in new exchange sites and adaoption may come again. It seems like that if shiba was recovering due to the bitcoin. I think that if you shall see how it was also growing up but you can expect new ATH above the old price as the price that can be achieved by shiba inu. The sky was the limit but if we must become realistic about the price and reaching the new ATH may happen in the next bullish trend.",

I think the recent pump was too much for it to call just that, so it might've been a whale that's temporarily pumping it with the game dev announcement being a coverup for it. Would set up stop-loss and just adjust it if the price continues to rise up. I'd think you'd be able to profit in the short term considering how the hype about the new releases they'd have would probably last for a bit. Maybe until the release of the game.",
