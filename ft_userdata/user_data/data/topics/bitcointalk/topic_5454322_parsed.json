Some people complained some weeks ago that they did not see confirmed transaction, but able to see the balance to be correct and able to spend the coins.But the best is to still import your seed phrase on a better wallet and later send the coins to an address of the seed phrase that the open source reputed wallet generate itself because Trustwallet is close source.",

We've already seen similar situations where Trust wallet had a bug displaying recent transactions, but the overall balance was accurate. You could try closing the app and reopening it to see if that helps. Just curious, do you primarily use that wallet for long-term storage? If so, I recommend considering the cold storage option. For instance, you could go for a hardware wallet or create a wallet on a device that never connects to the internet. There are also options like paper wallets or other cold storage methods available. It's worth looking into for added security!",

Trust wallet is closed source so you cannot verify what goes on behind the codes on the wallet.If your wallet is offline all day, I hope you do not connect to the internet when you want to transact? Instead of doing that, have another watching-only which you can use to create and broadcast transaywjile your private keys stays secured offline.",

How about VPN?What I think is maybe the trust wallet is blocked by your ISP which is why it is not loading or showing the correct balance. Using VPN should fix this issue.If not then switching to other wallet is the right thing to do as suggested above.",

If so, that is nice. It is good to use wallets like Electrum also becusee it is open source. Trustwallet is close source and you do not know how the seed phrase is generated. The advice I can tell you now is to create another wallet (wallet 2) which you will generate its seed phrase directly from Electrum itself. Send the coin from wallet 1 that you imported its seed phrase from Trustwallet, send the coins to wallet 2 which you generate its seed phrase directly from Electrum. Let the transaction be confirmed and delete wallet 1.",

To be safe from malwares?You can also create watch only wallet so you no need to access the wallet or use the blockchain explorers, simply it works like a wallet except you can access the funds via watch only mode.",

The balance is correct, but there is no new incoming transaction.Solutions to this problem:Delete the wallet, clear the cookies and install the latest version.Edit notifications on your device.Go to settings and change the node mode from automatic to fast.I tried the above settings and got a transaction notification as soon as I got a one confirmation.",

Check your transaction history to know that. Also that it can still happen at anytime. Not common but it can still happen at anytime.Do not save your seed phrase when you want to delete and download back a wallet. Immediately your generate the seed phrase, do two or three backups and save them in different locations.

Maybe it would work if you delete the wallet, redownload it and import the seed phrase. But someone still make a complaint to me like 2 days ago about the error and he is using the lastest version. So I am very sure that the bug has not been fixed.

I strongly and always advice people to use only open source, and not to import seed phrase generated on close source wallet to an open source wallet, best to generate the seed phrase on open source wallet and send the coin from the close source wallet, or to sweep the coin instead.",

If you are able to send the coin from Trustwallet to Electrum directly, that would be better. Send it directly from Trustwallet to Electrum.If you can not send the fund, import your seed phrase on Electrum (let us called it wallet 1). After you import the seed phrases on Electrum, generate a new wallet on Electrum (let us call it wallet 2) and send the coin from wallet 1 to wallet 2. You have nothing to do with Trustwallet seed phrase again because it is generated from Trustwallet which is close source.
