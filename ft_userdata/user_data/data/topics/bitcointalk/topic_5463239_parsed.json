We understand that this news comes as a huge shock.Why is Txbit closing down?Due to adverse market shifts, including tightening regulations and ambiguity about the legal status of cryptocurrencies in various countries, we are ceasing all activities.In an environment where compliance costs are rising, and our product margins constantly face pressure, continuing as before has become untenable for us. We began our journey with a distinct vision, but regrettably, the current environment prevents us from continuing.Regrettably, this marks the end of the Txbit journey.When is Txbit closing down?The website will stay accessible until 12:00 PM UTC on September 14th.We kindly ask all our customers to withdraw their funds before 12:00 PM UTC on September 14th, 2023. We recommend completing this process as soon as possible. Any funds left after September 14th, 2023, will not be retrievable.Can I withdraw my funds?YES! You can withdraw funds until 12:00 PM UTC on September 14th, 2023.We expect many users will withdraw their funds in the first couple of days, so there may be a small queue before your withdrawal will proceed. This may also apply to the KYC process and the handling of support tickets. We do our best to process everything as quickly as possible.Read more information",
