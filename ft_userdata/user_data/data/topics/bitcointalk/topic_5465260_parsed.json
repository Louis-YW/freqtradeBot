  "content": "Binance is limiting the service of BUSD so they are encouraging their customers to convert their Busd to other stablecoins by February 2024. So if you have Busd, then convert it to other stablecoins. According to Binance's new announcement, they will delist all the Busd pairs which they are already doing, they have delisted many trading pairs including spot, futures. So to minimize your risk, if you have busd, exchange them to other stablecoins, because after this news, anything can happen with busd as we have experienced many incidents since last year. Binance and Paxos both claim Busd backed by 1:1 USD. So they are working to prioritize their customers' funds. I also read the announcement of paxos where it said to end the relationship with binance.Binance's Announcement :  https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/binance-encourages-users-to-convert-busd-to-other-stablecoins-prior-to-february-2024-d392843e81fd4bc3a5f7e219aa01f34dPaxos Announcement : https://paxos.com/2023/02/13/paxos-will-halt-minting-new-busd-tokens/",

I only bring this news to the attention of traders who still have BUSD. I don't own any BUSD either, I've always kept my distance from this stablecoin. But it was a stablecoin with a top marketcap so it is conceivable that they had a large number of users. Binance once tried their best to make BUSD equal to USDT on their platform, they didn't give much importance to other stablecoins, and now BUSD is being delisted from their platform! But Binance never wants to lose the power to control the market, now they are very actively promoting FUSD which means they are moving from BUSD to FUSD now. I also think now traders should convert their BUSD to Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Hmm Yeah Op, well that was sad news because I really defended BUSD as one of the more preferred stable coins in my view because of their reputation in the market and I used to say it's Binance you should know what it meant when this term is used in this crypto world. So a Newbies posted a topic for the stablecoins and his leanings after posting another thread. On that thread, I made a very promising post for the BUSD but what a coincidence after the day passed the very next day Binance made this announcement and I was like what? Haha, why Binance is this is what you give to the BUSD supporters?",

However, so far crypto users have not lost because Binance is giving the option to convert BUSD to other stablecoins, but if any BUSD user does not convert his BUSD to other stablecoins after the time announced by Binance, then it remains to be seen what will happen to them. So there has come a time when it is risky to suggest any project other than Bitcoin because no one can predict when a project will disappear from the market. So Bitcoin should be preferred to hold most of the funds, the project seems super trusted today, there is no guarantee that the project will not make any unexpected announcement the next day.",

I hope that it gets to a point where they end up finding some other company to do something like this, there is really no reason to just give up. BUSD should have stayed, I do not care what paxos is doing, if they are not doing it, someone else should have picked it up and continued.",

The support for other stablecoins is much good in my opinion. Well we cant do about the busd case probably due to regulations issue. Its just unfortunate cause busd is good to use ad pairing since Binance has no fees for that. But since theyll be taking it out, I wonder if they will have the same privilege using other stables like tusd or fdusd.",

It is good that they were given a about 1 year, but I believe that all trading pairs for BUSD will be canceled before 2024, so you will only be able to convert them to USDT. With this announcement, it is a disclaimer of any responsibility beyond February 2024, which is almost a year since the SEC began investigating Paxos for printing BUSD, so I do not think that BUSD will be de-pegged if its value is less than $1, otherwise it may cause more legal problems for Binance, which is trying to avert the eyes of authorities.",

According to Binance's new announcement, BUSD users will be able to convert their BUSD to other stablecoins until February 2024, which can be considered as a deadline until the new announcement. Because we don't know what will happen after February 2024 to those BUSD users who fail to convert their BUSD within this deadline. Even if Binance removes all trading pairs of BUSD, they may keep the convert option enabled, so that users can convert their remaining BUSD by depositing it to Binance. Therefore, in the next announcement, Binance will update whether they will decide according to the situation and whether they will extend the deadline.",

Till February 2024, there are some months and till have enough time for many changes. I don't hope anything but I won't surprise if eventually BUSD will still be on Binance as well as BUSD trading pairs. This market is hard to believe but if you are worry, just convert your BUSD and stop trading any cryptocurrency that only has BUSD pair.Months ago, Binance delisted USDT trading pairs and many cryptocurrencies pumped a lot when Binance listed them again in BUSD pair a few weeks later. Is it a joke and internal trading manipulation from Binance?",

Since some people never visit the altcoin forums having a discussion there will limit the number of people seeing it. Here in trading and in the Binance exchange discussion are also good places to talk about it. This way come next year we will have a lot fewer posts of people freaking out about it. Don't get me wrong, people will still get burned and burned badly, but the more it's out there the fewer will be hit.-Dave",

After a while, Binance let their customers familiarized with BUSD a little bit till a time they decided to shill BUSD more seriously. At that time, what did Binance do?They charged withdrawal fee on USDT on TRC20 chain and with BUSD on Binance Smart Chain, it was still free in withdrawal fee.

There might be some sacrifice like slower trading speed but it should protect your privacy to some extent, unless you're trading on a KYC platform.

I searched around, and I did not find any link between Binance and FD121. Probably, FD121 paid a good amount of money to Binance to promote their Stablecoin so they gate more holders and/or FDUSD users. Or, FD121 might be a sister company of Binance. Maybe or maybe not. I can think only FD121 is promoting their coin through Binance, and this is the only thing that makes more sense than other speculations.",
