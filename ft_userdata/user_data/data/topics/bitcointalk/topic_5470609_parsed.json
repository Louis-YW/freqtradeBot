Private key is required to access your funds so you should've realized that cryptography is really important just from this point alone. How much do you know about Bitcoin exactly? If you're that enthusiastic about learning Bitcoin, I'd assume you've spent some time reading here and there. Maybe your question is not \"how important\", but \"what is cryptography\"?

Just kidding.You should ask all your questions here, if people know the answers, they will provide.Cryptography, public/private key pair, works like a gun with fingerprint scanner, without the private key(fingerprint) you can't shoot, bullets(public keys), are there but the trigger(signature) won't work if the gun(network) can't verify the signature(trigger) was activated by private key(fingerprint), so you would use the private key to actually shoot the bullets (coins). Fun fact, there are 2^96 fingerprints*(private keys) able to activate the trigger and spend from 1 round(address).*= out of 2^256 private keys.Simply put, it's all smoke and mirrors, private keys are normal but large numbers, that's it, the crypto part is used because everything is public, by using cryptography tricks you can make sure nothing is leaked even though everything happens in public.  Like traditional magic tricks, cryptography is a mathematical magic trick.",

Anyone else who somehow gets hold of this piece of information should not be able to understand it.There are different techniques used to encrypt a plaintext, with symmetric encryption, asymmetric encryption, blockchain and digital signatures being the most important encryption techniques. They are often used in combination with other cyber security measures. With almost everything being digitized, security has come to the forefront. Because even the most critical information is now stored online.Hackers target smaller businesses instead of corporate companies. Because most of them don't allocate a lot of resources and manpower to cybersecurity operations. So if you want to keep your business or yourself safe in the digital environment, you definitely need proper encryption and encryption applications to protect your data, business communications and so on from malicious attackers.",

      "body": "The main cryptographic functions for Bitcoin are the cryptographic hash functions, the one way compression functions, and digital signature algorithms.You can compute SHA-256 hashes here to see what cryptographic hash functions do.https://xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculatorOne way compression functions are very similar to hash functions as one can use the Merkle-Damgard construction to promote any one way compression function to a cryptographic hash function. The more complicated/conceptual cryptographic algorithm in Bitcoin is the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm. Perhaps the easiest digital signature algorithm to understand is the Merkle-Lamport digital signature algorithm (this will be easy if you already know about compression functions and hash functions).If you want to understand how elliptic curves work, you will need a mathematical background. It is best to first look at elliptic curves over the field of complex numbers since complex elliptic curves are motivated as the sets of the form (f(z),f'(z)) where f(z) is a doubly periodic function where the poles form an integer lattice and where the poles are of the form 1/z^2. From this construction, it is clear that elliptic curves are just toruses with addition. The book on complex analysis by Ahlfors covers double periodic functions and it shows that they satisfy the differential equation f'(z)^2=4f(z)^3-ag(z)-b. And things that work over the field of complex numbers typically also work over finite fields (due to Los theorem since the field of complex numbers is isomorphic to the ultraproducts of the algebraic closures of finite fields). Unfortunately, the people here have such a poor appreciation of cryptography that they do not even know that Bitcoin has a mining algorithm that was never designed to advance science. We need to be critical about what can be improved with cryptocurrency technologies.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

But If OP is a total newbie to coding or programming, or anything related to it, I will advise he doesn’t goes into reading some to those programming books yet.
