  "content": "Hey there! For the past year, I've been working with some amazing partners who are located outside the US and don't have access to payment methods like Cash App and Zelle. What I do is accept these payments on their behalf and then turn 85% of the payment into Bitcoin and send it to their given address. In return for my services, I keep 25% of the payment.These partners receive payments for various reasons, which honestly isn't any of my business. As long as I get my cut, everything runs smoothly.If this kind of service interests you, feel free to shoot me a PM and we can talk more about it!@telegram honeycoin_badger",
