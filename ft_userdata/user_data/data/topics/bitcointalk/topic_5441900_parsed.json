Sure, you may get more visibility there, but you will also get more shitposts as that board is known for that.",

I added questions that will facilitate bitcoin and DEX discussion.Here's my thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5442878.0Thank you, good effort, but I do not think that there will be a real addition. It is true that everyone is posted in bitcoin discussions board, but they are posts for signature campaigns. You rarely find people presenting their personal experiences on that board.I'm a little busy these days, was planning to put an explanation on how to download the wallet, and then the beginners board would be appropriate.",
