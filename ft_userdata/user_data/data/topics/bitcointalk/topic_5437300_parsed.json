Like influencers, they can have bad mouths and words about Bitcoin many years but later we knew they actually invested in Bitcoin far in the past too.Don't trust them and do your own research about Bitcoin, have your own thinking and belief in Bitcoin. If you have your solid belief in Bitcoin, make your investment decision that should not be affected by banks, influencers.",

Everything else is a copycat scam token.What makes you think that bitcoin is 100% clean? That it was not made by CIA or other organization? Why the fact of J.P. Morgan being secred, seed investors makes ETH not worth to use/invest?What's wrong with consulting ETH's business model (tokenomics) with the bankers from J.P Morgan?",

But, I can't deny the fact that there are a lot of utilities and use case done through Ethereum and that's why even JP Morgan is also investing on it. They're not the only company that's known in investing in Ethereum.Well, I don't watch those suggested videos as they might take a lot of minutes. But use cases and features done by Ethereum's smart contract can be done and applied to many companies if they want to. It's like another technology that every company needs to scale up their business.",

Everything else is a copycat scam token.I would say there will always be some people who will find hatred, and for some reason they enjoy that, and I do not get why. There are so many people out there who hate stuff that has nothing to do with them as well, like why are you angry at something that doesn't even matter to you. In this regard, if you really want to invest into ETH and won't because of this, then just avoid it and move on.JP Morgan did invested into crypto as a whole a few years back, I wouldn't be shocked to learn they got some ETH too considering it's the second biggest coin, but if that makes you not want to invest, then I fear to say that they have billions in bitcoin as well, and they could sell at any moment.",

The network is constantly supported by a large number of projects and miners, which are now PoS miners. Of course bitcoin is more reliable investment, but it is definitely not worth sending Ethereum to the category of scam tokens. Of course, ETH has many disadvantages, but no one can dispute the fact that Ethereum is the blue chip of cryptocurrencies.",

I would not be surprised to see he was targeting a native coin like ethereum as it has big user base. Miners were greedy bastard. miners are always thinking of themselves. They think retail buyers should always give their money through buying new coins minted by miners. i don't like that. Remember some blockchains were dominated miners who were deciding everything and trying to collude.",

Whether you agree with the content is up to you. As we have seen with the implosion of several top altcoins in the last year altcoins are garbage IMO, and these videos help to explain why they are garbage. They are controlled by a person or small group of persons (Vitalik Buterin, Do Kwon, Hoskinson, Bankman-Fried with FTT token, etc) which makes them not decentralized. They have a large premine with large allocation of presale tokens awarded to VC investors who have proceeded to dump their tokens on retail, so on and so forth. In short they are everything bitcoin is not and goes against what bitcoin stands for. they are basically unregistered securities or the equivalent of penny stocks run by boiler room scam artists. Notice how many of these shady characters such as Buterin and Bankster-Fraud have openly trashed bitcoin claiming theirs are superior.",

Ethereum in particular is the most production-ready blockchain to support CBDC requirements in terms of scalability and privacy.    System trust. A blockchain-based CBDC enables central banks to control the currency while protecting the privacy and independence of the CBDC’s use to the end users. We believe it is critical that users are not locked in by intermediaries so that they trust and use the CBDC.    Programmability. CBDC rules can be hard-coded in the protocol to facilitate compliance, i.e. wallet thresholds or third-party access to the system.    Data availability. Distributed systems such as blockchains ensure data availability and resilience, in addition to trust and transparency around transaction history. Ethereum has proven its capacity to support very large networks with 10k+ nodes and hundred thousands of users.    Innovation. A blockchain-based CBDC benefits from the innovative products and services that are being built across the open source blockchain ecosystem, including non-custodial wallets, zero-knowledge cryptography, and decentralized finance. Ethereum is the largest blockchain ecosystem in the world, with over 350,000 developers.https://consensys.net/solutions/payments-and-money/cbdc/",
