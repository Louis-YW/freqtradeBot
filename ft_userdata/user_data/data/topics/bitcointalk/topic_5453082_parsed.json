But about thier campaign they run in good they pay thier participants accordingly to thier respective ranks. Maybe theirs no issues a out promoting. But the casino is itself is very dangerous so everyone one of here in forum must be aware what is the true color of this casino.",

Does their backlog of unpaid money from all the accounts they have unresolved issues before not worth compared to the signature campaign participant's salary for them to leave the forum?They have thick skin in regards for not paying. I doubt they will just leave the forum for a silly backlog payment. They have multiple active flag on all of their account but still active here for many years. Nice try!",

This casino is notorious for spending money on promotions and doing nothing to fix their reputation.
