  "content": "I was waiting for the price of BTC to reach $40k in this month of August, before I will believe that $69k is possible before the end of this year 2023 which is the wish of many investors in the community. But the price started decreasing from $30k to $26k to create a great fear into the mind of those that is hoping for the price to increase above $30k before they can start thinking of how to visit the market to supply to make a good profits. With this slow move of the price of BTC in this season, I don't think the price will hit back to $69k before the end of this year because the green light is not stable like the way it was stable last two years to reach $69k for both long term investors and short term investors to experience huge amount of money from their investment. Do you believe that there is still hope for investors to experience $69k this year? Because we just have 3 months and some weeks before the end of this year. What is you hope for this current price?",

I believe you will also know about the 4-year cycle of bitcoin and you will not set such unrealistic expectations.  not a single investor expected bitcoin to hit $69k this year because everyone knows it's impossible, except for the newbies or those who already bought bitcoin at that price. I even doubt that bitcoin cannot hit $40k before the end of the year, let alone have a higher price.  this year is still a year of accumulation rather than thinking of some kind of bull run.",

What is your hope for this current price?Op, Hope is not lost and even though the market seems to be moving slowly lately, However, everything can as well happen faster than expected just with time. We still have four months left before the end of the year, so there is still a possibility that we could reclaim those levels or somewhere close to the price in the coming weeks and months. From what I could see from the indicator which I use that normally gives me a reversal signal, we have already gone oversold daily, and any further correction may result in the liquidation of shorts.",

You already have the predictions and can predict that it will reach $69k after the end of the year, so there is nothing to worry about.This year may be the last year for us to buy Bitcoin at a price below $ 30k because it could be that starting in the following months, the price of Bitcoin will start a long rally until before the halving and will make another correction. The $69k price is not a target for investors because investors already have a higher price target, and they may be waiting for the Bitcoin price to go above $80k-$150k.I hope to accumulate more Bitcoins starting at the current price or even lower and hold it until next year or until the price can go above $ 80k- $ 120k. And I can still hold my Bitcoin longer to wait for the price to make a new ATH again.",

While you may believe in the odds, I don't think $69k can be hit if there isn't huge demand support.$69k could be reached after the halving, but there has been much speculation that we will be close to the previous ATH before the halving occurs. That means bitcoin price could be close to its previous ATH value before 2023 ends, but I'm not that optimistic.",

Be more concentrated on accumulating bitcoins than setting price targets you expect bitcoin to reach.

What is you hope for this current price?Better not make yourself that too hopeful or being that optimistic towards the price for this year. Reaching out even 40k or 50k would be questionable, how much more on breaking that ATH? Im not saying that its impossible since we've seen on how Bitcoin did always make surprises in regarding about its price movement on which it would really be just that common that people would really be having these kind of insights in speaking about price predictions. Well, everyone does have their rights and opinions about price predictions or numbers that they do have in mind but honestly its better that you should really be minding that much on what are the digits that we could be able to see for this year and basing up on the price that we are seeing now which we are already seeing 25k+ which there are some people recently been guessing up for this price to happenwhich its a good call. Some do even tell about this dip and then we would be kicking in 35-40k but not on that previous ATH that we do have. So its your choice on what would be your positioning in speaking this price volatility.",

And I suspect this time it would be way harder to achieve that, because halvenings play smaller role in reducing supply. Well over 90% of all coins are already mined.
