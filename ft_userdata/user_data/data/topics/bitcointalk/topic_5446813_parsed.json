  "content": "Hi everyone,I recently inherited my late uncle's numismatic collection, and I've decided to honor his passion for collecting by sharing some of it. My uncle was an avid collector who spent his life gathering all sorts of unique items, and I'm excited to offer some of his treasures to those who will appreciate them as much as he did.In this thread, I will be selling a selection of items from his collection.I want to ensure that these items go to collectors who will cherish them as much as my uncle did, so I encourage serious inquiries only. I will be happy to provide additional photos and information upon request, and shipping is available worldwide.Thank you for your interest, and I look forward to connecting with fellow collectors who share my uncle's passion for preserving history.----DAK 1941 Nazi RingDescription: The Afrika Korps was a German military unit commanded by General Erwin Rommel that fought in North Africa during World War II. They were known for their skillful desert warfare tactics and achieved several impressive victories against the British Commonwealth forces, but were ultimately defeated in 1943 and forced to surrender. The Afrika Korps is remembered as a formidable fighting force of the war.Images:https://i.imgur.com/ZgrR20z.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/WN5X7ZD.jpgPrice: 0,0081 BTC",

Do you have any kind of proof that this is a real thing?  https://bid.candtauctions.co.uk/m/lot-details/index/catalog/11/lot/11349This example does not have the beaded edges like yours and is silver. What is your ring made of exactly do you know?",
