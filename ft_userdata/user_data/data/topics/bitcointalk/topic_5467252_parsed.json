The inevitable war is China-Taiwan-USA + the rest. Predicted in 2 years time. Highly likely if the government of China stay the same. I think the Korean conflict in 1950 is mentioned in the Britannia Article and one note was there which made it clear: QuoteNevertheless, the campaign ruined the CPVF Ninth Army Group, which did not return to the front until March 1951, and it convinced the UNC that allied ground troops could defeat Chinese armies, however numerous.",

If you mean the Korean war, which was basically a proxy confrontation between superpowers, back in the time of cold war, then yes I agree.Quote from: Tomson3 on September 24, 2023, 05:16:08 PMi will pray Let there be no more war. It brings horror.Horror and beyond.Honestly, it is quite disturbing how people talk about war or unleashing it in such an slightly way. I have seen videos from the unfortunate war going on right now in Ukraine and I must say it is incredibly heartbreaking how much suffering can be put onto the people of a nation, it is depressing.We can only pray for peace at this point...",

I believe there are grudges from the Korrean War due to the way the chinese \"helped\" North Korea. Many of the bras of those days are now in higher positiones and have a chance to get even. I admit that the title was not the best, as its more about the developing tension China creates by enforcing their point of view.
