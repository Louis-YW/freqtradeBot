      "body": "I see this as normal winning; this can just be some winning from RNG games where the player only uses a small amount to wager or from some kind of free spinning. Even if casinos want to manipulate their winnings and show some large amounts of winnings, if it happens frequently, they will not make the mistake of repeating numbers or even the user ID won't be repeated because it will be a mess on their side. As the above member said, game IDs can be used to verify that exact game for the casino, which enables that option. You can use that to verify if that amount was truly won or not. I don't see anything unusual in the winning figures displayed on your screenshot unless you have other details to prove otherwise, which are not visible on this screenshot.",

Maybe you can reveal what casino you took the screenshot from so that users can also do a check on that but I think there is no concerns about manipulation from just the screenshot you displayed, if you could drop the casino that will help to check if they are manipulated but the shots are not unusual.",

Of course, specially if those players or just yourself having that kind of playing on a single game like slots which using up on the same base bet amount and hitting up those similar rewards or combinations and if you are really just that you only is the one that playing then it would really be just your username would really be reflecting out and i do agree on those post earlier or some members that if you are in doubtthen you could really be able to check it for yourself whether it is really that not repeated via with those game hashes on which this is something that you could really be able to peak on and tell that those roll results are really just that different to each other.2. Stick with reputable or known platforms, you would really be definitely be able to save up yourself on stressing whether you are dealing with the right site or really that dealing with a scam one.We do know that there are lots of scam casinos nowadays on which it would really be that normal that we should really be making up some search first on which site that we are really tending to deposit.If you dont really make yourself that wary then you might really be ending up on playing on sites which are really that shady and might be ending up on getting scammed. If you do see those patterns and it do looks suspicious. Then why not really be tending to tell the sites name and would be sharing it up so thatthe community would really be able to know and see whether you are dealing with a good site or a shady one? but in overall its not really a solidindication of those kind of observation that the site is showing some shady acts since those are really just that casual ones.",

As a lessons though, if you have the gut feeling that something is wrong with the casino that you are playing, then simply stop and then go to other reputable casinos that we have here in our community so that you will not worry about this kind of issues.",

It looks suspicious.Who do you call \"original gamblers\" I don't understand, someone here said they have already played this game Mega Gems from Betsoft and got the same results as above in the picture from OP? I didn't see that so I guess the post should have been deleted unfortunately... I've never played this slot since it doesn't seem to be available at the casinos where I gamble usually. But you can try a demo on the provider (Betsoft) website. And when I played there I didn't get a series of several winnings with the same number like in the OP picture above. So I would be a little bit surprised if a regular player of this game had told that. But maybe the amounts shown on the picture are not the payouts but just the amounts bet of the winning spins.https://betsoft.com/play-demo/?id=900",

If you're that curious or suspicious on the bet, some platforms offer you to see and verify the bets shown but some won't and it varies on the player if they'll allow the public to verify their bets.",

It's probably on auto mode and the amount of bet is constant. That the payouts sometimes happen at the exact time is because the time shown doesn't include the seconds, and spins or rolls happen every second or even split of a second.

Yes and no. They're simply accounts that use bots to play the game, and due to how fast it cycles through, the live display pretty much shows them winning multiple times in a row. In reality, there's probably a bunch of losses in between those wins instead of it being concurrent wins. As for two, I'd say it should be based on real-time data in reputable casinos at least. I wouldn't pull out that their fake though, new casinos probably do that to attract players into thinking some people actually play there as you've said. There might be some casinos that show the TX or something similar though and in those cases it's pretty easy to check whether the game actually happened or not though.",
