Again, hoping this is not another FTX incident, and very much looking forward to lock this thread if it's just a small issue - waiting for Paxful to advise about this.",

In one of the links you posted, a moderator said the team is already investigating the issue.What's strange about this, is that the status page is not showing anything[1] except for some degraded performance for BTC only, and they also had maintenance but that's for withdrawals/send-outs and not deposits.[1] https://status.paxful.com/",
