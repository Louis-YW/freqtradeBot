  "content": "The reason why I asked this question is because I have been following local boards activities posted monthly by Rikafip. Every month Russia activity is always more than double of the other countries. This means that the population of Russians in this forum is higher than other countries by large portion.   I also understand that bitcoin url was   blacklisted  by the Russian government and yet they are still topping all the charts. This has made me think that Satoshi is a Russian. I said so because I am a Nigerian. If I am able to develop something like because, I will bring my people in to take early spot and they will also support me when necessary. There is no other evidence apart from what I presented above which is not concrete. If I am not correct can somebody explain to me why there are many Russians in the forum?",

Satoshi needed to be covert with his activities as privacy was very high in his priority.

      "body": "The charts you've posted show that there's a lot of Russians in the Russian local board, much more than in other local boards, but that can be interpreted in many different ways. It doesn't mean there's little people from different nations on bitcointalk, but that there's little people willing to post in local boards. I could use myself as an example here. I live in an English-speaking country, but I'm not a native. I was born in another country and there's a local board for that country here, but I don't use it. I find much better threads in other sections and don't have time to be a content creator for my inactive local board. I feel like Russians have a very strong attachment to the Cyrillic and prefer it over English. I've always found it funny while playing online games that everybody used to communicate in English, but Russians always ignored that and used their alphabet, even when they understood us. Back in the day when I played a lot, you'd always get a random Russian in Dota or CS who would reply to you in his language.",

There are many bitcoin enthusiasts besides the members of this forum, although it's undeniable russian community is pretty active on every sectors of crypto environment.I'm not sure the reason, but as I've observed many russians look for extra income, because they are also present in every micro earnings sites. Maybe it's worthful for them because local currency, ruble, is devalued. On this forum, for example, the high traffic of russians might be due to bounty campaigns.The fact is that the origins of Satoshi's identity remains unknown and probably will remain so.",

If I may ask how does this satistical findings on the Russian local board chat participation connotes that he Satoshi is from their? Are there any substantial variables to back your claims? Well I get your point when you try to say that as a person who invented or first accessed an innovation, you will want to bring your people onboard so as to first gain access to that certain technology or innovation which is what every normal and reasonable human would do but however, I do not see anything here which you have said to have any linking with Satoshi. Russians I believe are very much technologically and ICT inclined so hence their early and active participation on their very own local board. We should also note that bounty campaigns run on this platform which is also a means of getting extra income so therefore I will say that presenting a statistical chart for local board participation is not enough proof  to back your assumptions or claims.",

I know he made some posts in British English and others in American style but that’s as far as the trail leads. In my opinion, Satoshi did a great job in concealing his identity, I don’t think we will find the true identity of the pseudonymous person or persons Satoshi Nakamoto that easily even the name is pointing to a different continent. Never once did he write in Japanese, this says a lot about the way HE presented his person. All this was meant to confuse those who would try to find the face behind bitcoin.",

Again, the fact that a certain board has more activity compared to other boards is not conclusive of anything, let alone implying that Satoshi might be Russian. Though some factors may still be considered, this fact alone cannot be conclusive to think that Satoshi is even Russian.Like what previous discussions have mentioned, the pseudonym \"Satoshi\" can be a group of people or even an organization. No one really knows about his or their identity/identities since he/they clearly left without a trace.",

It should be, \"Why is the Russian local board, more active than the rest?\"Your stats haven't considered the English boards, which makes the assumption not strong enough. I am not from Russia, but their board could be very active because of the nature of policies there.One thing I have noticed is that there are so many exchangers that seem to originate from Russia than from anywhere else, if you check exchange monitors like Bestchange.

Until we do a proper research on this topic, lets keep on making suggestions and assumptions. The population of Russia compared to other countries could be a good reason why they have more activities in the forum. It could also be that some of the first members of this forum are Russians. Their high population could also be that Russian have close relationship and are openhearted. I said this because it is possible they have the tendency of introducing their countrymen to something good than other countries. Some people are very selfish that they might not want to introduce anyone to such an educative platform because they want only themselves to acquire relevant knowledge.",
