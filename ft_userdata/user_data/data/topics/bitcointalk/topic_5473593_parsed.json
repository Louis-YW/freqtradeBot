But if you are not new to a supermarket or shopping mall, you may not ask for the price of what they are selling. Some people buy some goods and if the estimated price is not too much, they will pay. It is just true that poor and average cares more to know about the price of what they are buying than the rich people that just go for total price of what they bought.",

Imo, even if you are rich you wouldn't want to spend money on things that are not worthy of price being paid. You wanna look at product and then it's price, if it's worthy of price, you purchase the product. When it comes to buying any product, I always consider the price and quality first before buying it. Because if a product is cheap, but the quality is not there or it is not commensurate with what I want, I will not buy the product. But if the product has the quality that I want, I will buy it if the price is not too expensive because I will still consider the price before buying it.I don't know how other people see a product when they want to buy it, but personally I only consider these two things more when I want to buy a product, although sometimes there are other considerations such as the feature sector in the product. Because if the price is only expensive, but not of good quality, it would be very silly to buy such a product, but it will be a different story when I really need a product at any price because it is in short supply to get it. Meanwhile, for those that are easier to obtain and that are necessary, considering price and quality are the two main things that I always look at.",

I can say why people use this word is like a process to express the amount or feelings they want to get the money because to me, if someone says he or she wants to be rich to the extent that he or she will purchase an item without checking the price tag, it is just to express how day will lavish money when day gets rich because lavishing money is never good. In economics, if you are lavish, you will end up facing the consequences because you might end up broke. To avoid that, you need to have a budget even though you are rich.",

There's nothing bad in knowing the price of what you're going for, this will depend on the value of the item, we also have some individuals discrepancies whereby if you don't have an idea on the price of a commodity, the sellers would have scammed you by inflating the price, which means when you're uncomfortable with a particular price tag for an item, you're free to check elsewhere for the best price offers.",

We all know that the whole world was affected by the inflation. The rise in prices of goods and services which highly affects the poor/low to middle-income class. That's why they often think of earning at least enough money up to the level of they will no longer have to look at the price tag of the product just to keep their money on the budget.",

      "body": "The idea of not looking at the price tag probably comes from the basics, such as going to buy groceries or going shopping. If you're on a budget, you pay attention how much you spend, so that you can have enough money to buy stuff tomorrow and the day after that. If you're rich, you don't really have to do that, you can just grab whatever you like without caring about the price. But that doesn't mean that this is what all rich people do or what people should aspire to do. I think that prices matter because they can be an indicator of the quality of a product (if it's way too cheap, stay away from it), and reasonability of spending money on something.",

That saying is just for fun because what it really means is that when your money is limited and you want to buy something, of course, you will first look at the price tag to find out whether it fits your budget, whereas when you have a lot of money and can be said to be rich then you will first looking for the item you want because the price is not a problem at all, even when you have to buy at a price that can be said to be over it is not a problem because the money is available to pay any amount, that's why luxury goods are always available because rich people are always willing to buy at high prices even though the function is the same as the same item but a different brand.",

I've never seen anyone that rich other than billionaires in movies and what I see in reality is that the richer people get, the stingier they become. They go to the market and even bargain for pennies and buy just enough of what they need, they are even more frugal than people in lower economic situations than them. Not all rich people spend lavishly or use money uncontrollably. If it were me, I would do the same because even though we have a lot of money, making money is never easy.",

It’s really dumb buying something without checking how much is it because how are you supposed to pay it even if using credit card.People that is not rich typically consider price first before their personal desire to that specific item.

But that does not mean that its value depends on all recognition, it has its own object for that need, and when we no longer care about it, it does not affect its continued existence.In some aspects of spending, perhaps many people do not understand that their behavior is programmed by someone, and they also do not understand whether owning those things really brings value to themselves. . Yes, competition for material things, and self-expression,... is part of the waste, even if someone has a lot of money, are they the ones who can buy the whole universe?
