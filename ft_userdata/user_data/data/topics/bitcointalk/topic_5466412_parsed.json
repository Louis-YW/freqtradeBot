They want to earn more from pump and dump games. Group members can get profit or become victims if they are too late with signal receiving by difference in time zone or whatever reasons. If they join pump and dump games too later, they certainly get big loss.Quotebecause as a trader he knows that it is easier to make money by selling his signals than using signals that are sold for his own tradingTrading is risky and they know it but they also know more than newbies know. Pump and dump games are very attractive with newbies who don't have knowledge about trading but have greediness. They chase profit with their empty brains so such groups are their favorite places to join. Group owners only give some polishing successful trades to attract those newbies.They spread signals so they buy first before releasing those signals. Therefore they take very slim risk while have big chance to earn big profit with their games.",

I have friends that are into this stuff and I don't feel convenient with it becauseI don’t believe in trading signals, so I will tell you there are no real trading signals. I have seen different trading signal groups, and I noticed that all are fake, so I already concluded that there is nothing like real trading signal groups, all of them are just after money which they will be making. That’s why, as a trader, it’s just better to learn how to trade and not depend on any trading signals because most of them are just fake.Quote from: Z390 on September 11, 2023, 12:22:00 PM2. They might have other motives for creating such groups too. Most of the signal providers are just doing that because of their selfish interests. The motive behind creating such groups is just for them to make money. They will create a group, and ask people to pay before they can be added, if you don’t pay, you won’t be added to the group. After you have been added, most of them end up providing wrong signals, and there is nothing that can be done about it because you already paid for the group, and they have nothing to lose, People that followed the trade are the ones that will lose. You will be losing the money you used in following the trade, and you will be losing the money paid for the group.Quote from: Z390 on September 11, 2023, 12:22:00 PMSince this groups are label premium signal groups, they are requesting some form of a monthly subscription, a friend said that most of them are inexperienced traders who are pretending to be a pro traders. If they don’t pretend to be professional traders, then nobody will subscribe to the group. All signal groups will pretend to be professional traders to get people’s attention. If you join, you will discover that they know nothing about trading, but they will have collected their money by then, and you won’t be able to get a refund.Quote from: Z390 on September 11, 2023, 12:22:00 PMMy common sense is asking me why will they create such group if they know how to be pro traders already? Most of the signal groups are always wasting their time marketing those groups so that people will pay and join. As a professional trader, they won’t even have time to waste forcing people to join their group, but most of those groups are always looking for ways to force people to join, which is already a red flag.",

Like why can't they keep this to themselves and keep making their money? Why are they trying to help and getting subscribers in return? Just my own common sense like I've said. What do you have to tell me? These are some common questions, that come to mind when one is forced or get to know about Premium/VIP Signal groups. Where they could earn a hell lot of money but first we have to buy their subscription. I also used to be as skeptical as you are now on this issue. And I always tried to remain vigilant to all types of scams too because if what your second friend is saying is true then yeah we can call it a scam. The point is, what I did? When I had these types of queries in mind? I simply ask one of my friends to share the signals with me that they are getting from those VIP groups. But I do not follow those signals instead just observe them and try to make a winning ratio. As I do not have access to their background history, so I used this method to analyze their experience. Another way is to avoid all those traders who are at a lower level because those who are not so public and have a lesser approach do not buy their signals because you don't even know them. For example, I used to follow P4Provider and WaqarZaka on FB and YT. Because they are public entities and at least I can take some action against them if they try to scam us. So, never fall for new guys who are there to scam us only.And you asked why did they do that. Because they want to make extra bucks too. Let's say you are doing all the analysis and 70 to 90% sure about your analysis and predicted the market and then what? You will take entry and make some profit and all of that analysis will go to waste. So you decided to share that analysis with others but in exchange for money. Isn't that a good idea? I would do the same. And there is a plus point which is we as signal providers ask others to sign an agreement saying, the losses and the profits are not on us instead you are following it on your own will. That's enough to save yourself from any cases.",

I’m considering legit crypto signals here and not scam. Nothing beats a passive income through subscription because trading still involves risk even if they are pro trader so having a profit from subscription will gave them a good benefits.They also benefits on providing good TA a guarantee profit to their investment since they are the first to purchase before their follower purchase the signal. It’s important to have a basic knowledge on trading before you start joining on this signal group especially premium group so that you will not be victimized by lots of scam signal group.There’s few decent signal group that provides detailed analysis on a certain token to buy.This is the group that you should look for instead those signal group that just drop buy and sell price target as signal.",
