  "content": "Hello Everyone Im new here, I've come to the bitcoin Community for some help. I've tried on reddit but had everyone just trolling me. So ill just get in to it here.on the 4th of January around 4oclock I was called out to a job (im self employed) upon arriving 5 mins in to my job I was approached by 2 men in helmets who pepper sprayed me and held me at gunpoint  put me in the back of a van tied me up put a bag over my head and drove me to an unknown location. (Ill spare you all the details in-between) They were after \"Crypto\" They asked me for my phone passcodes which I gave, They asked where the ledger was. I told them I have some BTC in a hot wallet on my phone. I had .55 BTC (yes I know about self custody)So ill skip to the bit where its relevant to BitcoinMy wallet with .55 btcbc1qchgf3waww3yv7crz0uymvgun3sczejeu99xwaf, bc1qtrh3sxcg7jyrkhp0w70fp9ve82amwl4ut6yljnSent to 3QEyb7Lk7PE1ZUWLN3CgJTZ735KzZ6yZv5, bc1qn7gjwnuvj0u5dzrfq2gvcnsk9840y4v9ruuqtcTxid 00125d6dbffb88ac24f4b71ed242d0d8151b19d2d87211144f150585eccc1a5eTransaction id of where .33 was sent (another hot wallet)988c948d7f8f707d2ba43991b1129c374f11058b477ca3f101ab1a0a36068c26I've been doing some digging on block explorer and have found that .55 BTC was sent to 3QEyb7Lk7PE1ZUWLN3CgJTZ735KzZ6yZv5 it sat here for a few days and today it moved and I can't see where it went as there were many transactions under one and most of them were .55BTCWhat I wanna know is is this a mixer or an exchange or OTC address also the .33 Btc was sent to bc1qgpa0uz3ph4076j4f3kjxgzzd6t5298sdtjvwc9This is address has loads of activity constantly funds being moved in and out currently it has 179 BTCThe reason I've on here is to ask for help if anyone can find any information about the wallets ideally what im hoping is one of these wallets is a KYC exchange in order to catch the perprotators . Police are aware and investigations are ongoing but I when I have provided the above details they have no clue. Their  lines of enquiries are cell site data cctv etc.Any help would be appreciated thanks Bitcoiner",

Once it's moved into a platform with a mixing service, that's where the tracking might end. Just check the people you might have discussed your holdings with who know how much you own and the pattern they use in luring you into the job interview who know the kind of job you do and can use such a job to lure you in. You need to start making small internal investigations within your secure, and maybe you discover a trace. This is the reason why it's always advisable for one to keep their crypto holdings, especially when it's something worth a fortune. Many people can do anything possible to obtain that amount from you. There are a lot of greedy and hungry people on the street, and their getting their hands on such information will put you in danger as you will be their target.",

Most businesses that accept crypto usually use a service like Coinbase where it automatically converts to fiat and sent to your bank account. People do this because crypto is just too volatile.It was probably someone that knew he had tons of bitcoins and word got around. Hence why it’s a good idea never to talk about your crypto holdings with anyone.",

I also agree with @Orpichukwu, that this was a planned attack and that some form of set up has been done to accomplish this, there's no way that they're also newbies when it comes to this kind of operation, they've probably done it with other people in the past, hopefully the investigation to this will lead to some matches in previous reports with the same modus operandi, hope that you're doing well OP because that's a traumatizing experience and no way that someone survives that encounter to be completely fine, have you tried doing therapy?Quote from: Poker Player on January 11, 2024, 04:45:57 AMBecause of these things I don't tell anyone I have bitcoin, unlike some people on the forum, it's a security issue.

I think the police can be of great help in this case since it was a physical robbery and not an online scam like we are used to seeing. I’m guessing they have checked cctv footage from nearby shops and likely have a lead on the van’s plate number. Their process may be slow but it’s worth trying.",

How were they able to identify you? Looking at the volume of bitcoin and the dollar equivalent, it is a good sum of money to start with. You could have saved yourself by keeping your assets behind since you are going to a place you have not been before for a job.Possibly there must have been an insider who could know your activities and is very sure you go about with your assets and funds and decided to take advantage of your ignorance to steal your assets. Aside from that, who knows about your bitcoin investment?From the looks, it seems you had similar occurrences years ago based on posts I have read here, and you were not able to learn a lesson from them.

Many posters here that create topics are costly, made-up stories for the sake of getting the attention of other users. We understand that because they are working for their rank. Anyway, if what you've said is true, how can you prove that the OP's account here is the same as the one you've seen on Reddit? At least provide evidence so that we can assure you that your accusation is true. This kind of scenario is common in this section or any other section, so I'm not surprised by this kind of topic, but in the OP's situation, why would the person who robs him know that he has an asset or crypto currency? And go straight to its asset? This seems too suspicious. Maybe others are right; the person who robs him is also close to him, because if not, then how could they know you have cryptographic assets?",
