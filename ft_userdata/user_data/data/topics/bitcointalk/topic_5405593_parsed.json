  "content": "Hi.I just was invited to a telegram group which has more than 300 members and one guy is something like the admin / guru.He sends daily trading signals mostly based on crypto AIC. Therefore he recommends a new platform called tilicoin.com. He also offers 1:1 trading coaching. He takes 10% of the profits and after several days of group signal trading I made some good profits. Unleveraged profits are not as high (1-2%).I checked in with some hundred dollars of gaming money  but for 1:1 coaching he wants to increase the money. I also checked withdrawal one time to be sure that it's possible and not a fake. It did work  also for a bigger amount.So guys... what is your opinion regarding this gambling case?   Does anyone here you this platform?Best regards",

As for gambling, I will suggest you not to depend on anyone, just play your game yourself and never depend on anyone, just use the amount you can afford to lose and have fun. For trading, better to learn it yourself and use a trustworthy platforms like Binance, OKX, Coinbase and other trustworthy exchanges rather than using an exchange that is new, not trustworthy and that can lead to scam.",

Seeing that scam site alone should have let us known that they are planing to scam. I am still always getting surprise that some people will be scammed this way which is avoidable.Quote from: Desmong on July 08, 2022, 11:25:34 AMIf you want to enrol for his teaching, one on one class then that should be your own opinion since you he had traded for you with good profits.The one on one class is not face to face, they met on a telegram group, believing who you do not know alone is foolishness when it comes to money, even the person you know might scam you not to talk of people you do kit know. These kind of online lessens, classes or whatever someone can call it are only a means some people are using to scam people. Quote from: Desmong on July 08, 2022, 11:25:34 AMSo do not trade or gamble on platforms that are new in the gambling and Crypto world. It is a risky attempt and you should know what you are taking yourself into. Exactly my opinion.@TomChicker, check lists of exchanges here: https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchangesSome can still be shaddy, make more research to know which ones are best for you.",

This should be on a trading section since its about trading and this kind of services is not good for me.Those who claimed their self as a guru in trading probably, is just hyping themselves to scam people, I don't believe on those telegram group and for sure, those are the dummy accounts to fool you OP. Better not to avail their services because its too suspicious, you can't make money with that kind of scheme, it can be a dead end for you OP.",

If you aren't trading on your own self generated signals, your doing it wrong from my perspective. Its actually you trying to skip the work and rather take risk where your not certain as to how it would go. A sight that has jus one year operational period based on registration and awaits further subscription to prolong service offer, scuffs. It's something to be mindful of.",

However, the fact OP is making emphasis on successful withdravals and on the percentage of this guru, investor, telegram thing, should raise a red flag.

You are a suspect. Telegram I know is a platform of scammers. It is only those who want to rich over night does want you are doing. Why would you give money to someone to coach, trade and gamble for you. How does that sound in your ears? The whole story here in my opinion is a scam presentation. I will never be scammed again since when I joined this forum, my eyes have been open and the Brain has understand more about scam. So scammers can't convince me anymore. Therefore, Mr. OP please if you are not part of the scamming team on telegram you better run for your life before it too late. I hope Oshosondy has given you the statistic analysis of the website you provided. The registration date and the date the site is expiring. Only that is an enough evidence for you to know that it is a scam site. I have been scammed for such people so I Know their tricks. My brothers run",
