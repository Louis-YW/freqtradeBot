  "content": "I have had a wallet stolen by a forum member,  10,000 btc which they had no right to move. The wallet was claimed and based on my data. i need a arbitrator to be involved and resolve the low life theft. if not then are there any other options besides getting either attorneys involved? or calling the SS  to raid his house and seize his assets which would burn the wallet and i will do this ... no one will get it. This has impacted my life and my wifes cancer treatments which is putting her at risk. I dont have time anymore.. so if you have a suggestion please let me know soon. I do have a longer dissertation and proof which i can post... he can end up with something,.. or it will be nothing overall one way or another. He was tasked with resolving a conversion , that is all and had no other contribution so 1% if that... Mods why is a member allowed to stay on this forum when he has lied and stolen a wallet? Is that not a ban offense? Additionally i did not vet the person which also fed into trusting him ...",

I am sorry to hear about your situation, if it is true, but I must remind you that making threats or harassing someone is not an appropriate or legal way to handle this matter. That will only make things worse for you in the long run. If you believe that you have been the victim of theft, you should file a police report and seek legal counsel.Quote from: MikeJ_NpC on February 14, 2023, 08:31:46 PMMods why is a member allowed to stay on this forum when he has lied and stolen a wallet? Is that not a ban offense? Additionally i did not vet the person which also fed into trusting him ...It's not the mods' responsibility to get involved in arguments between users, and they definitely do not want to take sides in disagreements over whether someone is telling the truth or not. It is important to remember that mods are just volunteers who are trying to keep the forum running smoothly and fairly for everyone. Like I said earlier, if you are looking for someone to intervene in this situation, your best bet is to pursue legal procedures.",

Remember if you don't hold the private key, you don't own any coin, so practically this is your words against his. Without more information we can't help much, 10,000 BTC is too much money to just entrust to some random anonymous individual on the internet.",

As I said, whoever was right, cases like this should be solved through legal means and not through threats and bullying online.I didnt ask him for assistance in cracking.. i asked him for help on conversion of my data which already established things on a shared K that i had for months before any of this..    So someone lying to obtain data  as he did citing he wanted to help is unacceptable. More so if you had this done to you, i dont think you would be too nice to the person either. Its not bullying its wanting to resolve the transgressions and theft which occurred against me ... those are the facts.. he didnt crack jack shit other than taking what did not belong to him  and was not his data wallet or claim. \\So i might not be as popular as him but i should be treated the same as any other god dam member who has done this before me and i clearly i have not been. To assert he had any relevancy is not valid what so ever. Is this helping someone as eluded too or has any of this been actually fair NO ...  Atleast get it correct.",

OR does this need to be done via attorney ? Oh wow, let me get this straight, you're claiming that someone stole a 10,000 BTC from you and now you're pondering who you should file a claim with and whether you should bother hiring a lawyer? How intriguing. Might I suggest seeking out a magical fairy godmother to solve your problem?",

Do you know how it was done, can you reproduce the results or you don't know anything about it?What I mean, is this the only one time in history of bitcoin that something like this is happening or do you know any similar cases?Because if you can't do what he did then how are you going to prove to anyone that someone transferred 10,000 bitcoins without having a private key? It doesn't matter what data you had, unless it was a signed transaction, which I doubt anyone would keep a signed tx on a file.What makes people doubt you is the fact that nobody has been able to do what you are claiming is possible.",

      "body": "So for the people who wanted to defend alberto the low life who stole my legit claim to that wallet.This  is from OCT 13 from one of his vids which goes over the shared K ... that he said he didnt know how to do after giving him MY DATA on nov 9th.As he said he couldnt do it or didnt know how or whatever pathetic excuses he gave as i had proven and shown.... makes no sense and this just reinforces that he stole the wallet and funds from me as it was my datasince the value doubled since then i asked him to send me back the amount it was in nov 2022 and anyone with common sense would of done so .. as its a way out and he could of kept the rest. Instead he wants to pretend otherwise... so i will be moving forward with legal action against him which there is more than enough proof... and that others here mislead and protected the theft.. when the wallet was mine along with the data.Just wanted to show this for those who want to believe otherwise",
