  "content": "I'm in my mid 30s and saved up for a mortgage. However my parents (retired) own 3 properties which they will sign over to their 2 children in the near future.There's a house, an apartment and a holiday home. They live in the house but wish to leave soon because of too much work in the garden.They'll switch from the house to the apartment, and I will inherit the house so it stays in our family. We have many memories to it. My sister constructed her own house and she gets compensated later, or I can pay her monthly to equalise.I've saved up 70k for a mortgage deposit, but I don't have to take one.Mortgage rates have gone through the roof, and this is only the beginning. I will take over the house and expand it (construction throughout the years) with the intention of taking care of my parents + in laws when they are old. So no retirement home for any of them. I like to have them close.Before they move in, I can rent out the newly constructed rooms (at least 3) for business purposes. I study osteopathic medicine and I can take some colleagues. Sort of a small private clinic.With this prospect, what is the smartest thing to do with 70k savings now?I figured, buying 1 BTC and a few Ethereum eyeing the 2024 halving. Keep the remaining 50% of money in the bank for emergency situations.An other option is to take on a loan for the renovations. Or to simply keep all of it, but I don't like that with the current amount of inflation.A lot of people have told me that it is good to take on a mortgage in highly inflationary times with rising intrest rates. I don't really understand that. I guess this is only true when your salary rises equally with the inflation.",

Keep the remaining 50% of money in the bank for emergency situations.Buy the one BTC to store around 27kLook for schools around and try to get a selling permit for fruits or whatever your conscience allows for.Buy some Gold, small units, another 20 k, Leave little in the bank.  Then there is staking, some coins give you 12 to 15% and your coins (money) are kinda frozen.Spread and learn. Once you get a feel you can put more into staking, Earning go into Gold, or if enough pay for another BTC. Not listening on unique occasions which could triple your money.  Only Drug deals can do that and there is no guarantee.",
