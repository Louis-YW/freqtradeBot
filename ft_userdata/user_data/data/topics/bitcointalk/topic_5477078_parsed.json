  "content": "I will create an advertisement for you, to your specifications. I can create frame-by-frame animated ads & non-animated ads that, 99% of the time, can evade ad blockers. It’s possible to do this because it’s just an image, linked to a URL, without any of the bloat and trackers that ad blockers try to detect. Prices are very low as I am doing this mostly for some spare crypto and to hone my skills. The prices will vary based on your specific needs, for example a 256×256 non-animated ad will cost around $5, but as said before the prices will go lower or higher based on what you need.I can create any size for you. Here is what I will need from you to create your ad:1.   Your size(s). Let me know if you’d prefer something for your header which will have a longer width, or sidebar which is usually square or with a longer length. If you want multiple sizes done, just let me know.2.   Do you want it animated or not?3.   Any images, logos, text or other elements you’d like in your ad4.   The link/website/affiliate you want your advertisement to lead to. I can add statistics to your link so you can track visitors, BUT doing so will increase the risk of ad blockers trying to filter it. The best way to avoid this is having an in-site redirection that uses your domain to forward the link (WordPress for example has many of these plugins), but you can use any URL shortener or even just have the link itself. It’s really up to you!I can accept pretty much any crypto (I try to avoid Ethereum due to the brutal gas fees), just let me know what you’d like to pay with, and I’ll let you know if it’s okay.For payment and delivery: If you are a Full Member+ with no negative feedback, I will create it for you first on faith. Anyone with negative feedback or below Full Member will need to either pay first, or put the money in an escrow. Payment won’t be accepted or withdrawn (from escrow) until you are completely satisfied. I will send you watermarked proofs for you to check out before I deliver the actual ad to you.If you require a specific ad format (like .png, .jpg, etc) let me know. Most animated ads will be in GIF format, though.If you have any questions or would like me to make an ad for you, please feel free to PM me, reply here or get in touch VIA the methods below.
