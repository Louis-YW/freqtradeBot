  "content": "Hi, the next halving ahead I'm getting a little troubled about a couple dozen addresses with one UTXO each containing more or less just dust (I know the term is inappropriate, but only 5-8 USD worth each atm). I'm using Electrum and could mark these addresses to „combine“ them sending to a new address (preferably same wallet).Disregarding the privacy issue my question is: would this make sense considering that transaction fees might (most probably will) get higher after the halving?Thankful for opinions and input!(Please excuse my english but I won't use a translator for this).",

The halving period or after it doesn’t necessarily mean that the transaction fee will get higher, high transaction fee is mostly caused by a congested mempool. Although since after halving the bitcoin price pumps many take their profits resulting into many transactions that in turn increases congestion in the mempool and thereby increasing the fees. The only thing guaranteed after halving is the block reward reduction or halved.",

      "body": "Transaction fee will be paid in bitcoin but with same amount of satoshi you pay for transaction fee, its value will be different with Bitcoin price. Like 2000 satoshi when Bitcoin was at $2000 will be cheaper than when Bitcoin is at $26,000 recently.So if you have bitcoin in your non custodial wallet, you can consolidate your UTXOs when you see chances to do consolidation with good fee rate. If you use centralized exchange account, you will pay more expensive cost for consolodation and with small fund, withdrawal fee will be very expensive cost.Quote from: _typer_ on August 23, 2023, 08:45:16 PMAs I understand it the fees are calculated per UTXO, so stuffing many of those into one transaction could blow up the fee I'd pay while each of them is almost just \"dust\". Please correct me if I'm wrong.It is correct but if your fund is small, you can do only one trasaction, consolidate it to a new address which will be used to trade or to receive more transactions later.If that fund is too small, you should not consolidate it, pay on chain transaction and later will have to move it again, pay on chain transaction fee again.",

Please correct me if I'm wrong.You won't be paying high fees now as the mempool is not congested and the lowest fees right now is 6 sats/byte so, I would say consolidating the UTXO right now won't be a problem unless the mempool is congested with many transactions that will result in higher fees compared to the fee before. I haven't tried what you are planning but I did tried sending 5-10 usd worth of bitcoin. Right now, the fee for a transaction is at 8 sats/byte as I am writing this.",

Last weekend I saw the fee at around 4sats/byte so wait on and keep checking fee estimators.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.Bitcoin transaction fee are calculated according to the size of each UTXO, it is total fee= total transaction input (utxo) size + output size= fees. Imagine the byte of each utxo is 100 (even signature verification included) and you have total of 8 utxo then the input size totals to 800, then the output byte which is say 32 then 800+32 will give 832 which is the total bytes for your transaction. Then you set the transaction fee at 4sats then consolidating them will be like 4x832= 3,328sats/bytes as your transaction fee",

Electrum generates a new address for receivements by default so I didn't really care (think about it) at that time. By now addresses have piled up a bit so I thought it might be a good idea to do it before the next halving. Now I've learned that the halving will not necessarily result in higher fees so I've calmed down a bit overnight.Actually I'm now asking myself where would this end? After having consolidated inputs < 0.0004 BTC what will come to my mind next - consolidating inputs < 0.004 BTC ? and then inputs < 0.04 BTC ? Completely disregarding privacy is not really appealing after all...I'll take my time now and wait for the moment to do what seems right.Once again thanks to everyone for the helpful comments!",

After having consolidated inputs < 0.0004 BTC what will come to my mind next - consolidating inputs < 0.004 BTC ? and then inputs < 0.04 BTC ? Completely disregarding privacy is not really appealing after all...I keep a variety of input sizes. There's no point having all your holdings in one or two large inputs of (say) >5 BTC. What happens when you want to buy something for 20 bucks? You have to use a big input, creating a big change output, and causing problems for the privacy of all that change. Similarly, there's no point having all your holdings in small outputs since you will have to pay higher fees when you want to make a larger purchase.So keep a range of outputs. You say your outputs are in the range of $5-8 each. Might you use bitcoin to buy a coffee, some fastfood, a month of a VPN subscription, or something at a similar price range? It so, it's fine to keep those outputs as they are since you can spend them as they are. If not, then consolidate them. Now you've got an output of (say) $50. It's reasonable to think you might want to spend bitcoin on something around that price in the future, so it's reasonable to keep an output of that size.And if you have a range of outputs, then it's easier to make transactions which create no change and therefore not run in to the problem of lots of small outputs needing consolidated in the future.",
