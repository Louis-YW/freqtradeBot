  "content": "I want to promote crypto related products or services but no illegal activities, items or services.Hello everyone,I set up a website in 2019 mainly aimed at Dutch speakers.The website is an independent news and opinion website with loyal followers.This originated just before the corona crisis. It's not an affiliate website. There is exactly one advertisement from a regular reader of ours. I never wanted to monetize this website and not participate in GoogleAds and Affiliate programs from the \"ordinary world\". Principally not. I tried AdSense but removed it again.Our readers are mainly adults from 30 years old and all ages above.We have a newsletter with hundreds of subscribed readers. We have a clean chat/comment section. It is moderated to keep trolls away. It's a serious website with multiple writers. 5 regular writers and in total we have around 10 writers. Mainly columnists and news bringers who bring substantiated news (and often add their opinion).Now I'm looking for sponsors.. Not only out of necessity but also because I myself love cryptos. I'm not an expert in it but the BTC has brought me a lot of good in the past. People on our website are also mainly interested in privacy, buy VPNs, and are afraid of the disappearance of cash and a centralized digital coin.Of course, there are also people in our base who gamble but are driven crazy by the control.I think an audience with beginning crypto enthusiasts can be valuable for our readers, for me, and for the sponsor/blog writer/advertiser etcetera.For more information, PM me or ask here.I would like to hear from \"the good people\" whether it is wise to post the link of my website directly here or only to potentially interested parties.Also, if someone has tips.

      "body": "Since my native language is Dutch, that won't be a problem at all. When I do something for someone, I do it well.In response to the question of which Bitcoin-related articles would best suit the website, we can coordinate together. I know my audience, I think about what fits best with us and I hope after my explanation you will have an idea too? A simple example is a 1000-word explanation for people who want to enter the crypto world. A sincere article with the right links.For example, a guide on how to get started with Bitcoins. Or a video. We can advertise with a separate section on the website where we provide more explanation.We must meet the demands of the people.I have nothing against just a simple advertisement or a general article, it will certainly get views with good SEO. But a really good approach is to really involve people in the service and teach them how to purchase cryptos, how to do this as anonymously as possible.A casino is another story, but as long as it's a fair casino, there's plenty to think about how to get people there. Perhaps we can give away bonuses in the right way on the website without the entire website being full of gambling advertisements.I'm just giving some examples. These are real people to whom you are offering your product. People from \"the offline world\", can I describe it like that? Not sure if some typical Dutch expressions also make sense in English As long as everything remains legal, I am obv. not going to post for scamsites, I believe there are numerous possibilities. Don't overlook the newsletter and the social media platforms that are linked to the website as well.When we devise a plan, I'm confident we can agree on a price that is suitable for both of us. If the business is truly serious and I find it appealing, we could start with a small project, such as writing some blog posts as an initial task, and brainstorm other ideas together in the meantime.We can get in contact any way you like. I just still have a PM limit of just 1 or a few today here.This is the website btw:commonsensetv.nl",

I posted my situation on the forum in various topics, albeit perhaps a bit lengthy, but understandably, people have many questions.Suddenly you started writing over the forum, mostly asking for money. No matter whether is it a loan or selling ad space. Desperate moves and rashness are definitely not a good solution and you need to slow down a bit. You have already received enough suggestions, present your pages, give some details about traffic, number of visits, the average stay on the site and similar and present your offer. Who is ready to enter into a deal with you if it is obvious that there is a great possibility of selling the site in the case of an offer that meets your needs at the moment?I saw that you have solid traffic, but it is mainly from the Netherlands, so you are limited to services that may be interesting to your visitors. Also, you need to study a little more on this forum, you will see that there are different ways to monetize your blog.

In the end, I said that Adsense is not the only option, there are many others, almost the same, some even with a better payment rateOf course they're multiple advantages of Adsense, but that doesn't make my response nonsense, because a site admin may not change niche or content type that is against Google's policy without getting banned. For instance, google adsense may not accept a cryptocurrency blog and Op wants to switch his contents toward crypto, if he is working with adsense would he do that without getting banned and lose already generated funds? They may not be the general admin, but the adnetwork has influence over your site, and you must abide by their rules, you are no longer the sole proprietor of what happens in the site. In addition, monetizing adsense has to do with the tier of traffic that visits your site and their CPA. If OP's visitors are from tier3 what gain is it to choose google adsense or an adnetwork as sponsors. It will take ages for the site to yield him much profits. Webmasters with Tier1 traffics are advised to use google adsense as they have higher CPA on Ads published on the page. However, the site OP is running is not yet big like I said, and it's a factor to consider, before jumping into adnetworks regardless of the company whether Adsense or PropellerAds",

I'm not an expert in it but the BTC has brought me a lot of good in the past. People on our website are also mainly interested in privacy, buy VPNs, and are afraid of the disappearance of cash and a centralized digital coin.Of course, there are also people in our base who gamble but are driven crazy by the control.I think an audience with beginning crypto enthusiasts can be valuable for our readers, for me, and for the sponsor/blog writer/advertiser etcetera.For more information, PM me or ask here.I would like to hear from \"the good people\" whether it is wise to post the link of my website directly here or only to potentially interested parties.Also, if someone has tips. Much appreciated!Website:commonsensetv.nlBased on your story, you seem to realize that you need to promote the website you created, right? Then I have another question, why didn't you join Google ads, affiliate marketing and didn't you pursue to monetize that?Isn't it with these tools that you can have sponsors especially when you see your community growing on the website you made? It also means how many years were wasted in this incident on your website? Well, it's not too late for that.",
