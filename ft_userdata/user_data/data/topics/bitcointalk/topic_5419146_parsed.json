If it comes to bitcoin price, short term guess could be right or wrong, but long term guess that is pointing towards mooning and bullish trends are always right. If anyone is no more believing in bitcoin that its price will increase, such person is likely a newbie that do not check bitcoin price history because if bitcoin price history is analyzed and known, he should know that the price of bitcoin will pump again.",

You have to be careful about the samples you use when determining if there's fear among investors (you're unlikely to see as much fear around here as you will in places like Twitter and YouTube).I don't think bitcoin has \"died\" enough yet though to end the bear market, but what if it doesn't have to? Perhaps not having complete fear will derive greater strength in a rally (though I do think we have further to drop at this point).",

We only have two market conditions; the bear and bull seasons. Perhaps, it is a cycle - once the bear season is over, the bull season will take over. However, it was not a simple thing to think about, not even have the chance to know when it comes but we are aware of the halving which will change the direction of the market price. It was believed that every 4-year cycle it will change, as we are in bear season this year, it is likely we wait 4 years from now, and that gonna be 2025 we see the market in bullish again. That is why we have to learn to be patient and of course, to keep positive despite the disturbing price movement.",

While it is possible that we may see another leg down before the blast off to the moon, I feel safe saying we’re definitely in an accumulation phase and the smart money is buying BTC here. Historically speaking, this is the time in the cycle when Bitcoin hits bottom, so while I don’t expect history to repeat, it will rhyme. Don’t miss out on accumulating through the bottom year of the market by trying to catch the exact bottom. Stack sats!",

It’s ok to get bored as long as you are bot losing the money, bear market is the best time to accumulate and it’s good to do this slowly but surely. Bull will still come, time can tell and we can only be ready for that. Many are still focus on the economic situation of US, that affects the whole crypto market.",

We are lucky that the price is still above $20k'ish right now. But in the last couple of days, the market went from $20,500->$20,100. So that is huge dump already.Market cap losing its $1 Trillion space again as we are down to $989.45B.",

But after that, it's selling again and the pressure continues to push it further down. And if by chance this continue because of some negative news, when sub $20k is going to be experience again.So yeah, no one knows what's coming, we don't have the crystal ball to predict the future.One thing that we can hold though is the historical cycle of bitcoin, now that we are in the middle of the bear zone, don't expect the price go to up. But be positive and take advantage of the current situation and accumulate cheap BTC.",

Dont make yourself get affected on whatever people around been telling.2. True holder doesnt really gets bored.3. Bear or Bull, no one  really knows on what would happen next.4. You should bare in mind that market is always been unpredictable and totally random.",

No other finical markets give you this return on investments & profits in this little time.Another example is that you can invest in real estate and hope for good returns in over a decade. Bitcoin market will give you maximum returns in only under 4 years.",

It's normal to be bored and I believe that even the old crypto hodlers do experience this too but they just find ways to entertain themselves outside. They don't really focus in the market because that can affect the way they think and maybe they will sell at loss.Those who believe that crypto is dead are just newbies or anti cryptos but many of them will change their minds once they see that cryptos are pumping again. For now, you are right op. There is no signs that we are in a bull or the price is going to pump. I don't know why some can say that. Are they doing it for a purpose?

People who persistently say that a new big pump is coming in the middle of a bear market say it mainly for themselves, because weak hands are always weak and they are looking for a reason to comfort themselves, although most of them will not see what they are persistently talking about, because by then they will have already sold everything they have.You are somewhat right, for those who are just looking for a quick profit, these times are really very frustrating.",

Even BNB in the last week was pumped up to 15%. I think this is an amazing show. No one gets tired of holding crypto, except for an urgent need that compels them to sell it.
