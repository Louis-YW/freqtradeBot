  "content": "Recently the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, started a five-day four-nation expedition of Africa. He is slated to visit Egypt,  Ethiopia, Uganda and the Republic of the Congo. During a press conference in Cairo he blamed the West for the atrocities in Ukraine. He had also written an op-ed where he claimed that unlike the West Russia has “not stained itself with the bloody crimes of colonialism. He painted the  Kremlin  (and especially the current Putin government) as the defender of nations against Western colonial ambitions and aggression.Yes to a large extent the West have not been a sincere and reliable ally of Africa. Africa is today ravaged by corrupt leaders but the West aided the assassination of Africa’s finest leaders. The killings of Thomas Sankara,  Murtala Mohamed and Patrice Lumumba have been linked to the West because of their anti-Western policy or stance. The exploitation and dehumanization of slave trade cannot be described. Western powers treated Africans less than animals. African culture and arts were diluted and stolen. Some artworks stolen by Europeans are been returned to Africa out of repentance and restitution.The West has always aided corrupt African politicians to siphon and bank African funds by granting them access to European banks. They support or back coup and crises because of their selfish interest.But Africa should not be deceived because Russia is not a viable alternative to the West. We are seeing an increase of Russian interference in the internal affairs of many African countries. It is already heavily involved in domestic politics in  Sudan , CAR, DRC and Mali.  Some countries are being indirectly colonized by Russia. There is evidence that suggests that Russia has colluded with Sudan's beleaguered military leadership, enabling billions of dollars in gold to bypass the Sudanese state and to deprive the poverty-stricken country of hundreds of millions in state revenue. The Wagner group is committing untold human right abuses in some conflict or war stricken African nations. The invasion of Ukraine is a clear proof that Russia can invade any country even in Africa. Russia cannot also be a trusted friend of Africa because it can use food as a weapon of war. No doubt the West and Russia have contributed immensely to the multidimensional development of Africa. They have given Africa strategic investments, trade incentives and lucrative energy deals, but the truth is that the West and Russia cannot love Africa more than Africans. The West and Russia will never genuinely aid the development of Africa. If Africa develops who would buy their products and how would they get cheap raw material. Africa is one of Russia and the West cheapest market. Hence, only Africans can develop Africa.",

If you want it to be a nation, there are a lot of people in Africa that you have to change the mindsets of. The term \"Africa\" being used as one-size-fits-all, doesn't even make sense.",

Africa feel lazy to develop their country with the fund they have. Let's take dubai for example,  dubai is located in a desert land but the people of dubai were the one that develop their country,  dubai was not developed by Americans or the Europeans.",

From slave trade, to colonialism and now neo-colonialsm Africa have always been exploited by the West. Although we can say that even the colonial masters are far better than the corrupt set of rulers in Africa but the truth is nobody can put your house in order for you. We Africans most strive to make our continent a better place because if we don't nobody will do it for us.

Colonialism was over quite a long time ago, and all African countries now have their countrymen ruling them, if all through these years they have pursued the interest of their nation, in regards to development and other whatnots, they'd definitely be in a better place right now, but for African leaders it has always been about their own selfish interest, and for as long as that continues, there would hardly be development in that region; all i can say is that it is time for most parts of Africa to stand for good leadership or absolutely nothing else.",
