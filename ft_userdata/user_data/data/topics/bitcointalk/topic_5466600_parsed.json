      "body": "And because the news leaked out, expect investors to dump Solana before they give FTX a chance to sell theirs. This is the good part when you are updated with the current news. Whales won't have a chance to sell at the peak of the price while retail investors could take advantage of this and be the first to do it. Will this affect the cryptocurrency market? It sure will. That's a lot of money and it alarms all who are holding whatever asset FTX has. It could be either an opportunity to sell while it's in this position or it will be a devastating event for those who have not heard the gospel just yet. If they will keep on selling every week then I bet we will have a dump until the end of this year for the coins that they have possession with.",

Solana community must be feeling worry about this. The price of solana has been plunged so hard due to this news. The dump from FTX will make it go down even deeper in a short time. I expect panic selling for solana to happen in upcoming days. Im not feeling worry about BTC and ETH caused by these cryptos have so many daily trade volumes that can prevent the dump. Solana is just having 300 millions daily trade volume. It will be so difficult to dump it as FTX owned 3/1 compared with daily trade volume of solana.

The solana community must move to another crypto to protect its asset from the dump by FTX",

But, as we all know, anything is possible in crypto! Let's see how the market reacts.With the affected coins, definitely. But seeing as there's a limit per week, I don't think we'd be seeing anything big of a dump, we might see a lot of traders taking advantage of the weekly sale though and make moves on the market, so you can expect a lot of changes within those say 2,3 days after the sale, but after that it should become relatively steady again. Cycle would probably repeat, and maybe only after a few months can we see if any significant change actually happened. If we do add the confidence of investors in SOL though, then things change. A lot of holders would've probably sold their coins temporarily for now since this sell off would inevitably stagnate, if not dump the market of SOL. What would be the use of hodling it by then? They'd probably sell it off even if the request hasn't gone through yet, so a drop in the SOL market would probably be expected.",

But, as we all know, anything is possible in crypto! Let's see how the market reacts.The prospect of these coins being sold off onto the market regularly every week makes the community extremely worried. With the plan approved, FTX will sell the coins without informing the community, instead, they will only notify the government trustees and creditor representatives. FTX proposed in the plan that they would sell this crypto without prior notice.This initial proposal met with opposition from some commissioners. They believe that the sale of large amounts of BTC, ETH and similar coins needs to be widely announced to the community first. This can help reduce the impact on the market and keep people fearless. FTX revised the proposal based on officials' opinions. However, FTX still maintains the stance of not announcing sell orders in advance to keep the coin prices at the best possible level. Perhaps we also need to be alert to these issues, because selling this compared to the market value will not be worth it, so don't be too afraid of the news, but also need to be careful with the crypto you are holding that FTX holds. The current situation seems like the market has not yet reacted strongly to this, after all, this is an ongoing part, besides we are also at a stage where there is also a lot of special attention for for the market sales.",
