It appears the attackers gained access to user private keys and passwords by modifying the source code of the application on the server.If true, then I'm not sure if they will be able to stop the hacker from keep sucking away their users funds.

Their homepage which show review from \"CZ Binance\" on Trustpilot[1] also add confusion since i remember CZ Binance also promote Trust wallet on Twitter some time ago[2].I have been searching around this forum, but I could not find any previous discussions about this specific topic. However, I did come across a few articles from 2018 that shed some light on the partnership between CZ Binance and Konstantin G., who is the CEO and founder of AtomicWallet and the former CEO and co-founder of Changelly.https://www.unlock-bc.com/news/2018-05-03/changelly-partnered-with-binance-konstantin-met-with-cz-in-malta/",

I didn't think Atomic was also owned by Binance?For those of you like me that did not remember if you left any funds in there (I had an entire $2 of tron so no big deal) just put your phone in airplane mode or disconnect your internet from you PC and check. And then if needed get your private keys. Don't start with getting the keys and importing do a time / effort analysis. Copay was open source. But as I have said countless times. Open source and build verified still does not prevent bad coding. Or as you mentioned a supply chain attack.It just allows more people to see the bad code and report it and get it fixed. And also as I have said countless times. Open source don't mean shit if people don't verify the source vs compiled that you are downloading. And lets not forget the HOW SECURE IS THE PROCESS OF UPLOADING THE APP TO THE VARIOUS APP STORES.Everything else could be perfect, but if you don't secure that system then you are not secure.-Dave",

If the computer is compromised then malware with sufficient elevated rights can compromise the software wallet. If the software wallet itself is badly crafted, which you can't check with closed-source software, then you're screwed anyway.Importing the BIP-39 compatible recovery words of the Atomic Wallet in another wallet only makes sense if you can exclude the possibility that those recovery words or the underlying seed wasn't already compromised. Sure, if the current attack on Atomic Wallet needs some more ongoing interaction with the Atomic Wallet software, then you may gain some ground by importing it in another verified wallet that supports all your coins and tokens. Sadly, many alternatives are closed-source, too, with very few exceptions (I believe Unstoppable Wallet is multi-coin and open-source).Even more sadly is that those closed-source wallets mostly don't offer the use of a hardware wallet with them. If implemented properly and without malicious intends that would mostly prevent a compromise of the seed and/or private keys that are secured by the hardware wallet.",
