Do you have a private key or a seed? You wrote about a key, then you said about addresses. I am asking because from a seed you may recover addresses on various derivation paths. This means that there's a chance you had in the past addresses that started with 1 and now you got in Electrum addresses starting with bc1. So it worth knowing what addresses you're expecting.3. Maybe you check the expected address (not key, not seed!) on a block explorer like https://mempool.space and see if there are indeed funds in there.If these don't help you may have to tell a bit more about your problem. Background - where's that key/seed from, how old the transactions, whatever you think it can help to understand what can cause your problem.",

I rechecked in blockchain for balance and found it was there until now.First, make sure that the private key that you've imported is the key of the address that you're trying to import:In Mycelium, click on the \"Accounts\" tab and select your \"Bitcoin SA\" account that was created when you imported the prvKey.Then go to \"Balance\" tab to see the address (click the QR Code to switch to the other address types).- If one of the address is the same as the one with balance, then it's a simple server issue in Mycelium.To rescan: go back to the \"Accounts\" tab and select your \"Bitcoin SA\" account, then click the menu (three dots) and select \"Reload Account\".Wait for a few minutes until the loading animation stops.- If none of the addresses is correct, then you might have a different private key.",

I tried this but it doesn't seem to be working still. Is there someone out there who can help me on this?As far as I know, restoring wallets or generating addresses from individual private keys is not doable in the case of Mycelium wallet. Perhaps you can sweep a private key automatically moving all the coins associated with it to a new address, but for that, you obviously need to have a wallet at hand. Given all that, I can safely assume that what you have tried to import was a set of 12 or 24 English words, that is, a seed phrase. You are probably trying to say that addresses previously associated with a seed phrase showed balance correctly and existed, but stopped doing so once you imported your seed to a new wallet. The only explanation I can come up with regarding why that may have happened is you probably forgot that while initially generating your addresses, you used a special secret: a passphrase that serves as an additional deterministic entropy for your keys. Your seed phrase generates one set of addresses; your seed in combination with a passphrase generates a completely different set of addresses. If you don't specify a passphrase when restoring your wallet in Mycelium, you can't re-calculate your addresses with balance.",

      "body": "I am allergic to people who ask for help with a problem but don't provide the needed information or come back to report whether they managed to fix their issues or not.There are several questions here:1. What was the original software that generated the key?2. Is it a private key in the first place or a seed?3. What happened with the original wallet you used that key with where you received your coins? Why don't you send the coins from there to a different wallet?4. If this is in fact a seed and you imported it into Electrum, did you tick the option \"BIP39 seed\" and selected the correct derivation path that corresponds with your address format?

I was curious about that myself, so I checked around a bit. hosseinimr93 is right judging by what the Bitcoin Wiki is saying in How to import private keys.",
