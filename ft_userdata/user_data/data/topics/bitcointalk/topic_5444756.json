  "content": "Hello guys , ughh dont know how to start . First of all i want to Say some words about me , I’m Andrew (24 years old ) I’m coming from Romania ( country of Dracula ) here things go hard and to make a decent living you have to struggle and work hard , so I’m trained into marking efforts. This year I decided to put all of my knowledge and all of my time to built a good project on cryptocurrency so with that being said let me introduce you SpendHubWhat it is SpendHub? Well , a new way of marketplace . I am looking forward to crypto adoption and with my idea we will be closer to the future .In this marketplace people will use crypto to buy and also sell goods and services like cars, houses , clothes, electronics etc . But also to buy and sell services online like mentoring , marketing etc . Each buyer and seller will have a real rating so we will don’t have fake gurus , scamming won’t be possible on our platform because we will pay the sellers after some time when the customers will be happy otherwise if someone will be scammed on our platform we will be able to refund them very easily. How it will work ? So we will have partnerships with brands because it will be a plus for them , they will sell their stuff more easily and target a very large amount of people .Payment possibilities? Over the classic crypto like BTC , ETH , SOL, BNB etc. we will have oleo our own cryptocurrency called Spend (SPN ) that clients will use on the platform . I decided to post here because I’m looking for potential investors but also to understand the project not only come with funds , because I might need some advice also I hope my post doesn’t bother you guys . I can be found on TG at @ themarketwarriors  or on instagram at marketwarrriors , for further question or possible Colab . Hope you all have a great day !!!",
