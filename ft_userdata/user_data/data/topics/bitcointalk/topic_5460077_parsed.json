  "content": "Europe security is vulnerble If things turn to be bad then USA only options what's left to protect some part of europe Will be to nuke or bomb all eastern Europe to protect at least half of the france and spain and UK ireland untfortunately it's quite impossible to protect finland baltics and eastern Europe region as whole.Let's look the locations the eastern Europe and south europe italy turkey...region also surrounded by middle east countries and those borders Are vulnerble to attacks.Europe can be protected only by USA and canada but in worse case scenario If middle east will join russia then its impossible to protect Europe Also it takes a lot resources and money and USA debt ceiling is lifted up to 2,5 years so after that usa have trouble to finances war.By geopolitalc talk point USA and canada have 2 options either to give half of the europe to russia and china and middle East or USA and canada Will fight with long distance fire at least they can save only Norway sweden netherland Denmark spain and UK ireland untfortunately half of. The germany the East Side Will be occupied by russia USA and canada can only save west side of germany.The italy and all the south side of Europe cant be protected either. So let's see wich options the USA and canada Will choose either to going to some deal like half europe going to go to russia china and middle East and africa and India ownership rule.Or they Will just save UK and spain mainly.But Even If they going to do deal it's dangerous and no quararnties that russia and allies dont move forward to take spain and france.It seems that the USA and canada Will not choose deal but long distance fire to save UK spain Norway and maybe sweden.",

I think that also US was moving nuclear bombs in suitcases as I have seen this lately on TV and news,it means that they are ready to counter any of the Russian regime nuclear move without putting much of the population of the world at risk.They are well prepared for such a scenario and they know well that desperation is growing in super high levels in Russia as they are not able to sustain what they call the special military operation which in fact is a full scale war against an independent country.I don't think Russia will be that stupid to use nuclear arms as this means they will be eradicated from earth soon after they do so.",

      "body": "STFU mate! You know nothing. Who brainwashed you? A biased one-sided book or a teacher with limited knowledge? I will never be biased for the USA as well but your analysis is laughable. You cannot even picture thru your mind the whole map of the world. Germany for instance is in central Europe which is nearer to Russia which means it will be taken first before France and so on. You also have little to ZERO idea about each nation's population and military capability.But yeah, because I was laughing so hard, I was able to finish reading your post.",

The military pf every country has been developing over the years and is not what it was yesterday that people know.I started to become addicted to wars and world history when I was 10 years old. So I started and wanted to read all the wars and conflicts and history and geography of course to better understand the backgrounds from different sources to avoid bias and come up with better imagination. And it would be the dumbest idea to ignore the various statistics reported unless you have better knowledge to start your estimates than those groups and organizations which actually consist of experts, researchers, agents, etc. Obviously, they are not accurate but they are a good basis to start estimating their numbers and capabilities. The nukes will be the real equalizers when it comes to total war and nobody will want to start a nuclear war unless it is out of desperation or when some of these superpowers are already depleted.",
