They are simply changing the layout of the camera or pinholes etc. Well, the Design looks great (of Trezor's wallet) but I am not a user so why I am getting excited? hehe. In my thought, they will name it in the X series maybe. What other name they might come up with?",

      "body": "Bitcoin Takeover podcast, Matej Zak and Vlad Costea (August 8, 2023):QuoteBut speaking of Trezor, there are some exclusive news to be discovered in this interview: first of all, Trezor is planning to launch two new hardware wallets in 2023 and 2024. The first one is an affordable unit which improves on the Trezor One design and retains the physical buttons – the code name for it is Trezor Model R, and according to the ongoing GitHub commits it features a 3-button layout, a USB-C connector, and a SLIP39 (Shamir Secret Sharing) integration. If it costs around $70, the Trezor Model R is bound to be the most affordable Shamir-powered hardware wallet on the market. It’s bound to launch sometime during the fall of 2023.The second hardware wallet that Trezor will add to their line is a more high-end device. Not too much information is known about it, but it’s expected to be more feature-packed than the Trezor Model T and get sold at a similar or even lower price point. The expected launch date is sometime in 2024, but the bad news is that it won’t come with the Tropic Square open source chip.According to Matej Zak, Tropic Square‘s TASSIC (Transparent Authenticated Secure Storage Integrated Circuit) chip is still in testing phase and will enter production sometime in 2024. Therefore, it can’t become available sooner than the year 2025. The good news is, however, that Trezor will be the first company to benefit from this unique security chip. So the Czech-made hardware wallets will finally get the kind of uncompromising physical security that they have been seeking.https://bitcoin-takeover.com/s14-e3-matej-zak-on-trezors-new-hardware/You can listen to this podcast on Spotify, Apple Podcasts & YouTube.",

Repackaging the old perfumes in a new bottle yields no change in scent.I require a companion for my Passport 2 HW to integrate it into my multisig wallet. I held a lingering hope for a new Trezor model featuring a cutting-edge SE devoid of the shortcomings typically associated with Microchips products. Unfortunately, these hopes are unlikely to materialize this year.Probably will wait for new ColdCard Q1 which should appear next year.",
