But you can actually create the wallet offline. I just checked it out. The link is from the official site, so there is no need to worry.",

I highly recommend bookmarking their official address. It is always best to never access websites through a search engine, especially when using a web wallet. Otherwise, you could accidentally end up on a phishing site. Also, make sure that your computer is clean of malware before accessing your wallet.",

What are the coins that you want to buy?Can't you go into those dexes or cexes where you can buy those coins that you want? It's safer if that's what you're going to do and then just withdraw it eventually there if you're going to do it in a centralized exchange.",

In fact, I can not see any repository that deals with this kind of web wallet. You can search on it with the \"web\" or \"wallet\" keyword. It is similar to some people who thought Trust Wallet is open source but it isn't.Quote from: Stalker22 on November 12, 2022, 10:31:31 PMsince you plan to trust them with your money, there is no reason not to trust their official wallet.Agreed. I also found there is another wallet in case @OP is interested, see https://forum.pokt.network/search?q=wallet. There is an extension-based wallet, just DYOR since I didn't dig deeper about it, although it has the wallet repository available, not like the wallet in OP.",

I checked Ledger still not support this coin, so it's fine to hold in this wallet until Ledger include it. You should know any web wallet are vulnerable and increase the possibility to get compromised, it's not good to hold huge amount for long time.",

I don't always like .json file from wallets because you need to download them and store them in a more complicated ways.I can only think of copying into a empty USB flash or do you have a better idea? If the JSON itself is not encrypted, it is essential to encrypt it before you store it or make a backup. Generally, it is better to store in 3 locations, preferably in a different location. But if you only store a few amounts, practising basic data security is good enough. Storing it on a USB flash is a plausible idea, but it is not recommended to store long-term data. You can also make use of reputable cloud services. The main idea is, to store and backup in it multiple locations wethers digital or physical, and beforehand make sure the data is encrypted.",

I'm pretty sure most wallet will ask for your seed to recover your wallet instead of JSON file as the main recovery option, so losing your JSON file or not creating it is not a big problem as long as you keep your seed safe in one or two backups. EDIT: Just checked the site, looks like it doesn't support seed generation and just created a keyfile(JSON) for you, which means storing it is mandatory. Are you sure it generate a seed for you? I've double checked and the wallet generation follows the same process (create new wallet, create a password, download keyfile). Are you sure you don't mean passphrase/password instead?",

It's better if you learn first before make a non sense post.Although hardware wallet is really safe since you don't need to connect with internet, I will say away from any closed source hardware wallet since you're don't know the security about this wallet.",

Yes it is a good idea, or an external hard drive on which you save the JSON file, and never try to use the hard drive or flash USB on your computer that you use to download programs and other things. It is better to use it on a computer that is devoid of any programs, where the file is safe with you and is not vulnerable to any Trojan horses. The web wallet is good, but its security rate is not as high as cold wallets. You have to choose the online web wallets that you will use and deposit your money on them carefully. I have no idea about Pokt Network online web wallet, please do your own research.",
