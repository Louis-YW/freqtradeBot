Not that familiar with other wallets though blue and phoenix wallets ring a bell to me.  LN wallets all have to be hot wallets or have hot wallet components imo. There's a security tradeoff with the person you're opening your channel with (and a potential it relies on trust). Quote from: rhomelmabini on June 24, 2022, 01:28:18 PMEdit: Checked it, it says \"Lightning support in Electrum is experimental\".I think it says this because they're an experienced and well known developer in the cryptospace and are offering the ln in all updated wallet software versions - it's been out a while but I'd like for anyone using the lightning network to try to understand it (and check you're happy and comfortable with its limitations).Quote from: DoublerHunter on June 24, 2022, 11:20:23 PM^ Yes, where is Electrum wallet that is a very easy and convenient way of using Lightning Network transactions.

A PC version is always good than the mobile version wallet app but unfortunately, this is not available on Apple's AppStore. It's disappointing it's not available in the appstore, I'd agree with that - especially if over half of the US still has iPhones (afaik in Europe it used to be 20% and is now likely even less that exclusively own an iPhone).",

It depends on the user itself too if they want to run it with own channel or unknown channel that has been set up the developer, but at least the best wallet need these criteria e.g. open source and non custodial.This is good read from those wallet you mentioned above and other thread that will make you gain more knowledge:1.
