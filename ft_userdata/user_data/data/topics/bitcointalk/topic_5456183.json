Use a different image hosting platform (like TalkImg created by @joker_josue, a forum member).Imgur images suddenly became invalid?Since you have very few posts, manually updating them is fine... but for anyone else, consider using my script: [Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images",

I see only one post have some images link which are hosted on imgur. I will suggest to update the post. Download the images and re-upload all of it to imgbb or talkimg, update the image link of the post. The images will work again.",

Forget about imgur and use the TalkImg service initiated by a forum member named joker_josue.I am the fourth person to advise you with the same advice as PX-Z, TryNinja and BitcoinGirl.Club regarding the malfunctioning of image hosting using imgur.Imgur had time to recover every image post that was uploaded on the forum.If you post a lot of pictures, use the script created by TryNinja.",
