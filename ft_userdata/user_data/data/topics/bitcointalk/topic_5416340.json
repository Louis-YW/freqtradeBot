Timeframe is one of the common things that people do ignore or mistakenly able to check.Its not bad to look out on others speculations and analysis.A good trader would definitely be finding out some resources for him to at least justify on what he had made out for himself.Looking on other angle might be one of the strategy to make up some confirmation towards his possible trades.Its true that every word that comes out into this space would really be 100% speculation.Fuck off into those people who had said about 100% winning trading strategy since it doesntexist on the first place.Nothing is perfect and knowing trading would involved a never ending trial and error.",

The fact here is volatility has come to stay and as such knowing how to go about your analysis should be a necessity for Bitcoin holders. This advice is for traders, not for holders. Holders follow a long pattern that can easily be know if not following charts, but holders too can follow charts using a long range of candles like weekly or monthly candles, but holders are not more moved by the candle stick pattern and indicators, but believe more about bull and bear market which can easily be known from the present price of bitcoin and the present all-time-high. This would determine whether to hold or not.",

Trading signals work until they don’t, and with a lot of traders that “don’t” wipes them out. Reminds me of popular crowd wisdom projects that came up around the last ATH, convinced that hive mind projections were more accurate over the long term, forgetting also that in rallies, almost every pick is likely to rake in profits, forgetting that the hive is just a lot of traders following only a handful.Major funds all reporting profits and losses at the same time, at the same periods also prove that experts and career traders can't really trade outside the noise.So yeah. Longer term holds understanding that you will be in the red most of the time in crypto, the better way to go. So long as halving patterns hold, anyway.",

I don't know what is their basis for trusting someone who does this as for me, they are just like us which are also relying on the price chart and of course, the capability to speculate the market. If we are about to spend the market and trying hard to analyze it, I believe we can do even better with these experts. I believe there are some experts who really exist but it was different in crypto where it is absolutely unpredictable, unlike the others.",

I only can say after halving is when the bull start to happen.For emphasis, what you said there also is a speculation 🤔. The bottom line is that this industry is speculative in nature and that's why some people erroneously say it's akin to gambling (it's not, actually). I guess the speculative nature stems from the fact that nobody knows tomorrow. The crypto industry is based on what happens in the future/tomorrow, we only can speculate on where price will be going. No one is certain what happens next. If anyone knew of certitude where price will be headed to that person will be made for life. Again, due to the uncertainty in this speculative industry, investors are warned ahead to only invest what they can afford to lose.",
