  "content": "Amidst the doubts and scepticism came the news of El Salvador making Bitcoin their legal tender. Many thought it was far-fetched and impossible to adopt as a country. However, the country did that and has been able to aid its economy gracefully after that. There were countless people of went there only to visit the Bitcoin beach and see what it is like to live in a country where Bitcoin was accepted in every nook and corner. Additionally, after the government passed the Bitcoin law, the country saw an increase in crypto startups and a 30% increase in tourism. Of course, there are challenges throughout the journey since the government made the decision during a bull run, and the crypto market didn’t perform well. So, let’s break down the Salvadoran experiment with Bitcoin and list its pros and cons:Pros:The country's tourist ministry claims that since accepting bitcoin as legal tender, tourism in El Salvador has increased by more than 30%.Crypto multiplied the opportunities to do business with more partners anywhere in the world.Provided financial freedom and added innovation to the current system.Along with more tourists, more investors also came to see how crypto works.Around 1.1 million visitors had been projected, and the country has received 1.4 million.After adopting the bitcoin law, El Salvador had a double-digit GDP increase for the first time in history, according to Nayib Bukele.When compared to January 2021, exports, a key factor in economic growth, increased by 13% in January of this year.In an effort to alleviate concerns about sustainability, Bukele claimed in June that he had given the state-owned geothermal power company LaGeo instructions to create a plan for providing bitcoin mining facilities utilising renewable energy from the nation's volcanoes.Bukele has established a $150 million fund to facilitate the trading of bitcoin for dollars in order to help with foreign exchange.In El Zonte, a beach town that served as one of the cryptocurrency's launchpads in El Salvador, bitcoin has established itself as a well-liked method of payment for individuals who hold them.It has raised hopes that it might be a significant source of foreign exchange.Cons:Because of merchants' slow embrace of bitcoin, customers are left in the dark.Hacking incidents are on the rise. At least 2,000 cases of identity theft have been monitored by the Tracoda watch group.According to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, El Salvador runs the risk of becoming a refuge for tax evasion and money laundering.Fitch stated that due to heightened foreign exchange and earnings volatility risk, bitcoin would have an adverse credit impact on Salvadoran insurance companies exposed to the currency.El Salvador's creditworthiness was reduced by rating agency Moody's after Bukele's bitcoin law was adopted.The country's dollar-denominated bonds are also under pressure.It might make financial institutions more susceptible to legal, financial, and operational risks, including those related to global anti-money laundering and terrorism financing laws.",

The milestone operation transferred around 125,000 cubic metres of LNG. The vessel is a part of the Acajutla FSRU project that is for exclusive use by Energía del Pacífico. The 378 megawatts Energía del Pacifíco power generation is the largest private infrastructure investment in El Salvador.This FSRU is a part of the new technology solution. It includes Wärtsilä 50SG gas engines and a steam turbine cycle which will provide power for 30 per cent of the country’s electricity demand. Therefore, this is to transform the country into a net exporter of electric power instead of a net importerSo when you create the infrastructure to supply 30% of your electricity via gas-powered powerplants, isn't the whole volcano thing starting to look more like a lie or publicity stunt?PS.The cons are just as stupid, to blame bitcoin for crime in Salvador is just silly as for financial, common, Salvador was the poorest of the poor even before this.",

Bitcoin bear market makes many persons see no future in investing in cryptocurrency because they thought the market will never rise again due to so much loses many investing had acquired. El Salvador is not left out here because they also suffer the loses due to there large investment in Bitcoin that had make many persons to know about what cryptocurrency is and some of what it entails.",

Technology has come to this point where we can put one full functional, powerful computer machine in our pocket. And yet there are primitive people who do not know that electricity even exists. My point here is, BTC in not a new concept, it has been here for ages now. Since October 31, 2008. People know about it, they own it, they love it and some hate it. Those who are primitive people in crypto world, they will never know that BTC exist while the world around them will continue to grow. It will face many obstacles on the way but in the end, just like technology has reached us in this era, BTC will be widespread all over the world at some point. The issue with El Salvador tho, they can only use BTC to improve their recent condition if other countries accept BTC as a way of payment from them. Recently there have been news regarding many countries legalizing BTC as legal currency have popped up but not many, and I am not sure what kind of relation El Salvador have with them. As days goes by it will spread all over the world and everyone will be benefiting from it. Remember, people only remember who is the first. El Salvador may face some difficulty, but in our crypto history, this will be the first country to accept BTC for what it is. Only time will tell.",

It is true, there is big opposition as well as support on bitcoin as legal tender within the country. We don't know how effective this have made changes in the market. As for the statistics there is rise in the usage and acceptance of bitcoin within the country. The best part, people who are craze and prefer investing into bitcoin keeps accumulating the funds received out of business and use the fiat received to meet the expenses. This shows even after the legal acceptance, bitcoin is preferred more as an investment than a payment system.",

El Salvador is a 3rd world country, and they don't have their own currency, they use USD, and during those years, they faced many difficulties. If continuing like this is also not the solution and they accepted the challenge with bitcoin, I think it's worth a try. Since El Salvador accepted bitcoin, their tourism industry has recovered strongly from the pandemic and is now developing very well, so it can be said that bitcoin has not brought them too much success, but there have been positive changes. We must wait and see what happens next instead of jumping to conclusions that they have failed.",

The president of El Salvador is a young geek who wanted to go in the history books as the biggest/greatest leaders the country ever had. He just fucked everyone in El Salvador lmfao by publicly admitting to be in BTC. Clearly doesn't know how the Crypto world works. Clearly an Elon Musk wannabe, and when Elon left, he was still in it hoping for the best because he's a president and he can't just back out of the BTC deal anymore. My man got jebaited. How long have you been in the market and how much experience do you have in this market that you jump to the conclusion that they will fail? I don't follow much of the country of El Salvador. But as a long-term investor, I know that to be successful with bitcoin, for bitcoin to be profitable for us, we need to hold it for a long time. El Salvador has only been accepting bitcoin for over a year, and in the past 1 year, they have also achieved some remarkable achievements, time is too short of saying whether they failed or succeeded.Mate are u from El Salvador? If u were, u would hate him too. I am just saying the president is a retard for buying so much BTC when the country is a 3rd world country. They don't need that much BTC, lmfao he's just gambling. He's a wannabe Elon Musk fan like I said.Even if he does not invest in bitcoin, he also will be hated by the people there simply because the country's economy is unstable and in trouble, the people will blame their government. But they need to know that what he's doing is finding solutions to revive the national economy, not make it worse. I wouldn't say he made the right decision to use bitcoin as the nation's reserve asset, but so far, he hasn't failed, so we need to observe more before drawing any conclusions.",
