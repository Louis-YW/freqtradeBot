One of them I quote here: https://www.blockchain.com/legal/termsQuote2.4 In order to use some of the Services, you will need to satisfy an onboarding process, along with our Compliance Program. For example, we may have to verify your identity or source of funds, or ask you for additional information. We may request personally identifiable information such as network address, name, email, address, telephone number, date of birth, taxpayer identification or social security number, official government-issued photo identification, and bank account information or other information we may reasonably deem helpful in satisfying our risk management or legal obligations. In providing this information to us, you represent that it is accurate and you agree to update your User Account and/or Wallet Account information promptly, but in no event later than 14 days following any change in your information.

Ideally I'd create a completely new wallet too and move my funds there (so my wallet seed is no longer linked to blockchain.com). And, if the funds are big, please consider buying a hardware wallet and sending them there.",

Do you want to withdraw your coins to the debit card or do you want to send and receive coins?Withdrawing coins to a debit card always required KYC except in p2p exchange.Quote from: Jason212 on August 02, 2022, 12:18:52 PMIn this case the Coins are offline and safe right?And when I lose the Device I only need the Seed with 24 Words?Thank You!Yes",

For all the time, I didn't have a need for the KYC procedure. Recently, I went to check my account (due to a warning from the service that support for my region is ending and I wanted to check the balance) and there were no problems with KYC. It is possible that this website selectively requests a KYC from its users. Not sure if that's the case. Just guesswork. In general, Iâm not interested anymore, because I donât see the need to use blockchain.com and after their announcement I will stop using their services for good. Although, in fact, this happened quite a long time ago. To solve your problem, may recommend contacting their support or going through a KYC (looks like it can't be done without it), withdrawing all your money from the platform and also stop using this site",
