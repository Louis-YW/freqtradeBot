What you say about our service not relevant much because you predicting bull run show's that you are more likely newbie. Based on call / put orders. I don't see \"bullrun\" but more likely to liqutatate long positions soon market will start going down when btc is on 45-46k One of the plans we might have is to set up our special TRON buyer seller method so our members can reap the benefits of the profits aswell when we sell TRON at the right time and buying it back right time.",

Of course, that bet of mine is going to lose 100% if I gamble but that sounds reassuring that if I gamble, I'd definitely going to lose money and first time to see that I've get a money back guarantee if I lose my bets. As if that I'll literally and assured that I'll lose money if I go on your platform and do it everyday. That doesn't sound fun at all. And where is your website? why there's an insurance? Seems that everything is interconnecting like what others said.You can lose maximum 70% of your 100% the entire single placed bet wich is the transaction you make on tron blockchain.It's been said you receive minimum 30% up to 1000% back in 24h + your wallet will start to receive TRON Rewards later on and you are free to place another bet to try to see your Luck you can have peace of mind with 30% insurance for each placed bet you make.You can use your received tron reward funds to try your luck again and again this way there is high probability to win.It doesn't sound right for me, honestly. I think that this type of business isn't really gambling at all. It's more of the twitter posts about \"send me this and I'll send you this back\".Quote from: CreatorofTronWinner on December 11, 2023, 01:28:05 PMBy the time you don't gamble anymore with your own funds but with our funds.While technically, it's no longer the losers fund and that now belongs to you. This scheme seems like, everyone is free to gamble with their own money and you'll just receive back a portion of it because of guaranteed lose. And that's why for me, this isn't really gambling at all. As yahoo and the others have pointed out, we've got the same understanding to your scheme man.",

Scheme indeed. Send me $10 i'll send you $3 back, sounds awesome. Pffft go scam somewhere else.I was reading comments not until I came across yours and just gave up on all they have to offer. Thank you so much @yahoo62278 because you broke all this shit to the lowest point for a lame man and I was also wondering how long one will keep sending you money and getting 30% to be able to win any actual money because I was actually wondering what one will be betting not until he still pointed out that we‚Äôll be betting on our own lucks and in cases when there is no win then it simply means that we don‚Äôt have any luck if I‚Äôm not wrong.",
