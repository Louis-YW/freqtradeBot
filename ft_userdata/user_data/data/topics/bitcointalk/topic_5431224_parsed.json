This is the problem that we face as investors, which is the overcrowding of the markets with listings of memes and shit coins on Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, which do not have use cases and real projects. Therefore, we find it difficult to choose the correct and promising currencies for investment, because anyone can list their currency on these platforms for free, and if he is an advisor, his listing request will be easier, so the Op service is not worth one cent, I hope that high fees are imposed by these platforms in the future for those who wish to include their currencies so that there is an obstacle for the scammers to promote their nonsense projects for free.",
