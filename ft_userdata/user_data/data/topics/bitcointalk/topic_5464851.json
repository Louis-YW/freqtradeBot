  "content": "Reading through the coin desk's newsletter today I came across news about Robin Hood and it's holding analysis. Apparently the HOOD company has reached Top #3 in the list of who holds the most Bitcoin in the world. Current stats: Binance : ~ $6.3 billion Bitfinex : ~ $4.3 billionHood     : ~ $ 3.0 billionThat's a lot of money under one roof of each entity mentioned above. It should make us think whether this is good or bad to Bitcoin economy? Since these much Bitcoin are under their custody they have full control of it and we have already seen what happens when such entities get hacked for their data leak. The case of FTX is the biggest lesson for us. However, having that much significant amount can also be good for bitcoin economy since it is in holding for long terms. It is like having that much less Bitcoin in the circulation. It may or may not have an effect on the demand and supply but I wanna ask, does it have any?QuoteRobinhood Revealed to be Third-Largest Bitcoin Holder With $3B in BTCRobinhood transferred some 118,300 bitcoin to the wallet from several other smaller wallets over a three-month period.Investing and trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) holds over $3 billion in bitcoin (BTC) in a single wallet that attracted the holdings over several months, wallet data from Arkham Intelligence shows. This makes it the third-largest bitcoin holder behind crypto exchanges Binance and Bitfinex, which hold $6.4 billion and $4.3 billion worth of tokens on single wallets respectively.The wallet previously gained notoriety among market watchers in the past few months as the identity of its owners sparked conversations and concerns about who the mysterious owner of such a large amount of bitcoin could be.As of Monday, Robinhood has not publically commented on these holdings.The transfers sparked speculations ranging from the bitcoin holdings belonging to financial behemoth BlackRock, which filed for a Bitcoin ETF earlier this year, to crypto exchange Gemini shifting its users’ holdings to a wallet.Robinhood transferred some 118,300 bitcoin to the wallet from several other smaller wallets over a three-month period, data shows. These tokens are custodied by crypto trading firm Jump Trading, Arkham representatives confirmed to CoinDesk in a Telegram message.All of these holdings are held on the Bitcoin blockchain. The first transactions were made on March 8, after which huge amounts of bitcoin were transferred until July 14, data from BitInfoCharts show.Meanwhile, the holdings shed light on the extent of Robinhood’s bitcoin exposure despite low crypto trading volumes on its platform.Source: Robinhood Revealed to be Third-Largest Bitcoin Holder With $3B in BTC",

Even the government can step in and cease their holdings if any time the government wants to disrupt the crypto market. Really concerning!",

I think you are mistaken as FTX was not hacked or anything else instead it was bankrupted due to less liquidity or some other types of scams. And it does not really mean that these amounts are not in circulation because these amounts are in the liquidity pools from which traders are making there trades. I hope you do understand that the assets they have are in circulation and not in there holdings. But you can say that, the inflow and outflow almost remain equilibrium.And to be honest if we look at the bad side then the impact will be a lot more than the FTX but still market is open for everyone and any exchange or any entity if have the potential to buy a lot of BTC then no one could actually stop them. But still there are pros and cons to everything but con here is for temporary time so chill and observe them.",

But indeed, it would be wrong to generalize. We tend to relate FTX's issue with the likes but given that the two platforms have different management, then things would be different. Also, whether they choose to sell that huge amount of Bitcoin or not, we would be left with no other choice but to just ride the wave and hope for a fast recovery with the market price. For now, I would just be glad that huge investors are still into this technology 'coz worrying won't solve any problem. Let's just hope as well that more businesses would consider using this blockchain, for this industry's betterment in the future.",

Just as expected on which on the time that these big players/institutions/companies/government would be able to realize that holding Bitcoin would be worth then they would be no doubt on using up their financialcapability to take over or the advantage in the entire market which it isnt really that a shocking move or actions that they are doing.It might seems that they dont care but they are actually accumulating in silent.Sooner or later if these big companies and institutions would be starting on accumulation because it do really symbolizes that having more would be having that greater power and dominance then for sure it would be making out that huge impact when they do start on trying to hype on everything specially if they do decide with those Bitcoin ETF's approval.Therefore, for us shrimps or retail traders or investors then its better to go with the flow and accumulate while they are really that still accumulating because anytime soon those positive bullish newswould just come out unexpectedly which it is really that a casual buy high sell low with these companies or simply entities.",
