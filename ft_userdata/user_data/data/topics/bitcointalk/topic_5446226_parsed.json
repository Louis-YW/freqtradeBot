Tokenomics are great with a circulating supply of 25 million and total supply of only 31 million its not far off Bitcoin in terms of how scarce it is. It is not a project I hear too much about and only stumbled upon it a few days ago. Just wondering if there is much interest on this forum and for those who know a thing or two about it what can we expect next bull run? $1000 seems to be the average prediction which would give us a 24x return.",

I don't share your enthusiasm about the project, the project might pump in the future but to me, it has turned into another pump-and-dump token, the team rebranded after the hack and created another token also added more to the team's quota. The project is not gaining adoption, almost no one is using the platform, and the most successful Game moved to Avax. I think the project needs to deliver first before talking about price action. Yesterday's price is not today's price",

That's not going to happen.$1000 is not my prediction just an amount I have seen mentioned a few times, I am aware that is a lot to ask. I am not going to go to heavy with this altcoin - will DCA until I have 25 and hope it does a 10x or something which is not impossible.",

That's not going to happen. i don't know how people are also expecting that a lot from this type of project. the likelihood of going down is more plausible to happen rather than going up to 24x. maybe 1/24 x, that's gonna happen here. most projects are on the downhill side rather than on the uphill side. it is not being pessimistic here but the reality of what will happen to most coins and tokens. even rock solid projects can easily go down depending on the dev team themselves.",

Maybe in the futureIt started last 2 years and it seems like they are really serious about it because most of the other big companies also joins this huge innovation which will be heading towards it in the next few years to come. Most of the time they talk about this a lot and they are not joking about their enthusiasm and wanted to adopt it in their companies.I also see a metaverse where they will create a whole city for the sake of tourism and even if you can't go there, you will have some idea about the place and they will gonna make it more realistic so that the tourist will enjoy their visits next time they visit Dubai for real.",

It’s just that many projects appear that, on the wave of this hype, are trying to provide some kind of good projects, but basically this does not lead anywhere, but is shown at such a level as if everything is already ready. But in fact, this is just an ordinary trailer created to be shown on social networks. But the idea is really good and whoever gets it, it will be a great breakthrough.",
