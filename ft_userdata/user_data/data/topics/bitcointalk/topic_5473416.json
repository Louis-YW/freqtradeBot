I am not sure I am understanding you correctly. Are you saying you are not connected to the internet? You need internet connection, so that you can get your transaction history from a server. If you are using electrum as a cold storage, the wallet which contains your secrets should be on a device which is disconcerted from the internet, but your watch-only wallet should be created on an online device.",

Any of your addresses can be used to receive fund forever. What expires is the request. Let's say you want to sell something to somebody and tell him you will accept the transaction only if the person sends you the fund before a certain time. You set the expiry time to know that whether the sender has sent the fund before the deadline or not. This doesn't mean you won't receive the fund after the expiry time. Also note that you don't have to make a request at all. You can go to \"Addresses\" tab and use any of addresses listed there to receive fund.",

On Electrum? Do you mean a deposit address on Binance or the opposite? Bitcoin addresses don't actually expire; they cease to exist. From my understanding, the transaction will go through just fine. Even though the address is not available to you anymore, that doesn't mean that the generated address suddenly disappears from the network. As the previous poster already mentioned, as we were writing this reply simultaneously, the request is what expires.",

This information is seen by the recipient if you send them a signed payment request.For on-chain requests, the address gets reserved until expiration. After that, it might get reused. The bitcoin address never expires and will always be part of this electrum wallet. You can reuse a bitcoin address any number of times but it is not good for your privacy.For Lightning requests, payments will not be accepted after the expiration.The address displayed when you make a request is one of the addresses from the list of bitcoin addresses on your Electrum. Of course you can use it multiple times if you want - but if you want better privacy, then use different addresses.",

Do you mean a deposit address on Binance or the opposite? You are right that addresses don't expire, but when you want to generate a new address in Electrum using the 'receive' tab, there is an expiry notice that displays 10 minutes, 1 hour, 1 day and 1 week, and this can confuse newbies a lot because they would think that it is the address they are generating that would expire after any of this time duration selected. Op should take note that you don't even have to enter any payment request info when generating a new address, just click on 'create request' and you get your address, which never expires.",
