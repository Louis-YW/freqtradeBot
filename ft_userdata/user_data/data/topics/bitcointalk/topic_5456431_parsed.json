  "content": "Hello all,I have asked myself the same question over and over again and as a experienced person, i couldn't find an convenient answer to the theory problem that i found, so here i am sharing you guys what the weird theory that from my point of view could be that we in fact could have broken 160 bits AND any other bigger security bits without us even noticing it.Now let's start with my theory. (I'll use Bitcoin 160 bit address as an example).Bitcoin Addresses are known to have 160 Bits. Since we know that an Bitcoin Address could be generated from any 160 bits, we can then be 100% sure that we will be able to successfully generate an valid 160 bits Bitcoin address from the first try to by just inputting any 160 bits. So for me to get an Random Bitcoin address from the total 1461501637330902918203684832716283019655932542975 different possible Bitcoin addresses by inputting random 160 bits is exactly 1 in 2^160. Here I am trying to generate one random Bitcoin address by inputting an 160 randomly generated bits.Code:GenerateKey: = E9A3EAA622BBDC094205C2D03395C9FFCA41EB0C Here i have generated randomly an 160 Bits PrivateKey.Code:ConvertToHash160ANDAddress: 4E6A51BF4C909515A8B9151C258068906482026D + [b]189d5ADsBrQ9mvgraapVs9iF2eyHoQcywg[/b] We have now got our final desired address.Now the weird theorie problem that blew my mind: Does this mean that i just generated an Bitcoin address 189d5ADsBrQ9mvgraapVs9iF2eyHoQcywg that the chances were for me generating it was 1 in 2^160? If yes, theoretically speaken, everytime we generate an random Bitcoin address, we actually break the law and generate an address that is ultra rare to find and not infeasible for any humans to genereate it back again because it take an infinite amount of years.Now if i were to generate the same address 189d5ADsBrQ9mvgraapVs9iF2eyHoQcywg that i previously just generated by 1 in 2^160, i would still have the same chances as before, namely: 1 in 2^160. But the differeneces that it would take this time zillion of zillion of years before i can generate the same address, that i previously found, by just 1 try. So how is this possible?My theory says, everytime we generate an Bitcoin address, or an privatekey, or an long Random Hash, we actually break the security for its bits for ONLY once, but never will be repeated again for same address/privatekey/Hash.What are your thoughts on this guys?",

I generated the address randomly, so i can't have the control for the whole 2^160 range to pick from. Its like when you hash something, you get completely random value. So According to my calculation it's still 1 in 2^160.EDIT: You are right, my address generator was bugged, i have corrected the address now.",

It is impossible to generate a specific address, because the odds of that is 1 in 2160. But if we are considering the odds of generating any address, then well, there are 2160 to choose from! So your odds are 2160 in 2160, i.e. 1.",

In fact, it is very possible; guaranteed even, to quickly generate a valid Bitcoin private key and address.Have a look at the algorithms:Quote from: https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/keys_addressesAnd there we have a private key… just a big random number (in hexadecimal format).It is trivial to generate a random 256-bit number on a modern PC.What is indeed not trivial, almost impossible even, is 'generating' (sampling) a specific private key (e.g. one that spends coins sent to a specific address).",

TLDR; using probability theory, OP thought that with 50% chance of generating a 0 or 1 bit, he inadvertently generated all (1/2)^160 combinations when doing this 160 times (which is not true, not even from a mathematical standpoint, because the probabilities are independent from each other, which means only one of those addresses was actually the subject of the probability and not all 2^160 of them).",

But reading your posts, i think some people still didn't understand my point that i want to let you know about it.The point that I'm surprised by the fact, that when i generate a random  key, out of the all possible large keys that exist let's say 2^256, i get 1 in 2^256 chance to get a specific unknown one private key from that big range.  * I know that i am guaranteed to land on a key but that fact that the chances were for me to land on that specific key that i previously got were supposed to be 1 in 2^256 *. Many assume that i have the full 2^256 chances (since i can pick whatever the private key is) but i have to disagree with this. If every time i randomly generate a key the chances are always 1 in 2^256 for each time to land one on a key out of those many keys.So imagine this was a existing private key! The point of my post is not to scare and say that private keys are not secure anymore No! but to say that theoretically its not fully impossible to generate a key that did indeed existed.",

How many times do you need to pick one key until you land on that one? You already know the answer, generate 2^256 keys one by one.You need to sleep a bit more and think about the math a little more,  this is not good for your mind to insist on something which is not important at all, go back grinding for a puzzle key.😂",

For every possible 16 digit credit card number, there are approximately 10 trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion possible bitcoin private keys.",

All private keys already \"exist\". The question is whether or not a key is in use. 2. Everyone here knows that a collision is not \"impossible\". The reason that people say that a collision is \"impossible\" is that it is so \"improbable\" that it is indistinguishable from \"impossible\", so the word \"impossible\" is a good choice for practical reasons.I'm sure you already know all this, but I'm just clarifying.",
