  "content": "Greed is never a good idea because it can ruin all your profits when you are having more of Loss. To underline why we should avoid greed, here is a short story from ancient Greek writer Aesop: QuoteThere was once a Countryman who possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine, for every day when he visited the nest, the Goose had laid a beautiful, glittering, golden egg.The Countryman took the eggs to market and soon began to get rich. But it was not long before he grew impatient with the Goose because she gave him only a single golden egg a day. He was not getting rich fast enough.Then one day, after he had finished counting his money, the idea came to him that he could get all the golden eggs at once by killing the Goose and cutting it open. But when the deed was done, not a single golden egg did he find, and his precious Goose was dead.It is a very simple story but it is also true for crypto: don't get greedy because it could result in a big loss, where all your profits are gone and you end up at a big loss, no chance to recover it. Do a detailed research, avoid risky Altcoins and keep your coins safe. Be happy from what your profits are at and don't get greedy because it is always a good idea to avoid risk. Don't murder your goose = HODL your Coins.",

That said, the story can be interpreted in a different way: don't be too greedy, sell your coins when you're in profit because most investors usually lose. Be in profit, even if it's just 10%. Don't hope for 200% as you may never get it.Being a hodler myself, I prefer your way of seeing things, OP. I'm not going to give my bitcoin away for a fraction of its ATH price. The lower it goes below the ATH the more stubborn I'll be. If they want my bitcoins they'll have to offer an arm and a leg",

Every person who is greedy will go that part eventually. If we compare the price of bitcoin last two months to what it is today, we can see it has added 3k, that is from 17k to 20k. Being patient is what a hodler needs and halving is yet coming, I think we may see high volatility this time with the rate of price increase.",

Relating this to cryptocurrency investment is way two closely related factors that have really affected most cryptocurrency investors. One needs to be loyal to any coin that has proven to yield profits and we should make up our minds about what we want if we are holding for long-term or just short-term investors. Being short-term is to be highly calculating to know when to take profits and how to deal with risk and avoid greed.",

There is the lesson about greed, but I can also identify the meaning that we should not be impulsive and too quick with actions, we should always take second moments to rethink actions to be taken and if possible, get opinions on it before acting to avoid as much as possible the possibility of making bad and wrong decisions that you will get to regret. Just as we get good ideas in a moment, so also do bad ideas that you should not try come to you. Making impulsive decisions with your investment, increases the chances of loss.",

In crypto, we should think that investing is good for a long-term process not only for short-term purposes. Â I believed investing in altcoins or those coins that under the pump and dump is being greedy which someday will put your fund at high risk and it could be lost without knowing you.",

Selling Bitcoin is not an equivalent of killing a goose that lays golden eggs. You can use the profits to buy Bitcoin later at a lower price. Quote from: Phu Juck on January 15, 2023, 03:57:26 PMGreed is never a good idea because it can ruin all your profits when you are having more of Loss. Greed is what also makes people miss out on selling at a profit when the price is high, and then regret it when the price crashes.",

If you hold 1 bitcoin after six months the amount is same 1 bitcoin. While in the story the goose lays golden eggs regularly/daily. Which farmer can sell and make profit. Nice try By the way.Quote from: Phu Juck on January 15, 2023, 03:57:26 PMDon't murder your goose = HODL your Coins. Are you sure about the \"=\"?

To underline why we should avoid greed, here is a short story from ancient Greek writer Aesop: Not all perspectives can be combined with the stories you share, this story is closer to the parable of the fairy tales that I often tell children before they go to bed. Don't worry, this is just an analogy and the story doesn't make any sense because the goose lays golden eggs.And it's true that greed is another part that can destroy a person, but I think it's also good when greed is used to buy bitcoins. Isn't this the goal many people want, to collect as many bitcoins as possible and store them long term before ATH arrives.QuoteIt is a very simple story but it is also true for crypto: don't get greedy because it could result in a big loss, where all your profits are gone and you end up at a big loss, no chance to recover it.

Don't murder your goose = HODL your Coins. Your second point is also a little confusing, you are trying to give an idea of avoiding risk, while in the last paragraph you mention \"HODL Your Coin\".This idea is far worse than killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. Because when mentioning coins, it means that there are no special restrictions and are still quite common, while currently only bitcoin is able to maintain investment value in the long term.The Right one in my opinion, Buy and HODL Bitcoin",
