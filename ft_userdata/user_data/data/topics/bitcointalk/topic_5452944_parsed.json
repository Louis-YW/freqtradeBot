  "content": "Just dropping a bit of info to help you guys from making a dumb mistake like I did.  :/  I bought around 200 bucks worth of some memecoin which turned out to be what they call a honey pot...  Meaning you could buy it but you're not able to sell it.  Lolol.This info is mostly for Ethereum users but pretty sure other L1 users would find it useful.Anyway here are the ways to avoid making the same mistake...1.  Find out more about the project's token in https://honeypot.is/It basically checks if the token is a honey pot.2.  Check if the liquidity is locked.  PEPE got as big as it got because traders tend to trust a token if its liquidity is locked.The easiest way to do this is by going to the token's page at https://www.dextools.io/ and look at the token's label called  'Total liquidity'.  If it doesn't have a green lock then it isn't locked.  Stay away.3.  Go to the token's page in https://dexscreener.com/ and look at the buys and the sells.  If it's mostly just buys with just a couple of sells, that's most likely a honey pot.4.  Go look at the token's holders tab at https://etherscan.io/The more concentrated most of the supply is to just a few holders, the more likely it's gonna be dumped.5.  Another important thing is to check in https://etherscan.io/ is if the contract is verified.  In the token's contract page there's a tab called contract.  If it has a green check then it's verified.Stay safe out there.If you guys have more to add, feel free to post them itt.  Thanks.Edit:  Typos.",

It's an additional work just to buy a \"lottery ticket\" but it's never wrong to educate yourself and take those extra measures. There's a higher chance to \"win\" if you know you won't get rug pulled or dumped on by fraudulent devs after all hehe.",

I mostly check token holders and how much spread out it actually is just to avoid some sudden manipulation dump.Outside of numbers it's pretty natural to read the tokens whitepaper just to see what they're doing and what they're planning to do in the future. Can be quite convoluted at times but hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.",

That's the same reason why OP had carelessly put his 200 to such memecoin without having to go through all the process he have enumerated to secure yourself from falling into a meme scam. What we have to avoid here mostly is to become a honey pot victim so I guess checking out all OP's instructions could really help. But I'd rather be more cautious if I don't see anything sold and majority is buy orders.",

      "body": "This is good information and dex tools are just awesome. They are coming real handy I guess when checking projects status. This strategy is far better than the paid services where they claim they asses the project validity and check for you whether you should invest in that particular coin/token or not? The dex tools can give a clear idea of its liquidity, daily traded volume, ongoing orders and it's volume. Everything contributes to shaping the clear picture of that particular project. I am not sure if this strategy or dex tool is only applicable to the memecoin alone but it should be updated with the other projects' information as well. Since it is a decentralized tool, it might be synched with all the chain projects other than meme coins.",

It might be easier to know if there is such a token. If this is a typo and you might wants to write 10%, i think this 10% is a reasonable tax and many project using this. The tax allocation varies, some are returned to all holders, some are burned, etc. To be sure, most of the meme tokens that turn as a scam, mostly is non-saleable or smartcontract created to disable outgoing transactions and rug.Regarding ATH, if ATH achievement is already very high, and the recent drop more than 90% and current market position with low trading volume at AMM and cex, chances this token will be abandoned very high.",
