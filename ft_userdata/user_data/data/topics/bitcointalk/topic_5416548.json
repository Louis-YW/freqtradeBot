They are indeed starting toe become too hard on cryptocurrency. The United States of America is not an ordinary country, they have reasons why they are doing these sanctions/regulations on cryptocurrencies.The more people are hopping on cryptocurrency, the more volume pouring into the cryptocurrency market, and the more they will become strict or hard. If you take a look on early days, it seems most government ignore cryptocurrencies.",

But considering the situation nowadays with the US regarding crypto, miners and holders should have their own plan B in case more regulations are coming in the future. They should know that they can no longer be safe against huge amounts of taxes once these regulations are passed.",

There's no reason to call US being too hard on crypto. Remember even some regulators in US have been issuing approval for some crypto products.

And I think the US is too hard on crypto because they are too strict on regulations and trying to control crypto. But maybe my guess is wrong because I don't know what the US government really wants.But even if the regulations in the US are stricter than in other countries, it won't hinder the movement of crypto because crypto doesn't belong to the US. It belongs to everyone who wants it. So there will be countries that will allow and accept crypto and allow their citizens to use crypto.",

I believe they are restricting a lot of things on crypto when in fact US is the worst when it comes to crypto handling. I believe crypto is way better before than now. A lots of news or even frameworks created to govern crypto unlike before they are just ignoring it and even dont care about it. Thats where you can see how they are so eager to have some cut of the growing marketcap of every projects.",

US is too hard on everything, globally! Whenever they see an oil-rich country, they send military there to save that country from their own administration like what happened in Iraq Or Syria. The same is happening with crypto. As charity begins at home, they are first targetting their home users and then they will launch a global attack on crypto companies doing business with US citizens and then the countries with most mining operations. Please note - the above post is imaginary and any resemblance with the reality is a pure coincidence.",

US has never banned crypto so I don't think they are the harshest by any means. They aren't even really against it they just want theor money.  Like a good mob as long as you pay you can play.  The reason they fear crypto because they don't know yet how to tax it.  When they iron that out it will be smooth sailing.",

Until then, expect a heavy hand against the revolution from the world's biggest superpower. You can't expect the government to ignore something that's been rising in popularity at a very fast pace. At least, the US hasn't banned crypto from mainstream use. Other countries like China and Russia don't want to welcome crypto with open arms because that would mean losing power over their own people.It's only been 13 years since Bitcoin's inception, but there's still a long road ahead before the crypto/Blockchain industry becomes fully adopted by everyone worldwide. Regulations are just the tip of the iceberg. After crypto is \"properly\" regulated, all that's left is for institutional investors and VCs to join the game for things to start kicking. As long as the government doesn't go too far, there should be nothing to worry about. Just my thoughts",

I believe the regulations will not stop until they feel satisfied.There's nothing we can do other wait and see what happens regarding governments' stance towards crypto. As you've said before, regulations are inevitable. You can't expect something popular to slip under the radar of the government. The US knows how successful crypto has been since day one, so it's trying to \"legitimize\" it by regulating it as much as possible. This is good in the sense that it reduces the level of criminal activities in the industry, but it's bad because people will be forced to submit their ID to be able to participate in it.Of course, there are decentralized exchanges and other means which you can access crypto without KYC. But it's something not everyone is willing to do due to its high level of difficulty. Giving out your personally-identifiable information to centralized exchanges is a much easier way to get access to the world of crypto/Blockchain tech with Fiat (in this case, the US Dollar). The US is just beginning to regulate crypto seriously, so let's give it some time to determine whenever it's being too hard on this emerging industry or all the other way around. Other countries like China and Russia are faring worse that the US, so I guess current regulations aren't so bad after all. Just my opinion",
