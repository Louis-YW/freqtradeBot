  "content": "Selling this beautiful loaded set by Crypto Imperator: A silver SuperDoge (100,000 Doge), and a Limited Edition (10,000 Doge). Both coins are numbered #016.SuperDoge â€” the most stunning silver coin I've owned, and arguably one of CI's best. It graded high at MS-68, and is loaded with 100,000 Doge. It is visually perfect with no milk spotting, etc. 25 of these numbered coins were produced. I haven't seen one of these hit the market in a very long time. 12 remain unpeeled (as of this post). Reference by Elias: https://www.cryptonumist.com/coin/crypto-imperator-100000-doge-silver-edition-superdogeThe second graded MS-67 and is loaded with 10,000 Doge. CI did a run of two -- a numbered set, and unnumbered. This is from the limited numbered set of 100. Reference by Elias: https://www.cryptonumist.com/coin/crypto-imperator-10000-doge-limited-editionTotal loaded value in BTC at the current price of Doge: 0.70 BTCAsking 2 BTC or best offer. PM serious inquiries only. Additional photos available upon request",
