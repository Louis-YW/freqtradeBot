  "content": "December 12, 2010 06: 22: 33:00 It seems like just yesterday #Satoshinakamoto posted his last message. Although much time has passed,  his genius impact on the world are still evident. Satoshi is a true genius of our time. His invention, #Bitcoin BTC, is not just a cryptocurrency; it's a revolution in thinking and approach to money. In an era dominated by control and regulation, Bitcoin offers an alternative - a world where people, not governments, have control over money. Satoshi's contribution to decentralization and his fight against the financial dictatorship of governments is more than just a technological marvel. It's a movement for financial freedom and sovereignty. His work paved the way for reducing total government control over money, a step toward greater freedom for people around the world. What's most intriguing is that Satoshi chose the path of anonymity, not just for mystique but also for his safety. In a time when many seek fame and recognition, Satoshi chose to stay in the shadows to protect himself and his work. His disappearance is not just an act of self-preservation but also a reminder that not everything in life revolves around personal fame. post link  source",

His disappearance is not just an act of self-preservation but also a reminder that not everything in life revolves around personal fame. No one can say why Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared in 2010, no Goodbye, no thing, just disappeared after one day.It could be a planned disappearance, abandonment but it could be an accident that was not in any plan of Satoshi Nakamoto. I still believe that it is his plan but there is no evidence to prove it is right or wrong.Five months later, Gavin will visit the CIA. If Satoshi Nakamoto did not disappear, will he visit the CIA, not Gavin Andresen?",

It is a shame that Bitcoin is more associated with nefarious transactions instead of scientific innovation.

I think if he's still around he'd also praise the entire community because he'd probable say that he can't do this alone without the help of the community that has trusted his vision and the Bitcoin project that he has started with. It all takes a bold step of initiative and movement to take into decentralization to this level. While many are still talking about belittling about this piece of code of money to them, see how far it goes and it's unbelievable. The true meaning of potential has manifested on Bitcoin and we're not even yet on the peak of it.",

So, you are one of those who still think Satoshi is alive and still waiting for the right time to enter into this era again, I hope he will be alive, but it does not matter now either his existence matters for the regulatory authorities, because Blockchain is now out of his (Satoshi) hands as everything is public and managed by the public also, then why would Satoshi still prefer anonymity while many other fake Satoshi came into being declaring themselves Satoshi while they are not.If theymos can remain hidden then why satoshi can't, I think he is dead! maybe I am wrong or right, but that's what I assume.",

I will no longer make an attempt to save lives, and I am sorry that I have ever tried to save lives.But I am willing (for a substantial fee) to apply some of the machine learning techniques that I have developed to all of Satoshi's writings so that I can try to figure out who this Satoshi character is.Perhaps cryptocurrencies should all implement a system where if coins are not moved for a long time then those coins must pay a certain fee to the miners so that the coins exponentially decay in value. This will make it harder for someone who has a whole bunch of coins but who has been silent for the longest time to suddenly appear and disrupt the market. Or maybe that will make it harder for users to use cryptocurrency technologies. -Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",
