Users cant enable withdrawals. The platform does not have access to funds. Trades placed through API key and you can view it on your Binance account as well.",

The advantage of it being installed on my PC is that I can have restrictions on the IP using my API key. I don't want anybody to access my trading positions with my API.What are your other strategies there as well?Thanks a lot for such a good question. I fully understand your concerns. Here is a technical answer from the developer:Installing software on your PC at home and whitelisting the IP, is only as secure as your home network. Those, mind you, are being breached orders of magnitude more often than cloud servers networks. So, the real question is how many and how strong \"barriers\" are between your API Key/Secret and potential party with bad intentions.In Cleo there is probably nothing we take more seriously than security and that’s why try to keep up with the best industry standards. Without going too much into details, few security barriers we use include:Main servers manipulating with sensitive data, are exposed only to internal network, and are not visible to outside world at allYour api key/secret is not stored in single database, but is stored in 3 different places, each with separate hardware and software security protectionsYou would have to breach all 3 to get access to Encrypted version of api key/secret - which doesn't help you at allThose sensitive data are encrypted with arguably most modern and secure protocol - 256-bit AES GCM encryption (feel free to google details, or read this specification/analysis document  https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/168.pdf )Long story short the data from database alone, encrypted with 256-bit AES GCM encryption would take 2.29*10^32 years to decrypt with current technology, which is way longer than age of our universe Our cloud hardware is distributed and software up to date with most recent security updatesWe also use more security systems to protect our users' data, but we would like to keep those privateAlso its important to know, that we don’t allow keys, that have withdrawals enabled, so there is no incentive for bad actors to even try to get hold of those data.So in the end it would be most likely easier for somebody to hack your PC than get even all encrypted data for your api key/secret from our server, even if you would teleport right next to our physical server",

With cleo.finance, traders can trade crypto futures with advanced risk controls, order management, and algorithmic executions. We need it to be tested and gather feedback from traders. There will be remuneration based on traded volume on the platform. I have a few questions. Why does a trader even need an intermediary in the form of your platform that offers futures trading? And what is this strange condition for the mandatory creation of take profit and stop loss?You offer to connect your account from the exchange and trade through your platform, only this complicates the very process of trading with extra obligations. If I want to trade futures, I will do it directly on the exchange without any mandatory orders. What is the purpose of this application?Intermediary:The goal is to add value on top of what centralized exchange (Binance for now, we will add other exchanges soon) natively offers. If you don't see added benefit in automatizing your trading process via \"if this than that\" statements, or advanced risk management options in form of multiple concurring Stop Loss or Take Profit orders, or the ability to replay every position to learn from your mistakes, or any other feature that the platform brings (or will bring in the future), than there is no reason for you to use it.But let's not kid ourselves - exchange does not have inherent desire to help you be profitable in any way. The majority of futures traders lose money, precisely because they don't have any risk management tools, that would help them understand what risk they are getting into before they place the trade. And this is just a first kick off - loop trading is in the works, backtesting and paper trading is in the works, social trading where you can get copied or copy others is in the works, trailing stop loss is in the works, stop loss and take profit placed as a multiple of ATR is in the works and much much more. We aim to grow into ultimate trading tool. You just have to start somewhere, no?Mandatory SL and TPNot desired long term, it is sort of an inefficiency of the current \"position\" model design. We are removing this condition as we speak, allowing you to add or modify any protection as optional either before the entry or during the open position.",

The fact that a trader will install your platform and start trading futures with it does not mean at all that he will now have less problems with money management and risk. The problems will remain and will recur until he identifies these vulnerabilities in his trading strategy and eliminates them.It's like improving the quality of your driving skills in a car with the help of some applications and specialized programs. Until a person himself develops the necessary reactions and a sense of his own car, nothing will help.Quote from: Ratimov on May 19, 2022, 06:54:03 PM\"The problems will remain and will recur until he identifies these vulnerabilities in his trading strategy and eliminates them\" I never said that all traders using our trading platform will magically be profitable and disciplined. But they do have more tools in their arsenal to identify their weaknesses and easily apply some measures.If the problems remain until you fix them, why wouldn't you want to use every tool available to fix them faster? Cleo doesn't aim to be THE solution, the ultimate financial hack the rich people don't want you to know about  We aim to be a tool that makes trading easier and gets you to the finish line (reliable profitability) faster.\"..nothing will help\"\"Unless you figure out on your own how to trade well you have no chance\". How is this attitude useful to the newcomers? There are hundreds of thousands of new retail traders every year and the vast majority blows up their account and never trades again. Seems like they could use any help they can get. Plus - using your car driving analogy - technology is actually helping modern drivers all the time. Parking sensors, cameras, and angle tracking, there are even self-driving cars these days… Technology is making your life easier. Why wouldn't we want to try to innovate the trading space?",
