First of all, I don't have enough bitcoins but if the price crosses $1 million per BTC then my BTC can make me around 350k dollars, which is a huge amount of money, that I can use to start many types of businesses at the local level, or I might start the business of flipping website, where we need huge investment or I might start a business of clothes at a bigger level. I can do whatever I want to, but of course, I am not a money waster, well at least that's what I try to do. I will use the funds to invest further, maybe in new stocks, maybe in FBA or FBM (AMAZON), or maybe use those funds for trading purposes. That amount can make me rich, but I should be wise enough to use these funds in a manner that would really have a good impact on my life, otherwise, many people have achieved nothing even with that amount of money.",

It will not affect my life to much extent but it will definitely make me happy and financially stable without any question. The current value of Bitcoin is over $30k and it will take enough time for Bitcoin to reach $1 million price tag. I'm surely a supporter of Bitcoin and most of us at this forum are somehow related to Bitcoin and want Bitcoin to get higher in value if they have enough holdings. Many people will be financially stable if Bitcoin reaches $1 million in value as they all are hoping to have better returns from their investment and they all want to be financially stable in their lives. I'll personally purchase many good things for myself and I will most probably purchase a house for my family if Bitcoin reaches $1 million in value.",

By the time 1BTC sells for $1 mln., inflation will accelerate so much that $1 mln. can only buy a cup of coffee.  That is, of course, the effect on life will be noticeable, but I don’t think that it will be so significant for you.But if you think about it seriously, with the price of a bitcoin at $1 mln., the significance of $1 mln. is much lower than it is now. If you look at films from 20-30 years ago, everyone in them hunted for $1 mln.. It was that elusive MacGuffin, the main goal for the characters in the films. Nowadays, no one will be surprised by $1 mln. At least in the movies.I want to say that you overestimate the possibility of the influence of a bitcoin at a price of $1 mln. on your life, and also, this moment will not come soon.You assess the influence of the bitcoin on life from the position of a speculative moment, while the significance of the bitcoin as electronic digital money, decentralized and possessing unique technical capabilities is incomparably more important and impressive. For this parameter, the current or future price rate has absolutely no meaning. But the impact on life is simply unimaginable.",

Let's pretend that it's possible, will you still hold your Bitcoin seeing the price pumping that much? Assuming you invested only $4000 in Bitcoin and your money turned to $80,000, you will never believe that it's going to 1 million unless you are stupid. Last bull market many people are chasing $150,000 per Bitcoin, it never happened and they ride the bear market again, trapped and angry, when your ROI is too good you won't care about the Top-Top, you are here to make good gains, not to be a greedy fellow.",

With how high the percentage of the circulating supply is already, the halving will start having less and less effect on the market and the price will peak around a certain range and adjust downwards to accommodate the lose of price speculators. At this time I expect the use case to have significantly changed and for us to have a much higher level of adoption.",

Some might diversify their funds to other assets which I think I would do as well just to secure the ‘life’ I would be getting. If ever the market value of Bitcoin will be this much, it does not guarantee  consistency and with that, the price could fall in an instant so the best way I guess is to secure the profit and wait for its bottom to again re-invest. Properties would be prioritized on my end ‘coz it has a higher tendency for a continuous price increase as years would go by.

To begin with, it means I'll have a million dollars of fiats to spend but that's not what we want for Bitcoin, the  profits are great but what about the adoption. If I can't use my Bitcoin as I use fiats then there's no excitement in Bitcoin reaching $1 million as I'll still have to sell my Bitcoin for fiats whenever I need to buy something or pay for a service that I use.The goal should be 1 Bitcoin been recognized as 1 Bitcoin and not 1 Bitcoin getting to a specific price in dollars. I'll give up one Bitcoin getting to $1 million for Bitcoin been recognized globally as a currency and not what's happening with the attention been shifted from a currency to a speculative asset. After Bitcoin gets to $1 million and you sell your Bitcoin for fiats, what's next as you don't have any Bitcoin left but if Bitcoin gets the recognition it deserves, you won't have to sell your Bitcoin or be scared of a decline in price as then the fiat value won't matter anymore.
