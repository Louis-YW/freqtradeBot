Sure, the supply still shrinks and shrinks slowly, but as time goes bitcoin goes up in value as well. People will be incentivized to not lose them; not like back then when bitcoin was merely a few cents so people didn't care much about their private key backups.",

This makes me sad.Why though? It is not like people must spend 1 BTC to make one transaction. I would not be surprised if 100 sat is worth $100 or something in the future if Bitcoin continues to be valuable. While it can happen, I doubt the BTC price will continue to increase that 10 sat or so is no longer affordable for small payments/transactions. Even if it does happen, we'll probably see many layer-2 solutions or something similar at that point in time.Quote from: DapanasFruit on June 24, 2023, 02:02:23 AM So maybe we can propose like creating a new cryptocurrency or a token corresponding to the number of BTC presumed to have been lost alreadyThat's basically creating an altcoin IMO.",

Today there are many more security measures, more knowledge, and people consider them much more valuable than they did then. They will always continue to be lost, but in percentage terms much less.",

As time went up and bitcoin gained more value people also became more careful hence the number of cases where people lose their keys diminished significantly.So you can't say it gets \"lost all the time\".Quotecurrently it is thought 3-4 million bitcoins are already lost.Wrong. Nobody knows how many bitcoins were actually lost. This is just an estimation you posted.QuoteIf an address did not have any activity in let's say the last 100 yearsThere are two problems with this:1. Not having any activity is not the same as being lost. For example there are people who have coins from 2009 that they haven't touched but they still own the private key.2.

This makes me sad.I propose a redistribution method:>If an address did not have any activity in let's say the last 100 years the address is considered lost and the bitcoins are free to be mined in the next block.I think that is a horrendous idea. Without a clear definition of the coin that is being lost and a proven method of counting lost coins, coin recirculation would be prone to a bigger problem.Besides, for the sake of keeping the roughly 21 million bitcoins intact, I think that is a lame reason that has no urgency. There are intended coins burned by OP_RETURN. So that won't happen. If we truly want to address the legitimate users who forgot, missing, corrupt private keys, or has any other genuine cause. That might be the sensible motive.

With blocks currently netting around $200,000 in total block reward, a reward of $5 million per block will be more than enough for every miner on the network to constantly attempt to reorg the chain many blocks deep for their own benefit.
