The analysts who are bearish on crypto right now, are also bearish on the macroeconomic market.\"FIAT was built to retain its valueCrypto has been rebuilt to be abused and inflate\"",

I personally haven't encountered even one view that has this analysis. Who are these so called financial analysts who foresee Bitcoin falling too far down at $1,100? My guess is that they are either Bitcoin critics who have always been perma-bears and who wished that Bitcoin turns to zero or they are traditional financial analysts who know nothing about Bitcoin.",

And just like you and me, you can make you own and wild educate guess. There's no question that the world is in recession that's why all market has been affected.But as far as bitcoin market goes, we are in a bearish market, meaning the price will really have to go down very hard. So we have the wait for the halving in 2024 to see how much bitcoin will recover. It could be in the 6 digits price range.",

There are always two sides on trading which is the bulls and bears but the price direction always dictates by the majority so even if all indicators and analysis are bearish but the majority of traders speculate that Bitcoin will pump, The majority speculation will govern and will ignore all the analysis.",

I thought you made it up but I see there's a famous author who's going bonkers:I'm Waiting for Bitcoin to Test $1,100: Robert KiyosakiHe has already made some failed predictions, but lately I see him more and more apocalyptic, maybe he sees the hour of his death near and projects it to the world.For my part, I think it is very difficult to be bullish now, as there is no reason to be.
