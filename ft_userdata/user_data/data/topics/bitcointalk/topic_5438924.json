      "body": "Teaching children about the finance is good. That too needs to be done at the right age. Some parents used to force their children to learn at the earliest as they weren't able to reap the best out of the market. This doesn't gonna benefit the children as well as the parents. In the long run these children will be with partial learning and they never find a way to progress. Giving them about the base of finance is good. Along with that when time comes we need to inform about the alternate choices available. If he wish, let him learn because most of the parents try to educate about cryptocurrencies just for money making. This is not the right way.",

Because of what I experienced before when I started to learn about Bitcoin, I started to become responsible for my money just like how to value your money, how you track your expenses, investment and deep more into the financial system we have now, trying to understand and connecting the dots because if you want to learn Bitcoin, you will somehow encounter some of these.",

Children should be taught how to save and invest early to enable them master these  two important behaviors. But it is not adviceable to introduce a child that is less than 15years to bitcoin except the child shows uncommon interest. At this stage they should be allowed to focus on thier academics and also build some interpersonal skills that would help them to develop both academically and morally. We can introduced basic saving skills like keeping money in piggy banks and introducing the child to some easier schemes. Bitcoin education can be introduced after the secondary school when the child is matured enough to understand bitcoin transactions. Don't  forget that the child should also be exposed to privacy and online security before exposing him to bitcoin.",

Younger generation should start working with their financial awareness, and we should guide them on every possible way. I couldn't agree more. Pushing Bitcoin as some sort of one and only true form of money, reeks of fanaticism and instinctively pushes people away. It should be shown as an example of a decentralized alternative to fiat, but we have to remember it's an experiment that has a risk of failing.Quote from: Scripture on February 08, 2023, 10:56:44 PM...I will start teaching them on how to save money and how they can spend it, by this you are slowly teaching them to be more wiser when it comes to their finances. It's getting much harder than it may seem. When I was a kid, cash was a primary form of payment, I associated money with coins and notes and the concept was easier to grasp. For children born and raised in a primarily cashless environment, it's much harder to associate money with anything tangible and they have to learn of money as a more abstract concept, which is probably more difficult to comprehend.Similar thing with savings - what used to be true, i.e. encouraging long-term saving, is not necessarily a good advice in a situation of high inflation and low rates on saving accounts.",

We are all bitcoin investors, so for us, bitcoin is the best, but not everyone likes bitcoin, and there are many ways to become rich and successful without bitcoin.

Alternatively, we can keep educating them slowly as they grow up about how the blockchain works, such as use of miners, about block confirmations, fees used, etc. instead of putting the price and investment pressure in their heads. The more they learn it technically, the more advanced and skilled they become when they are ready. Also the mind is very sharp to catch things during childhood rather than in adulthood!",

Sometimes you just need to let the youth enjoy their childhood, then educate them when they're ready.With children, their childhood is full with fun and playing times. If parents want to teach their children anything educationally, they can try to do that with playing games or anything similar to games.Children need to get funny experience from that they naturally learn things with their small brains. It is like how they learn to say \"Daddy, Mommy\", very naturally and without pressure on their brains.Cartoon movies, cartoon books for them are great. Games for them are great too.I think they if parents can find games for them to play and guide them to tips other players with bitcoin, it is great. Teaching children about finance when they are very young is not great idea.",

The child's brain is developing rapidly. and their emotions are not as stable as adults.and actually children are more susceptible to experiencing anxiety disorders due to stress or feeling burdened. so teach in a fun way and avoid making them feel pressured or coerced.interest them first and make them curious and ask questions first. before you explain.",
