I hardly believe you are a bounty manager with three activities. If I am not wrong, multiple accounts were allowed to register in the forum from its start. It's up to the campaign manager whether he will allow multiple accounts. It's his responsibility to check if someone is enrolling with multiple accounts. Back in the old days, theymos had to add a scammer tag manually if it was proven that someone was a scammer. Cheating in the bounty campaign is a scam as well. Since implementing the Trust and feedback system, theymos removed the scammer tag from the forum. Choose a reputed bounty manager who will check multiple accounts. This is not the moderator's Job.",

It's not really a worthy thinking to involve our beloved moderators in such things because it mostly falls in the domain of bounty manager who is running the campaign. The moderators have more work to do then searching for the ones who are cheating the bounty campaigns with multiple accounts. Although, they try their best efforts but still a little help from a good user is a appreciatable thing.You should also try to search for anyone who is using alt-accounts on bounty campaigns and report it to the bounty managers when you have proper proof, that way the members of the forum will also appreciate your hard-work. It's really not worth it to get emotional on such things because scammers and cheaters are everywhere, and the ones who detect them are truly respect-deserving ones.The bounty managers are doing really hard work in running those bounty campaign and sometimes they also have limitations as human beings. It's the work of a good member to report the scammers and cheaters to the bounty managers so that they could penalize those negative actors by removing them from the bounty campaigns. And reporting them to the moderators and administrative staff, so those cheaters can be penalized with a ban.EditedQuote from: Baunty detective agency on May 23, 2023, 12:40:16 PMI understand your post very well but I told the manager I run multiple accounts but he didn't give any importance so I posted here without any help.Wow, you have done the crime yourself and now asking moderators to penalize those who are doing the same thing.
