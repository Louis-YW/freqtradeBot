  "content": "To me it seems like there have been talks about BTC becoming scalable for many years now. BTC is decentralized and secure no doubt, but if we don't solve scalability, how can this ever work out? And if BTC doesn't solve the trifecta, perhaps an altcoin will; before bitcoin does.I know Blockstream has made some interesting products, by Adam Back (most suspicious person for being Satoshi). But these are all products that are not running on the Bitcoin main network (not decentralized, secure is arguable).It's my main fear for BTC not succeeding, never becoming scalable. The halvings have been cool in pushing us into new bullruns, but this 4th halving will be a minor decrease in mining rewards compared to the previous ones. Sure we can have other bullish catalysts, but I don't think it will cut it. We've had some of the most bullish (in theory) moments in time for BTC these recent years, but we couldn't latch on; because frankly, Bitcoin is not finished yet. If it could scale on a massive global scale like advertised - It would have been mass adopted during the pandemic and hyper inflation times.Am I naïve, is there any reasonable chance for BTC to conquer its scalability issue? It's amazing the Byzantine General's problem got solved, but now we've got a 'trifecta' problem. A cryptocurrency can't be decentralized, scalable and secure all at the same time.",

Even though it'd be mostly pointless since you will not have escaped the traditional monetary system being correlated to the dollar. Most stablecoins just run on the Ethereum mainnet, with that, making them unscalable by default. Transaction times and fees of Ethereum. To me, for a cryptocurrency to reach its goal of global adoption, worldwide instant transactions, anywhere anytime. It should, ofcourse have instant transactions - and second, have extremely low fees >$0.01. Especially needed for less developed countries where sometimes in peak network stress fees can go all the way up to monthly salaries.",

Am I missing something? If you lack any of these 3, you cannot become the advertised global adopted cryptocurrency (as far as I know).

I actually think at the moment looking at things, we'll probably see altcoins be used for lower values. This might actually be integrated in a user friendly way in the future, I don't know. However, by reducing the transaction times, and therefore the confirmations you're effectively making it a little less secure. Although, Bitcoin could potentially be used like that now. As an example, many users here feel comfortable enough to allow for 0 confirmations, and only see it broadcast on the network. I wouldn't recommend it for the security implications that could potentially impose, but most people are already doing this with cards using fiat, so maybe people don't care all too much about the additional checks to prevent double spending etc. I'm not sure that makes Bitcoin insecure though, since Bitcoin by default would still be secure, it would be the user choosing not to use the additional checks, which means Bitcoin is secure, but the users are slightly less secure by taking risks, however small they may be in reality. Expensive; yeah there's an issue of that. However, segwit, and Lightening offer somewhat solutions to the expense problem, and in the future we'll likely see additional steps taken to reduce the transaction fees. However, due to the nature of Bitcoin, fees will always be a part of the network, and I'd rather higher security, a decentralised system to a degree, and paying a fee than giving up those benefits. I mean, a lot of people are already getting fees associated with their cards, they just don't realise it. Especially, if you own a credit card.Also, one could argue that Bitcoin isn't completely decentralised, and they would be right to an extent. Mining as an example takes a certain amount of hardware these days, which of course directly translates to expenses, something which prices out the poorer users among us. Plus, there's also a certain technical element to it, that not everyone will be willing to wrap their head around. Thus, mining attracts a certain demographic.",

Hence why I made this post, asking if I'm naive for thinking this, is there something I don't know?Using Binance smartchain isn't solving any existing issue, you're only proving the trifecta problem I stated in my original post. BSC has 21 validators, selected by Binance. The chain is not decentralized, it's a centralized network. You sacrificed decentralization from the trifecta in order to achieve scalability. Trifecta: (decentralization, security, scalability).Also, $1 fee is still too high for global adoption. In the Netherlands where I live, when I use my bank card to purchase something in a store, I pay $0 in txfees. No ordinary person here will take that txfee burden from crypto. $1 is also way too much money to sacrifice as a fee for most african people, some asian countries too, or poorer people in general. If you buy a $2 coffee and pay $1 txfee. That's a 50% price increase.",

However, with the former there are ways to improve it or at the very least mitigate it. However, whether it's advisable to do that remains another thing. I genuinely believe most people will find a use for Bitcoin, however I know not everyone likes the idea of being their own bank, and I'm quite shocked it hasn't happened yet, but I can see banks making their way into Bitcoin storage, which will appeal to a certain type of person. While the very core users of Bitcoin will likely be hostile towards that, I might say it might even be necessary for mass scale adoption, since Bitcoin is a complex subject, and we can probably only simplify it so much, and therefore as long as there's complexity people aren't going to trust themselves to look after multiple thousands worth of Bitcoin, thus opting for a third party that will supposedly be more qualified in handling security issues. So, with that in mind, as long as we continue moving forward, and we aren't too hostile to things which might go against the very core of Bitcoin principles, we should still see some major adoption. Obviously, people like us will opt to handle our own funds, but I'm just giving an example there where decentralisation might actually be harmed in the future, something along the lines of what OGNasty said.",

The transactions reach their destination immediately (1-2 seconds) and on average it takes 10 minutes for them to become finalized.In comparison in the traditional systems like the banking system, it takes months for the transaction to be settled and become finalized and same with altcoins considering they need a lot more \"confirmation\" compared to bitcoin to be considered final and that usually takes hours.As for transaction fees, in 99% of bitcoin's lifetime the fee has been very low. Currently a normal bitcoin transaction costs about $0.03 which is very cheap.",

Currently a normal bitcoin transaction costs about $0.03 which is very cheap.Come on, 1-2 seconds? In a utopia maybe. In reality purchasing anything you will need to wait for network confirmations, which can take multiple hours. I've used Bitcoin countless times. Comparing that to the traditional system, my transactions don't take hours, rather seconds.The average transaction fee per 1 September was $1.09, where do you get a $0.03 instant transaction on Bitcoin mainnet?",
