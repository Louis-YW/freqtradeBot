Lmao on the source. Does the X post doesn’t have the source on their post?Nevertheless, Bitcoin is truly always bullish during November of every year ever since I started on Bitcoin investment. The Black Friday + Thanksgiving Combo are always working well to boost the price.QuoteWho is holding since 2010 here ? There’s only few active users that registered during 2010 but I doubt there’s a lot of user manage to totally hold their Bitcoin from 2010 until now. That’s a very strong temptation to resist selling in an insane amount of profit.",

And I don't think that there is only one reason for the crash in price and even now there are still scammers in the Crypto-currency world so that only can't be the reason for the crash.Also we can see another crash in 2022. The market is very unpredictable but as we can see long term holders always see through the crash and into a pump. It would be smart to just see those crashes as a good entry point because time without number Bitcoin always bounces back.",

You should have added the link to that source here so we could be sure to see it. From 2010 to 2023, we may not have seen the price of Bitcoin on Thanksgiving day and how much it has increased. But on Thanksgiving Day, November 28, 2024, Bitcoin was over $95,000. We've seen a similar Twitter post, which lists Bitcoin prices from Thanksgiving Day 2010 to 2024.https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1862009417710919785?t=Tov1_-xDRRK9VC2CvZUTag&s=19QuoteWho is holding since 2010 here ? Maybe there are very few members who have patiently holding Bitcoin since 2010 till date. In the beginning the price of Bitcoin was very low and since then the price of this Bitcoin has gradually increased. There were also many investors who invested when Bitcoin was priced at $0.28. Then when the price of Bitcoin increased several times in a few years, they may have sold their invested Bitcoin due to greed.",

Even though many other lesser coins and even memecoins would be able to reach such percentage gains, they would lack what BTC has in abundance - clear goals, ideals, decentralized nature, and faith put into it. It's a known fact that any enthusiast in the space can analyze BTC cycles - and have some gains from that.",
