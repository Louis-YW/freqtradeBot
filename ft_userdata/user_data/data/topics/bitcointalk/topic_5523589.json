For me to become a weak hands the situation that would trigger me to sell would have to be an almost unrealistic situation, like bitcoin going down to $1,000 in 24 hours or something like that. But that is a scenario that is not going to happen, especially with the bullishness of the coming year. In fact I see the recent dip as a good opportunity to keep accumulating. The fools who are selling will regret it.",

Even if you are a firm believer in crypto, it can be hard to remain invested if there is major correction in price over very short period of time .Weak hands are always weak hands and they will be weak whenever Bitcoin has corrections. Weak hands can change if these people change their minds after experiencing this market more, and understanding more about this market operation as well as about Bitcoin market history.It will be affected in percent, like - 10%, -20%, -30% correction and people will care less about drop in $. It's important if they lose in $ but I imply that they will be fearful mostly because of how many percent their portfolio drops in one day or during a correction.Sometimes, if they're holder but are traders with leverages, their hands will become much weaker. Exchanges always wait for market corrections to liquidate leveraged positions of users and don't care their customers whether have strong hands or weak hands.",

This drop is likely due to the festive season; with lots of people selling off for the holidays, there is no need to quake about it because there is still good time ahead from January and 2025 still holds promises.Don't be a weak hand, selling due to no important reason. If you are trading bitcoins for fiat in this period, it should be for a good reason.",

A simple price decrease amount is nothing since Bitcoin is already high. It’s nonsense to become a weak hands after the price decrease by 10K while it’s still hanging strong on a price support.Looking at the chart and rely on support and resistance is still the best way to determine whether you need to sell or still hold.But in long term, holding is still the best option.",

In short, even if a major correction occurs and btc price drops deeply, dropping below $10k is highly impossible. That won’t never happen again. Strong hands will remain strong because they’ve seen the real potentials of bitcoin, while weak hands will always be weak because they don’t have the confidence to trust the movement of bitcoin.",

The first conclusion is that the Bitcoin price is growing in the long term, so buying the first cryptocurrency at any price will eventually lead to profit. The second conclusion is that a fall in the Bitcoin price is the best time to buy the first cryptocurrency. I have seen the Bitcoin price fall from $ 19,000 to $ 3,500 (over 2 years). I have seen the first cryptocurrency fall from $ 5,000 to $ 3,000, which happened in just 24 hours. It is very difficult to surprise me. If the Bitcoin price fell today, then in the future it will certainly grow. There is no point in worrying.",

There will always be a correction and the price will rise to exceed the last highest price. I would rather wait for another bull run than rush to sell my coin at a loss. From historical information, the peak of the Bull run will be next year and this one will be an uncommon one.

On the contrary, if the cause is war or collapse similar to FTX, Mt.gox causing bitcoin to be dumped, then it is an opportunity to buy at a high discount, not a time to panic.Also, if you invest with an amount that you can afford to lose and you have enough faith in bitcoin, I am sure you will see no reason to sell your bitcoins no matter what bad happens.",

However, to cap it all, anyone selling now; no matter the perceived dip in the market isn't getting it right. This is just a correction, a cool off period for Bitcoin. That's why I said anyone selling now is going to miss out big time; except they're selling to buy the dip.I can take my risk cashing out on alts with the aim of buying back but I dare not try it with Bitcoin. No matter the dump now, I ain't panicking to sell off. I can begin to consider selling off once my targeted level is reached. Until Bitcoin does more than $68k X 2, I won't bother with whatever signals of dump the market is presenting.",

I have witnessed bitcoin massive dip within 24hrs and I still kept my holdings in good faith that it will recover which it did. The only measure I kept in place is that I keep buying using DCA. So, I don't think little correction like this can give me a weak hands. Its even an opportunity for me as I able to grab more units through limit entry on my BingX portfolio.",

Let's say price drops into $20k from the current btc price, that's already too far to mark.However, this is not always the case with bitcoin. We may often see bitcoin surprise us with a new all time high, but it's just very rare for bitcoin to drop its price 50x or 80x from its original price. Bitcoin would not have been the most prominent, most reliable and most profitable crypto in the market if that's the usual price pattern for bitcoin.",

Price fluctuations like this doesn’t scare them much, Although it will be hard to even get a 15% drop in 24 hours it is possible to get a 50% in a bearish period and that still won’t scare people. 50% from here is even just around $48k which is a price we have been to before, so for me right now I don’t see any price drop that will also turn me to a weak hand because I know it would bounce back this isn’t a shitcoin where a drop like that can brings its crash",

If we are already at the end of the bull cycle - then it is possible to sell everything instead of some or gradually. I've survived this far without taking profits when I see profits - so there's no reason for me to be a weak hand just because of a drop in price.However, one thing is certain - each of us has a different tolerance for risk. Some are optimistic about the future, they will hold - while others will cut their losses and sell during a downturn. Optimists don't sell until their targets are reached - while doubters exit and even have to accept some losses due selling during a downturn.",
