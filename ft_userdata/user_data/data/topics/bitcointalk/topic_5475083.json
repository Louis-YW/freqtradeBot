I am still searching for ''ideal'' card.",

On top of the card just before you activate it, you will see \"Support Global Consumption\"So, about the services that work and those that don't work. They actually vary from card to card. For example, the first 2 cards I posted don't support Walmart, Etsy, Newegg but some other cards in my very account do support this.I will also test the service sometime to come and I will update here.",
