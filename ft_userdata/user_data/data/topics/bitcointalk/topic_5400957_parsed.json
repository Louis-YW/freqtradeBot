  "content": "Introducing RidottoRidotto is the very first cross-chain gambling and lottery protocol based on complete transparency, anonymity, security, and fairness. Our approach is to provide an open protocol driven by the community, where users can play, build, and even bankroll casino games, thus earning generous liquidity. Ridotto’s overarching goal is to elevate the user to the role of “house,” thereby offering a fully scalable alternative to centralized online gambling.Beyond our vibrant flagship casino, we will unleash retail ingenuity by giving users the decentralized infrastructure to experiment and evolve the gambling ecosystem, much like the App Store did for mobile gaming.Multichain As a multi-chain protocol, the Ridotto protocol will be deployed across all major blockchains, to include Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Fantom, Matic, Cardano, and many more as the war of the blockchains separates the wheat from the chaff. Minimum Viable ProductRidotto’s Minimum Viable Product is a lottery and slot machine protocol, open exclusively to partner projects. Through it, Ridotto’s partners, and their communities, will be able to play and bankroll their very own Ridotto built slot machine and lotteries, run in their native token and designed per their specifications.Announced PartnersBakery Swap, NetVRk, NFTb, CyberFI, Dfyn, Don-key Finance, Gerowallet, Charli3, Lovelace World, and many more to come.Proof of Ownership NFTsTo operate casino products, partners and anyone else interested in running games, must own Proof of Ownership NFTs. They are the assets earned through NFT farming. Owners can choose to deploy them or sell them on the secondary market. Categorized by game type, they entitle owners to lotteries, slot machines, specific table game, and more and will give its owner the ability to customize their casino product’s design, as well as its internal rule structure - house win rate, jackpot size, and to what degree the particular casino product will be open source bankrollable. Individual investors, influencers, charities, DAOs, and both tokenized and non-tokenized communities can benefit from Proof of Ownership NFTs. Profits, marketing, community engagement, native token utility, and non-inflationary staking are just some of the benefits that projects will enjoy by deploying their own casino game.NFT FarmingCommunity members can stake the $RDT native token to farm and progressively earn fractionalized Ownership NFTs.  Only whole NFTs are claimable; the progressive fractional earning system simply exists as a mechanism to slowly give out NFTs to individuals, rather than giving them out all at once. However, the more an investor stakes, the quicker he or she will earn a whole NFT.Token DetailsRidotto’s native token “$RDT” is currently available on Uniswap and PancakeSwap and it will make its way to other blockchains and centralized exchanges.ETH -  https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=ETH&outputCurrency=0x4740735aa98dc8aa232bd049f8f0210458e7fca3BSC - https://pancakeswap.finance/swap?inputCurrency=BNB&outputCurrency=0xe9c64384deb0c2bf06d991a8d708c77eb545e3d5Official LinksTwitter: https://twitter.com/ridotto_ioTelegram Announcements: https://t.me/ridotto_ioTelegram Community: https://t.me/ridotto_communityMedium: https://ridotto-io.medium.comDiscord : https://discord.gg/ridotto",
