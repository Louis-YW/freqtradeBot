  "content": "We know trhat for centuries various countries have sought to create a global empre. Probably the most successful was the British Empire which grew out of the wealth of the Knights Templar. When the British Empire started to crumble from within, it switched from from being a trading empire to a banking empire, and it still controls the bulk of the worlds wealth. Both Cecil Rhodes and Winston Churchill ( amomgst others ) sought to solidify an anglophone empire by absorbing the US, and this has happened. The Eton/Oxford elite  used their Davos meetings and the WEF and WHO to control most of the western world. Two things are important to control a disparate population. You need to control the food, and you need to control the money. The creation of privately owned central banks who have the ability to create fiat  money to lend to governments was an early stage in the ambition to control the world's currency. All of these individual currencies need to be combined and controlled though. The fist stage was the creation of the European Union, and this is an unelected body with a new fiat currency that is used by all of the member states. This caused massive economic problems,  as countries like Germany and Greece need to have different fiscal policies to manage their economies. This is not allowed, and massiive transfers of wealth result as some countries started to fail. It is significant that Britain didn't become a part of the Eurio, as so much of the old wealth is designated in Sterling. The banking elite have created so much debt that the current fiat currencies need to be replaced, and  inflation allowed to erode the current government debt. It is important to the bankers that they are  able to control the public use of money. Computers and the Internet raised the possibilty of creating a virtual fiat currency with central control.So, on to the second stage in this path. Bitcoin is a complex and brilliant creation. It contains elements of military software, and an appreciation of money supply and usage. I believe that it was created by the bankers to test and develop a digiutal payment service that they could control. It had to be portrayed as an anti-banking projectr in the same way that central banks were promoted initially. Without this, it would have been dead in the water. Thed maximum of 21 million coins, and the 10 minute block generation time, meant that it could never a currency for mass global adoption, and thus could never compete with the proposed global currency. It became a massive succedss, and the bankers saw that it could become a wonderfukl store of wealth as an addition to gold. I beleve they have been buying and storing large blocks of Bitcoin, and they are using these to create volatility in the market. This frightens most people, and leaves them receptive to a government backed central digital currency. It explains the frequent bear spikes in the current price.Unicoin has been announced, and it is clear that this is intended to become the centralised, global digital currency. Will it survive, or will it go the way of the Euro? btw, have you noticed that they are heavily moving into food and energy control to strengthen their grip on the gullible public. I won't even start down the road of eugenics, and the role of so-called health care.",

I believe that it was created by the bankers to test and develop a digiutal payment service that they could control.Using decentralized coin to get the attention of people only to come back with a centralized coin that would be used to control the global finances is like giving a kid candy only to lure the kid in for his broccoli.This is a point of conversation because the originators of bitcoin still remains a mystery till today, many school of taught has said it was the CIA, Top government, we have even see a man come out to claim he is the one, now there is a possibility of bankers. The most regarded logic now is that it was Satoshi who was the originator of Bitcoin but even his identity is a mystery.In my own opinion Bitcoin is too much of a sophisticated work of technology to only be used as a forerunner to a centralized coin. If that’s was actually the case then it wasn’t thought of properly.The decentralized nature of bitcoin has giving many the opportunity and freedom they did not get from centralization and that’s among the core reason Bitcoin got this adoption.I don’t think any centralized coin would change peoples mind to come back to it so personally I believe the unicorn idea would be a failure.",

      "body": "One of my points was that Bitcoin was deliberately created to be unsuitable as a global currency. They want their own controllable currency, not a wils decentralised currency. Giving the illusion of democracy is a tried and tested way to ensure people and products that are detrimental to the public interest are adopted. Do you belive that politicians in the US can even run for office with a credible chance of election is they aren't supported by the puppet masters. Similarly, you, in the UK, you have to be approved by the Eton/Oxford elite. That is why our MPs are all bankers, lawyers or PPE graduates. Euro MPs have no authority, they bget paid large sums of money to attend parliamentary meeting and parties, but they have toi vote for the pokicies presented by the unelected leaders. The Euro has massive debts, several countries are rebelling and want to foloow Britain out of the EU ( when will we get a PM who really want to make Brexit happen? ), and economically weak countries like Greece have had to sell national assets just to pay the interest on their debts, and they can't adjust their economic policies to recover.Of course Bitcoin has made loads of money for the minority who have adopted it. In return they have field tested the concept, and created some amnazing software concepts. It has also created a massive new store of wealth for the bankers. What a brilliant success fior them.You can't stick to verifiable facts when the future is still in the planning stages. Otherwise you end up in the same terrible state as those who believed that a crippling injection would protect people from viruses that have been evolving since the 1930s. Can we do anything about the Unicoin? Well we could refuse to use it, but no doubt they will be giving away loads of free \"money\" to encourage us to adopt it. Can we retain the current system? There is far too much debt for it to survive in its current form. We can hold hard assets to carry us through, but they are already starting to attack and soak up housing, and they are debasing gold, so you need to be careful. Bitcoin is an ubusualk hard asset, and it has been adopted by the bankers. It is also too small to be of significance in the grand scale of things. I'm watching developments, and I hope to be able to protect my investments.",

The average person hears a lot of fud about bitcoin, but at the same time may like the concept. If the government will now make a \"better\" bitcoin and will bring the media to report a lot about it, many average people will use it. This will be especially true, if the government will simply pay its workers in this new currency. I think that bitcoin was not made by governments, but still I think that there are some projects from central banks and big companies (facebook for example) that are trying exactly what OP described minus the government creating myth.

The world is comprised of many nations and countries and they have their own interests and conflicts.

This game of regulating the emission is what they bankers and States have done in the last century, and the economy cycles of bubble/burst continue, because that money is trash, to not mention fractional reserve...Gold is not infinite, but it may be if you explore the universe (or can harness the energy to produce it artificially). Currently it is somewhat limited on Earth, except when they find an undiscovered source like they did in Ghana? but is considered that most sources have been depleted.With fiat there is no end, and they abuse this power.",
