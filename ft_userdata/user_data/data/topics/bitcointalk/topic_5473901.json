It's hard to predict the market because even market makers are unable to control everything, every event on this planet. Hence sometimes their plans will be broken or not fully completed as their initial plan.You will have an easier life if you don't time the market and only focus on fundametals as well as have a long term investment.What are fundamentals of Bitcoin that are good for your long term investment?It's Controlled supply.

But be sure that you use 1W or 1M for it. They could also guide you if the pattern changes, which might be the time to opt-out.QuoteThere are those who argue that candlestick patterns called bullish pin bars  signal a bull market, but I am not so sure about the validity of candlestick patterns in terms of predicting the right outcome.I'm a living witness to the goodness of price actions my friend, they are so powerful when used on higher timeframes. Nevertheless, I make sure that I use other trend trading or breakout strategies to filter/confirm the signal.QuoteDo you have an indicator that you use that you think is useful for accurate predictions in technical analysis? Also, have you come across such a sign in the recent past until today and what are your analyzes?I've used countless indicators, both default and custom, I must tell you that they are weak, you do not rely on them as they often fake signals. The ones you see that are crossed now might uncross at the moment after, so they are not so reliable. You would see them confirming the halving too since they work with the market price but I prefer price action for reliability if you know how to read it better.Perhaps, you confirm it with an indicator to be more sure.",

Because even after a bullish pin bar candle pattern develops, the market might still go in the opposite direction.

However, this bullish pin bar can be said to determine direction only if found on a higher time frame such as the weekly or the monthly, to talk about a possible bull market.",

And in the end they have mentioned a possible way to handle the situation or judge it.We have to look at the fundamentals of the market too like what is happening in the world that can impact that assets, currency or product you are trading in. Besides all that so far I have learnt that never read the candles because we might not find reading candles useful as they are based on past data and in crypto past data cannot be used to predict the future. So, the best practice is to take all the measure to get full benefit of the bullish market and we can not time the market. But at least we can try that.",

These months range from 12 months to 18 months on average, and therefore the chance of a large price increase will occur in 2025, despite the possibility that we will reach $100,000 before that date.",

That's right, yes. A deviating factor could already be seen in the bear phase in 2022, for example: The ATH of the previous bull market was undercut for the first time, which has never happened in any cycle before. It is therefore quite possible that the motto \"bulls start halving\" will now also apply in this market. If you look at the altcoin market over the last few days, you might well get the impression that the bull market is back in full swing. Personally, however, I am still very skeptical.",

The price started to rise about 6 months after the halving, the new ATH occured 12 - 18 months after the halving. So it is indeed very likely that we will see a rising BTC price in 2024 - at least if one wants to rely on previous cycles - which I don't think anyone should do.
