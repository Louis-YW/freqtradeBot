But there are very few people who consider a graphical aspect while they're designing their website. I know this is a subjective question, but I would like to know what websites you think are truly beautiful, whether you built them yourself or if they were built by someone else and you just think they look great. I'm looking for websites that are visually pleasing, easy to navigate, and functional. You can also include any personal projects you have built as well as websites from large companies like Apple or Google. Please include a screenshot or link to your favourite website in the comments.For starters, here are some of my favourites:The Game Awards MicroverseCode:https://thegameawards.dreamwave.live/Nest WifiCode:https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_wifi?hl=en-USHomecultCode:https://homecult.com.ua/",
