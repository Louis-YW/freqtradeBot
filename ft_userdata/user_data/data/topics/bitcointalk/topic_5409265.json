Since many people complain about this and due to the new policy GDPR before they remove the ads. If the ads is your problem in other alternatives why not host a Bitcoin converter on your own you can use something like this one https://github.com/wp-plugins/bitcoin-calculator-widgetIt's outdated but you can edit the blockchain.info ticker into .com.",
