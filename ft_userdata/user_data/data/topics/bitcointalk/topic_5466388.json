  "content": "Greetings to everyone, please its been 2days now since I started experiencing my forum account getting logged out, and I'm kind of worried, and I really don't know why, and I thought It's better I come share this out here to know of is it a general problem? Or am I the only one experiencing this? Please and please I need your advice, because as a result of that I have just gone to change my password and Gmail, to avoid any such of hack, but I keep experiencing the same situations. So on that note, I will like to call on the attention of some reputable forum members I have always looked up to since day one on possible advice on what to do, and by that I mean in the person ofÂ  @ Loyce, TryNinja, Rikafip, Nutildah, Pmalek and lastly Sir Theymos. Thanks in advance as I wait for your solution.Please Note: I'm a Nigerian and will always remain a Nigerian on this forum for the rest of my life, and likewise will I continue using this Bitcoin wallet address below that I have been using for the past 2yrs on this forum til further notice. ThanksBTC address (Segwit)- bc1q569t82xygdh62d6f0lduedq4k9nk42s0ljcvvsSo, please am I the only one experiencing the forum log out or it's general??",

I haven't experienced such, it means it's peculiar to you too. But you can't experience this due to your nationality or a Bitcoin address. You, writing them out is not necessary.Before the likes of those you called out share their view, you might want to be sure that you do not use VPN or Tor, or private mode of browsers. Also, be certain that you click on \"Always stay logged in\" to keep you on. You might also want to delete your browser cookies and caches. You may try logging in on another browser as well.",

How does it happen exactly? You're just browsing the forum, and then you refresh to find yourself logged out?Using incognito mode can not lead to your Bitcointalk account to be logged out automatically, it only help people browsing history not to be recorded on the browser used.This can not be cookies. Bitcointalk does not send any cookies link for someone to accept or reject. I do not really know about how cookies can be related to this. I may not be exactly right.If you visit a website, you look for an item on the website. If you visit the website again, you will easily see similar items again. The cookies stored on your browser makes that possible. Also if you visit another website, you will be seeing similar items and also you will see ads of the item on another sites. That is the work of cookies.Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on September 11, 2023, 09:15:58 AMI'm not using any VPN of any kind, and I was thinking it could be as a result of maybe since my browser was outdated, should be the reason for this, but I updated it and I keep experiencing the log out, but haven't tried clearing cookies, which I will go do it now.Make sure that it is not someone that is doing it.

But if you browse using Incognito, close... and then close the whole window, and reopen it again, then you will have to type your credentials again.I could be wrong, but the Session ID or token must be stored on the client's side so when the user deletes that data from the browser, he's asked to log in again.",

If CryptoHeadlineNews is using a browser like that, the browser will keep erasing all the browsing history.@CryptoHeadlineNews. If you are not using incognito browser, my advise is that should reinstall the browser app. Or you can clear your browser storage. If you clear your browser storage, all information stored on it will all be erased and the browser will become like new. If the problem still continues, you can use browsers like Duckduckgo for mobile or Firefox for desktop.",

Okay, I'm using Chrome Browser Sir, which I specifically downloaded from Google PlayStore, since I'm using an Android device, and this incident which I just reported all started on Saturday evening, after while trying to access the forum, I saw that my account was already \"logged-out\" when i didn't, because my account have always been on the \"Always stay log-in\" mode. So I tried logging-in, and after some while, I noticed that I was still logged-out, and the issue persisted til yesterday been Sunday. So on that note, I just had to take the bull by the horn yesterday by changing both password and Gmail, so as to be on the safer side, and report this issue to the forum to know if could this be a general case or just mine.
