Now he tells smth about changing details. Let me describe the situationThis person bought from me Binance account. Before buying I sent you the account details to check it. He told everything is good and paid for it. I asked him to change phone number and email of the account on his own because I my email which was attached to the account I use for many accounts which I sell. He told me that he would change all details on the next day. While I was sleeping he made 2 BTC transactions in that binance and successfully withdraw them via P2P to his bank account. After that he asked me for a refund because his own binance account was fixed. My argument is that I can't make a refund as he already used an account (who knows for that he used it???). His arguments - 0I wanted to send you screenshots of full conversation but that clown deleted it and wants to blame me that I took money and didn't give him full access to the account. People who worked with me from this forum know that I'm a legit seller and looking for long term partnership. I am not a fucking schoolboy who would ruin his business on the forum for a couple of bucks",
