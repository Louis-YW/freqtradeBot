  "content": "I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos about Cryptocurrency trading.I especially enjoy watching one YouTuber, Eddie Moon. I Googled him and read about him. \"is an American YouTube channel with over 292.00K subscribers. It started 9 years ago and has 196 uploaded videos.\"In any case, he has a Patreon, which I joined. He also offers one on one mentoring.He suggested I open an account at Webulltradingbot.com because that's where he does her trading. So I did. I deposited $10,000.00However, there is another site called Webull at webull.com. I felt confused and I wrote Webull.com an email asking about the website, webulltradingbot.com. This is their reply:\"Hi,Thanks for reaching out to us. Our official website is https://www.webull.com/. webulltradingbot.com is not our official website. We advise you to contact law enforcement if you have been taken advantage of by this fake website. At Webull, we make it a priority to protect your privacy and safeguard your personal and account information every day. Recently, we have seen an increase in fraudsters targeting Webull customers. We'd like to share some tips about what you can do to help protect yourself and your information, too. Together, we can keep your account and your information safe.\"I googled webulltradingbot.com reviews but nothing comes up.I contacted him and told him about this. He said it is a legitimate site and has been trading on it for years.Am I being scammed by a prominent YouTuber?",

I'm sorry for your loss, but you gave $10k to scammers with easy hand.",

I would understand if he would try to advertise that fake site, but he didn't even managed to give correct link to it.He said he joined Eddie Moon's Patreon, and from the pinned post in the Eddie Moon official Patreon and recent posts, I can say that maybe OP joined a fake Patreon account with the same name as Edie's youtuber because the real YouTuber had not previously touched on highlighting this fake trading bot platform before, frankly, I do not believe the OP, and he did not put proof of his deposits or chat logs.And what caught my eye is that the OP has a previous topic titled: \"Met Beautiful Young Asian Woman On Dating Site To Teach Me Trading\" and in this topic, he tells another story that I think is from his imagination and indirectly promotes the BitContractPro platform, which has no reviews or ratings and is definitely a scam.We can tell from the following quote that the OP intends to promote these fake trading platforms here and not to solicit recommendations or advice.Quote from: David92506 on June 16, 2023, 02:22:22 PMOn her platform, she can Buy and hold on to it and Sell it in 60 seconds. You can't do that with Coinbase.So she wants me to transfer all of my Coinbase money into the platform she uses, which is:BitContractProShe has $100,000 in her account.
