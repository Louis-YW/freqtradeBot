  "content": "Justin Sun reported earlier today that HTX exchange (until recently known as Huobi) has been hacked for 5,000 ETH approximately worth $8 million. All funds are of course SAFU according to him, until they aren't.  So yeah, another reminder that storing your crypto on centralized exchange is not the smartest thing. https://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1706311251024822748?s=20",

His level of trollery is equal to that of CSW. It is once again shown in his announcement of the hack. Only a troll announces a hack that has successfully stolen millions while declaring that funds are safe. Only a clown proudly announces that they have \"addressed and resolved all issues\" while at the same time offering monetary and even employment reward to the hacker just so that the stolen funds are returned. Only a joke brags about detecting the hack immediately and taking \"swift action to prevent any losses\" while saying that the platform has suffered a loss of $8 million.Such a clown!",

This is a bad thing and they may need to change the name again to HHTX (kidding )The $8 million lost will not constitute a loss that will lead to the bankruptcy of HTX, but it may be a test attack and what is to come is worse, so it is better to stay away from using it at least until publishing a detailed report on what happened and the necessary steps to ensure that this does not happen again, although I think it is difficult for them to gain trust again.",

Are there independent third parties investigating such allegations, because what appears to be an employee did not receive his dues and then stole that money in exchange for getting what he wanted. Will the platform guarantee that it has become safer or actually enhance this, or is it money that was lost and recovered?These responses are more likely to arouse suspicion than to be useful.",

Concerning how they pride the exchange to be unhackable, Justin Sun could easily tweet this to calm all fraying nerves down and to make HTX exchange look good in the eyes of the media. To back up his claim, I would have expected him to attach a transaction id of the returned stolen funds by the hacker.  Aside that, I just find it hard taking his words for it.",
