The problem lawmakers face is that it is very easy for someone to say they have lost their Bitcoin private keys , for example, and there is no way to check whether they are telling the truth or lying and have them stored in a safe a few feet underground. If the legislation allows the simple claim that you have lost them to be counted as a capital loss, it gives a lot of scope for the declarants to cheat. On the other hand, if it is too restrictive, it can be unfair to those who have really lost the keys and have no way of proving it other than their word.",

And it doesnt unfairly punish those people who are just swapping coins to move them to different wallets.  This raises a very important question, what is bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in terms of tax legislation. Could it be stocks, money, currencies, commodities?Capital gains tax also has many disadvantages in the cryptocurrency market, because the price of coins can grow 20-30 times or decrease in a year. And tax deductions for capital reduction are limited.",
