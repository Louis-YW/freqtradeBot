Topic like this can’t easily get merit unless you provide a valid inout towards your question. Try to exert some effort next time by making some research so that you can provide valuable info that can be shared here if you really want merit.Answering the question, I believe most crypto millionaires already secured there assets and prepared it for there child future in case they will die young. I personally entrusted the backup private key to my wife in case I die young so that they can access my wallet to support them in the future. I’m not a whale holder and I have this kind of plan. I believe those millionaire is much prepared like having a safe box for all there keys that only there beneficiary can open when they die.",

I don't really think most of this generation has thought of giving their wealth to their offspring. This concept for them is pretty flawed. These days people want to make sure they live the best of their lives and their children should earn their livelihood and their fortune by themselves.",

InvestmentSome people do not have either one of them and it can eventually cause issues and it all comes down to : 1. Teaching them about something important like cryptocurrency like Bitcoins. 2. Teaching them to value their investment3. Teaching them regarding economic investment plans and management for their future as well.",

      "body": "I don't really know what you regard as legacy. If I were to say from my point of view, it would be that legacy has more to do with ones work and life which often results in wealth or poverty. For work I mean, what so passionately one loses him/herself in and in turn earn from it either it pays the soul and gives it fulfilment or it fills the pockets to sustainment and multiplication. Failure to leave a good legacy could be a result of mishap, inadequate planning, inability to discover oneself among other variables.Mine would aim to ensure my children learn what gives life meaning and how the pursuit of money ain't the path to happiness. Also, my wealth is theirs in all respect, both intellectually, financially, and otherwise.",

These days people want to make sure they live the best of their lives and their children should earn their livelihood and their fortune by themselves.Are people harsh like that on their future offsprings? Well, if I had children I would do the best to give them confort and life quality. And probably one of the reasons why I don't think about having children is because I know I can't offer them any of those things.I think it's an egoistical philosophy to want children to pass for the same difficulties they did, just because life wasn't easy for them, so children have to suffer as well.Once I settle my life, learn a profession, have an income for a confortable and independent life, then I could start thinking about children. Then I wouldn't have to worry in preparing a legacy for them anymore, because it would be already done. All I would have to do was to maintain it until they reached maturity age. If that will be possible someday, I hope it's going to be with the help of bitcoin.",

Millionaires don't need to invest in bitcoin to secure their children's future, they already have invested in so many things with that investments and businesses their children's future is secured.

Or These crypto millionaires can write legacy not Their grand Children.Ahmmm not yet, because for my own perspective only I rather give them fiat or gold I think, because giving them crypto will be subject to volatility and it is hard to maintain the value of it. Maybe I could give them crypto but in btc or eth only because these two proven that even there are bear markets and other things still it will not leave the market especially for bitcoin of course it is common sense now.",
