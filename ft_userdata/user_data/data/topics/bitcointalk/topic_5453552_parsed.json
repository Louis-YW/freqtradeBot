And the Etherscan link shows multiple transactions from a Coinbase address to elsewhere.This happens to be one of the many cases where a scam accusation is made yet those reading it are confused as they cannot understand anything. I would advise the OP to post back with complete clarity otherwise he will not be able to gather any support from members.Quote from: JeromeTash on May 21, 2023, 08:46:33 PMYou are not being clear in this scam accusation, or am I missing something?You said you deposited 1 ETH which was credited to your account and then made another deposit of 1 ETH which was never credited to your account.

      "body": "OP there are lots of discrepancies on your complaints and accusations. Your proof submitted does not aligned with your complaints.For instance, the second Link provided as your proof or evidence is showing a BTC transaction that take place as far back 2013 against the date which this complaint was created or occurrence took place. You never mentioned of paying or depositing bitcoin for the game and the second Link shows ethereum transaction with 2 eths showing coin Base and this seems to be an internal coin Base wallet transaction if I am not mistaken. OP sorry to say this you will have to edit this post and properly give in details proof and incidence of how it occurred because what you have posted here is not factual but errors. Try do the needful as to avoid further confusion.",

I would not say either way whether ethercrash scammed the OP or not but how many times have we seen scam accusations from newbies which are unsubstantiated (or unclear to say the least)?You would at the very minimum expect someone making a scam accusation to provide some sort of evidence to back up their claim.Quote from: CryptSafe on May 22, 2023, 09:45:37 PMOP sorry to say this you will have to edit this post and properly give in details proof and incidence of how it occurred because what you have posted here is not factual but errors.
