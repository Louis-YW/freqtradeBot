After the conquest of Ukraine, Russia will not stop, it will move toward the rest of the former Soviet Union states and will further strengthen its authority over them.There are different kinds of wars. Simple trade wars involve ideas of who can produce the best products cheapest, and then sell them around the world. There's little wrong with that kind of war. It's a share-the-world kind of war... by sharing products.When war is done by force, as in Ukraine, that's when it is the wrong kind of war. The thing we automatically think is that Russia started this war by invading the Ukraine. But the war was there for a long time, guerilla style, long before Russia invaded to stop the guerilla tactics Ukraine was using.If NATO, the US, and the Nazi's pulled out of Ukraine today, Russia wouldn't be able to believe it, and they might stay there long enough to be sure.But what would the US and other countries go back to if they left Russia and Ukraine alone? They'd go back to free international trade. They would resume the war in trade wars. Russia would be forced to go back to trade wars as well... which it has only stopped in some ways because of US aggression.At this stage of world communications and transportation, I don't think that any country would act aggressively against any other... at least not in a big way. Trade and trade wars are too important.Also, I believe that Russia might not let the Ukraine ever go easily. But the Ukraine brought it on itself by antagonizing Russia with its guerilla-war tactics.Here is a little insight. People who become leaders of a country are phobicly aggressive. If they weren't, they would simply sit by and not get into leadership positions. They have a form of insanity, an aggressive phobia. And as they take over their nation, other people who are not as aggressive as they are, simply sit by and do nothing. Why? Because they aren't phobicly aggressive enough to do anything. So, we have war at the drop of a hat by the deranged, aggressive leaders.",

China gives Large loans for the short-term period that are given on strict terms and these loans are mostly spent on projects that do not give you any special benefits, for example building motorways and not setting up industries. Many parts of Africa and Sri Lanka businesses are now virtually under Chinese control because they have not been able to repay their debts.The war between Ukraine and Russia, as you said, is a war of power and it is the responsibility of both countries to ensure that they reach such situations while ensuring their security.Now the war has started and Russia will not return until it achieved its goals as far as the trade war is concerned It has already begun. Russia has cut off gas to Europe, while Britain is considering legislation to seize Russian assets, and there are reports of a wheat crisis.As far as world leaders are concerned, they are really like that because if you are not like that, you cannot run the country. Many things and decisions are beyond the comprehension of the common people while the majority associate them with oppression. But those decisions determine your life and death.",

It’s more likely Susan Rice, former President Obama’s national security adviser who is still working for him and essentially implementing his policies through our dementia puppet president.That would explain why the U.S. and their Western lackeys imposed ‘economic sanctions’ on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine without having any real enforcement mechanisms.Included in a basket of Russian goods, services and commodities allegedly sanctioned by the West is Moscow’s biggest export — oil. Only, the wily Russian President Vladimir Putin and his extremely worldly foreign policy team have found a way to circumvent the sanctions.According to Business Insider, oil shippers are continuing to take on Russian crude by “going dark,” to include paying for the oil in Chinese currency, the yuan, and exchanging weapons for Russian crude:Oil shippers are using several tactics to conceal that their crude cargoes are from Russia, sources told the Guardian, as Europe and the US try to stem imports.At the same time, concerns are growing that India, which has snapped up Russian oil at discounted prices, has the potential to be used as a “back door” for those supplies to enter Europe, the Guardian reported Sunday.One workaround being used to mask the origin of Russian oil is paying in China’s yuan rather than the US dollar, the standard currency for trade, sources told the newspaper. Alternatively, sellers will exchange Russian oil for goods like gold, food or weapons instead of a currency.Trading between the yuan and Russia’s currency, the ruble, has skyrocketed nearly 1,100 percent since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24. That is mostly seen as a means of the two great powers bolstering their alliance and strengthening ties as a means of weakening U.S. and Western global influence.",

The US wanted Russian lands and property.4. The US start moving NATO closer and closer to Russia.5. Russia let their free trade overcome this initial NATO repositioning, rather than making a direct response against the US.6. The US, using Ukraine (one of the most corrupt countries in the world), started moving Nazi troupes in, which started guerilla tactics in and out of Russia, against her.7. For years Russia begged the US to stop the tactics of the Ukraine Nazi military, but the US only doubled down on the guerilla attacks on Russia border lands.8. Finally, after the US set up bio-warfare labs in Ukraine, and started getting serious about making her a NATO member, Russia attacked out of self-defense.9. The US used her bullying might to attempt to cut off Russian trade from the rest of the world through sanctions.10. Many nations formally bowed to the US, but secretively continued trade with Russia, NOT using the US petro-dollar, but using barter and other currencies, including payment in military equipment to Russia.11. Russian wealth increased dramatically, through trade, through certain strategic methods to fight the sanctions, through weapons taken from Ukrainian troupes, through sale of Ukrainian products taken in the conquered Ukrainian lands, etc., BECAUSE...12. Nazi's of the past were never a match for Russians, and Ukrainian Nazi soldiers still aren't today.13. Now, Russia is starting to copy NATO tactics by moving troupes into Nicaragua.If you throw other nations into the explanation, things become more complex. It isn't easy to see most of what is going on. Regarding Ukraine, Russia probably wasn't acting in self-defense 100%, but they were acting in such a way to a great extent.In the past, Russia found that it couldn't win by force. The USSR failure showed them that. So, they did what other nations were doing... free trade. And they were winning and growing in their friendly free trade... something the US and Western Europe couldn't stand. So, these nations attempted to block Russia using the Ukraine.Now that it is backfiring on the US, expect to see much of Western Europe turn their backs on the US, and make peace with Russia. At the same time, expect to see Russia continue with her NATO-like tactics against the US, and move combat troupes into American nations south of the US, and probably into Canada from the Northern Polar regions.Note that China, while smiling in a friendly way with the US sort-of, is preparing to add the strength of their numbers to the coming, Russian invasion of the US.",

You can imagine what it would be like if this decision was extended to include gas and oil.",

I sure hope not.  I know I won't think that.  It seems pretty clear to me that Ukraine was fighting a losing battle, but fighting it hard.  The US has been supplying them with weapons and money to draw out this conflict and try to impose financial penalties on Russia.  At this point it has to be pretty clear that Russia is playing chess while the Biden Administration is playing checkers.  Now we watch as the US Dollar loses it's place as the currency of trade for one commodity after another until it has completely lost it's reserve currency status.  Biden's presidency is going to be felt via a lowered standard of living for generations to come.",

Post style is very similar 2. Over the decade, Russia changed tactics to conquer the world through free trade. - Lie ! The tactics of Russia, as a country of the standard of corruption - bribery, sabotage, blackmail. The EU/German gas market confirms this perfectly.3. The US wanted Russian lands and property. - Lie. More precisely - an absolutely idiotic mantra of communist propagandists. Why capture and invest effort and money if Russia, corrupt from heels to the top, will sell EVERYTHING that it will be told for their favorite green pieces of paper?! 4. The US is starting to bring NATO closer to Russia. - Brad  5. Russia has allowed its free trade to overcome this initial NATO reorientation, instead of responding directly to the US. - Technologically and backward, and totally dependent economy of Russia, which is actually tied to the trade of its resources from / from the earth, cannot be competitive by definition!6. The United States, using Ukraine (one of the most corrupt countries in the world), began to deploy Nazi troops against it, which began partisan tactics in Russia and beyond. - I laugh to tears!   About corruption in Ukraine, writes a person from a country whose basis is theft and corruption  7. For years, Russia has been begging the US to stop the tactics of the Ukrainian Nazi military, but the US only doubled down on guerrilla attacks on Russia's border lands. - Lie. It is very easy to prove - give at least one example? 8. Finally, after the US set up bioweapons laboratories in Ukraine and started getting serious about making it a NATO member, Russia attacked in self-defence. - Everything is bad here ... Here you need to urgently see a psychiatrist. Put down the keyboard and run to save mental health 9. The US has used its power of intimidation to try to cut off Russian trade from the rest of the world through sanctions. - So everything turned out  Right now, half-dead Russia will have a little convulsions and will come again to beg for food 10. Many countries formally submitted to the United States, but secretly continued to trade with Russia, NOT using the US petrodollar, but using barter and other currencies, including payment for Russian military equipment. - Yes, that is right ! Only these countries put Russia in the position they want and buy resources for a penny, often at a price below cost. It's not a secret for anyone 11. Russian wealth has increased dramatically, through trade, through certain strategic methods of dealing with sanctions, through weapons taken from Ukrainian troops, through the sale of Ukrainian products captured in the conquered Ukrainian lands, etc., BECAUSE .. - there is no concept of \"Russian wealth\". There is \"stolen by the Russians from the Russians, and from the neighbors.\" Looting is not a method of making a profit ... This is stupidly criminal theft. Boasting about it is a dubious occupation.12. The Nazis of the past could never compare with the Russians, and the Ukrainian Nazi soldiers are still no match. - I agree ! Nazis yes, I completely agree. Therefore, the Nazis cowardly fled from near Kyiv, from the Sumy region, in the south of Ukraine, now they are cowardly trembling barricaded in Kherson. And the Ukrainian soldiers, with the help of friendly and adequate countries and peoples, are destroying the Nazis from Russia! All right! 13. Now Russia is starting to copy NATO tactics by deploying troops to Nicaragua. -  I support ! Very correct! Destroy your defective gene pool, infected with Nazism / RashiZm should be more active. And in 5-10 years, most of the RuSSians will be an exact copy of \"friends from China\"",

The Ukraine is simply helping with Biden's money laundering scheme, and raking in a bunch themselves.Rubles for grain doesn't have much to do with Rubles or grain... not for Russia, that is.

This could work to an extent if they had a wide - very wide - international group of significant countries doing the same. As it is now, even if grain, gas and oil have to be paid in roubles to RF, most institutions and countries will not \"hold\" roubles. These would be bought when needed.The main reason is that the rouble is not stable and is just another political tool that depends on what Adolf Putin decides on the day.Beyond that, such an alliance would be nearly impossible, since China would rather build it around the yuan and many countries would simply not want anything to do with it.I do not see this attempt by RF being successful nor having any significant effect.",
