But on the page your coins are listed, you will see the present price. I like Unstoppable wallet for this.",

A bunch of blockchain explorers out there let you see the dollar value of transactions.  Wallets like Electrum can do it too.  For me, I like using bitinfocharts.com to check this stuff out.  It's cool 'cause not only does it list the transaction amount in dollars, but you can also see how much your profit is compared to what that BTC would be worth today.  And I'm a sucker for their little transaction graphs they have and  definitely comes in handy to visualize profits if youre investing.",

There are many more options from where you can get data. Many members have suggested you but I also want to contribute. We have some options like.https://blockchair.com/https://blockstream.info/https://3xpl.com/https://explorer.viawallet.com/You have many other options too like a member also shared a thread where you can see many explorer and you can use any from them which you think provide the detailed information. Personally I use Blockchair com which I think is the best option as compare to others explorers.",

That's the current USD value. Those USD values reflect the real-time USD price of Bitcoin. So, they also change accordingly. OP was asking a way to know a Bitcoin transaction's USD value during the time when the transaction took place. OP, blockchair.com offers this. Under your address is your transaction history. Scroll to that particular transaction and click on its transaction hash. It will show you the details including the USD price of the transaction when it happened.",

Because it is latest blocks so values are for recent prices on the market.If you look at thisQuote from: OcTradism on November 29, 2023, 02:06:59 AMhttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/1https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/800000This is more accurate. Value is $0.Block 1, Bitcoin has no value in $ so the value of 50 BTC is $0.Look at block 400,000 https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/blocks/btc/400000QuoteA total of 26,270.68 BTC ($11,079,920) were sent in the block with the average transaction being 15.8257 BTC ($6,674.65). BW.COM earned a total reward of 25.00 BTC $10,544.00. The reward consisted of a base reward of 25.00 BTC $10,544.00 with an additional 0.3335 BTC ($140.66) reward paid as fees of the 1,660 transactions which were included in the block. Simple math: 26,2470.68 BTC = $11,079,9201 BTC = $421.76. It is not today price for Bitcoin.",
