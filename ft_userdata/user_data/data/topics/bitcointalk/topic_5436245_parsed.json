  "content": "Silence is golden is a idiom used to say that, it is often better to remain silent than to speak. But silence is not golden when people like the CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, Jamie Dimon say, \"Bitcoin itself is a hyped-up fraud\" or that \"Crypto is a decentralized Ponzi scheme\". Silence is not golden when people like the Geopolitical economist Peter Zeihan makes comment saying that BTC is intrinsically worthless and would ultimately go to zero. Silence is not golden when someone like Warren Buffet described bitcoin as “probably rat poison squared”. Silence is not golden when bitcoin critics like Paul Krugman, Peter Schiff and others starts spewing venomous comments or narratives about bitcoin.These people are like the so called experts back in the nineties that called the internet a fad yet are enjoying its benefits now. Many years from now, they will be enjoying the benefits of bitcoin but until then, we shouldn't remain silent for our silence will not be golden. We should speak up and speak boldly, we should educate, enlighten them and we should do so from a place of empathy not anger. However, if we have nothing other than hate words to throw at them then silence is golden.What do you say?",

Ignore them and don't give them more publicity if their posts is not malicious, but if it is then be aggressive with pointing out their contradictions.",

Bringing beliefs into misinformation (eg emotioned arguments) can often spread more misinformation.Free advice from wealthy people normally isn't free and that's a point you have to consider. Almost everyone has a self serving motive behind it - particularly if they're hoarding wealth. Even if some of those people enjoy using the Internet and make a profit from it in a lot of cases, that doesn't mean they understand it. They probably have entire teams ensuring they're not attacked while using it and only access trusted sources without making themselves more anonymous/getting someone else to do it.",

      "body": "\"Do not throw pearls before swine.\" The more you argue with such people, the more you become like them. Bitcoin does not need such protection; time puts everything in its place.On the contrary, make your silence golden by not disseminating your wallets and maintaining your privacy. All that Satoshi conceived was anonymity and decentralization, that is, independence from everything. No need to go to the barricades to protect your freedom; just allow all people to express their attitude towards bitcoin as they want. Nothing will ever be accepted voluntarily by people if force is used. Therefore, use what you have and do not put pressure on others.",

Being in this forum gives you a personal responsibility to promote bitcoins as much as you can so as much as silent is golden, It is for some situations and not this kind of situation.",

      "body": "I agree that it is important to speak up and educate others about the potential benefits of bitcoin, especially in the face of criticism. It is also important to approach the conversation with empathy and not anger. Empathy is a valuable quality that often gets overlooked in today's society, as people tend to jump to conclusions without considering another person's perspective. However, it is also important to remember that criticism can be valuable, so before you start an argument with a skeptic or someone who has misconceptions about bitcoin, make sure to consider different perspectives and be open to constructive feedback. So if you see a post or hear a comment that contains misinformation, do not hesitate to jump in and correct it. Just make sure that your corrections are accurate and relevant; otherwise people will think you are just trying to push your own agenda onto them.",

Although it is completely unrealistic to expect dinosaurs like Buffett or Munger to do the same because their minds think completely differently.As for the saying itself, sometimes silence is golden, especially for those who talk nonsense, but also in cases when it becomes senseless to repeat the same things to people who do not want or cannot understand what we are saying. Life's too short for anyone to spend it convincing some old fart on the other side of the world that Bitcoin isn't what he thinks it is.",

For some crypto has no value and for some crypto is everything.I agree, education and conversations are important, but regardless some people will never give up their thoughts on a cryptocurrency that has no value to them.Trying to talk to them is actually an unnecessary waste of time and energy and I don't recommend it.I think it is important that the media present credible and accurate information about crypto so that average people can understand what crypto is and in the end everyone will draw their own conclusions, for and against crypto, and that is completely normal.Expecting everyone to accept crypto is unrealistic and will never happen.The crypto community should definitely be active in crypto promotion, but I think a much more effective strategy is to focus on educational institutions and the media.",

They're actually doing nothing against Bitcoin. They're only showing their ignorance and bias. So why dignify their hatred or biased opinion? I better stay silent and stack Sats. I may speak in favor of Bitcoin, but not in response to their criticisms. I may respond to objective and valid comments against Bitcoin in front of friends, loved ones, and others, but only if brought forward in a fair manner. If it seems they're always against Bitcoin whatever happens; if it is clear they're deaf to reason and facts and data, silence is indeed golden.",
