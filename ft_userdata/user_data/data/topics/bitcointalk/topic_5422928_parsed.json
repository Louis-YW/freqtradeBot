In local markets, you can find similar video cards for $100-120, and the wholesale price is even cheaper. But they pay off for a long time even with free electricity.",

Even Ethereum Classic can be mined until September 2025 on video cards with 4 GB of memory. Therefore, buying 4 GB video cards in the presence of very cheap electricity can quickly pay off if the price of Ethereum Classic increases several times.",
