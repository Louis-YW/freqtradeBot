I believe it could assist beyond just that, as any of such, be it ublock or DNS stands to add an additional layer of caution both against other apps or malicious spyware we either unknowingly have on our devices or was planted on them.",

      "body": "I never heard adguard before according to their privacy policy they do not collect data but we do not know if they didn't. But for me, I would stay using ISP DNS to avoid such data leaks from DNS providers. And if this is all about blocking popups or auto-redirect dangerous links then uBlock origin as mentioned above is fine but the problem is you can't add an addon extension in mobile browser chrome or firefox so if you want protection I suggest use Brave browser or set up your Chrome/Firefox browser to enhanced protection under safe browse. Also, you can increase internet security by setting up the router's firewall to high.",

      "body": "I personally use Adguard on one of my phones. The app is useful to see network requests so you can block addresses/IPs and so on. It also supports a lot of ad/host filters, so you can manually choose which one is the best for you. That being said, they claim that their DNS has no logs policy, but it is unclear how exactly they achieve that. I wouldn't trust them that much if privacy is your concern. Sometimes the request processing speed is also slow, not really the best for browsing many websites IMO. For example, using Adguard DNS changed my response time from 100 ms to 1800 ms in one of my browsing sessions. If that happens to you consider using other DNS providers.If you can't use Mullvad then try to look for alternatives DNSscrypt alternatives such as this one[1]. Keep in mind DNS encryption doesn't really change your IP address, it just helps you access ISP-blocked websites and ads. CMIIW. It also doesn't help you filter phishing websites unless it is widely known beforehand, so keep your awareness and don't download/click from random links.[1] https://github.com/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers",
