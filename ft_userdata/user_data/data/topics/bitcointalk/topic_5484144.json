Some may say freedom others  say hope in a world of restriction, love to hear your responses.For me, Bitcoin is a profitable investment vehicle and also a solution for the freedom to send money across countries freely and without borders. So it could be said that Bitcoin is like freedom for me too. Apart from that, Bitcoin also made me realize that the world of finance is not limited to a centralized system. Because it was through bitcoin that I began to know about the world of non-centralized finance. Before getting to know Bitcoin, I had absolutely no idea about the world of finance which could not be centralized. And to be honest, I consider Bitcoin to be the greatest discovery of this century in the digital and financial world.",

As for me, it is more of an investment that paid a lot and then slowly I learned of the many things it is symbolizing like empowering people away from the control of institutions like governments and banks, for that matter. Bitcoin can still be considered as a young boy and there will be more to its story and history as it is now on its second decade of existence.",

For me, it's a lot of things of what btc means to me.

BTC has dual relevance in my books and those are – as money and as real estate (or any property that doesn't depreciate). So, you see how strong I feel it's impact. I believe its the same for many a user here.QuoteSome may say freedom others  say hope in a world of restriction, love to hear your responses.[/center]The hope and freedom angle is from excited fans. I don't see it from their prism. When we hype Bitcoin to high heavens we should also remember the hiccups it experiences. It's really frustrating when that congestion thing happens. For the first time I had a transaction unconfirmed for over two months. Yes, it was that bad because the app I used didn't have a RBF option on it and there wasn't anything I could do as I never wanted to import it to an app with such a feature. At a point, while waiting, I forgot about the pending transaction. The day it finally confirmed, it was like I was hallucinating. I had to stare at my phone for minutes before it dawned on me I wasn't day dreaming.",

But as majority of us here, we have now financial freedom. At least that's what Bitcoin brings to me. I'm not a big time holder or whale, I just accumulate as much as I can and experience multiple bull runs already. So I made a good profit and from that profit around, make a U-turn, create business for passive income.And you just simply repeat that process, it might be tough to be a long term holder or long term accumulation phase. But at the end of it all, it's going to be worth it as you will have the financial freedom and buy things that you couldn't afford before. And so your life improves together with your family.",
