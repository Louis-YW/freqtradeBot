A gambler who is saying wrongly about any casino won't be able to produce valid evidence against the casino while the casino must be able to produce some pieces of evidence which will prove that the scammer is speaking false.Quote from: hd49728 on August 17, 2023, 02:45:04 PMThinking about it, I see it is unreasonable to have such restrictions, like newbies are not allowed to post in gambling board or Scam accusation board.

But there are also casinos that abuse such rules and use such rules as weapons to restrict withdrawal thus not paying an actual winning. As long as you win small and withdraw small, they won't have much problem in your account. But whenever you will hit a big win and go to withdraw, the casino put restrictions and forces KYC, etc, and then comes up with an excuse to cancel the withdraw.",

You are over reacting mate,Theymos has given access to everyone to post on various boards because this community is a free world. When you were a newbie,you were given free access to post and now you want the newbies to be restricted to lay their complain and should contribute on gambling board. If it is so then the newbies shouldn't also gamble in a casino here,how about that ?Casinos should also come up with their claims that the gambler didn't deserve his wins or should come up with a good reason why the gambler shouldn't be allowed to withdraw his win,if he has violated any of their T&C. I know vivdly that if a member complains about a casino depriving him from withdrawal,forum members will ask the person if he hasn't violated the T&C of the casino. Gambling is for all either newbie or Legend members and that is why newbies wouldn't be restricted to post on those boards that you have mentioned.Quote from: elevates on August 17, 2023, 02:02:55 PMOnly if they buy copper membership they should be allowed if every new member has to pay the evil fee then why not put restrictions on newbie posting on concerned boards?   You didn't buy a corper membership,neither did you pay any evil fee.

TBH, despite of my interest toward Gambling i will say the one who is mentioned by OP is at right because he did got his payment in the first case.If he was making fake excuses or blackmailing them then instead of getting payed he would be red tagged already. But in second case, the case which that company has opened of multi accounts can not be proved by one until they respond by themselves. But till then we should listen to the dude and should not jump to outcomes.",

We cannot judge until we hear the justification of the accused member.Although from the first impression I think that it is difficult to repeat the same problem with the same player twice!! This is somewhat difficult to happen because the question that will come to everyone's mind is why these problems occur only with this member? Especially when the casino is reliable and has a good reputation, this makes such charges hard to believe.Such things harm the reputation of the forum as well as the reputation of Crypto, especially since governments want to catch anything suspicious to discredit Crypto.",

I would say that lesser known brands are more at risk. Casinos that are trying to build a reputation and do not want the negative publicity talk in the forum. If casinos have evidence a user is cheating them, then they shouldn't worry about any publicity. They can use a mediator and show their proof and end of story. Most cases we see in the scam accusations board are bs, but there are a select few that are legit. The issue we face is casino's do not show their proof. If they did, then scammers get smarter and learn how to beat em. So if you have a legitimate claim, you need to get the casino to agree to an outside mediator and both parties agree to the mediators ruling.",

If the user is just trying to formulate lies, there's a chance that he can be phished out as a cheat or abuser if he can't provide some substantial evidence to prove his claims.
