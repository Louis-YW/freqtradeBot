  "content": "Bitcoin is going up, I have electricity for 0.02 USD Kwh. So basically any mining i do is very likely to be profitable at any scale. Loan amount: 1-2 BTCUse: purchase of 10 s19 xp hydro ASIC miners + hydro container (210 unit size) and tariffs for importing to Norway (Currently at 25%) (I will use my own money too in this venture, Im aware that 1-2 BTC doesnt cut it for the purchase of this equipment. But im putting in my own savings as well)Collateral: Equipment itself will be collateral (40 000 USD worth) With a rather high and stable second hand value. I have a smaller online business (Would evaluate it to about 100k USD worth, www adress and revenue details will be provided upon request, about 4000 frequent customer base) I have 3 laptops + Imac rather new (3500 USD worth) car (4000 USD worth) Instagram account 90k followers (Not sure about evaluation, but maybe worth 2000 USD?) ASIC mining rig since before (3000 USD worth) iphone 8, 2 Huawei P30 pro, one new Galaxy 23S Ultra 512 gb - all in decent shape without damages (About 1000 USD worth total propably)15 000 USD in outstanding loans (Debt that im owed from others, that im actively collecting on monthly) Not really collateral but useful: Can provide tax return statements from 2022(60k USD) and 2021(40k USD) (Yeah, I dont declare most of my online income to avoid taxes)Can print full statements from my 2 main bank accounts (Show about 100k usd in transactions last 1-2 years) Also not really collateral, but can ofcourse show passport, driving license, electric bills (as proof of residence) income stream 1: 1800 USD/monthIncome stream 2: 800 USD/monthIncome stream 3: 2800 USD/monthIncome stream 4: 1500 USD/monthFor those interested, these are my own calculations which might differ 5k +- from reality and based on current mining difficulty and BTC evaluation with the combined hash power the data center I want to establish : Gross mining revenue + 6000 USD/monthElectric cost - 1500 USD/monthSafe industrial facility - 500 USD/monthAbout 4000 USD profit monthly (In Norway you dont pay taxes unless you sell bitcoin for fiat currency) Repayment plan: My initial offer is 2000 USD/month. 50% interest rate on the entire capital amount borrowed. Im aware of the rather slow repayment rate, which is maybe not that interesting for anyone looking for a get rich quick scheme of any kind. So propably Im more interested in garnering interest from someone who thinks long term and is willing to see it as an investment for some years ahead. Instead of making a quick buck with a few short months horizon. Realistically, with a 2 BTC loan we are looking at about a 3 years repayment plan. Also very interested in someone willing to partner and become a co owner together with me and sees potential in establishing a mining farm in a 0.02 USD/kwh location. Example:1 BTC borrowed, 1,5 returned. 2 BTC borrowed, 3 BTC returned. I have access to a smaller industrial facility with 50 amps, 240 volt breakers (Plentiful) with 0.02 USD/Kwh in a crypto friendly region in my country(Norway) with excess electricity in the power grid. Space would be enough for hosting up to 400 machines. If needed I can upgrade the breakers and electric system to handle the load needed if it exceeds the current one. So I am open to hosting older mining equipment that no longer is profitable in other areas in the world due to electricity costs as well. So if you have some, for example L3+ antminers, im open to hosting it as long as im given a cut of the mining profits. My first post, but trying to be as transparent as need be. Am aware that many scammers lurk these forums as well. For any interested party I will get on a video call and make a more detailed presentation. Best regards, Carl",

      "body": "As additional information. Long term Im looking to upscale. I have a friend who is interested in hosting s19 xp hydro miners in my facility. So thats an additional 20k USD worth of machines thats gonna generate some passive mining income. Im also looking on buying cheaper older Asic machines that are still profitable to run with 0.02 USD/kwh electric prices.",
