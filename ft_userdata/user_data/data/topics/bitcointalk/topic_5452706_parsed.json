They ask for sending mail to download@binance.com . i checked mail sender and found that mail sent from real Binance email. i mailed to this email provided and i got reply with Binance APPs link but i am confused that 1: Why they ask for installing from Playstore instead of contacting other email.2: Why they didn't give me link of Playstore or Apple instead of giving link looking scamBelow are the some proof. please check these below mail and what you think about, this is scamming attempt?",

This is for any domain at allFirst, I don't think it's Binance's practice to send download links by email. As I know, it's enough to visit their website and you will find download links.This third screenshot is particularly suspicious to me, the links look very risky. Also, why the Chinese language (or whatever)? Is that your speaking area?I would suggest you register your own Antiphishing code link There You will set a unique code, which must be included in every email you receive from Binance.Here's what their service email looks like that they sent me, maybe you can compare",

The scammers will lure you into installing their fake Binance app, which will steal your passwords and personal details if you do not deposit coins at their addresses. I'd love to see what they're up to this time. On top of that, one should never install any application that isn't downloaded through the Google Play Store, especially if it is related to financial services. Binance would never send such an email; I'd report it to their customer support if I were you.",

Be careful it seems like someone is trying to scam you with a phishing page. If unfortunately, you click on the link and download the app from the page, you'll get a malware in your device and that will give the access of your device and accounts to the hackers who are trying to social engineering tricks with you.You should open up the Binance app on your smartphone and see if there is any notification of installing the app or the app requires any kind of updating. If there isn't any notification then be sure the scammer has somehow got your email and will try again to scare you with such tricks.It's better to block the sender so that you won't receive any emails from it. And, also be sure to avoid any such mails to be safe from the social engineering tricks of those negative actors. Their main intention is to get access to your smartphone and your account and once they get the access they will withdraw all the funds without your noticing.",

You don't have to check where the email comes from. Because I can send you an email from the Official Binance email if I want to scam you or hack your device, this is email spoofing. You will receive an email from the same email address. But only experienced and advanced users will find the difference. Binance doesn't know if you are using an app that contains malware. Binance won't email a specific user, letting them know they are using an app that contains malware. If your Binance app contains malware, Your funds wouldn't be there. Moreover, Binance won't ask you to download the app from an unknown website. You have to update your app from the google play store or app store. They only send notification updates to the app through the Binance App. It was a scam attempt, for 100% sure. Just avoid those scammers and do not reply to the email again. BTW, Did you download the app from the link by any chance? If you did, Factory Reset your device as soon as possible. Change all credential information of your emails, social media, exchanges and other accounts.",

Because they are scammers and wanted to assure you that they are real Binance call contact support. Scammers always use this kind of tricks to decieve but we should not trust on it. In your case Hackers are using same email like Binance official and asking you to download APP which will lead to account hack because they there is possibility of malware in these apps to access all your galley or with this new Binance App they record all your login Â and fund passwords .

You don't email someone if you want them to download as you've got an app that's published on the app/play store.I used to receive email notifs from Binance and the first one always indicates \"do-not-reply@ses.binance.com\" or \"do-not-reply@post.binance.com\".",

I think This all happen because of this clone app because i didn't recieved any message in original account. I think thet Cloner app devolpers find my email and Password but they cannot withdraw funds without Fund password. This friend Binance have no fund and i think no need to change password this time because he are not using for trading purpose.",
