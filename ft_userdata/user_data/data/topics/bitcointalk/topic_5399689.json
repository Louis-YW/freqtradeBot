There is the need for a consumer friendly option to send small amounts without TX fees and also with a very low verification time (10 seconds maximum). If that does not happen then there is no way bitcoin is used daily. In my option the fact that you have to wait 30-40 min for verification is even more important than the fees.",

What you need to do is compare the fees to the existing payment networks and determine how the transaction fees stack up. If you look at things like Visa and Paypal, you are looking at a 3% ish fee and it does seem possible for Bitcoin to get below this at some point if the developers and network continue to make improvements. However I think the real obstacle to adoption, at least via individually controlled wallets, is going to be how long it takes for transactions to be processed. Nobody is going to want to wait around for a long time in a shop as transactions confirm, you can avoid this through an exchange like Coinbase, but then you're just relying on a third party again so might as well stick with existing providers outside of crypto.",

If you opt-out RBF, it's realistically impossible to double-spend. Only if you bribe a miner, you increase your chances of having it replaced by another transaction. For weekly transactions, wherein you pay $100 - $500 to the supermarket, it's fine to accept unconfirmed transactions. Even with 1 sat/vbyte, it's very improbably to not be confirmed within 2 weeks, which is the default time required to dump it from the mempool.",

Card transactions generally levy a fee of around 3% per transaction, which is far higher than what most bitcoin transactions charge. And yes, a customer handing you cash might not cost you anything right there, but at some point you need to get that cash in to your bank account. Forgetting for a second the direct costs of securely transferring large amounts of cash to a bank for it to be counted, then business bank accounts also charge a variety of fees including monthly fees, deposit fees, cash counting fees, transfer fees, and so on, depending on your country and the exact type of business account you have.Just because the consumer doesn't see the fees does not mean they aren't there and they aren't substantial. And the consumer ends up paying these fees, as reflected by higher prices on goods and services. In contrast, it is significantly cheaper all round paying 5 cents for a bitcoin transaction which is received directly in to the merchant's wallet and they can do whatever they want with it without getting hit by a bunch of third party fees.And let's not even touch on things like currency exchange fees or international transfer fees.",

I must have never given more than $1 in a transaction. Yes they can be accomplished with lighting if you are educated about it. Also many mobile wallets don't even support it. For the fee of 0.8 USD: Currently the network is not crowded at all, still the average fee per transaction is 0.5 USD. So maybe you don't pay that fee but you will also wait for a quiete long time or when the network is crowded can't get a confirmation at all. This is again a problem as you would have to wait for a few hours in a store to be able to leave with whatever you bought. For example the transaction to the address in my signature took several days to be confirmed with a fee of 288 sats and the current network load. And this is always considering your transaction is not based on many micro transactions like here https://mempool.space/de/tx/b2a01dc1111c2ff2b327774498bdd21dda29f5bc4a69c784bb96ef1ce9d37f0d where a fee of more then 600 USD had to be payed.",
