But nevertheless, this is not the main issue I wish to focus on in this thread, I just want to divert a little.Sometimes back when bitcoin price was that low ($16k) a few investors if not many felt discouraged with a flinching desire to sell in fears that the price might keep getting low and addition to the lies and negative rumors from bitcoin haters about bitcoin falling further low even to zero, these lies made many bitcoin holders to hurriedly sell even at a lost.QuoteWhen #Bitcoin’s market price was low, they wrote literally thousands of articles about our supposed losses.Now that #Bitcoin’s market price is way up, if we were to sell, we would make a profit of over 40% (just from the market purchases), and our main source of BTC is now our citizenship program.We won’t sell, or course; at the end 1 BTC = 1 BTC (this was true when the market price was low and it’s true now); but it’s very telling that the authors of those hit pieces, the “analysts”, the “experts”, the “journalists”, are totally silent nowsource1source2El Salvador President, Bukele was exempted, critics made a lot of noise in the media with many articles about El Salvador's bitcoin investment heading to a loss but the Salvadoran President didn't deter in his resolute not to sell but resolved to keep holding not listening to all the critics. Today El Salvador is 40% in profit  in their bitcoin investment as bitcoin price keeps rising, 40% when the halving has yet occured, and the next ATH not yet hit, how much more when it all does.I think all bitcoin investors needs to take a leaf and learn from Bukele's firmness and resolve to HODLing even under strong press, criticism from the so-called experts.  Today everyone is praising him for for holding firm. Remember this; bitcoin will always silent the critics, our role is to just hold patiently strong.",

This is an issue we need to pay attention to because each person will have a different situation, so we need to come up with a plan that suits our financial situation instead of following others. Just like CZ, he once took the risk of selling his assets to invest in bitcoin and we all know what he achieved. But that's not good financial advice, just because he sold his house and bought bitcoin and was successful doesn't mean we will be successful if we imitate his approach. Investing wisely is coming up with a plan that suits your situation, not imitating someone else's plan.",

Right. Bukele's using El Salvador's cash for that Bitcoin move. If you're barely making ends meet, don't go splurging on Bitcoin. It's cool to take cues from him but uou have to adapt it to your own situation. National strategies are one thing but if your wallet's looking thin, stick to the basics and save the crypto adventures for a more stable time. Prioritize keeping the lights on before diving into the Bitcoin rollercoaster",

That decision is now paying off and every international media house is covering the news. This is another great example struggling economically countries should take from El Salvador. Not only President Bukele is trying to improve the living standard of his citizens but is in the process of making his country crime free.

With these profits, they can work in so many other sectors of the country that needs development.It's a good thing and as always, a Bitcoiner should be on the idea of holding their coins for the long term. We can see how Bitcoin had skyrocketed past it's old Ath in just 2days. Which for many, I think it's surprising.

The president of El Salvador, Bukele, is now seen as a hero, because the asset that he invested his country's money in, is now yielding profit for them, so his critics are now quiet, I hope that other countries, corporations, companies and individuals, will learn something from this president and trust Bitcoin to be the asset that it's value will keep increasing and being more profitable in the future.",
