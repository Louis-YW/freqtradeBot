  "content": "The APIZ project offers a fresh take on the tokenization of existing production based on Tokenomics.Any business idea, regardless of its creativity, must, first of all, be based on the economic rationale for its own existence. Otherwise, even the most interesting project will be unable to compete in an already overcrowded market. As for APIZ, its foundation is well-documented and gives the stakeholders plenty of reasons to ponder over its implementation.Ideological mastermindsThe given article will consider a business project developed by Igor Ganya, a successful entrepreneur who’s been building his own business empire for 15 years. The empire encompassed agriculture, winemaking, restaurant business, crypto mining, business relations, etc. His like-minded partner, Daniil Moshko, is a prominent figure within the IT industry who began his career path at the dawn of the age of computer games. He is the creator and ideological mastermind of some truly innovative solutions in the fields of security, communication, data storage, as well as hardware solutions that play a key role in the given project.Together, Igor and Daniil drafted out a business plan to create the world's first \"industrial apiary,\" the next big thing in beekeeping. But first things first.Scientific basisHumanity has long since mastered such vital resources for the existence of civilization as oil, thanks to which we successfully cultivate a hundred and fifty different products - from fuel and plastic to medicines like Aspirin and Vaseline. However, oil is certainly not the only essential product for humans, the gifts of which can be cultivated with the proper approach.The honey produced by bees (along with the hive created by these extremely complex beings) can have as many benefits and meet a vast array of needs. Since honey keeps its useful properties, it can easily be sent to Mars with the first colonizers, which already indicates it features an amazing potential.Surprisingly, the bees have been studied by humanity by no more than a quarter. These are incredibly complex organisms, capable of transmitting highly accurate information to each other, producing honey, propolis, royal jelly, drone milk, and the most potent poison on the planet.Unfortunately, beekeeping stopped its development more than a century ago. The hive and the standard beekeeper's log, still used worldwide by almost all beekeepers, are still devoted to long-standing traditions, which negatively affects their effectiveness.Unique conceptThe APIZ project objective is to reform the beekeeping area and transform it into an industrial entity. To do this, you will need to combine the industrial potential, animal husbandry, the agricultural sector, IT technologies, and... Blockchain. Yes, you heard right - the creation of a hives system  production, logistics, maintenance, security, telemetry, and the provision of food supply in beekeeping involves the use of Blockchain to ensure transparency throughout the entire path of production of bee products.Tokenomics - fuel for advancementBlockchain can include absolutely all data - from volumes, geography, and logistics to climate info, production cycles, and consumption statistics. Streamlining and overseeing the implementation of the APIZ concept implies creating a system covering a million hives over a ten-year project lifecycle.What is Tokenomics? In fact, this is the tokenization of a living being. Specifically, in our case - a single bee. One bee is equal to one unique token. The average number of bees in a hive is 50,000. A simple mathematical calculation clarifies that the estimated number of tokens we release will subsequently reach 50 billion. Economic calculations show that the cost of one bee in the market is $0.01. And we are going to build our entire economy around this key figure.Attractive termsIt is important to realize that all the coins we release will be frozen at the first stage. The conditions for their defrosting will be specified in our contract. Part of the coins will be defrosted at the end of the beekeeping season (the end of each October). It also depends on the number of hives that our company will have at that time.Thus, those who invested in 50 thousand coins (one hive) will become the owners of a genuine virtual hive. This will be possible thanks to the VR system and the comprehensive telemetry of the hive. Moreover, an NFT hive will be available to investors in the future, and a profit of 7% is based on the average net profit per company hive paid in APIZ coins.The lucky investors of 2.5 million or more coins will become owners of virtual apiaries, each of which will be located in the region of their choice from the prototypes available for their locations. Such investors will receive an annual return of 10% based on the average net profit per company hive.Investment feasibilityConsidering the cost of one bee (0.01 dollars), the profit from one such unit during the year is 0.017 dollars.Our approach to beekeeping has already shown a much more impressive result of $0.025 per bee over the same reporting period. In this scenario, the figure of $0.15 of profit from each bee during the year can be achieved within a mere decade.Profit warrantees First of all, it should be considered that our project is not a start-up but a well-established business with existing production. The total investment already amounts to more than 6 million dollars, and the company's total value has successfully exceeded 25 million dollars. All this gives solid ground to be confident in the project's prospects, based on an already operating and profitable enterprise, which is one of the guarantees for the keeping and increase of funds invested in the project.All of the above allows us to guarantee a return on investment in our token in the amount of 110% within 18 months from the date of purchase. Based, of course, on its value at the time of purchase.Let's summarizeThe APIZ project is a unique opportunity to produce a symbiosis of cryptocurrency and real business with a financial background comparable only to the state’s gold and foreign exchange funds, which exclude any force majeure and cannot lead to the loss of invested funds.Tokenomics is the next big thing in doing business. APIZ is a dream project for any investor interested in raising their own capital in the shortest possible time!About APIZ:APIZ is the first world-class project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a factor as a living organism – a single bee unit, equated to one APIZ  token.Contacts:Websites: https://www.apiz.digital/http://www.ganeapi.com/ Social Media: https://twitter.com/apizcrypto https://instagram.com/apizcoin https://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/ https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.gg/EKHtwexchttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "APIZ – a new era of cutting-edge advancements in beekeeping APIZ and Xairo are using modern technological advancements to revolutionize beekeeping in many aspects.In beekeeping, apiary management is a thing that may only be handled right on the apiary location. Until recently, it was impossible to imagine a system that would help beekeepers monitor their hives remotely. Thanks to the joint efforts of Xairo and APIZ, remote apiary management is no longer a thing of sci-fi but an actual project with feasible results. Regardless of how large or small it may be, any apiary is highly susceptible to different bee diseases. Hence, the beekeeper's top priority is ensuring that their apiary is safe from these occurrences. Still, monitoring the apiaries is a challenge, and there is no unified system in place that would help beekeepers to manage the task properly. Two types of diseases affects the bees - non-contagious and contagious. Non-contagious are much less dangerous, as they are not transmitted from one bee to another. The causes of such diseases, as a rule, can be improper care, unacceptable living conditions, and even lack of food. Identifying and eliminating the cause that triggered the disease is crucial before beginning the treatment process.With infectious diseases, things are more complicated since the cause of such conditions is the pathogen. They are divided into invasive and infectious. The former can be provoked by organisms of animal origin (helminths, mites, etc.), while the latter are caused by plant microorganisms (fungi, viruses). Carriers of infectious diseases are wasps, ants, ticks, and other insects.To avoid the undesirable consequences and economic damage that bee diseases can entail, it is recommended to pay as much attention as possible to your apiary in order to prevent the spread of diseases in the first place. It is imperative to keep several strong bee families in one apiary throughout the year, monitor the cleanliness of the hives, replace old queens on time, and regularly monitor the bees' behavior to take appropriate urgent measures if necessary.There is also the issue of outdated beekeeping practices. Did you know that the famous beekeeper's journal is a century-old invention that's never been refined or altered in any practical way? Sure enough, it affects the various beekeeping practices somewhat negatively, to say the least. Seeing how bees are 100% self-sustainable, it is no wonder that the main objective of the beekeepers is to monitor their activities in hopes of preventing any diseases from spreading across the apiaries. Bees require no intervention in their business, but they do need to be monitored closely, and that's what the APIZ project is mostly about. The endgame of the project is to deliver a unified solution for all beekeepers to use. It would incorporate all matters of logistics, maintenance, security, supply provision, etc., for all existent apiaries. Above all else, APIZ is going to initiate the advanced telemetry system that takes apiary management from physical to digital, making beekeeping more efficient, advanced, and reliable in the process. Blockchain is required to ensure secure data transmission. Thus, we’ll get all the adequate data that won’t be somehow meddled. Subsequently, we’ll share our systems with the beekeepers worldwide.About APIZ:APIZ is the first world-class project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a factor as a living organism – a single bee unit, equated to one APIZ token.Contacts:Websites: https://www.apiz.digital/http://www.ganeapi.com/ Social Media: https://twitter.com/apizcrypto  https://instagram.com/apizcoin https://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/ https://discord.gg/EKHtwexchttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/https://t.me/ApizDigital",

      "body": "APIZ Crypto - a fool-proof token based on actual businessJune 16, 2022 - APIZ provides a unique opportunity to become involved in innovative achievements in the field of crypto business.The bee is one of our planet's most complex and little-studied organisms. Despite all the knowledge and progressive technologies of our time, it is worth recognizing that humanity cannot survive without bees and other pollinators. Bees are amazing, complex creatures that produce many useful products: honey, propolis, royal jelly, as well as the most concentrated poison.Unfortunately, beekeeping development has stagnated for more than a hundred years. To date, the standard beekeeper's journal, just like the beehive, developed in the last century, is used by 90% of beekeepers. And though there are a lot of beekeeping systems, no single methodology would streamline the entire industry and take it to a new stage of development. Naturally, with such technologies, it is impossible to reach the industrial goals of beekeeping.The goal of the APIZ project was to completely transform the beekeeping industry and bring it to a new industrial stage. And this became possible thanks to the combination of new technologies and opportunities from several important industries, including the agricultural sector, animal husbandry, IT technologies, and Blockchain.APIZ conceptBlockchain plays a key role in ensuring maximum transparency of the entire life process of a bee and eliminates any possibility of product falsification. Blockchain is indispensable in creating the necessary conditions, beehives, telemetry, security, and providing forage. This unique tool combines all the data regarding geography, logistics, production cycles, climate indicators, and consumption statistics. The introduction of a single universal system that allows you to organize all the necessary information and exercise control means the realization of the possibility of creating a system that includes a million hives over a ten-year cycle.Our project is a symbiosis of the main activity of beekeeping and high-precision modern technologies. Since the APIZ project is not a start-up, our enterprise is already profitable today, and the amount of investment in production is more than 6,000,000 dollars. 70% of the funds we're planning to issue will be invested in our existing products, making it possible to receive a stable, sustainable profit. These facts speak for themselves and guarantee the safety of invested funds in any scenario.Let's take a closer look at what tokenomics is. It is safe to say that we are pioneers in this field. APIZ is the only project in the world that has tokenized a living organism, namely a bee. A bee is equal to one unique APIZ token.Let's move on to mathematical calculations for greater clarity and understanding. On average, 50 thousand bees live in one hive, and when creating a system consisting of a million such hives, we will be able to issue 50 billion original tokens.Today, in beekeeping, the cost of one bee is estimated at $0.01, and the annual profit is about $0.017. These numbers are more than decent, right? However, from the start of our project to the present day, we have achieved impressive results in a relatively short period of time. We have already managed to increase the annual profit per bee to $0.025. And after a ten-year cycle, we will approach the figure of 0.15 dollars. Considering the time to adapt to the industry and the funds spent, it can be said with confidence that the project successfully copes with the tasks at hand.In order not to be unfounded, we will demonstrate several examples of our fruitful activities:1. By replacing century-old wooden hives with eco-friendly food-grade polyester hives, we increased thermal insulation by 300%, reduced honey consumption in the off-season by 50%, and reduced the mortality of bee colonies by 60%.2. Using an innovative remote control system for the apiary - telemetry - we minimized human participation in the process of organizing the life of a bee, which made it possible to reduce the number of attendants.3. Due to the use of trucks instead of small-sized private cars in which beekeepers transport their hives, logistics costs have become 15 times cheaper.Our termsIt is obvious that each stage of production goes through a deep analysis to determine the most effective and least expensive approach. With our enterprise value of $25 million, we can firmly state that investing in our crypto project promises only an increase in your funds without any risks and losses. Based on the fact that the cycle of beekeeping is a full year, investments are instantly frozen and directed to marketing projects, technological solutions, and ensuring the life of bee colonies. Funds are unfrozen after a full cycle from the moment of investment. Detailed conditions for their unlocking are outlined in the contract. After analyzing all the data, we are guaranteed to be able to provide a return on investment in the token in the amount of 110% within 1.5 years, based on its initial value.Investors of 50 thousand crypto coins (one hive) become owners of a virtual hive. All this is possible thanks to VR technologies and volumetric telemetry of the hive. Technologies are evolving. Therefore, in the near future, NFT hives and an annual profit of 7% (in APIZ crypto) will be available to investors based on the calculation of income from one hive.Investors who purchase 2.5 million tokens or more will receive a 10% return profit and be able to choose the location of the VR hives from the available prototypes.ConclusionOur project is the only one of its kind and has no analogs. And it would seem difficult to entrust your savings to a newly developing business. But we are not selling you air, as our project is based on real established production and the latest technologies. The world around us is constantly changing and adapting to modern realities. Technologies come to a person's aid in everything from domestic improvement to industrial-scale tasks. We are laying the bridge that will help people make a smooth transition from the livestock industry and agriculture to the world of modern opportunities and solutions - the world of crypto.About APIZ:APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://www.apiz.digital/http://www.ganeapi.com/ Social Media: https://twitter.com/apizcrypto  https://instagram.com/apizcoin https://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/ https://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/https://t.me/ApizDigital",

      "body": "Beekeeping merged with blockchain is not a myth, it's Apiz27 June 2022 - Did you know that beekeeping relates to the livestock sector, just like the breeding of cows, chickens and sheep? We were real pioneers in this field when we decided to tokenize our apiary farm. The Apiz project combines the agricultural sector and the crypto-world, providing a unique opportunity to jointly develop agriculture and the rapid application of multiple innovative technologies in a new field. No one has even thought that agribusiness can use the blockchain, and the blockchain itself can be applied to honey production, beekeeping, and melliferous plant cultivation. But, one thing at a time.Scientific conceptualizationThe foundation of any business is an idea, but merely an idea is not enough for building a booming business with a long-term perspective. It’s necessary to take into account the financial framework. This is particularly relevant nowadays, considering a highly competitive market. We can safely say that our financial analysts carefully drafted the Apiz project. Hence, stakeholders can get familiar with the key ideas of our project.The main idea was to reform the field of beekeeping completely and, with the help of the knowledge and technologies available today, reach an industrial level of doing business.To date, humanity has mastered many vital resources. The most striking example is oil, from which literally everything from plastic to Aspirin is made. But many other equally useful products can and should be used for the greater good.Honey is a unique and genuinely valuable product, rich in vitamins and minerals, which don’t lose its nutrients. But honey is not the only product made by amazing and complex organisms - bees. They produce royal jelly, drone jelly, the notorious propolis, and the most concentrated poison in the world.Revitalizing the beekeeping industrySince the beekeeping development ceased over a century ago, it is now far from being as effective. But thanks to the combination of such key fields as the agricultural sector, animal husbandry, industry, IT technologies, and blockchain, beekeeping can reach a new level on an industrial scale. Entire systems of hive production, the provision of food supply, logistics, security, creating the necessary conditions, and telemetry are based on the blockchain. This will ensure 100% transparency of all beekeeping processes.A blockchain is a versatile tool for geographical, climatic, and statistical data. It will help us streamline and control a system with a million hives over a ten-year project cycle.Tokenomics – investing in sustainable beekeepingSo, we tokenized the bee, and it has the value of one original Apiz crypto coin. On average, there are 50 thousand bees in one hive; thus, we can make a simple math calculation. If there are a million of such hives, we will release 50 billion tokens. One bee in the market is equal to $0.01. We’ve used this figure as the basis on which all further economic calculations were made.Let's talk a little bit about the attractive conditions of our project. At the initial stage, all invested funds will be frozen and used for marketing projects, technological solutions, and beekeeping. The financial statements based on the number of hives will be submitted at the end of the season. Unfrozen crypto coins will be calculated according to the formula for the number of bee colonies  * 50 thousand.Lucky owners of 50 thousand coins or more will be able to stake, which will further help them become holders of VR hives. Such investors will access the telemetry of a real hive that we have on our balance sheet. But that's not all. In the future, these investors will usher in a new era of technology and get an NFT hive, bringing 7% profit per year. Payouts will be made in Apiz tokens.Owners of 2.5 million hives will be able to choose the location of the virtual apiary prototype, as well as extra bonuses, such as a personal visit to the location, the apiary monitoring, and the ability to dispose freely of what they produce. Their profit will reach 10%.The Apiz project is not a startup; it is a unique branch of our well-established business. The world outside is continuously changing, and technology is developing faster every year, and we cannot stand aside. This project is a transitional bridge from the world of livestock and agriculture to the new progressive world, which will skyrocket soon enough. This is the perfect combination of real business and cryptocurrency.About Apiz:Apiz is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one Apiz token.Websites: https://www.apiz.digital/http://www.ganeapi.com/ Social Media: https://twitter.com/apizcrypto  https://instagram.com/apizcoin https://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/ https://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/https://t.me/ApizDigital",

      "body": "We know for sure how to improve beekeeping01 July 2022 – APIZ is exploring the effectiveness of a bee, intending to tokenize it in the nearest future.Have you ever wondered if a single bee can be efficient as ten bees? Is it possible to milk a cow 10 times a day? Can one chicken lay 10 times more eggs? Is it possible to shear 10 times more wool from a sheep? I think your answer is no. But we assure you that it is quite possible. And our project will vividly illustrate that a 10-fold efficiency increase in the agricultural sector and animal husbandry field can be achieved shortly. Using the example of our apiary, we will prove that a single bee can bring 1000% more profit over 10 years. All this has only been possible thanks to the blockchain system integration into animal husbandry and agriculture. We shall let you consider this idea to prove our point. What is our idea based on?The bee is the world's most logical organism, which has only been studied by 25%. These busy creatures are full of mysteries. We don't know exactly how a bee keeps finding out a flower several kilometers away from the hive and then transmits highly accurate data about its location to another bee. How do these tiny complex creatures weighing 100 mg are capable of producing honey from various raw materials (rich in vitamins and minerals), propolis (the most powerful natural immunostimulant), drone jelly (some hormones can turn a bee into a drone), royal jelly (consists of another set of hormones turning a bee into a queen bee) and the most potent natural poison.Unfortunately, the development of beekeeping stopped around a century ago. So did the outdated beehives and the beekeeper's journal created over 100 years are used. The whole world continues to skyrocket, and the progress simply can't be stopped, but such stagnation can lead beekeeping to decline. Not to mention the fact that the effectiveness decreases considerably when a beekeeper has more than 30 hives.We have combined the advanced capabilities and knowledge available today in our project. The result is a symbiosis of such key fields as industry, the agricultural sector, animal husbandry, IT technologies, and Blockchain. On this basis, we have created a unique approach for creating the world's first industrial-scale apiary.Our goals and objectivesSince the bee is a self-sufficient unit, it can successfully adapt its vital activity with minimal human impact. A human can only provide a comfortable environment for it to ensure productive activity.That's why we set ourselves the goal of creating a hive system, providing feed, logistics, security, and telemetry (a hive remote control system).The following objectives are also important:1.   Ensure full transparency of all bee products production processes based on blockchain technologies, such as all key data from volumes to consumption statistics.2.   Increase the honey consumption ratio at the cost of enhancing productive capacity.3.   Replace mass consumption of sugar with honey in the long run.EconomyThe APIZ project is based on a ten-year strategic plan, which implies the creation of an industrial apiary with 1 million hives. Have you heard about tokenization before? We are pioneers in a particular life-form tokenization, equal to one unique APIZ token. If we consider that there are 50 thousand bees in one hive, then the total number of released crypto coins will be 50 billion.It is worth mentioning that our project guarantees the increase and security of your funds. The rationale is that the online business is a branch of our offline project. 70% of the funds directed into our token are invested in the beekeeping development, and the other 30% - in the development of blockchain-based crypto business. Nothing will affect our main beekeeping business even under any unforeseen circumstances (the fall of cryptocurrency). Investors won't suffer financial losses in any scenario, as they are guaranteed to get a profit of 10% of each coin's original value.The token is growing in value due to the developing beekeeping. The market value of a bee is $0.01, and the annual profit is $0.017. These figures show that beekeeping is a fairly profitable business.However, we are able to achieve a much more impressive result thanks to a unified approach and technologies. Right now, in our business, the annual profit from one bee is $0.025. Based on our calculations, in 10 years, we will reach $0.15.Our project is the best way to connect the familiar and established world of beekeeping with innovative technologies and opportunities. It is a unique symbiosis of the crypto-world and a thriving business, which gives us firm guarantees of success and motivation to continue to invest and reap the rewards. APIZ is your guarantor of successful investment and prosperity.About APIZ:APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://www.apiz.digital/http://www.ganeapi.com/ Social Media: https://twitter.com/apizcrypto https://instagram.com/apizcoin https://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/ https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.gg/EKHtwexchttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

This means that it includes every facet of the beekeeping industry: from the hive, the creation of queen bees, the beekeeper's journal, logistics, and security to processing, packaging, and selling honey.    We implement a control system that allows you to control the entire process of honey-making - from bees to selected users, which is the best indicator of the purity and value of the product. But first things first.The ideological masterminds of the projectSurprisingly, the APIZ project was founded by people involved in business, import and export, industrial production, marketing, security, and even IT technology. These people have never practiced beekeeping. Perhaps it is precisely because of this that the beginning of a new era in beekeeping takes place.Igor Ganya started his entrepreneurial journey 15 years ago in China. To date, the branches of his companies are actively developing in the large restaurant business, winemaking, agriculture, crypto mining, and business relations.Daniil Moshko is the owner of an IT company that employs nearly a hundred young and talented professionals. Daniil decided to dedicate himself to the development of software and hardware solutions, which plays an important role in our project.Our conceptThe success of any business depends on efficiency. When developing our project, we considered many important components that are inextricably linked, but at the same time opposite, if we touch on the issue of their development:1. The bee, without exaggeration, is the most complex and logical creature. Bees combine impressive capacities in producing useful products: honey, wax, propolis, and royal jelly. With a mass of 100 mg, these fragile beings are excellent builders and protectors.2. Beekeeping stagnated in its development about a century ago. 90% of beekeepers still use the outdated beekeeper's journal. It should be considered that its effectiveness is sharply reduced in the presence of more than 30 hives.Relying on the above facts, we decided to create our system to improve the efficiency of beekeeping and bring it to a new industrial stage. For this, we used the technologies available to mankind today: animal husbandry, industrial findings, the agricultural sector, IT technologies, and Blockchain.Financial backgroundBlockchain collects all the necessary data - from geography, logistics, and volume to production cycles, climate data, and consumption statistics. And this means creating an entire industrial system comprising a million hives over a ten-year cycle.Bee tokenization is a key part of our project. The math is simple. One bee equates to one APIZ token. The number of bees in one hive equates to around 50 thousand. A network of one million hives would then sum up to 50 billion issued tokens. The APIZ project guarantees not only the safety but also the growth of your investments. This is quite justified due to the fact that our online business is inextricably linked with offline production. 70% of all investments are directed to the development of beekeeping. It means that even if the crypto market falls, the main investments will not be affected. In any case, our investors are guaranteed to receive a 10% profit from each coin from its original value.In general, beekeeping is a profitable business, as the cost of one bee is around $0.01, and the yearly profit is $0.017. This is in the presence of outdated technologies.But we have already achieved better results today. We've managed to reach an annual profit of $0.025. According to our calculations, in 10 years, we will have reached $0.15! Our project is not just a great investment – it's also an incredible tool that's bound to revolutionize beekeeping as we know it!About the company: APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

A striking example of this is that the beekeeper's journal for reporting on the condition of bee colonies was created more than 100 years ago and has never been updated since those times immemorial. This is quite acceptable for an apiary with a volume of 20-30 hives. But if a beekeeper creates an apiary, including 100 or more hives, here we are talking about industrial scale, then this will destroy him as an entrepreneur. That is why we decided to create an accounting system - the first blockchain-based beekeeper's electronic journal, which will not only be a communication tool but will also provide analytics, reporting, and information management system, which will make our apiary even more efficient.Basic goalsWe know very little about the bee since it has only been studied by 25%. However, these highly organized complex organisms did an excellent job of organizing life processes for hundreds of years without human intervention. If we analyze beekeeping, it becomes clear that, in fact, this is the kind of deal that a person concludes with a bee family. Man, for his part, provides comfortable conditions in the form of hives and feed. In exchange for this, the bee allows us to use the products produced. Thus, the intervention of the beekeeper can and should be minimized since it is unnecessary. This is our main goal.We also have secondary tasks that need to be addressed:1. Ensure transparency of the honey-making path from the bee to the end consumer. Thanks to our blockchain-based beekeeper journal, we will get all the necessary analytical and statistical data. Blockchain is a unique tool that combines geography, volumes, logistics, climate data, quality assurance, and consumption statistics. This will make the entire production process as transparent as possible.2. Increase honey consumption due to the rejection of sugar in favor of honey. The daily norm of honey should be at least 50 grams, but statistics show that only 3% of the norm is consumed. Unfortunately, today the production capacity is not enough to provide the required volumes. When using our methodology, it is realistic to increase the use of this useful product by 15-20 times.Tokenomics - a window to the futureThe APIZ business project is based on a ten-year development plan. First of all, we plan to create a system of 1 million hives. Have you ever heard of tokenization? We are pioneers in the field of tokenization of a living creature. In our case, this is a bee. One bee is equal to one APIZ token. If we take as a basis that there are 50 thousand bees in one hive, then the total number of issued tokens will be 50 billion. Based on today's economic realities, the market value of a bee is $0.01. It is on this key figure that we will build the further economics of the entire project.In modern realities, where circumstances are changing at lightning speed, the issue of the safety of investments in our project will be very relevant. Due to the fact that 70% of the investments from the sale of tokens are mastered by the main offline beekeeping project, all risks are minimized. And the value of the token grows in proportion to the development of beekeeping. Figures of $0.01 per bee and an annual profit of $0.017 allow us to state with confidence that beekeeping is a very profitable business.We have already managed to increase the efficiency of beekeeping today due to the fact that:1. Instead of outdated wooden hives, we have developed our own beehive systems made of sustainable polystyrene. This allows us to increase thermal insulation by 300%, thereby reducing honey consumption by 50% and reducing the mortality of bees by 60%.2. Thanks to telemetry, a remote control system for hives, and an electronic journal, a beekeeper can serve up to 200 hives, with today's norm of 100 hives. This allows us to significantly reduce the cost of the wage fund.3. By replacing small-sized personal vehicles with high-capacity trucks, we can save 15 times more when transporting beehives.Only in these few examples does it become clear that specialists carefully analyze each step of our production to reach a new efficiency level. Today, we have an annual profit of $0.025 per bee, and in the future, we strive to get closer to $0.15.About the company: APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.gg/EKHtwexchttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "Do we know what we eat?07 July 2022 - APIZ implemented a blockchain system in beekeeping, guaranteeing full transparency of honey production.It's no secret that any product is made from high-quality raw materials to achieve maximum competitiveness. Many companies are willing to shrink in quality just to stay on the shelves. This problem will not lose its relevance for the consumer until all supply chains of each company become absolutely transparent. Thanks to the blockchain system, we have found a way to solve this problem of beekeeping by tracking every step of production, from building the hive to the packaging of products and the appearance on the store shelf as much as possible. Only in this way, each buyer of our products will be sure that thanks to the scan of the QR code, he will be able to see the entire honey production path from such details as the size of the bee, bee colonies, weather conditions under which it was collected, delivery times, date and packaging conditions and even the moment of sale. Thus, our product will gain consumer confidence and convince our dear customers that they are consuming a truly natural and healthy product.APIZ SolutionsA bee is an amazingly complex and, at the same time, intelligent creature weighing 100 mg, able to equip and organize its activities without outside help. After all, bees have been working autonomously for thousands of years, even before human intervention. That is why we decided to create an industrial cycle apiary, minimizing the human factor and increasing efficiency. This is our key task.In fact, bee colonies need to be provided with comfortable conditions for continuous work activity in order to get more honey rich in vitamins and minerals.Since the development of beekeeping stopped 100 years ago, and obsolete beekeeper logs and beehives are still used today, we came up with the idea of creating our own unique system based on innovative technologies available today in the field of animal husbandry, IT, and of course, Blockchain.Blockchain answered our main request - to make honey production as transparent as possible. This is justified by the fact that the Blockchain contains absolutely all data - from volumes, geography, logistics, and climate data to production cycles, consumption statistics, and quality control. This will guarantee the quality of our product and will not let you doubt the naturalness. Another task of the APIZ project will be solved thanks to the Blockchain.Perhaps the longest-term goal will be to increase the consumption of honey and phase out sugar in favor of honey, as well as equalize the price of these two products. Solving this problem can help prevent cardiovascular disease and excess weight.Principles of TokenomicsThe ten-year development plan is the cornerstone of our project. We aim to create a system of 1 million hives. We were also the first to tokenize a living unit, in our case a bee, which is equal to one APIZ coin. Based on the calculation that there are 50 thousand bees in one hive, we will create 50 billion tokens in the future. All coins will be frozen at the time of release, and detailed instructions for unfreezing them will be described in the contract. Lucky holders of 50,000 tokens will be able to stake to form their real virtual hive. Investors will have a unique opportunity to monitor their hive thanks to telemetry remotely, and in the future, the NFT format will be available. Regarding the financial component: a guaranteed profit of 7% of the average income from one hive.Owners of 2,500,000 crypto coins will receive advanced options: choosing the region where the hive is located, visiting the apiary for familiarization, the ability to dispose of some products, and viewing the hive using VR. This category of investors will profit 10% from one hive of the company.About the company: APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.gg/EKHtwexchttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "Technologies for health18 July 2022 - APIZ has developed telemetry – a futuristic tech stack.How would you react if you learned about a system detecting the likelihood of developing cancer in advance? What would you say if you could detect the onset of diabetes early and prevent the transition to a more complex stage?Today in beekeeping, people learn about diseases only after the fact, often in a critical situation when almost all bees are already infected and are carriers. Thanks to our telemetry system based on the blockchain method, we can predict bee diseases at the earliest stage of development, literally in the first days of manifestation. Thanks to the artificial intelligence system, we will study each case individually, and within a few years, we will completely eradicate the most complex diseases that occur under adverse conditions.Bees can \"talk\" to each otherIn a bee hive, the organization is clear and wise. It contains the experience of many millennia of evolution. But this is unthinkable without the relationship and coordination of actions between individual members of the bee family. What is bee language, if it exists at all? The answer to this question is sought in the laboratory of bioacoustics.It is important to hear what is going on inside each hive. Sound helps us determine the state and mood of a particular family. Compiling sound charts throughout the day allows you to analyze the family's condition. For additional assistance, you can connect AI (artificial intelligence). Having collected the database and distributed it on the shelves, we can teach AI to process our diagrams. In this case, weight, temperature, and humidity play an important role. It is with all this that telemetry will help us.Blockchain reformsAccording to statistics, 90% of beekeepers use the beehives and beekeeper's journal that they used about a century ago. While the world was moving forward with leaps and bounds, bright minds came up with new technologies and found non-standard solutions, but beekeeping remained unchanged. But we decided to fix it. Today there is no specialized institute for studying this most logical creature on the planet. Therefore, many theories and methods of beekeeping do not contribute to the sector's development.The APIZ project was created in order to create a single unified system based on existing knowledge and technology in the industry, livestock, agriculture, IT, and blockchain.It is quite obvious that, provided that the old hives and logs are used, the beekeeper can serve no more than 30 hives effectively. It also becomes more difficult to observe and care for the apiary. However, introducing telemetry, the latest remote monitoring system that minimizes human involvement in the production process, will solve this problem. Artificial intelligence will make it possible to inspect the hives better and thus keep them clean, observing the behavior of bees to prevent diseases.The telemetry is based on the blockchain, which includes all the necessary data, including consumption quantities, production steps, quality control, climate data, logistics, location, and production volumes. The use of blockchain can once and for all solve the problem of transparency. With the help of a QR code, all data will be available, which means that buyers will have no doubts about the quality of the product.About the company: APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "APIZ guarantees transparency in honey productionJuly 21, 2022 - \"Ganea Api\" has developed the world's first full-cycle industrial apiary based on the blockchain.Why do we need full production cycles, and how will blockchain be useful here? Every time we purchase a product, we are, in fact, buying its manufacturer. The manufacturer can either independently manufacture goods or accept supplies from another company, only gluing his company logo on the container. The enterprise can also autonomously produce some part of its goods but buy a large batch from other persons.Why APIZ can be trusted?What is the risk? Of course, this can create big problems for the manufacturer himself. Without controlling all production processes, you cannot always be responsible for the quality of products because you depend on how well other contractors perform their work. Without managing all production processes, you cannot always provide the enterprise with the necessary volume because, at any moment, another company performing a particular function can switch to another client offering more favorable financial conditions.Only if all production cycles are followed can you guarantee the best quality of the product. You can guarantee 100% volume control. You can guarantee the minimum cost of the product, which subsequently affects the market competitiveness.We have developed a unique industrial apiaries system that covers all cycles. This means that we produce hives, are engaged in breeding bees, and in logistics, protection, and training beekeepers. We ourselves are implementing a blockchain system that will fully control all processes and indicate to us failures or changes in the external environment that may affect the collection of honey. We pack and sell honey ourselves. After all, this is the only way we can be sure that we will give the best product to the client. We will give it as soon as possible and exactly in the volume in which it is required.Fresh conceptOur project has set itself the goal of carrying out cardinal reforms in the field of beekeeping and bringing this industry to a new industrial level. In order to increase production, we had to abandon the outdated methods still used in beekeeping today for lack of alternatives.We have replaced ordinary wooden hives with our own system of smart hives made from eco-material. This significantly reduced the mortality of bees and the consumption of honey.We have also introduced a new data accounting system - a beekeeper's electronic journal on the blockchain, with the help of which we will receive all the necessary statistical data and be able to manage the system. This will make beekeeping a much more efficient industry, as the beekeeper will be able to manage an apiary of more than 100 hives. And here we can safely talk about industrial scale.Our universal approach is based on the blockchain, which was implemented to clarify all stages of product production. The blockchain stores the following information:1. Climate data;2. Logistic data;3. Geographic data;4. Consumption statistics;5. Production cycles.And the buyer can get all this information by scanning a QR code on a jar of honey. Everything is transparent and without deception.In the long term, this approach will certainly affect the increase in the use of honey and, as a result, the gradual elimination of sugar. In today's realities of the mass market, customer confidence is a rather rare phenomenon. If the buyer is provided with all the data about the product, the issue of trust will be resolved.About the company: APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "Team of professionals25 July 2022 - the APIZ team has developed a unique concept for creating an industrial apiaryAbsolutely all departments consist of experts who have been performing their professional duties with high quality for more than a year. For some of them, this is not enough, and then they decide to try themselves in a new interesting field.The crypto sphere is a fairly young but no less promising direction. We all perfectly understand that even 10 years ago, 99% of all those involved in this area today did not even imagine that they would wake up every morning and follow the bitcoin rate, that hundreds of new projects would be shoveled every day, while simultaneously studying the development of completed ones. Rejoice in successes and sometimes be disappointed in failures.But, one way or another, today, our team supports the development of crypto coins and the development of the blockchain system. Looking back, it wasn't easy to imagine that our team would actively promote the development of blockchain technology and cryptosystems, having already reached heights in certain areas.Why is the project self-sufficient today from any angle? Our team consists of people whose IT projects have been vital for large corporations and state-owned companies for decades. Our team consists of people who were engaged in marketing in the period when Bitcoin first saw the light of day. Our team consists of people who know how to create strong teams. And among them, there will definitely be specialists who know how to sell; specialists who perfectly understand what it means to work 24 hours a day and at the same time achieve success in various industries.We are a team of professionals from different fields. We are confident that our project will be self-sufficient, that our project will be successful, and that our project will fulfill absolutely all the tasks set. And all this is possible because each of us is passionate about this project, confident, and gives our all to its completion!The ideological inspirers of the projectAny team, even the coolest specialists, needs competent leadership. The originators of the APIZ project are Igor Ganea and Daniil Moshko, thanks to whom we have already achieved good results. But we are not going to stop there.This project aims to reform the beekeeping industry and expand this area to achieve industrial scale through a unique blockchain-based APIZ development approach. Curiously, project managers are people who are people without any actual knowledge of beekeeping. Where did it all begin?The head of the project, Igor Ganea, began his professional career 15 years ago in China with a modest budget of $5,000. Today he is a successful businessman with branches of companies in more than 10 countries in various fields - from the restaurant business to crypto mining.Daniil Moshko delighted gamers by setting up game servers at the dawn of computerization. Today Daniil owns his own IT company, providing jobs for talented professionals focused on solving software and hardware problems.Why are reforms needed?One of the key patterns of successful business development is to keep up with rapidly developing technologies. However, the beekeeping industry is frozen in time and has not changed over the past 100 years.We solved this problem by creating our own beehives with a remote telemetry control system and blockchain-based beekeeper electronic journals. In other words, we used the latest advances in science in the field of animal husbandry, the agricultural sector, information technology, and blockchain, achieving a synergy effect.By minimizing human intervention in the honey production process as much as possible, thanks to the telemetry and blockchain that we used in our developments, we will be able to bring beekeeping to an industrial level. Now the beekeeper will be able to serve two hundred hives instead of a hundred. This will significantly reduce costs and positively affect the efficiency of the industry development.Blockchain incorporates all data from geography to quality control at all stages of production. This means that the product will become transparent, and the buyer can get all the product information through the QR code. In the long term, this may lead to an increase in the mass consumption of honey.Our main objectives of the ten-year development plan include creating a system of 1 million hives and the tokenization of the bee. The cost of a bee will be valued at one APIZ crypto-coin. At the same time, investors will be insured since 70% of all investments will be used by beekeeping, and only the remaining 30% will be directed to developing a crypto project.About the company: APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.gg/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "A unique roadmap28 July 2022 - APIZ has developed a blockchain-based roadmap.APIZ created the first roadmap in history, including a collaboration of blockchain, electronics (based on which we develop telemetry), agriculture, and animal husbandry. The Roadmap (RM) of the APIZ project differs greatly from other business strategy development maps. If the basic crypto projects are focused only on moving in one direction, then we have four. It is noteworthy that each of these areas is a self-sufficient project. In our RM, we want to demonstrate the development in all details visually. That is why the RM of the project consists of four linear 10-year plans, each of which complements the other, creating a synergy effect. Only achieving results for each of the plans will solve the main task - increasing the efficiency of one bee by 10 times.Fundamental tasksIt is hard even to imagine how complex the body of a bee is. It would seem that it is a tiny creature weighing only 100 mg but fraught with so many mysteries that humanity is still trying to figure them all out. The bee has been studied only by 25%, and so far, not a single institute for studying the bee has been created. A bee can be considered the most logical organism, since it can function fruitfully on its own and does not require constant human intervention. All that is needed is the creation of favorable conditions, namely the provision of hives and food.APIZ is developing a whole system of modern hives with an implemented remote control system (telemetry), equipping the forage base, solving logistics issues, security, and other aspects of keeping the apiary.Since beekeeping has long stopped its development, reforms in this industry have become the basis of the APIZ RM project. To create the most effective mechanism to help the beekeeping industry enter a new industrial stage, we have combined the available knowledge in the agricultural sector, animal husbandry, and information technology.Blockchain implementation has become the cornerstone of our revolutionary project. Blockchain is easily able to solve one of the tasks set - to ensure 100% transparency of honey production at all stages. This is the only way to earn the trust of the buyer.Our tasks are inextricably linked. So, by making the process of making honey as transparent as possible, it will be much easier to increase the consumption of honey. The longest-term goal will be to make honey the number one food and replace sugar with honey entirely.Crypto projectThe APIZ project is built on a 10 year development plan. Let us explain our plans for the next decade. Firstly, thanks to innovative technologies and a unique approach, we will create an industrial-scale apiary consisting of 1,000,000 beehives. But that's not all. We will tokenize a bee and equate it to one APIZ crypto coin. With a simple mathematical calculation, we can calculate that upon reaching the industrial turn of the apiary, we will issue 50,000,000,000 tokens.All detailed conditions for our investors will be specified in the contract. Investments will be guaranteed to be protected from crypto market fluctuations and other external factors. This is possible because 70% of all investments will be directed to improving the development of beekeeping. Accordingly, the value of the token will only grow in proportion to the development of the core business.Now let's move on to the numbers. Today, the value of a bee on the market is estimated at $0.01, and the annual income is $0.017. These figures are based on the traditional beekeeping approach with conventional wooden hives and a standard beekeeper's journal.With our progressive methods, we have already managed to reach an annual income of $0.025 per bee today. According to our calculations, in 10 years we will reach a profit of $0.15 per year. Quite an impressive difference, isn't it?Bee with APIZ!APIZ is the first global project that has set itself the task of tokenizing such a living organism – an actual bee, equated to one APIZ token.Websites: https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://www.reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/",

      "body": "APIZ project created its first telemetry-based hive modelAugust 4, 2022 - The APIZ project has created its first telemetry-enabled hive model designed to improve the productivity and efficiency of beehives and industrial apiaries.Hive telemetry is a system that allows keeping tracking of all the data related to bee lifecycle and activity without examining every frame since ii is stressful for everyone involved - bees and keeper as well. The telemetry system receives the entire data on bee's health and productivity, the environmental impact, and feedback on any particular modifications. For example, changes in a hive weight could indicate one of the following problems: -   the beginning or the end of the nectar harvesting season -   the honey extensions are full -   you need to start feeding bees with syrup to get them through to the spring, -   swarming or robbing occurs -   decreased activity in colony strength and productivity. Also, it is very important to keep a certain temperature and humidity in a hive for the strong brood and appropriate adult bees' behavioral patterns.Healthy bee colonies maintain a stable environment in the hive. Monitoring and continuous analysis of any changes will help not only increase the productivity of bee colonies but also their viability, due to the creation of the most comfortable living conditions.The APIZ team began researching hive telemetry a few months ago and has already been able to transform their knowledge into custom devices. At the present moment, the team has created a device for measuring such features as weight, temperature, humidity, and sound, with the option to send the collected data to a remote server for further processing and analysis.We developed our first telemetry model based on an ordinary wooden beehive, under which we placed our device. The first scale design is presented as a stand with weight sensors and all the necessary electronics installed between the hive body and the bottom.Now, these test devices are collecting and sending data for processing and analysis. Our long-term goal is to modify and improve hive telemetry devices gradually to get the most accurate results and data on the state of bee colonies, preventing any problems inside the hives.Still, there is a lot of work to do, but a start has already been made. Follow our updates to keep abreast of all events and future developments.Bee with APIZ!APIZ project has a goal to tokenize a living organism, mainly a bee, and it is based on the offline business from the apicultural industry.

APIZ project founder Igor Ganea will talk about our project, about the connection between blockchain technology and beekeeping, and of course, about our most important and ambitious goal - the tokenization of a living organism.Traditional beekeeping is based on the knowledge of mankind about bees and its development stopped about 100 years ago. Unfortunately, now there is no special institute that studies bees and their vital activity, therefore it is almost impossible to unify beekeeping systems into one single system.We set ourselves such a goal in our industrial apiaries, where we combine long-term beekeeping traditions with innovative technologies. From our videos you will learn how this affects the efficiency of the life of the bee and, accordingly, the entire project.Here and further we will give answers to all your numerous questions, so stay with us and do not hesitate to ask everything you would like to know. Bee with APIZ!

      "body": "Attention to details really matters to usCommunication and deep understanding of consumers needs are important to a successful business project. And how can you understand it and promote your product? The most effective way is to communicate and interact with the clients directly without any intermediaries.Direct interaction with the client is the main focus of marketing and sales in all our projects. Igor Ganea, the APIZ project co-founder, set this trend from the very beginning. He is always directly involved in all stages, from production to marketing campaigns and sales. Most recently, he spent several days in one of stores, communicating with people while selling them excellent Le Souffle d'Adore honey. It’s extremely important for a team when the leader is not only delegating the tasks but also working on a par with the employees. And this is the way our business is done, where honesty and credibility are core values. Consequently, the entire APIZ project is based upon these values with the detailed description in project’s RoadMap.The motion vector of APIZFirstly, we strive to provide full transparency of the honey production cycle at all stages, with no exception, from the nectar collection till the jar of honey is on the store shelves.This can be done by implementation of modern science achievements, to be more precise, the blockchain system. This system is a unique data storage of climatic characteristics, geographic location, volumes, production stages, quality control, and consumption statistics. By providing all this information to the final consumer, we’ll nip the problem of a manufacturer's credibility in the bud. After all, you must agree when you take a jar of honey from the shelf in the store, with a QR code with detailed information about the production on it, you’ll most likely give preference to this particular manufacturer. This is quite natural since far from all manufacturers being entirely honest with their customers in today’s realities. Therefore, earning the trust of our clients is a high priority for us.Only if the first task is completed, we’ll be able to move on to the second, which includes the expanding mass consumption of honey and quitting sugar in favor of honey in the long term. It has long been known that honey is rich in minerals and vitamins and therefore has a high value for the body, unlike sugar, which we consume in excess since there is almost no product without added sugar today.If honey becomes the number one product, replacing sugar, their price tag should equalize. While this is the longest-term challenge, by solving it, we can make a modest contribution to the health care system. By consuming honey, people will be less prone to cardiovascular disease and obesity.Our team strives to do a strong project that will serve the well-being of people. Our team strives to make its business project as honest and transparent as possible so as not to challenge the reputation of the company and its masterminds.Websites:https://apiz.digital/https://ganeapi.com/Social Networks:https://twitter.com/apizcryptohttps://instagram.com/apizcoinhttps://facebook.com/apizcoin.official/https://t.me/ApizDigitalhttps://discord.com/invite/26tBfZZAxGhttps://reddit.com/user/ApizCrypto/https://linkedin.com/company/apizcoin/",
