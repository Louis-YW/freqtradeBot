  "content": "Ok i understand onchain analysis can be really helpful, but over 8000 dollars per year for it. And mind it it, it is retail plan for institutional plans you have to contact them. You know i read 799 dollars (Really thankful for $1 discount) and thought it is pretty expensive sevice and when I looked closely it was monthly not yearly and I was in shock. But maybe onchain analysis is really that useful that it will make you millions or at least thousands of dollars to justify this cost.",

Short term TA is bullshit & anything unexpected can make the price massively deviate away from what you think is supposed to happen. Halving in 2024 & moon in 2025, I wonâ€™t charge you $8388 for that either.",
