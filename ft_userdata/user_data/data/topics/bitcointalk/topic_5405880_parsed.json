Your interest to be a Bitcoin coder needs to be honored but I'm afarid it is impossible. You need huge coding skills and especially for Bitcoin, it's very important. Because Bitcoin has very high requirements for code, existing Bitcoin developers like Peter Wuille are very strict for new code to be added.

The first place you would want to start is learning a programming language. I would recommend C, although its not really relevant to most Blockchain programming, its really helpful and makes learning other programming languages much easier. There are many free courses online as well. So thats something you could easily look up on your own.Understanding Blockchain is something that you could also look up. But I also recommend going through the development sections of this forum to see what the other developers are doing. Maybe they will even let you participate in their projects.",

      "body": "Since you wisely worded the topic as 'blockchain based developer' that implies that you already know that using a blockchain is NOT just limited to cryptocoins. Blockchains are being used to replace conventional databases that are used in a myriad of applications where goods and records need to be securely tracked and that information permanently stored. Examples are in shipping logistics, food production, state and municipal records, etc.For those applications the current pool of programmers who know how to code for them is very small meaning salaries for talented programmers are huge. BTW: this is the same situation for AI programmers - huge demand but few people who know wtf they are doing.That said, it means that:a. you need to learn how to code c++/python/java/etc. If you can wrap your brain around that then you will have a very good start.b. you need to learn databases - much of what goes into designing a database application applies to blockchain tech as wellc. you need to find universities that have blockchain (and or AI) programs.d. somewhere in all that you also cover at least a working knowledge of cryptography, 'c' should have the needed courses for it.It is NOT impossible but it does mean that you need to learn quite a bit. Of course that applies to ANY technical career you want to pursue...",

Understanding Bitcoin is very easy but when it talks into coding might be difficult and I didn't even try it myself.

You can start to practice coding in any programming language at first just to familiarize some basics like some logics because later on you can use this knowledge on some programming language. After that, you select your programming language and stick to it until you master it just like others said, C++.There are already a lot of self-taught programmers these days just because of the internet, you can learn on the internet.",
