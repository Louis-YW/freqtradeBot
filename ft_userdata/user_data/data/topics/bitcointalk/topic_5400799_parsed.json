I sorry this has happened to you and you lost your investment, unfortunately this is something that happens almost everyday, scammers spend all their time and effort to try to make their project seem as legitimate as they can, however there is nothing inside, so people think that they are investing in a project that is serious when they could not be further from the truth, which in return creates a very negative attitude against altcoins and projects which are legitimate are the ones that have to pay the price and face great difficulties trying to attract investors, as the more people get scammed the more reticent they will be to ever invest in the altcoin market again.",

You must have been very much aware of this kind of market. But still you fell for it. So this is not just a mistake that is committed exclusively by newbies. Even a legendary sometimes makes this error. Greed is always around the corner. It is always a threat. It is always there tempting us to make the wrong move. It's great to be reminded of this once in a while. And for people to avoid committing the same mistake.",

Thank you for sharing your experience, this means a lot not just for the newbies and also the old investors like me that sometimes in doubt and thinking of what I shall do when I want to invest and also when I'm already in profit.There really are experiences like this that makes us want to be simple and be happy with any amount of returns and profits that we make. That means that any profit we make, counts as profit no matter how low or high it is.",

It might not have the same concept, but the initial feeling that you get whenever you get a successful trade or gain in a particular asset would make it seem that you will get something even better in the long run. Hence, keeping your money at the start makes it ideal, but then it's just a losing position for you. I think the big letter \"G\" on everyone's head would make you lose a lot more than you are willing to, and that's just how many people get down and fail with their financial stuff.I agree that this would make it seem that you have lost everything, but no matter, don't think about it too much and move on. Everyone who has experienced this, including me, has and should've learned their lesson with this.",

I think that participants in this market quite often face a similar situation. It is very difficult to predict the price movements of cryptocurrencies, and especially new tokens. Therefore, I consider this situation almost typical. If we don't take risks, we won't make a profit. The only thing we can do is to study the general movement of the market and the specific project whose cryptocurrency we are interested in. Then there will be fewer such failures, but they will not disappear anyway.",

Actually Ive got what youre feeling. I had too many regrets not taking profit on some of my shitcoin activity that supposedly gain some good and decent one but not able to monetize due to my greedines. This is really a tough to mustard when it comes to crypto since we want more and we cant be contended to what we already have. Some say sorry is not sorry. But thats life in crypto either you lose it or win it.",

Sorry to hear that OP but i think stuff like that happened to most people that are active in the crypto space before. I did not make the same mistake as you did but i made other mistakes. For example i took part in a few private sales in 2020 and in early 2021 because i am part of a few launchpads and in May of 2021 my portfolio had significant value at least for my standards but of course i did not sell and today my portfolio has only like 2 or 3% of it's ATH value from back in 2021.Also i sold my waves when they were at around 50$ each which was a good sell obviously but i wanted to buy them back once they are below 4$ but now yesterday Waves took a jump from 4$ to above 8$ at the moment so i already regret not buying back at 4,50$, but that is how it is.I also don't buy waves now i just wait. If it will not fall again i have just missed that opportunity.",

(.....)I believe that using Binance Smart Chain (BSC) or any of their launchpad even pancakeswap is a gamble.Most of the projects that are already rugged pulled have existed in Binance Smart Chain (BSC), there is still a lot of them, and a lot of coming.So yeah, taking profits early is always a good move here.",

I move on once I've got my capital covered. No regrets. I behaved like OP in the past, trying to rebuy after I had sold and taken profit. Most times I went in all and got burnt, of course. My strategy this day is take profit, and if I feel strongly about the project after selling I rebuy from the profit. The recouped capital must not be tampered with when I'm buying back. That way, whatever ill that happens to the project won't affect me completely.",

Greed isn't necessarily bad, imagine if you pulled out when you made 5x more when you invested again, that's a result of your greed. You just made a mistake in judging on how long you should hodl it, and honestly, if it comes to altcoins, I'd almost always sell after making a profit, even if it was rather small, especially if it was a new project. Most of them are just full of hype and manipulated so whales could profit imo.",

With bitcoin and altcoins, the selling chances are often less explored because people like to hold. While this seems good for the community, it is bad for the trader's portfolio.Of course one should sell when in profit, depending on how much the coin has gained over time. Not doing so means missing an opportunity and the recycling of money refreshes the traders mindset which tends to become stagnant over time when holding.Such examples are common though, not just in crypto but also in fiat markets.",
