My ledger has 24 seeds inside, that pretty sure we don't need to write it again on any site or any browser.So be careful, in my experience, a newbie and beginner must watch his step before downloading anything in Internet. and I know out there are too many scammers watching your wallet to steal your fund.",

Fake Ledger Chrome extensions have been around on and off for some time, following the same pattern: asking for your seed. In fact, Ledger discontinued all Chrome apps in 2022.The one thing I’d be worried about now is not having installed any additional malware as a by-product of installing the fake extension mentioned in the OP.",

Although, that's up to the OP, and their personal threat model. Since it was executed, there could be underlying things attached to that. However, it probably was a script kiddie attempt of scamming a few people, and probably wasn't all that sophisticated. This is why I like virtual isolation at the very least. Virtual machines or a operating system dedicated to it; like Qubes OS. However, Linux usually offers some sort of protection from unwanted programs doing unwanted things. Not always though. It could be fine, and probably is fine. However, I'd be at least wiping that hard drive, and reinstalling everything.",

You may have installed some clipboard jacker software on your computer as a by-product, which could change a destination address when you plan to send BTC (i.e. you copy the address from a given site, and paste in on your legit Ledger Live). If you follow the procedure through as usual, believing that the hardware wallet is your absolute safeguard to any and all malware, then you could end up sending bitcoins to the address you weren’t intending to.",
