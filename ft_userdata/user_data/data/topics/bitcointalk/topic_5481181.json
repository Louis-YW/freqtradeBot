So it's not just a matter of technological advancement. Countries like Italy are advanced enough, but just don't want to get rid of cash, and there is a similar situation with Germany.But let's imagine all the obstacles are gone, and we are moving toward a cashless society. The way I see it, there are two different ways of getting there. One is cashless, but dominated by centralized structures like banks and corporations. In that case, Bitcoin doesn't play a major role. Another is cashless and decentralized, in which case Bitcoin can play a major role. It all depends on how much humanity will value privacy over national safety, security.",

The high transaction fees and the lack of requisite skills to set up a lighting network are also roadblocks to the use of Bitcoin for the payment of goods and services.

Also as you said it will coexist with bitcoin if there's certain adoption will happen. Bitcoin cannot cooperate with regulators but rather the people use it especially those institution should push and present that bitcoin is good alternative currency since once these regulators will impress on the usage of bitcoin together with its potential for investment matters then provably they would allow bitcoin to became their legal tender just like what El Salvador did. Bitcoin has really have potential and there are lots of institutions are now investing with it since they see how huge its marketcap also the supply is limited so if there's global adoption will happen then provably we can see bitcoin price to rise up.",

Cash is not replaced by crypto but by CBDC. Each CBDC transaction is monitored closely by automated systems as part of wide government efforts to control their citizens.Crypto's role has been reduced to financial instruments like ETF and various derivatives that are used to trade under government control on heavily KYCed centralized exchanges. Movement of real crypto outside of the centralized exchanges is discouraged and can bring the user unwanted government attention in the form of various audits from the tax authorities and other government agencies. After all only criminals use crypto outside of the government-approved exchanges, so the moment their KYCed customer tries to move his crypto into a self-hosted wallet, the automated systems know that there is something fishy going on.In most countries privacy coins have either been directly prohibited or usage of privacy coins is made impossible in more indirect fashion by special laws by requiring KYC for every transaction of privacy coins making their use pointless unless the user is willing to break the law.That is the direction we are headed.",

      "body": "Well I don't think society will ever be entirely cashless. There will always be some need for physical money, even if digital payments become 99%+ of what is used.Anyway, bitcoin I expect will operate as an alternative to fiat currencies. Nations aren't gonna give up their national currencies, so bitcoin will only always be an alternative. Some nations, like El Salvador has done, will put bitcoin on par with whatever currency they use, and likely as in El Salvador's case this will mostly be done in countries that don't issue their own currency.Once bitcoin use becomes widespread one nice thing that will be greatly streamlined will be traveling! No more worrying about exchanging currencies (except perhaps to have a little bit of physical cash on hand) and no more worrying about your credit card being charged big fees for using it in a different country (happened to me a year ago when I was in Mexico two credit card charges on my statement were mysteriously DOUBLE!! what I was charged in the store). In the somewhat distant future you'll be able to travel and just spend bitcoin without worrying about any of that!Also I think many people (probably eventually billions of people) will save in bitcoin instead of cash in banks. Cuz why would you save in a currency that decreases in value when you can save in a currency that increases in value? People will still have some savings in the bank beyond what they need for the month, for safety of having that emergency fund in a \"stable\" currency, but savings beyond those fairly immediate needs will be in bitcoin.Also it could be that international trade ends up getting done in Bitcoin. Even if on-chain fees are $100 or something in this fairly distant future, that's nothing if you're making a hundred million or billion dollar transaction. And with bitcoin you can move money directly and usually within 30-60 minutes to the other party so it makes more sense than going through the fiat system. Faster and cheaper with bitcoin.I see a future, perhaps a couple decades from now, where paying online or in person with Bitcoin over the LN (or perhaps other L2 solutions) is not just as easy but also as commonplace as paying with credit card or mobile phone fiat wallets is today.I look forward to the day when I can simply save in bitcoin and spend my bitcoin as readily as I use my credit card today. It is coming, though we'll just have to wait probably a couple decades until it is that pervasive.",
