And... I think it turned out relatively well (at least I think so, maybe it is not that good idk) . I'm excited to share it with the community here and would really appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or thoughts you might have!I'm always looking to improve, and it would mean a lot to hear what you think.

The first part about bitcoin you are talking about blockchain, and the fact that users can send money to other users is thanks to the blockchain, when you say that the transaction is direct from one user to another isn't true, there are a 3rd party involved, and those are the miners, without them no one would be able to send money to other users.But i really enjoy the animation and the voice is really clear, did you use any AI for the video?",

But what concerns me is the voice in the video, it sounds like a robotic voice. If it really is a robot/AI voice, I think it would be better if you made your own VO. Those are basic explanations about Bitcoin (BTC), will you then make further explanation videos about safe Bitcoin (BTC) storage and so on?",

It literally must have cost you a whole lot of time to bring up this lovely content. However, base on my little idea about YouTube and content creation in general, there was something I observed about your YouTube channel, which is you uploading same video in two different languages (i.e English and Spanish). As I would have suggest why not you create a separate channel where you post same content only in Spanish alone, while you have another one where you post videos only in English alone, so as not to confuse your audience. As I'm sure this strategy will help you reaching more audience but in an organized manner. Thank you, as I wish you good luck. I just Subscribe to your channel. EXAMPLE    That is, to upload your first video in English on this your current channel, while you translate the video with an A.I tool to Spanish and upload it on your second Spanish YouTube channel dedicated to Spanish audience.",

That's why bitcoin transactions have third party involved because the transactions won't go through if there's no one mining the block and if no one is mining the block then the transactions won't be included in the blockchain and would only stay in the mempool. I wouldn't mind if OP will use AI as long as the voice is clear and said correctly then it doesn't matter if it's AI or not.
