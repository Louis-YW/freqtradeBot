  "content": "I got an interesting offer for one of my art piece from an unexpected art merchant as he led me to believe. He happened to like two of my art pieces, but opted to get one first before the other. It however came with a catch, and that is, I would have to register and pay gas fee on the NFT marketplace he provided with the link, https://roninsea.com/.I took my time to visit the link address he sent and it seemed kind of legit, until he started insisting I pay the gas fee after he learnt I registered on the site. Before completing the trade with me however, he reiterated that I must pay the gas fee before Tuesday, else he would spend the fund on something other than the purchase of my art piece.In applying caution so as not to fall into the hands of a fraudster out of desperation, I tried to research the name 'roninsea' on Google and have asked a few friends if they have heard of any NFT marketplace with this name. None could confirm if the site is legit till today. Am conversant with Opensea, Rarible, besides these, please let me know if others exist.This is why I am asking here, where I know answers will suffice. 1. How do I ascertain the legitness of an online market place such as one used to trade NFTs?2. Has anyone ever heard of Roninsea.com?3. Am I in the process of being scammed if I go ahead to pay the gas fee?",

They do not even have a social media presence - I'm redirected to the site when clicking the twitter icon. Their contact number is +123456789 so how would you take that seriously?Have you not tried selling on a more popular NFT marketplace like Opensea before? You should be able to tell if what he's asking is a standard practice.",

How do I ascertain the legitness of an online market place such as one used to trade NFTs?You can't be 100% sure so best is to simply stick to the most well known one that you used in the past instead experimenting with unknown dodgy marketplace that lacks any info.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on February 28, 2023, 03:04:22 PM2. Has anyone ever heard of Roninsea.com?Nope, and can't find any info about them on Google either.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on February 28, 2023, 03:04:22 PM3. Am I in the process of being scammed if I go ahead to pay the gas fee?Looks like a classic scam attempt to me, in which scammer is insisting that you completely unknown platform created few weeks ago and giving you a short deadline in order to make you do what he wants.

He tried to create an urgent trading with you and make you panic, likely to wait for your mistakes. Generally it looks like a scam attempt.",

      "body": "It is very likely a scam site. The site did not even get indexed by Google and as shown above, the domain was barely bought. Does anyone even able to click any NFTs on the site? I doubt so. The way he know you have registered and then urge pay the gas fee or he won't buy the NFT is a classic scam scheme. assume there might be something to do with the contract that existed on the site. Since you have made an account, I hope you did not use your real email address and reuse the same password for your account on other platforms.",

And why would someone push you to pay a gas fee with a scheduled date? Because it might close down after you just pay for it.Good thing that you've asked it first to get everybody's thought about it and hopefully you didn't for it as you've got already those signs that it's likely a scam attempt to you.",

I wonder why you came to this platform while Opensea is the biggest Nft market available you can trust. Much really better next time to avoid those not known platform then use the famous one to avoid asking about legitimacy and to avoid being scam.",

This seems very suspicious to me.It is better to stay away from such suspicious people and wait for another opportunity that does not raise suspicions.",

Am conversant with Opensea, Rarible, besides these, please let me know if others exist.You are definitely in the process being scammed, and in no way you should pay the gas fees for something that you are selling and that you own. If they were really legit, they wouldn't take you to another specific platform to do the trade. I'm sure you have accounts on regular and famous NFT platform such as OpenSea, Rarible etc.I've never heard the name of that platform before. You should ask them to purchase the art pieces that they like from a reputable platform to avoid unnecessary problems and confusions. If they insist, let them go and never trade with anyone next time who asks you to register on a specific website just so that they can buy your art pieces.",
