If you have an interest in a company and you want to be a part of it in partnership or some sort, you buy her shares or stock base on the unit you want and by that you have invested and has a contribution in the company as a share holder, that is the business in it and if the company makes profit and declares it, it is also shared to a holder as dividend. Also if a company is not doing well it affects the stocks just as a business that didn't make profit at a particular time. You need to read up on stocks.Buying property is good is also business with its own risk. Natural disasters, flood or bad road networks among other factors can hamper a property not to develop faster if you buy a genuine property and not the one you get scammed on. All investment involves risk.",

You are certainly right when you talk about real goods, for example, buying an apartment or a car, that this is your investment in a real product, when, like stocks or cryptocurrencies, this is something abstract and cannot be touched. However, the emergence of stocks or cryptocurrencies is not accidental. Why? The fact is that many of us want to earn money and use different assets for this. For example, real estate or cars, but with the advent of stocks and cryptocurrencies, a new additional niche has simply opened up for investment and doing business, and this does not mean that it is bad or not fair. Probably the answer here lies in how we relate to certain assets, and only this attitude determines the importance of this asset for us personally. Therefore, in this matter, everyone can be right and wrong at the same time, since the market simply receives new assets and new opportunities, and we ourselves decide what to use to generate income.",

Some people may prefer to use fiat currency for everyday transactions because it is more widely accepted and its value is more stable, while others may see the benefits of using cryptocurrencies for their decentralized nature and potential for anonymity. Ultimately, the choice of which type of currency to use depends on a variety of factors and is a personal decision.So, in order to invest in your so-called \"Property\", which currency are you going to use? That \"BS Fiat\" or \"BS crypto\"? QuoteI know all stock investor loss money and some of them are killed, but not all property investor loss moneyLet's talk about this, shall we?

For what is worth, people can still buy properties, Real estates and just about anything online and that doenst make them virtual.Cryptocurrency might he virtual but, stocks aren't and even with that, they still do quite well in there field.

While intrinsically backed assets like real estate are legitimate and real money?That's not far from what precious metals investors have been saying for a few years now.In the case of real estate, prior to the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, it was thought by many investors that it was impossible for the price of american real estate to decline. No one could remember an instance where US real estate exhibited noteworthy downtrends. Which led to the urban myth of real estate only being able to appreciate in value. As a result, the ensuing crash of 2008 caught many completely by surprise.There are many who claim that reverting to a gold standard would prevent inflation. However, we know that the roman empire experienced considerable inflation due to its denarius being devalued close to 2,000 years ago.While there are generally assets which are more reliable and stable than others. I don't know if its accurate to say that anything has proven to be exempt from bubbles, devaluation or crashes. Everything has its time. And when that day comes, who knows.",

Then the results will rise very quickly. And of course, ethics related to real investment, property and gold are two things that are very related. Both are very worth considering and owning. However, let's see, how much people can afford to invest in property? Only some people really have the money to buy and develop their property. However, ordinary people with a lower-middle-income economy would find it difficult to invest in something like this. Never mind buying a property, for everyday life they may be in trouble.For this reason, digital assets exist, both stocks and crypto. Even though they are slightly different, most people can afford them. Even cryptocurrency can be owned by anyone. In my opinion, this is one of the special aspects of crypto, namely that everyone can invest in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency (provided they are really prepared with the risks and knowledge, not a random investment). So, this is why I personally still choose to invest in crypto because I haven't been able to afford the property and later plan to get an investment in property from the results of this crypto. And of course, most people must have financial management that suits their conditions. And what's more, it doesn't rule out that people have investments in various assets, right? As long as it is productive and promising, why not? what is certain is that we have risk management, assets, and finances that are good and suitable to us.",

When you buy common stocks, you buy some ownership of a company, whether or not it's significant depends on how much %-share you buy. Since people can buy a tiny fraction and more liquid, stocks are more inflated, way inflated than you think if you look at their P/E Ratio. Simply, stocks are way too overvalued. Sometimes, the price is detached from the firm's current performance, but more of a copium and hopium (yep, I called it BS price as well). Crypto is like stocks on steroids.Meanwhile, people just can't speculate on housing, lands, etc. since it's way more expensive and illiquid. Therefore, these assets aren't being pumped as hard as stocks, but still, there are still boom and bust cycles in the property market because of institutional pumpers & dumpers.",
