You can enter any numbers or you can enter a valid numberWe have a referral program, but we also have Exmon Earn. This is different. About Exmon EarnTerms of ServiceCard Types: There are four types of cards available, each with a different value: 1 USDT, 10 USDT, 50 USDT, and 100 USDT.Unique Codes: Each card is assigned a unique code. To gain access to a card, you must pay the cost of the card to the owner of the code by which you are activating it.Earning Potential: Once you have access to a card, you will receive the value of the card from each user who registers using your code. For example, if you have access to a 1 USDT card, you will receive 1 USDT from each registered user. If 100 users register using your code, you will receive 100 USDT. If you have access to a 100 USDT card, each registered user will bring you 100 USDT. In this case, 100 registered users would earn you 10,000 USDT.Sharing Your Code: It is important to share your card code as widely as possible to maximize your earning potential.Earning Amount: The amount you earn from each registered user will be equal to the value of the card you have access to.If you have any questions, write",

So this one is obviously no license since it's KYC free, there's a huge risk that it will be ban in the Philippines eventually. Do you have a p2p in your platform too?One of the key elements of cryptocurrencies is anonymity. Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned Bitcoin as a tool to give people more freedom and control over their finances. Anonymity plays a key role in this, allowing people to make transactions without interference from third parties such as governments or financial institutions.However, governments around the world are increasingly passing laws that require cryptocurrency exchanges and users to go through KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures. These laws require users to provide personal information to the exchange, such as their name, address, and passport details.We believe that such laws are contrary to the fundamental principles of cryptocurrencies. KYC procedures undermine anonymity, making cryptocurrencies less attractive to many users.We believe in freedom and give people the right to decide for themselves whether or not they want to remain anonymous. We do not require users to go through KYC procedures, and we offer a wide range of features that allow them to maintain their privacy.Regarding your question about the security of KYC-FREE exchanges:It is important to understand that any cryptocurrency exchange, regardless of whether it requires KYC, is subject to certain risks. Governments can shut down an exchange or impose restrictions on it.In the case of the Philippines:Yes, it is true that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the Philippines has banned Binance and other cryptocurrency exchanges that do not require KYC.However, it is important to note that this does not mean that all KYC-FREE exchanges are illegal in the Philippines.There are exchanges that are registered in other jurisdictions and are not subject to Philippine laws.Yes, we do have a P2P exchange on our platform.",
