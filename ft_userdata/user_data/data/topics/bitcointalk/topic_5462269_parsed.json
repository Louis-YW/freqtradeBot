  "content": "Hello:The following transactions were made from my Electrum wallet without my authorization about a month ago:https://www.blockchain.com/es/explorer/transactions/btc/185c4ba5ff25c8603090f5c4fa8e646bdabef995f01123d5e610b75b0232a517https://www.blockchain.com/es/explorer/transactions/btc/b3dcfc3e18047139ae197f07c4fa2cb79c94b3c9059d93fa315e871ad7ddcd5ahttps://www.blockchain.com/es/explorer/transactions/btc/6365cdf3291026fd3f1335c8e2b763e051dc8d178bf9226bca59c6e92b0898fcI want to make it clear that I have always followed all the security recommendations, which is why I have never shared my private keys publicly and that I have not stored the seed phrase to access my wallet digitally either, as they always recommend to avoid situations like this. In fact, I didn't even use this wallet to make transfers since it was intended only to store fractions of bitcoins, thinking that it was much safer to do so than in a custodial wallet like Coinbase, so it had also been a long time without using it to make transfers. transactions. I also don't think it was a hack because, as you can see, they didn't empty the entire wallet, although a large part of it did.I would appreciate if someone can guide me because it is a fairly high amount and I need to recover it somehow since it took me many years of effort and hard work to collect it.Thank you all very much for your help and have a nice day.",

Reformat your computer immediately or scan it using reliable antivirus.Hello. Thank you for answering so quickly. With respect to what they mention, I don't think it is a virus because I formatted everything and I have passed many antiviruses and everything is ok. They didn't take all the funds as well, so I don't think that's the case.In relation to tracking the funds I have tried to do it but it is quite difficult because the transaction is lost after all the movements of the blockchain.",

      "body": "Sorry for your loss, this must be terrible!You can report your theft to local authorities and only those or with a police case you could report thief's addresses to exchanges, if the thief is dumb enough to go with your stolen coins directly to an exchange with KYC. Likelyhood of success is probably minimal. It depends also what the thief is doing to disguise the origin of your stolen coins.But all this is very much too late when you discovered it a month later. It's not impossible that the thief itself did huge privacy mistakes where and when he moved your coins, but I wouldn't count on it. Still worth a shot as you can't do a lot more.The other interesting puzzle to try to solve is how your wallet's security was compromised.1. What system did you use for your Electrum wallet? Was that also your daily driver? What kind of software was on that system?2. Who had access to your computer, to your place? How about when you're on vacation?3. Did you ever take digital pictures of your wallet's recovery words?4. Where did you store your wallet's recovery words? Is it possible someone else could get access to those?5. Did you use some password manager and saved your recovery words there, too?6. Who else did know that you had bitcoins or other crypto currencies?7. Did you always verify your Electrum software update downloads?8. Your wallet had legacy addresses. Was this wallet created by Electrum or did you create your wallet by some other procedure?If you have funds left and can't use a secure environment for your wallet, consider to buy a decent hardware wallet. If you follow good practices with a hardware wallet, this will at least secure your wallet from malware on your computer.A hardware wallet won't help much if you somehow messed up with your storage of your recovery words.",

The first is a segwit address which always receives a round amount (the biggest), the second is a legacy address and the third is yours which receives the change back. Adding the fact that whoever made the transaction didn't empty the wallet makes it hard to think this is a jack!Anyway, as others have pointed out above, conformed transactions are irreversible so don't trust anyone who contacts you saying he can help you recover your money.",

There is no reason for a hacker to leave the 0.13 Bitcoin when it is worth somewhat a smart amount of money. Sometimes friends and family members also steal money and they take only what they need.
