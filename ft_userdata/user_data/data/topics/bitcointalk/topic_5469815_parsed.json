Do you ever think of quitting after you won a jackpot?Gambling is not a career. I am of the type that do not expect anything good from gambling. That is why I use little amount of money to always gambling except if it is free money which I can try my luck with. I have never won a jackpot that can let me quit gambling before. If I win big, I may quit gambling if I become a business man and have no time for gambling anymore. But if I still have time, I can have fun with gambling at times with tiny amount of money.",

In any case if that amount in dollars is big already in the Philippines, then she can't complain.As for those gamblers that I know who won big in land base casino, believed it or not, after their huge win, they are going back to the floor in the next 24 floors. So there's no quitting for this kind of gamblers as they are not satisfied how big their winnings is. They just want to play over and over again.",

      "body": "Quitting gambling after winning a jackpot is not of a good decision, unless it's the person's initial plans. The goal of gambling is to reward players some day. Like the girl in question. She wasn't expecting to hit this jackpot, and it's quite an interesting one, that'll help her easily manage the funds. Spending the jackpot back on gambling is the disadvantage of continuing to play game after winning the jackpot. And most young gamblers fail to put the jackpot into good usage. They'll reluctantly wager huge amounts expecting another big win. Soon or later the jackpot is squandered and only a few of it, will be used outside the gambling activities. Hence, the casino knows their money will come back to them. If gambling makes the person happy, they'll stick to gambling. Personally, I won't move ahead, by stopping to play games. I'd discipline myself not to make silly mistakes. Stake few amounts of money, then look into providing a service for gamblers. Gambling is not for me a place to make all the money I need. So, trying out other things with the jackpot will be on the back of my mind. Especially when offered a sweet jackpot like that of this girl. Pure good luck. Handing over the whole money at once, is always a bad decision for youths. It can ruin the youth. To spend recklessly on what doesn't matter to the society. Or even boost addiction in some people's gambling experience. Such persons I'd advise to stop gambling after winning the jackpot. As it could be detrimental to their life, despite having all that money.",

Do you ever think of quitting after you won a jackpot?\"Quitting\" this is word is very strange in gambling because I don't think anyone actually quites gambling I mean take a look the whole process of gambling, the winning only opens up the bigger view to actually plan on different and less risky ways to even acquire such winnings more. Although I cant count myself all that lucky but I think I have had my moment when it comes to my gambling habits. My believe is that no one ever has the upper hand towards this act , I think the loses will always be bigger than our winnings.",

The money generated from lottery sales goes into funding various government projects that directly benefit the people. So, when you're consistently buying lottery tickets and haven't experienced a win yet, it's not so much about wasting your money as it is about contributing to the government's mission.Now, if you do happen to win, that's a massive blessing on your part. And let's not even mention luck not being on your side because, in the world of lottery, luck usually strikes just once. Winning is often a life-changing event, given the substantial amount you could pocket, and it's tax free.",

How about you guys, are you having a good fortune on your gambling career? Do you ever think of quitting after you won a jackpot?If you are thinking of retiring just because you win a big prize, I believe that that in itself is a symptom that you are not in it for fun, but out of financial necessity, and that is a serious mistake. In fact, if you do, If you think like that, pay for a medical consultation.There is no reason to stop doing something that entertains you, that is leisure time, of recreation, that is what betting has to mean, we all always want that big prize, but given the chances of that happening are so low, especially in the lottery, Gambling should be the equivalent of going out to the movies, or; \"I'm having a coffee\".",

Years ago with sports betting but because it's a game per event sometimes you will have a lot of time without using your money so I tried casino games. My best luck was getting a x1500 multi-win, but after that, I have not seen any big wins again. I guess the gambling site is taking it all back and they are not finished with me just yet. But I am hoping very soon I will get another good multi-win that I won't even think twice to withdraw afterward. The problem with casino games is they give multiple wins and sometimes you will have to waste time with 10,000 - 20,000 bets before it comes out which means you may have lost an amount that will just suffice for what they will give back.Indeed she was lucky to win that huge amount but next to it will be how she will manage the money so that it won't go to waste.",
