But one major question started since the release, How can I claim without delegating? It is possible? and the answer is yes you can here are a few steps to do it1- First go to the arbiscan official $ARB contract (we are going to claim the tokens directly from there bypassing the webpage steps) https://arbiscan.io/address/0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9#writeContract2- Go to contract TAB and select Write3- Connect the metamask (or any wallet that qualified) with the Web3 tab4- Go to Write again and click claim5- Wait for the token arrives, you should put at least the medium speed and you must add manually the token contract to Arbitrum ONE. The fees are around 1.50 to 2 USD (of ETH)",

It's perfect chance for scammers to use fake token and scam naive people.Two golden pages to start searching for basic information in cryptocurrency are Coinmarketcap.com and Coingecko.com.Visit them, type in Search box like a project name and use their results to double check with Google.For hot projects like Arbitrum, its trading volume in general and liquidity pools on DEX should be very big. So it's easy to detect fake tokens by looking at their liquidity which is surely low.https://www.dextools.io/app/enhttps://dex.guru/https://dex.guru/",

I did miss the Airdrop but I did buy some from Binance exchange once it went live yesterday. I use to think airdrops are a waste of time  but recently, I have heard of these airdrops participants making good money from what they got from allocation. I believe airdrops the new ICOs and IEO of the coming years as it automatically gives the project a good number of followers.",

Because that contract address you dropped as official arbitrum contract address is wrong, you are up to something.The right arbitrum contract starts with 0x912 and ends with 6548 I am surprised that many people don't even notice this here, or am I the one that's worse at everything? Someone please look into this and confirm.",

It's manual claim by straight claiming into the smart-contract distribution token via-write contract.OP was correct, If you want to manually claim should be from (0x67a24CE4321aB3aF51c2D0a4801c3E111D88C9d9).",

I believe airdrops the new ICOs and IEO of the coming years as it automatically gives the project a good number of followers. Actually a lot of airdrops don't have that much value, and the arb event brings a more positive atmosphere to everyone. And I personally understand that it is not an easy job for us to seize the opportunity to earn free money, there are many top projects in progress and do not have their own tokens, so please pay attention to that for a chance to get from their ecosystem later. Don't waste time with airdrops by interacting with the media, as I find 99% of the time to be scams.",

Also there are some Platforms that are offering strong chance for holding the token, Mexc and bitget are ones and some other Defi as well",

I believe the growth of $ARB is organic and they will likely sustain the growth and the token price will pump, mid to long-term price projection for me is $10, remember that the VCs tokens are locked for a year, if Sol can trade at $240, Cardano at $3, Avax at $100, Luna at $100 then ARB at $10 is conservative",

This price is in accordance with my expectations because ARB's max supply is not much different from matic and both are also L2. I'm selling ARB at around $2.5 and I'm currently getting ready to buy again because I think ARB's price in the long run could be $5.",
