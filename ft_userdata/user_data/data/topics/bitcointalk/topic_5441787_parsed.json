      "body": "I've used a trezor with electrum before so can only speak from that experience but you normally have to disconnect the device and then restart the software on your computer that lets the hardware wallet interact with electrum. If you miss out that step with trezor the previous wallet often holds a lock on the device (you might just have to pair them before loading up electrum too).",

Some times the communication can be lost because the cable is a usb 2 and the port is 3 or damage to the cable can cause interference and not a strong enough communication to the ledger but can be used for other things.",

Anyone else have had this problem before?Thousands of people have many issues with ledger nono X, it's one of the worst hardware wallets in the world.Most problems are coming from bad battery and firmware issues, but in your case I would first make to sure to have latest firmware update and Bitcoin app in ledger live.Ledger recently released new update and they changed a bunch of things, app size increased again for some coins (surprise, surprise).If everything is updated I would try connecting with some alternative software wallets that support ledger, for example Sparrow wallet.",

If you leave that app open(or any other app that connects to your Ledger), try closing it to prevent potential interference.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on March 03, 2023, 02:34:04 AMI'm excited for the new Ledger Stax coming out. How about you guys?Looks good but I can't justify purchasing one with that pricetag lol. Probably something I'd buy if I performed really greatly with my investments this year.",
