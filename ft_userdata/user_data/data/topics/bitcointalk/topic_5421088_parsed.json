This Satoshi in his creativity has set human out of such bondage and control.

Who says the backdoor doesn't exist in the HW you mentioned, or maybe in another one you didn't mention? Although this HW is only partially closed source, so far it has not been shown that they have bad intentions, and I think they have been on the market for more than 6 years. Of course, this does not mean that you should completely trust them, as well as any other similar company that produces similar devices.In addition, imagine a situation where there really is a backdoor to that HW, and someone suddenly steals a huge amount of coins - I think the price of the entire market would collapse so quickly that the stolen coins would become worthless very quickly.",

They've been taken advantage of, exploited to gain users, used to entice them. Do wallets claiming to be decentralized and open-source truly decentralized and open-source? The ordinary users cannot tell.Just recently, Trust Wallet became popular primarily because of CZ promoting it using the FTX fiasco. Not your keys, not your coins, he says. Self-custody is the better way. As a result, the price of Trust Wallet's token, TWT, soared all of a sudden and more than doubled in just a few days. But how decentralized and open-source Trust Wallet is? I bet those who moved their funds to such wallet cannot independently verify. And, contrary to their marketing claims, it seems it isn't open source at all. So the transparency label could easily be faked.",
