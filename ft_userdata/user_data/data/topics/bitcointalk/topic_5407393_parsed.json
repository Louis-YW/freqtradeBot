  "content": "First of all, this thread will be self-moderated not because I want to delete posts that do not match my liking/opinion, but due to some very specific members who tend to trash every thread in P&S. Now that we've cleared things up, let's move to the main subject of this thread.\"Military conscription is the mandatory enlistment of citizens for military service.\" Conscription has considerably declined since 1970, but there are still quite a few countries who haven't abandoned such practices. Currently, according to TheSoldiersProject.org*, there are 49 countries with mandatory military enlistment, which are quite a lot. We're not going to go through every one of them, but some of them are:IsraelBermudaBrazilCyprusGreeceIranNorth KoreaSouth KoreaMexicoRussiaSwitzerlandI'm from Greece, military conscription is mandatory and was recently increased from 9 months to 12. While I understand why some countries require their citizens to serve in the military, 12 months is a long period for someone in a relationship, working and is paying rent on a monthly basis. It's not that simple to abandon everything and not being given another option. I don't know what happens in other countries, but here, apart from the first one-two months training, it's a somewhat useless practice which claims a whole year from your life and savings. I cannot afford to not work for a whole year, while on top of that, I'll lose the ability to apply for unemployment benefits if for whatever reason I do not want/can work after returning from the military. A large amount of Greeks here work in the tourism sector, mostly from April to October/November, and then claiming unemployment benefits.Have you served the military? What are your thoughts about mandatory enlistment? Personally, I find it extremely intrusive, often interferes with your educational and financial path, practically forcing you to abandon a decent job you might have landed. From what you've understood, I've yet to serve in the military and am currently in a huge dilemma, while avoiding it isn't an easy option.* Source: https://www.thesoldiersproject.org/countries-have-compulsory-military-service/",

Some countries adopt a mandatory system where you might be selected for service once you become 18 and then omitted somewhere in the process for whatever reason. Some just let you by if you make up an excuse like your mental health is not up to par. It's not that every able-bodied young adult must be required to serve. Some systems just require you attend military related classes while remaining at home, not that they hand you a weapon of war and force you into dormitories. I believe Mexico has that sort of system. Quote from: Ultegra134 on July 23, 2022, 08:43:33 PMWhat are your thoughts about mandatory enlistment?

There should be no system that forces citizens to risk their life for the safety and security of the state. I trust that people would take arms and defend their sovereignty if threatened without forced training and service.",

However, according to Wikipedia sources there are still plenty that require you to enlist for at least a year, whether you like it or not. Greece is one of those countries, and avoiding it isn't an easy option. Even if you claim mental health issues, they'll postpone your enlistment for a year, on order to provide you with time to \"feel better\". You'll actually have to go through  a committee a few times in order to be exempt from military service.",

      "body": "Be pleased to let me show one thing. Mandatory military enlistment often depends on the kind of legal system a country has. Because of the kind of legal system, the US, Canada, the UK, and a few others, can't legally enforce a mandatory military enlistment, except in the times of the right kinds of emergencies.Wikipedia has a rather good map of the various legal systems of the world. You can go to any country that has a mandatory military enlistment, and then go back to Wikipedia to see what kind of legal system it has.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(legal_system)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_(en).png",

Countries need a military in order to be able to defend themselves (and be prepared to defend themselves).

If a country is not in a position to defend itself, there is the risk of attack from your nation's enemies. National security in Europe is heavily subsidized by the United States.

      "body": "Good topic for discussion. I don't really like current military enlistment system. Military service isn't fully mandatory for everyone. From all eligible people (18-23 years) they are calling about 4000 people and they have to serve for 9 months. So, basically, it's lottery. And no matter, you have made family, having personal business or something similar. You can get called even if you live in foreign country. Only exception if you study in university. But in such case your military service will be delayed until you will end university. I think that such system isn't fair. I think it would be better to call everyone without excpetions after school when young people still haven't started their life - job, family, credits and so on.I haven't got ''lucky'' lottery ticket to military and now I'm a bit too old to get it. Now I only can go to military as volunteer and sign contract with it.",

Excuse me, but had minimal time the past few days and didn't have time to reply. I certainly agree with you, however, I find it way too harsh to have mandatory enlistment of over 12 months. Training lasts 1-2 months at most, and then you'll spend most of your service doing wack jobs around the military camp.Quote from: LTU_btc on July 25, 2022, 11:02:11 PM~snip~That's my point, it completely disrupts your life, at least there should be a way to have a reduced sentence, if you qualify certain qualifications, such as work, employment, living alone etc. It's a huge obstacle when trying to find a decent and stable job, because firstly, it disrupts you by taking you a way for a whole year and secondly, employers often ask from employees to have completed military service for the very same reason.",
