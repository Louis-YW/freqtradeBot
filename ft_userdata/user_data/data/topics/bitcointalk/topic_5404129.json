Zoom out on the chart. The \"sharp drop\" in hash rate is taking us back to levels we haven't seen since... *checks notes* last month! 180 EH/s to 80 EH/s when China banned mining was a \"sharp drop\". 220 EH/s to 213 EH/s is barely a fluctuation. At the last retarget the difficult only dropped by 2%.A small number of miners with the highest electricity costs have stopped mining at the moment, or maybe moved to some other coin, but to suggest mining is \"currently unprofitable\" is just nonsense. Even if it were, and we did actually see a sharp drop in hash rate, then the lower difficulty which accompanied that would then make mining profitable again. It's a self correcting system.",

Then bam, the war forced those miners hastily sell their bags to bail out because of the disruption in business, have pay back loans.I also agree with your assessment, less amount of BTC in miners' bags is a good thing.",

Saying miners are the biggest whales is like saying users on bitcointalk combined are the biggest whale!Quote from: Smack That Ace on June 26, 2022, 12:11:28 PMAccording to CoinMetrics data: The miners hold 800,000 BTC (4.2% of the supply), making them one of the biggest whales in the market.The real question that nobody can answer is how many individuals are holding this sum of 800k bitcoins. For example if there are a million miners that means each of them own a fraction of bitcoin and that doesn't make them whales.QuoteAlthough these public companies only account for 20% of the total hashrate of the bitcoin blockchain, their actions partly reflect the general situation of all other miners.I disagree. You can't compare a company with individuals. An individual doesn't need to always sell their bitcoin to cover the bills, they also don't have employees to pay a salary to.QuoteThe number of bitcoins continuously being sent to the exchange, reaching a record high since January 2021.This statement is wrong for 2 reasons.1. Every coin sold on an exchange is a coin bought by another person. That means the number of bitcoins continuously bought and withdrawn from exchanges is also at an all time high.2. Other reports from the blockchain analyzers have been saying that the amount of bitcoin stored on exchanges has been decreasing!QuoteBITCOIN HASH RIBBON, one of the signals to determine when to buy. SMA30 (green line) falling below SMA60 (Blue line) indicates that some miners have closed down and stopped mining.The sharp drop in Hash Rate shows that bitcoin mining is currently unprofitable.First of all, nobody should use hashrate to decide whether they should buy bitcoin or not! That makes no sense at all because hashrate reacts to the past price with a big delay not to the future possibility of price.Secondly hashrate set a new ATH during this big market crash and the average hashrate over the past 3 months is pretty much around 200 EHS which shows that mining bitcoin is still very profitable.The swings you see in hashrate are normal and currently the main reason for them is the increasing cost of energy in certain countries which translates into the miners in those countries shutting down or migrating to other regions that still have cheap energy.Quotewhile Marathon Digital announced they will not sell any bitcoin even though the market is going through bear season.Is this the same MARA pool that has been censoring transactions and going against Bitcoin's ethos? LOLQuoteWe are at the end of June, and how do you predict the market will be affected if in the future bitcoin miners will sell the bitcoins they mined?? Please share your thoughts.During all market crashes people from different groups are selling their bitcoins. This is nothing new to say miners have sold their coins!There is also people from different categories who are buying bitcoin. If you look at the number of addresses with a balance you can see how it is rapidly increasing which shows the increasing number of people who are buying bitcoin.In short the market moves based on a lot of factors, miners selling their coins is a very small one among them.",
