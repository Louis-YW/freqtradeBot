If the accelerator didn't help and if it still stuck after a few hours there is no other way to speed up the transaction because it is not RBF enabled like the above said. However, if you receive it in your wallet that you control you can do CPFP(Child Pays For Parent) to speed up the transaction. The only problem is you will pay more fees than your previous transaction 61sat/vbyte if you want to speed up this transaction. Can you tell us what wallet you currently using? Some wallets out there do not have RBF option so I suggest switch to a better wallet like Electrum.",

My suggestion is that you wait for a few hours or maybe a few days, it will get confirmed soon. Don't worry.We are having a spike in transactions now, and the fee is very high, which is not likely and it wont stay so high for long.mempool.space is the best website to check it before sending a transaction",

Yeah, last time was in 2017's bull run. And if I'm not mistaken, it was due to the Ordinals spamming the network right now that's why it is congested as hell. As others have said, better wait if you are not in a hurry to move your BTC around.Otherwise as per mempool, the highest fee is 123 sat/vbyte and then 30 sat/vbyte is the lowest, which is crazy to think that a few months ago, we can transfer with the lowest fee of 1 sat/vbyte and get confirmed very quick.",

But as every wave I think sooner or later it will just be processed and we will come back to more \"user-friendly\" fees.",

Yes, and there's no need for the OP to use the transaction acceleration in the first if he's not in a hurry cause normally it is easy for low fee transactions to get confirmation during the weekend since the transaction was sent on Saturday he just needs to wait for some hours and the transaction will be included into a block.",

I haven't seen this amount of unconfirmed transactions for such a long period of time earlier.This problem affected not only OP, but also all bitcoin users.Knowing how many thousands of transactions are in the mempool makes it impossible to know when this transaction congestion will end. Where can I find out (see) how many transactions have been confirmed in the last day and how many new unconfirmed transactions are added to the mempool also per day (for the last)? Knowing this information, it is possible to predict the approximate dynamics with confirmation of the remaining 250k transactions. Of course, changes are possible, but this way can find out when this jam with high commissions will end.You have never seen this, probably because this phenomenon arose for the first time (on this scale).",
