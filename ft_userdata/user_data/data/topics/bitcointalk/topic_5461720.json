An escrow won't be of too much help.Someone can send you PayPal, and you can escrow the bitcoins, but what guarantees that the other party won't charge back the transaction in a couple of days?Same thing with GCs/vouchers. A chargeback is possible, and like you said one can use them and claim that they don't work, which one can probably avoid maybe with live screen sharing or something but it's probably not worth all the trouble. Either go with someone you've dealt with multiple times and trust or a reputable gift card service.",

In such a case, you can easily be scammed.Here in the forum, we have some reputable members who run some escrow services, and deals can also be conducted transparently here in the forum so that other members can be aware of the deal. By so doing, you can rest assured that you are in safe hands.",

Usually there is a risk anyways. What if I’m selling a GPU and the buyer claims I sent him a rock over the mail? At the end of the day you’ll have to record every step of the deal and the escrow has to decide on an outcome even if he can’t be absolutely sure of what happened.",

And then ask the buyer to start recording a screen video before sending the voucher until redeeming.It is much safer I guess than asking escrow to temporarily log in to buyer's account and redeem by itself.",

I am not much of a person who uses escrow platforms but once there was a platform (do not recall the name exactly but it's something Z) the platform was new and they enables the review for members to do. But I can't join the review but still tried it. And that platform was good. On that idea. Once you send the vouchers the middle man (that platform) will hold them and on the other side the buyer will get the notification that you (the seller) have released the vouchers. So, the platform will ask the buyer to release the funds and once the transaction from both sides will be done things will be handed over to both parties. (fund from seller to buyer and voucher from seller to buyer).This means, when the transaction is done, you are good to go, now it's not your problem whether that voucher works or not because you must have shown them before the validity of the vouchers and you are legit from your side so you will not be investigated.But this could also be used to scam people who would try to sell invalid vouchers too. Overall, my point is, there are many escrow projects which ar good. You are making mistakes and bearing losses just because you have some flaws in your rules which you have to change. Like at first, you should show them the validity and then no money back rules is good once the other party receive the assets.",

I mean an escrow is just a middleman for sure it is possible to get a scam even though you already have escrow, I mean I have a similar case when I do a transaction online on Facebook related to NFTs and cryptocurrency. If your selling something like a token for sure buyer is not going to trust you that easily, there where no way to fairly send both the sender and the receiver at the same time unless you have something like a platform or maybe something like a middleman.The thing here is to pick an escrow that you already trusted or that is already well-known in the community If you're going to escrow here in the forum there are already a lot of trusted members here in the forum that is already trusted as an escrow probably already handle thousands of transactions here in the forum. if you do that it is almost guaranteed that you're not gonna get scammed. The thing scammer does is the scammer know the middleman and when you send your funds to the middleman both of them are going to disappear and scam your money, I mean it's easy just dont pick an escrow that you dont know or you dont trust.",

In a online transaction there is no way to trust somebody if he is not well recognized or you personally know him. In case of voucher i think there is a way to charge back the money even after few days but if you send any kind of crypto assets its gone forever. There will not be any way to get it back so it is bit risky to do P2P trade for a voucher.",

If the escrow came out of nowhere then chances for you or to other people to get scam is so high. But if you hire a reputable escrow here then you can assure that the deal done will be successful. But also make sure you didn't make a deal using a huge amount since even if they are reputable and if they see a huge money at stake then maybe they might shift then decide to scam the deal which is entrusted to them.",

I think you are new to your work because you must have some experience with the escrow platforms like how they work, I read some replies from members and many had already said how Escrow platform could be used. But from your scenario I think you are new to this kind of work. Because you could make a agreement with the buyer you are going to sell voucher that, there will be no refund after the trade occurs. And once you made an escrow using any platform you will automatically receive the funds.And I prefer you to not trust anyone here until you met someone in person because BTT is full of newbies who are always eager to scam you so I don't want you to be getting scammed in such a small trade. You should get ideas from different Escrow platform like how could you solve your problem using them instead of relying on some BTT member. The risk will be more if you shift to trust on BTT members.",
