Owning a portrait will make it possible to access and reap the benefits of the syndicate.Roadmap:Phase 1: Building the Foundation:Following the reveal of the public drop, a community Syndicate will be established and 50% of the initial revenue will be split between the DAO and our Incubation wing.Phase 2: Framing & Burn:V1 of the Framing Marketplace is released to the public. Emily holders are able to curate the Genesis/Public Gallery experience by exhibiting their favorite NFT’s.Phase 3: NFT Contest:Leveraging our existing infrastructure to help projects experiment and create new solutions.

Phase 4: The $EMILY Syndicate HQ and Gallery:Building necessary infrastructure that will not only help Emily holders to exhibit and auction their works but help improve the whole traditional art/auction industry that is now riddled with countless inefficiencies.Phase 5: Collaborate and Innovate:We aspire to build innovative solutions to ensure the autonomous functioning of our DAO. Improving Syndicates governance protocol, codifying our burn mechanics, and securing treasuries long-term prosperity.The Endgame:Building an ecosystem of related business activities that complement each other and bring value back to the Syndicate.

I'm shelving this matter for now, though, for a more intriguing matter.The statement of special privileges in form of taking part in real life art exhibitions and decentralised art auctions, wouldn't it raise concerns such as cases in the past like An A.I.-Generated Picture Won an Art Prize. Artists Aren’t Happy or the most recent one, although \"less controversial\", Man Posts Photo Of Children's Book Co-Written By AI, Internet Divided?In my personal opinion, ethical wise, coming from someone whom cantaloupe drawing can be very easily mistaken as a mishaped volleyball or... a surreal-sphere-shaped-interdimension-hole-that-expresses-the-artist's-protest-against-over-popullation, it's not fair that an AI generated image --or for your case, suppose you're different from deepai or midjourney as the art will be produced by artists instead of AI-- or a work done by someone can be claimed and auctioned as if it's the owner's own effort.",

You facilitate someone to ask artists to draw beautiful mountain shrouded by mist, painted in a sombre tone or a meadow so green that it's like heaven, a small silhouette of lone tree in the distance. Not a... cartoonish monkey with red hat and sunglasses and a joint on its mouth. What I tried to say is, your platform offered a service if \"real\" art instead of those... NFT images that's... absurd --not in the way of abstract-ism of an art branch-- right?",
