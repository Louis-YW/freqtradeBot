  "content": "In mid-June, U.Today reported the percentage of Shiba Inu's long-term holders as 19%, while that of midterm holders was then 77%, only 3% held onto their tokens for less than a month at the time. Back in late December 2021, it was reported that Shiba Inu holders were largely short and midterm holders, with the percentage of each category given as 14% and 86%, respectively. At that point, the percentage of long-term holders, or those that have held for more than a year, was zero. Fast forward to now, and the Shiba Inu holders' composition has shifted dramatically, with long-term owners now outnumbering short-term owners. This might imply a shift in investor focus from a short-term view to a long-term one. This comes as the crypto markets entered into a \"bearish phase\" or \"crypto winter’’, in which altcoins saw between 70%-80% of their present peaks wiped off.Read full details on U.Today https://u.today/shiba-inu-long-term-holders-are-increasing-as-investors-shift-focus",

      "body": "I would say the bearish market plays a big role in this new development of long-term holders increase, the market condition is not very favorable to many holders to want to sell their shib so it is very likely holding is the best option for now. But that could change once the market bounce back and the price is up again, until that happened and the number of holders remains the same or even higher, i won't considered this result as authentic just yet.",

Influencers plays huge role in this as well also some of the biggest exchanges listed that coin so people go with the hype but when we have stats for the long term I mean the real long term like for years then we can conclude that Shiba got the trust from its holders.",

Thats why iam still holding it soon shib will be like doge hold hold. don't expect too much in a meme coins mate because even before that there's a lot of holders of shiba it fell like rock in just a short period of time and the situation getting worse as well because market suddenly turned into bearish. So on this situation it's skeptical to believe that because of the percentage of holders in the market at the moment it has a chance to recover.. Well maybe a quick hype in the long run but for sure it will not last and most of holders will stuck up again in it if they missed to get out earlier before the manipulation as its very common event in a meme coins.",

As a result, since the bear market has started, they continue to hold it in the hope of making up for their losses. That's all for me, the reason for these hand-holds. Besides, shiba is already a complete doge imitation. I can't say if it can be like Doge or not, but imitations always follow the original. It was Elon Musk that enabled both cryptocurrencies to rise rapidly in this market and enter the trends. To me, they're both a total meme coin. You never know what they'll do, so if I had the option, I'd keep the doge, not the shiba for the long haul.Now people are no longer interested in hearing Elon's tweets on twitter, they don't care about meme coin being laughed at because of the previous hype whale impact increasing trading volume of meme coin, I think Shib coin future recovery is not Elon influence but should release new community supported innovation for recovery High.",

I can’t see any big progress with SHIB and without a hype, meme token is nothing because they have no real usage in the market. If you want to buy and hold SHIB, make sure you are ready for the risk because it may not reach the same level DOGE did, its all about the hype.",

But I have to say, if you are trusting shiba to make you money, then I have an amazing offer of a bridge, I can sell that to you for a big discount. People who are holding are not idiots, they are aware of what they are holding, well not all of course but many of them do and the main reason they do it anyway is because they realized long time ago what the market is all about. Market is not all about great products, its about having hype and price going up, if you put a shit on a platter and people still buy it, then you will sell it without no questions. This is what people are hoping would happen, nothing more.",

Also it is pretty obvious that back in the December of 2021 there were no holder that held Shiba Inu for more than 1 year because obviously Shiba Inu did not even exist a for a full year back then lul.So i really don't think that the statistics you posted above are a positive indicator for Shiba Inu. This news sounds more like it is written by a Shiba Inu holder itself that is very high on copium. I think the longterm trend for Shiba Inu goes downwards.",

I hold SHIB also for a long time but I wouldn't expect that high because of the holders that have billions of it. Once the price hits 0.0001USD a lot of holders will already be dumping just as investing today will double your money by the time reach that price. But I'm more interested if the development of thier metaverse will really go forward because it might just hit 0.01",
