For example, NotATether's post has been made on September 19, 2023, 10:45:22 AM (UTC), not Today at 10:45:22 AM.Check the first page of thread once again and if the times are not shown correctly, do a hard refresh (CTRL+F5).

This may happen sometimes due to the page not being refreshed or an error in the timing of the computer or mobile.Most of the time I leave the forum page open in the browser and close the computer and when I later turn on the browser the old page appears with the previous time when I close. I have to refresh the page to get the correct updated page.",
