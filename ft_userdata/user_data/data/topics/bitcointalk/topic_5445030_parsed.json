  "content": "Im making an exchange like sideshift.ai.I have 2 questions. 1. How do i generate a new deposit adress for each new user and each coin?Like if you want to exchange BTC to ETH, you will get a BTC adress/QR code to send to.But that unique adress needs to go to my binance account, or at least the deposit has to go to binance account.  Is there like any API or so that generates sub adresses and then binding them all to my static btc adress on binance?2. When a user send crypto to the deposit adress, he will get a notification that they are accepted by the blockchain network.  Something like: \" thanks for your deposit, We will now exchange your BTC and send 0.124 ETH  to your wallet. You can now close your browser if you want\".I will have like 50 different coins in total, so not only BTC and ETH.",

Its not rocketscience making a small exchange, and its even easier to maintain when its all set up. It like i would say\" if you have to ask how to fix a car, you shouldnt drive one\".",

Then i would get notification when his coins arrive to my binance account and then just send him back 5% less ETH if i charged a 5% fee.But he still would not get any notification that i have recived his coins while he is waiting or me to complete the exchange.  I like you 1-4 description, thats exactly how i want it to work. Do i need a node for each coin, like if i have 50 different coins, do i need a node for each one?And what could that cost?",

But if you're going to deal mainly with evm compatible networks then I would suggest you look into Alchemy, Infura, and Quicknode. They all have free tiers (there are limits on how many requests you can make, but it's still good) so maybe you can start with that at first and then upgrade.As for your comment above, then yes, an instant exchange like Sideshift may be easier to develop and maintain compared to a CEX, but you should still take security seriously.",

And charging 1% is easy. If the pair trades at 1 to 100, then you exchange at 1 to 99 or 1 to 101.But I see what you are doing. You don't want to hold any inventory and you want to act as a broker between the customer and the exchange.Many wallets do what you want to do. They set up a relationship with an exchange that allows them to be a broker. Checkout Binance Connect",
