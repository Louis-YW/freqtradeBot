There are few females who know about cryptocurrency, are investors and active members of this forum. The number of females who know about cryptocurrency will also be increasing, so maybe soon as you keep talking to people about cryptocurrency, you will meet more females who know crypto.Quote from: koinkab on July 11, 2023, 10:00:03 AMhave i been talkingto the wrong group of people :-)  It is most likely you have been talking to the wrong group of people or not talked to enough people.",

      "body": "You’d need to talk to hundreds, if not thousands of people to get any semi reliable results, notice trends etc. I think now, in 2023, there are so many people involved with bitcoin & crypto but we still do not have mainstream adoption. I think probably most people who have bitcoin & crypto are under 50 maybe & possibly mostly male but any more specific than that, it’s hard to say without doing a very big sample size survey.",

      "body": "^I agree with DeathAngel's point about as Bitcoin becomes more and more popular/adoptedthe age demographics change.I would have thought up to say 3 years ago that the majority of people into Bitcoin wereaged around 30, purely based on the fact they would have been 19/20 when Bitcoin came about.Just my thinking.Everyone I know personally or people I am in contact with on a regular basis and are into Bitcoinare over 45!",

      "body": "You would probably get a similar result if you ask about any other financial asset or investment vehicle - for some reason only a few women are attracted to the world of investing and to the world of bitcoin. It happens also with some disciplines like computing and Engineering, and I am not sure if this is because they just (at least most) are not attracted to it or because of the education.",

      "body": "That’s an interesting observation. I think you might be talking to the wrong group of people, because according to some surveys, the crypto demographics are quite different from what you have experienced.For example, according to the 2021 Global Crypto User Index by Binance Research, which surveyed over 61,000 crypto users across 178 countries and regions, the average age of crypto users is 34 years old, and 95% of them are male. The survey also found that 55% of crypto users own crypto as part of a long-term investment strategy, and 38% of them have a distrust of the current financial system - https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/Global_Crypto_Index_2021.pdfAnother source, Statista, which compiled data from various sources on cryptocurrency adoption in 56 different countries worldwide, found that Turkey has the highest percentage of respondents who indicated they either owned or used cryptocurrencies (20%), followed by Brazil (18%) and Colombia (18%). The lowest percentages were found in Japan (4%), Denmark (4%) and Sweden (4%). The global average was 9% - https://www.statista.com/topics/7705/cryptocurrency-adoption-among-consumers/So, based on these sources, it seems that crypto is more popular among young males, especially in emerging markets, than among older females or people in developed countries. Of course, these surveys may not be representative of the entire population, and there may be other factors that influence crypto adoption, such as regulation, education, income, etc. But I hope this gives you some insight into the global crypto user base.",

I know with time you will meet females that invest and are dedicated to Bitcoin (crypto)",

Ideally people need to start investing in their 20's, even if it's just a little. Investments that early will snowball over 30-40 years. If used for nothing else, doesn't hurt to throw some BTC into cold storage and let it sit for some number of years. I wouldn't rely on government sponsored pensions/social programs. It likely won't be there when they retire.",
