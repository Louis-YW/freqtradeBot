What is your opinion about this?Read about the news from here:https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-to-make-new-all-time-highs-within-24-months-coinshares-csoIf I will have to be positive about bitcoin price, I always think that this year will only be full of bear market, that makes me still continue to think that it is possible the price of bitcoin may drop more, drop more in order to rise more in the years to come. All I am thinking is that a significant rise like that may not occur before halving, halving will be in 2024. Is it possible for bitcoin to reach all-time-time by 2023 year before bitcoin halving, or by 2024 according to Coinshares CSO analysis?",

However, you mention July 2023, while this CEO talks about a period of 24 months, so he didn't really say anything other than that the new ATH will be sometime within 2 years, which means maybe 1-2 months after the halving in 2024.If you ask me, it's an ordinary paid article to promote the company, that CEO doesn't know anything more than you or me.",

But perhaps this is because of what we have heard from some BTC speculators who also try to force a bullrun by making an analyzis of supercycle. Yep maybe he have heard or watched the sames videos of those guys.I however thought of it too because I really think we have reached the bottom so far, and its already abiut to burst up in weeks. If we also have to related to the economic crisis today, I say BTC will be the savior for all the failing currencies, its time to be in the mainstream news.",

Is it possible for bitcoin to reach all-time-time by next year before bitcoin halving? Even in the article they are not claiming that the price would rally by 2023, they are also expecting the market to recover by 2024 and that is when the next halving happens and before that it is impossible to think that we would see another market rally considering we know how the market usually performs throughout its existence and the best bet for the next rally is halving and it would be wishful thinking if anyone thinks we would see before that .",

I think more likely is we see an ATH in late 2024 but let’s wait & see.That is true, I have edited the OP for correction, July 2023 is 12 months from now while 24 months from now is July 2024. I too believe that people will buy bitcoin more after halving. The first halving was on 28 November 2012, the second halving was on 9 July 2016, the third halving was on 11 May 2020. Looking at this having period, it is almost 4 years before the next halving but not up to four years, because of that, I think 2024 halving may occur before May and it may be more than 2 months to July by that time. But I too can be wrong, it is possible that halving can even occur after during or after May 2024.I understand your point though, the price of bitcoin still always take some months before reaching all-time-time and it can take over 2 months or more, but we do not know yet when the halving will occur.",

Maybe the same as what happen before where most of huge bull runs happen on halving this time maybe we can say that $100k will definitely reached since for sure once hype build up the price would shoot up again and for sure this event is the most awaited time of all people here.",

Now, it's obviously time to completely destroy this halving scenario by either refusing to go to a new ATH after it or by making one before the actual halving and dropping afterward. But yeah, going for a 24 months period is the new most accurate prediction they can make without risking to look like a few just a few months later.",
