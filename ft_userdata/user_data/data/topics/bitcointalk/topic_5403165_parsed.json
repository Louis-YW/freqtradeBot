  "content": "Bitcoin has only existed in an era of MASSIVE MONEY PRINTING by the Federal Reserve, that started in response to the 2008 Financial Crisis.   When the Federal Reserve is printing money, stocks, and most other financial assets go up by a huge amount.   The best example of this is MARCH 2020, stocks and Crypto crashed on an epic scale ( Bitcoin 3000 ) when the economy basically shut down.   The federal reserve did a MASSIVE amount of money printing and stocks and other financial assets miraculously recovered in just a couple weeks.Money printing and zero interest rates ( AKA:  FREE MONEY ) create huge speculations in worthless schemes that would never normally exist.  Tulip Mania, Dot Com Bubble, Zombie Companies that never make money, Cryptos, etc, etc.....NOW:   Inflation is now very bad, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates and withdraw money from the system.   Now is the time when we see worthless companies and worthless Cryptos collapse.  Indeed, several crypto lenders have already collapsed and even more are in the process of collapsing.  The Federal Reserve must fight inflation and will NOT be saving the markets this time.  Bitcoin has ZERO intrinsic value, it is only worth what someone else will pay for it.   Without the speculative bubble of the past 14 years to support Bitcoin, will go close to its value of ZERO.Bitcoin has NEVER seen an era of rising interest rates and tight money before.  This time IS DIFFERENT !!!!!  Ignore this fact at your own risk",

I was starting to worry that something had happened to you.I'm still waiting for that sub $1k bitcoin you promised so many times. I've got a stack of fiat just sitting here for the last 3 years slowly rapidly devaluing waiting to buy in! $1k is definitely coming this time, right? Does Peter Schiff promise? Quote from: HardFacts on June 18, 2022, 11:40:12 PMMoney printing and zero interest rates ( AKA:  FREE MONEY ) create huge speculations in worthless schemes that would never normally exist.Absolutely it did. And now we are seeing all these scam shitcoins, NFTs, and DeFi nonsense exit scam and disappear. Bitcoin will be just fine though, don't worry.Quote from: HardFacts on June 18, 2022, 11:40:12 PMIndeed, several crypto lenders have already collapsed and even more are in the process of collapsing.Good. These companies are fractional reserve centralized scams. Guess what hasn't collapsed? My wallet software or my private keys. The sooner everyone gets their money off these platforms and in to their own wallets, the better.",

Banks offer a stable or floating rate for your investment/deposit every 3/6/12 months. Bitcoin on the other hand, doesn't guarantee you a certain percentage of performance, but the possibility to rise in the future. It can't guarantee you that it'll earn its money. History has shown that the probabilities of recovery are decent, however, you're not earning an X amount per Y days/months. It's an asset similar to how stocks perform.Don't get me wrong, bank's interest is close to zero and can't outperform the yearly inflation rate.",

We see huge fluctuations in the short term, and in the short term the best asset varies. But for long term investors this doesn’t matter as much, there’s a reason Bitcoin is the best performing asset in the long term, it doesn’t just happen accidentally for over a decade. And we know there’s no guarantees, but doing nothing will guarantee a loss of all the time we spent working, for nothing in return. Bitcoin is risky, but fiat is more, and the market will just take the risk into account, it won’t hamper demand.When i first got into investing i considered every possibility there is, before i even really knew about bitcoin. I compared everything from taxes and other factors(also the state of fiat) of each asset class, and my conclusion was Bitcoin is the best investment there is. No one introduced me to it. And other players in the market will act similarly. And then only after this, i learned what Bitcoin is really about.And you’re right, you're not earning an X amount per Y days/months, but the reality is, at the banks you're actually loosing an X amount per Y days/months. There’s no reason for the majority of the market to bring their money back to the banks, first it’s a secure loss, second people know how unstable banks are at the moment (with no sign of betterment). Just because regular people are still asleep, doesn’t mean the market is.Bad times are the best test for how strong something is, this is also a chance for Bitcoin to prove itself, for people who were unsure before.Quote from: Ultegra134 on June 19, 2022, 03:39:00 PMStaking in such cases can provide more guaranteed results in terms of investment, usually surpassing 10-15% APY.
