The fact is that Bitcoin uses energy and generates waste like other industries but compared to those industries it is not worth much and is not the main cause of climate change as the bitcoin haters are spreading. Bitcoin is like other industries, it brings profits to everyone, creates jobs for a lot of people, thereby limiting dependence on the government and reducing pressure on the government. So the energy use of bitcoin is as reasonable as other industries, let alone today we are also gradually switching to using renewable energy.",

      "body": "The future of cryptocurrency transactions may be in Mutual Bank, Mutual Credit, and Mutual Exchange cryptocurrencies and forBitcoin itself is the best invention of mankind because it does not require a financial institution/government to maintain its value. Because of the mutuality, its value continues to gradually increase and we are all a part of it.Seems like an interesting idea, and it might be useful. However, a closer look at the details will reveal that bitcoin is not completely mutually beneficial. Mutuality means that contributions are exchanged in mutual agreement, with neither party getting more than he or she deserves.On the other hand, bitcoin pays miners with bitcoins they don't work for, which means they get more than they deserve. Still, embedded in this idea is a user-based currency philosophy that may have significant implications in the future.",

Not really. The smallest possible network is just one node doining the mining and storing blockchain. This node can even send transactions between their own addresses. This node doesn't need other nodes to make Bitcoin more secure, everything is secured by cryptography. Of course on practice its better to have a large network, but still Bitcoin was designed in a way that you don't need to depend on anybody else.

One node must interact with other nodes on the network too and together, they contribute to make decentralization for Bitcoin network.However, if you say Bitcoin can bring mutual profit between Bitcoin users, it is not always true. Sometimes people have mutual benefit like between Bitcoiners who broadcast their transactions for selling, taking profit and Bitcoin miners who confirm transactions and get block reward as well as transaction fee.Sometimes it brings profit to one user and loss to another one. The market itself is zero sum, one wins and another loses so no mutually win here.",

Yes. I'd agree with you but, to some point.....just as usual.I mean, these whole ideology is pure and was operated upon -- way back -- when we had less traffic. Taking an analytical survey will make you understand that we have a bustling number of personnels and transactions; engulfed in some voluminous -- manually statistical, auto synchronized walls, columns and rows of those trnx called the BLOCKCHAIN.We have alot of trnx and getting just one person excluded isn't gonna give down the process, or is it? I'd agree with you cus YES, if everyone decides not to run the P2P then, we'll all have the whole Bitcoin stuff doomed; I wouldn't wanna start making some elaborations but for sure, the worst would become our fate. Lemme deviate a bit.The big question is; why would everyone even decide to stop the MUTUALITY as you explained? Yes there are reasons; you dunno? It's unknown to me either.QuoteBitcoin mining is not depleting our ecosystem, it's not the cause of green house effect neither is it the cause of climate change.It was never and will never be the major cause of green house effects.",
