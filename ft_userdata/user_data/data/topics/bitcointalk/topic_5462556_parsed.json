  "content": "Is there a genocide taking place in South Africa?For those of us who remember the days of apartheid in South Africa, we probably recall believing that we were on the \"right side\" of the argument if we supported ending the policy.  I have no personal experience with the country, other than having a white friend who participated in the Rhodesia-Zimbabwe civil war, and hearing his stories and his take on the political issues of the day.  I'm aware that one side of the story is not enough to make a judgment and his is the only first-hand account of the situation that I've ever heard.  It's worth noting that my friend is also vehemently opposed to apartheid, but he does argue that the implementation of the new governments and their policies were flawed.Here we are, three decades later and there's still contention, fighting, and what appears to be a genocide of white property owners.  The most recent issues are related to property rights, specifically rights to the farmland in the country of South Africa.  Here's an article from 2021 that paints the picture: https://www.accord.org.za/ajcr-issues/farm-attacks-or-white-genocide-interrogating-the-unresolved-land-question-in-south-africa/Recently there was a rally held by the Economic Freedom Part and one of it's leaders, Julius Malema started chanting \"Kill the Boer\" (kill the white man,) and the crowd dutifully joined in the chant.  Since the EFT is a left leaning party (self described Marxists,) their aggressions have largely gone ignored by the American media.  However, a recent article in the NYT went so far as to excuse the allegations of murderous aggression.  Here is a substack article by someone who differs with NYT's editorial: https://roddreher.substack.com/p/kill-the-boer-murder-white-southI'll admit I'm very removed from the situation, but I still want to know what's going on.  I have no trust in the media in my country, they are more prone to obfuscate or straight up omit some of the more important news depending on political implications.So, I'm asking those who have better insight into the issues facing South Africa today, what's going on?",

      "body": "Officially ending apartheid didn't make it disappear. I've been to South Africa, it's a beautiful country. But racial segregation is still very real. I wouldn't be surprised if it's worse now than it was during apartheid.The genocide on white people in South Africa has been going on for years. Thousands have been tortured, raped and murdered. What's new, is politicians openly encouraging mass murder.By killing and chasing away the people who produce their food, they're following Zimbabwe's example. That didn't end well for them.--Knight Hider",
