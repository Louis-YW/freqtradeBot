The coins are sent to a specific address inorder to trace the transactions that would be made from the address. I do not know how dangerous the attack is, but if you see anything like that, just use coin control to freeze the dust coin or sent the dust coins as donation to a charity address.",

As Charles-Tim pointed out, if you receive the dust coins and create a transaction later with the dust as part of the inputs the attacker can link up all your addresses which has UTXOs in that transaction.

Even now if BTC goes up 10x from where it is now it's still under $1.00What I think is odd, is the fact that I have some coins in cold storage that only have inbound tx and nothing else. And those have at times gotten dusted. So it's not like it's hard to trace, it's only one input you would have to follow.Sometimes there are advertising or messages tagged to it, https://www.walletexplorer.com/txid/5bc44f106ae6bb52b87cdb61d8982fdf9076a29e952a49d4c86217483aba21c2-Dave",

      "body": "I find the article from Binance Academy pretty efficient to give a good definition of dusting attacks :QuoteA dusting attack refers to a relatively new kind of malicious activity where hackers and scammers try and break the privacy of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency users by sending tiny amounts of coins to their wallets. The transactional activity of these wallets is then tracked down by the attackers, who perform a combined analysis of different addresses to deanonymize the person or company behind each wallet.They are not inherently dangerous regarding your funds, but can lead to losses if used as a subset of a long-prepared attack.Dusting attacks make it easy to track your activity, and can be used as a \"tracking device\" to then attempt to infect your equipment with more dangerous attacks such as ransomware, cryptojacking etc.I have the feeling that the BTC network has become too expensive for dusting attacks, but it is very common on BEP20 for example.The best thing to do is to ignore them IMO",

When fees are higher than just a few sat/vbyte, adding a dust input increases the fee by more than it's own value. That's a waste of funds.Optional: lock/freeze dust inputs in your wallet, so you don't accidentally send them.",

The \"solution\" is to only fund them with small amounts, and don't use funds that shouldn't be linked together.

But I guess these explanations are a bit too complicated for me to understand (I've read the threads on Trustwallet and co, already I have to digest these informations). I have to say that I don't venture into the us part of the forum, there is a lot of information to assimilate. Enough to learn a whole life!",

With dust attack, the attacker may be able to link your different addresses together. If one of the linked addresses is known to be owned by you, then the other linked addresses will be known to be owned by you too.",
