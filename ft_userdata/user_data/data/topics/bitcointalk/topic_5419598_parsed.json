A project roadmap claims the concept is four years old but they bought their domain on November 5th this year! This created a ridiculous situation. This is a sure scam website. This website is incomplete, clicking on terms and conditions does not provide any information. Thanks to OP for exposing this website.",

He now has 21k followers. Maybe it dropped following that tweet, but I doubt it. That guy is far from an influencer. Most of those followers are probably fake or bought. His tweets have no engagement whatsoever. There are no likes, comments, or shares of his activity. It's an unimportant Twitter account shilling a scam.",

Bought followers, Twitter has started recently, a bit before before the acquisition, to really hunt fake followers services so no surprise some are losing thousands in a day when a whole farm gets nuked.As for this guy, he's just a moron, after that tweet he posted:QuoteDear @elonmuskPlease kindly confirm you are aware of the below:@TwitterÂ present to you Biggest Cryptocurrencies, #TWTTOKEN And he's specialized in \"IT | Cybersecurity\".That aside, I was curious why I got results from a year ago with the hashtag for #TWTToken, with this multitude of tokens they got the same name as \"trust wallet token\". We've reached the point where we definitely need 4 letters for coins, this is like cities running out of telephone codes or car number plates.",

No, not needed. 90% of those should just be wiped from existence. We have reached a point where it needs to become harder for douchebags to create scam projects supported by fake shittokens whose only use case is to take Bitcoin and other established alts out of your pockets and put them in the pockets of said douchebags. A bit of regulation for altcoins is definitely coming.",

No, not needed. 90% of those should just be wiped from existence.Seeing your reply I was curious, what's the highest token that has 4 letters, opened coingecko and, I realized I'm out of touch with altcoins.So, I'm guessing you'll be surprised too, in the top 10 coins there are four with five letters and one with five.USDT, USDC, BUSD, DOGE and MATIC.I counted 20 more with 4 in the top100 before I gave up.Maybe we won't run out of 3 or 4 letters but for sure we're going to run out *USD* 4 letters abbreviations, there are 87 damn stable coins!As you said, this has to stop, it's worse trying to recognize a coin that going through hundreds of listed companies on the stock market, and scammers take advantage of this every day.",
