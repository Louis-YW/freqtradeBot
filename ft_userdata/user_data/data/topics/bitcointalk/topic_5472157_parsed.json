Finding another partner could help him and not partnering with gambling. He has the money and I think there are more things than just putting every time and effort into gambling. I was lonely before but I only drank and smoked for a week and then I got back on my feet after that. I mean, we cannot stay on living bad habits because it will just ruin our lives. There's always an end to loneliness and that is by finding another thing to do that would matter in our lives. If he is your real friend then you better suggest to him a better choice than he keeps on doing this because at some point he might get sick and he will regret that all that money was wasted in gambling while he cannot pay his hospital bills. Or you could point him out to organizations who specialize in this kind of problem because this is a serious thing that is happening to him.",

Hahaha.Prostitutes are cheaper and could be more effective in making himself feel better. Get those high-class prostitutes who I would be sure will be prettier than his wife.",

But if they if they realize that they do is just another addition of stress that they are facing then provably they could able to stop on what activities they are doing. But over the months of playing then they enjoyed it since they meet a new set of friends that they think its easy to mingle with then provably this will result to became addicted especially if the new people around them is a compulsive gambler. If you can do something to the person you know especially if he's close to you maybe try to exert some efforts to guide him and give some good advice so he can control his self not to lose or use $500 a day since this is huge amount of money to spend on gambling in a day.",

How would you judge someone who says they don't gamble because it's fun, is that a sign of a gambling addiction? I am not a psychologist, but when you feel lonely gambling doesn't sound like the best activity for you in my opinion. Especially online gambling is something we all do alone at home from our PC or on our mobile phone. It's not really something we do as a group with friends and there is no real human interaction. When you feel lonely don't you want to talk to somebody? Maybe have a dinner with a colleague, or go for a walk with a friend? There are so many better things to do when you feel lonely than staying at home alone and gamble online. I am not sure if there is a connection between gambling addiction and loneliness, but I wouldn't think so. Addictions are pretty common with substances like alcohol, drugs and cigarettes, all these things usually people consume in a group with others and not alone. That is why I wouldn't expect that loneliness alone leads to addictions. You must have been interested in gambling before, it shouldn't come out of nowhere just because you are alone and unhappy. It would be better to try and fix our life first and not look at gambling to fix our problems.",

But his friend can let him know that stopping the addiction comes from inside of the gamblers mind which is the first thing to do. The second is that he really needs a girlfriend if he tries to settle things with this wife but his wife not accepting anymore. There are better women out there.",

Gambling can be a temporary way to forget about feeling alone or sad. Even if someone is alone in a casino, the fun and the feeling of being around others might attract them. If someone is upset or doesn't have much support from others, they might turn to gambling to feel better, and that could lead to addiction.

People gamble for different reasons which include fun and money and in most cases because of both. Not gambling for fun is not a sign of addiction because there are still other genuine reasons to gamble. Many responsible gamblers gamble because of money and they are just okay. Gambling addiction is when your betting activities become uncontrollable. The moment you cannot control the drive or motivation to gamble, that's a sign of gambling disorder.

They begin the seek activities that would keep them company. Hard drugs, alcohol, video games, and even pornography addition can be an offshoot of loneliness.Your friend is in deep trouble in the sense that he will soon become indebted.

Whether or not that is a gambling addiction or food addiction, drug addiction or even an alcohol addiction (although one might suppose that is also considered a drug addiction). Remember what addiction is: A malfunction of brain chemicals which give you the feeling of happiness and reward. If there is something wrong with your dopamine receptors or the levels of dopamine, then it can lead to addiction as a symptom.The best thing to do is go cold turkey until your brain chemicals rebalance itself back to normal. That can take months or even years, depending on the severity and time of your addiction.Loneliness is what makes you crave for more dopamine.

However, maybe for some people, in my personal opinion too, there are definitely those who vent their feelings of loneliness in their lives or when their lives are in chaos by gambling. Because it is certain that people who are experiencing loneliness in their lives need entertainment so that their feeling of loneliness is reduced a little. So it's normal if your friend chooses to gamble when they are experiencing problems in their life. Because at a gambling place he will definitely meet lots of friends who can at least entertain him (offline gambling). However, there are still pluses and minuses. Because for example, when your friend's feelings are broken and your friend decides to gamble. The biggest fear is when your friend cannot control himself well and in the end your friend could experience big losses in gambling.So in my personal opinion, when hurt or confused. It's better to calm down first and not take it out on other things, including gambling. Because when someone's feelings are in turmoil, that person certainly doesn't care about profits or losses. Therefore, gambling is not the right thing to use as an outlet when your heart and feelings are broken. Because I personally think gambling should be played by people who have good feelings and a calm soul. Because I personally think gambling should be played by people who have good feelings and a calm soul. Because if gambling is played by someone who is experiencing depression, it is feared that when that person wakes up from his depression, he will be even worse because after he realizes, he has spent his money.",
