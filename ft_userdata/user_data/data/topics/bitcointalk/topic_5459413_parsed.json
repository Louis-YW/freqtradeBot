Then I checked his thread and absolutely every reply seems to be done by him. 99% of replies are from accounts that have only 1 activity. A user registered on Bitcointalk just to write a post in his thread to highlight how smooth deal he or she had with FmaTR. Definitely, this is absurd and we can confidently say that this user creates fake accounts to write positive reviews about his service. He has been doing this since 2022, idk if that got unnoticed or if that is okay on this forum but one thing is for sure, this user is a scammer and liar.Here is his thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399661.140I want to apologize to him, I tried his service and this guy is not only legit but very cool!",

I really don't believe that anyone believes in what he does.QuoteHe has been doing this since 2022, idk if that got unnoticed or if that is okay on this forum but one thing is for sure, this user is a scammer and liar.You cannot be sure that he is a scammer if there are still no proven charges against him.

It is especially difficult now that we have a rule that says \"Old post: We generally do not moderate posts this old for on-topicness, substantiveness, multi-posting, and other \"cleanliness\" issues.\" In addition, except for plagiarism or spreading malware, it is extremely difficult to get a permanent ban on this forum.There are even weirder techniques that I've seen, which consist of the OP quoting and then responding to posts that are several months or years old, which of course makes no sense and looks very strange - but it definitely saves them time because they don't have to create new alt accounts.",
