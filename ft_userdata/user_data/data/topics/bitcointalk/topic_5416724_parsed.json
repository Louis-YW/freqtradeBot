Be it sport or casino, that was just an addiction and not encouraging at all. In casino, to have fun, very little amount of money is used in a way you will still spend very little after several games played.",

When users places all his balance in one shot to go big or go home.I have done that a couple of times in the past but never for a big multiplier, i did it ones with 1 bitcoin on 90% chance to win, we are talking about the old times when bitcoin was at $600. Nowadays what i like to do is to chase big multipliers with multiple bets, for example, if i have $100, then place 100 bets of $1 chasing the x2000. The chance to get it is 5%, i know that's really low, but when it hit the profit is massive.",

It's meant to take entertainment. The money part gives you the heat in the adrenaline. Honestly speaking sites are not designed to give you money but to take it away from you. You chose your option how fast you want to lose it.Quotebecause I want to feel the game and if I'm going to lose I want to enjoy my session first.It's all trading. There are two sides, buyer and seller. You are a buyer here so enjoy it as long as you can.Quote from: seoincorporation on October 11, 2022, 01:50:12 PMI have done that a couple of times in the past but never for a big multiplier, i did it ones with 1 bitcoin on 90% chance to win, we are talking about the old times when bitcoin was at $600.$600 still is a good amount to stake in a single shot. But imagine your 1 BTC was in a USB stick and you lost the stick before discovering it in your closet last year LOL",

It kills the thrill if you are doing it in one jackpot shot. This kind of tactic is for those who badly need the money. A high-risk gamble. I have done it once in my life and I will never do it again. I tried to gamble one week of salary in my signature campaign back when I was still new to the industry. I don't really need it and the exchange before in Bitcoin was so low you would just want to risk and double it in dice. It was a loss and I felt my energy was drained for the whole day.",

On dice, I think you are more likely to lose on many occasions if you adopt this strategy and I would probably say it is not a strategy but suicide.I tend to agree if you do it in sports betting, it's because you can analyze which team is most likely to win the match. But on dice, it doesn't work at all. I suggest you don't adopt this method on luck based bets like craps, it's definitely not a good idea if you want to have fun.",

Since they do not necessarily need to feel the enjoyment of gambling via betting, they just want to get this over with by gambling in one single punch, all-out.Personally, I would avoid this kind of \"strategy\" since it somehow ruins the purpose of gambling. If you put all of your resources in one go, then it basically becomes a Hail Mary shot- either you win or you lose. The problem with this, however, stems from its nature that you cannot recover your losses by betting again. Though this is actually more of an advantage rather than a disadvantage as it dissuades you from gambling further.",
