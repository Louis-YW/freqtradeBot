  "content": "So, there is a fake lending service that you can see in the following thread: Loan Service new (Newbie Kingdo Loans)The OP pretends to be giving loans without collateral to several users, probably to try to build up a reputation, but that those of us who have been doing this for years did not believe from the beginning. Quote from: DireWolfM14 on May 31, 2023, 09:18:44 PMThere are no loans being given out here.  This \"lender\" is just a troll with a lot of alt accounts, using them to talk to himself.  Scammers have tried this kind of thing multiple times; he'll pretend to give himself a loan, then use his alts to leave positive reviews for his own accounts.  It's an effort to feign activity and trust.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on June 01, 2023, 06:14:14 PMWell, it's been nearly three days since the OP has logged on, and \"payment day\" is upon us with a little less than 6 hours remaining (UTC time.)  I never expected these loans to get filled, and so far they have not.  If you're going to try to fake some loans to your alts, at least make it believable by sending some sats to the addresses you posted.  What's up with the lack of follow-through?  Of course one needs to assume this lame-brain OP actually has BTC0.076 to transfer.  Anyway, here's a table to help track the \"borrowers\" and their addresses.  Have fun!||.User|| Address|| Amount||||.Amarjoob|| 18SnZ6AEfdb6APiAwFNawqUkcaPq8qk3td|| 0.006||||.Accesstx|| 14hYd8Pn2apu6txZe3DFQwsxXbpodxzPXW|| 0.01||||.masdd|| 1MwfR7uGzoPAzN2XDeuYVbVTLNnRTEQW5W|| 0.03||||.Dlogd123|| 1FQVdKasUXfAa2iXCVVRoLBUdKGFQmd6x8|| 0.03||As you can check, as of today, no funds have been transferred to those addresses.

Perhaps they hoped that, encouraged by the \"successful\" transaction between their alt and fake deals, and possibly the alts themselves left feedback that'll encourage members to leave similar ones, they'll farm the trust and sell them, or use the built-up trust to make a huge loan themselves which will be defaulted.Three, and this is a long reach, attempting to steal the collateral. When there is someone asking for deal and they asked for collateral, they might went, \"you go first, send me the collateral.\" and later never actually send the loan to the borrower. Though they do asking for escrow on their now-deleted thread, it seems that was just barks, not the bites.Whatever that is, wouldn't the fact that they fake deals is enough to warrant some suspicion and advise people to exercise caution upon doing any deal with them?",

There is something suspicious by the silence. Let's put ourselves on the shoes of those people whose username put by DireWolfM14, they --or rather, we-- got a promise that our non-collateral loan was acccepted and then we never received it. If we are real and not the alt of Loansik12, wouldn't one of us, at least one of us, ask for clarification that goes along the line, \"hello good sir, how do you do. When can I have my loan?\", or \"My good sir, I have not yet received the payment.\" or, \"Sir, plz good sir, I need the loan to buy shiba 5 years and be millionaire, I need helping.\"None did.It'll be a different case if Loansik12 PMed them and rejected each of their loan. That'll nicely explain why there is no transaction on each of the wallet and none protested. But that'll be a breach of implicit --or could it be even a written one?-- contract. Loansik12 agreed upon a \"contract\", and then rejected them behind the screen, and most likely unilaterally. At the very least, it entitled them a suspicion. Why else would someone offered a non-collateral service, agreed, only to decline it later on behind the screen?And ultimately, the silence itself. The thread spread from 28th of May to 12th of June, if they're not guilty, or they've send the payment, perhaps to a different address that's changed by mutual agreement behind the screen, they surely would try to defend themselves, provide TX ID, ask the borrower to made testament, or at the very least, those borrower will say something themselves and provide statement that'll defend Loansik12.Can we agree on these?",
