So posting here so-called Satoshi post from an unknown forum would create more misunderstandings and arguments. I don't think it's reasonable to make a post here about these kinds of stuff. Why Satoshi can't post himself here is he real Satoshi? He could claim his account with proper evidence. We don't know if the PGP signature is from real Satoshi address.",

The other thing you could do is just link to where they are posting and let anyone here who is motivated go over there and show the users there why that person is a scammer / troll. Either way, it's probably a waste of time, some people will believe what they want to believe no matter what proof you show them otherwise. Since you said it's a conspiracy forum you probably can't get through their tinfoil hats anyway.....-Dave",

Probably another fake Satoshi. Its quite long since Satoshi's last post. But the rule of thumb of provings oneself here is the access of the wallet he used(even though he might got hack or what? But lol someone created bitcoin can possibly 99.9% knew how to evade potential threat or breach). Maybe we can say he is once he can move funds from Satoshis wallet.",

Dorian Nakamoto, Nick Sabo, Hal Finney, Alan Musk, Gavin Andresen and many others deny that they are Satoshi Nakamoto without any accurate evidence.
