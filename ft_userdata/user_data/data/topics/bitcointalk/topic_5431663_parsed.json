It's good that they listen to me and try to help me.Over the next two days, I described the whole situation again and again (although I did not change the dialog box and each time I asked the operator to read the correspondence with previous colleagues). And they answered me something like this - \"wait a bit. We have transferred your problem to the technical department. You will be contacted during the day.\" BUT DID NOT CONTACT!I will not post screenshots of the chat. I do not want to somehow negatively affect a bookmaker with a good reputation.My purpose of this post is to draw attention to my situation and finally solve it!!! I'm looking forward to the new year. And we need to resolve this issue as soon as possible!Please, the representative of the bookmaker pay attention to me! And solve this stupid problem!Perhaps your holidays have begun and you have left all the work for the robots.

As long as they already respond your ticket, don't need to be worried so much. You need to know most of casinos usually only work on working days, so they're usually slow to respond your ticket and solve your problem during weekday/holiday.",

      "body": "I’m sorry this has happened to you, that’s why i like to verify my account always before depositing or trying to withdraw some large amount of money. Fortunejack wasn’t requiring any KYC verification but suddenly they started doing it unfortunately and locked many people’s funds but once you complete the KYC process you will be able to withdraw your money For you case the problem comes when you try to complete the verification and most likely you need to switch a device to get that link working. Anyway since you said that the support claiming to not receive your emails that is kind of suspicious and illogical if you really did send an email to them and they pretend to not have received any that makes them guilty, but in this period of the year most of support manager aren’t working so you have to wait. Keep us updated",

Please try to follow the right scam reporting format and include all the necessary evidence through screenshots, block explorers etc. Quote from: Kadirlenok on December 26, 2022, 09:12:56 AMI will not post screenshots of the chat. I do not want to somehow negatively affect a bookmaker with a good reputation.Then what is the point of creating the scam accusation?Have you tried verifying via different browsers, devices of Internet network?",

You need to know most of casinos usually only work on working days, so they're usually slow to respond your ticket and solve your problem during weekday/holiday.I think OP became worried when the Futunejack support team claimed not to receive his emails while his email account showed that the message have been delivered. He became more worried when he used the same account to send email messages to his friends and they received the email. This situation made him think that the casino wants to stylishly or fraudulently confiscate his funds.Fortunejack is a well-respected and renowned asino company and I don't think 1849 USDT would make them want to tarnish their image. They have built the fortunejack brand on integrity and your funds is too small to make them lose their hard-earned goodwill. It is also possible that you violated their rules or their is a technical hitch. As you rightly pointed out, the holiday might have contributed to the delay you are experiencing. You should exercise more patience and maybe your issue would be resolved before the new year.",

      "body": "Today, December 28, I received an email that my account has been verified.In fact, the situation is extremely strange.I did not write any evil posts that they want to deceive me. I just wanted to make sure that the money can move not only towards the deposit, but also towards the withdrawal. And in my case there was a delay of 6 days! That's how long I could not complete the verification.The solution to the problem was as simple as possible. It's a shame we didn't think of this sooner. I was asked to log in to my account and attach files through the support chat window. It may not be very confidential, but it quickly solved my problem. Now Fortunejack has such experience in solving problems.I have no complaints about Fortunejack.I can recommend everyone to bet there! I myself will continue to place bets.",
