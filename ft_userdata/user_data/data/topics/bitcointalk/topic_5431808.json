Investing at this point would really be an advantage if you'd be able to determine which coin to invest but investing early would as well expose an investor to risk. Ofcourse profit would be smaller if you'd invest halfway the bullish trend, but atleast risk would be lessen.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on December 26, 2022, 04:48:05 PMBut I am optimistic concerning 2023, I foresee a major breakout for Bitcoin and several other top altcoins, and some new altcoins that are really promising..Basis I guess? 'coz if we would look at upcoming events for this industry, Bitcoin halving is more likely to happen on 2024, so since no other lined event is there(as far as I know), increase is more likely to occur on that year. But I do also hope that things would be better next year by any chances.",

I will not however start the year in a rush to invest in altcoins but give it proper time for consideration. Decisions about Investment in altcoins should not be made in a hurry remember, to avoid making regrettable choices. 2022 has not been a completely wonderful year for cryptocurrency, it will be good to take a good observation of the market first before making a choice for 2023.",

I do not see the need to do any major movement, I think the next year is going to be similar to the current one, so if anyone is thinking about investing in this market they need to look for solid and reliable coins more than anything, once the bull market comes then people are free to experiment with all kind of altcoins if they want, but at least to me it seems premature to do this already, when the bull run is still so far away and most new altcoins released during the end of this year will not make it to the next bull run.",

Definitely miners, institutional investors and individuals will be preparing for the big profits in the up coming year. This is natural process for bitcoin, whenever halving is nearing people are jumping all in to get the profits. This has always created nice buzz for the bitcoin and thus it naturally pumps the bitcoin prices. As we know there is good direct relationship between the bitcoin and altcoins pair, the alts will also start to move above the lines and will give us good green trendy graph. I mean what do we need apart from this? This is also one of the important reason we should be focusing on buying more and more crypto this month and several months ahead to keep our BEP at lowest.",
