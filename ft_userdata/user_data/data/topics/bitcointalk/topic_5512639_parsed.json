That's it!Most of the new investors think that the long term investors didn't do anything, well, technically that's right but along with that long wait is about being patient naturally. Without that attitude in investing in Bitcoin, you're likely not going to reach that point of success because you can possibly sell at losses and be in panic.",

Then again I believe it depends on what you define as \"initial stage\". In the past failing to set up a proper stop-loss (either too early or too late) makes me miss a good opportunity to sell some of my investment. On the other hand, setting it way too early (being weak hands, as mentioned above) costs me a good opportunity to acquire more sats. I believe there's no harm in selling some of your investment if it gives you profit already, assuming you don't sell all of them. I believe there's a detailed guide on how to calculate how much you could sell in the past.",

Investors should avoid using third-party services to store their assets because the potential for asset loss is very large, such as theft or the Exchange suddenly going bankrupt, of course the assets will simply disappear. Investors should always make rational decisions when starting to invest, avoiding FOMO is something that needs to be done to prevent things that can hinder investment plans.",

I believe there's a detailed guide on how to calculate how much you could sell in the past.Because the main purpose of investment is profit, there is nothing wrong with selling part of the investment for the profit that needs to be taken. But sometimes there are people who are too confident by not wanting to take a penny of the price they get when the price has shown the target price they want to achieve. They expect too high and when the price starts to fall and continues to be followed by a prolonged bear market, there will only be regrets, why not sell some and then buy below. Setting how much to take profit is also needed, I will also take some profits when the price exceeds my main target, and surely the profit can be a reserve fund to prepare to buy on the next decline. But it all depends on how each person's strategy is, some continue to survive and forget their investment for years and when they start to open their investments, huge profits are obtained perfectly, but also the opposite happens.",

So so far I have not felt any obstacles because I have instilled the belief that in the future Bitcoin will give me great benefits, and make Bitcoin my routine to always set aside a small portion of my money to buy Bitcoin and consider it as something ordinary.And maybe for people who are new to investing in Bitcoin, they will definitely experience obstacles or obstacles, especially for those who do not have experience and knowledge in Bitcoin.

This happens a lot with new investors. They are either too scared or too eager. They buy when they see the market going up because of FOMO and even though I know bitcoin will still continue to rise, it is important that you buy it at the cheapest price possible not the most expensive to obtain maximum profit. At the same time, you also shouldn’t be swayed by short term or temporary dips or negative news and immediately sell your funds. Remain levelheaded and objective at all times.",

But from my observation, FUD is one of the major challenges people go through. I observed that there are individuals and organisations whose main task is to cause and promote FUD, and this will cause many weak hands to dump their coins. Another issue might be uncertainties. Some investors have good plans but they don't give room for emergencies. There could be health issues, loss of job, natural disasters and so on; without emergency funds, Bitcoin investment plans might be truncated.Keeping your Bitcoin in a centralized platform. I am sure people who kept their money in FTX had great plans. But that single mistake of not keeping it in a decentralized wallet has affected their plans.",

Then it may push Investors to quick selling of their assets due to FOMO then, their investment plans must have negatively been affected their goal of holding until they makes profits.Another is investors with the DCAs accumulation plans.Understanding the strategies of the DCAs, investors are either scheduled on buying their Bitcoin assets bite by bits maybe because they don't have the exact fund to purchase and accumulate up to the expected value of Bitcoin to their assets at a time, and same lane, they ought to place purchasing orders when the market price is depreciating to buy higher values with minimum amount but due to the highily volatile of the market, price may suddenly increase which becomes disruption to their accumulation plans.Although this sensational investment effects remains effective on \"weak hearted\" volatile investors who can not stand the storms in the fluctuating crypto markets.I tagged this reoccurrence effects on \"price fluctuations\" because the volatility of Bitcoin potentials can not be manipulated by investors so, failure to bear that fact would keep investors investment plans reoccurring from achieving a successful investment plans.",

DCA solves this challenge and gives you calmness throughout all the period you're investing in Bitcoin because you know you're not investing too much at a time and while you continue to buy you get used to volatility and wouldn't always become worried of what will become of Bitcoin or your invested money.",
