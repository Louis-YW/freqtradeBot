We should be mindful not to fall under bull trap this time.",

To me this is a great sign of good things to come especially to holders.You are misusing crypto marketcap. A high or low number of crypto marketcap does not decide its contribution to society. If you consider it like this, it means society actually receive true value from all crypto projects. In fact not all crypto projects contribute real values to society.Their marketcap can be multiplied 10 times, 50 times, 100 times and can be divided quickly too. So crypto marketcap does not have real contribution to social marketcap.QuoteThe fear and Greed index also moving to positive side. Not positive man.",

All of those positive things turns out to show up that this might be the indication for this market to have some reversal but still not an assured thing to happen since this market is totally unpredictable.If the market had reclaimed that $1T marketcap then its good but we shouldnt really be that confident that this would go head on continously.Expect the unexpected and mind off that this wontreally be a smooth sail ride as always.So better position yourself if you do see that this might be a possible bottom price or something that we cant really see these levels on upcoming years to come.So as an investor or trader then always set out risk limitations and proper planning with your investment and capital.",

Well it happened a few days ago if I recall properly when Bitcoin was entering $21K but to me total market cap means nothing if project or token owners are just going to mint billions of tokens out of a thin air. At least for Bitcoin, you get to realize that the process of putting a few Bitcoins into circulations requires a lot of investment and energy.",

Maybe for others that can be a good sign but for most it's not, just like me, why? because have you forgotten that the market is so volatile that its prices can fall quickly and can also rise and no one knows when that will happen dude. It is still difficult to compete, it is still good to be wise and careful in what to do as a holder or traders in the crypto industry.",

I now understand the area you are coming from and my views was on the over all market conditions for some days using the available data. In case I said anything hurtful? Please let go as we are just saying the same thing from different views. Coins like ethereum, doge, litecoin still have really market capitalization and as a trader we use data and metrics from those markets to analyze the market.",

An increase in the market cap can be a good sign that people are now coming back into crypto again, so it's also normal that the fear and greed index are slowly turning into green now. Not only to the hodlers but everyone that is involved in this space are benefiting of this small pump we are feeling right now but it's just that hodlers can gain more in the long run because they keep on stacking and then they don't sell from time to time but they will only sell once btc reaches its highest possible value.
