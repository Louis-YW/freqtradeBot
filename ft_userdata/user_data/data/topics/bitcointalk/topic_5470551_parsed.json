Anybody who used that tweet as a signal to long and didn't get out early enough is in solid losses now.  So Cointelegraph has made a tweet ~15 minutes ago to explain the situation:QuoteWe apologize for a tweet that led to the dissemination of inaccurate information regarding the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF. An internal investigation is currently underway. We are committed to transparency and will share the findings of the investigation with the public once it is concluded within 3 hours.However, there is a reply[1] from Rollbit Casino that claims Cointelegraph made a long of BTC just before the tweet went live and closed at the $30,xxx price level.[1]: https://twitter.com/rollbitcom/status/1713919556568113503",

Create market panic. This created a short squeeze and a long squeeze in a matter of minutes and who knows how much investors and retail lost due to this.Within 10 minutes the news about the ETF went viral trending on Twitter. There are investors who experience losses of approximately $50 K.https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1713920641521660232?t=WLXnCbgRBa6W5_YvigxKjw&s=19",

And fortunately it can be overcome quickly, I don't know how it is left in a few hours until it spreads the world.Yes, at least we see the domino effect of ETF Bitcoin when received by SEC to be traded, it seems that most people are waiting for that momentum to shop Bitcoin, rather than buying today and waiting for it until it is done.Just because it came out of the trusted media development of Crypto, fake news also got a crazy reaction from Bitcoin investors.",
