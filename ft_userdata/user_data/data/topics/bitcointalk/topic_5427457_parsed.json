This is a lesson for everyone, specifically me, that we shouldn't lose hope about our requests, goals, or aspirations. That's why we need virtues called patience and persistence. As I earlier stated in this thread, Public request to Theymos for a name change, he deserves this name because it suits his personality. A big thank you to Theymos and others that have supported the course of this change of name. I also hope that all our desires would one day come to reality.",
