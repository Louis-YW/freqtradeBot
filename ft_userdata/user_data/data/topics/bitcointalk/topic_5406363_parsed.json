      "body": "Hey there, my incredible community! I wanted to take a moment to share a deeply personal and thought-provoking artwork with you all. \"Millions of People\" captures the feelings of voicelessness and powerlessness that many individuals experience. It raises profound questions about identity, purpose, and our shared existence. As the artist behind this piece, I poured my emotions and journey into its creation. It holds a special place in my heart. I'm still eagerly awaiting the first sale of this artwork, as the initial auction encountered issues with shipping, and the buyer couldn't wait for its arrival. But don't worry, answers to the questions raised within this artwork will be revealed soon. Stay tuned for updates and let's continue our artistic journey together.",

      "body": "Hey, Bitcointalk community,This artwork has been a constant in my journey, a piece that's been through auctions and even found a new home once, only to be returned due to some shipping mishaps. I can't help but feel deeply connected to this one, it's my absolute favorite in the entire collection. The story behind it runs deep, I sketched it during a time spent in the clinic, a place that marked almost a year of my life.But here's the thing, it's not just about the time or the personal connection, it's one of the most profound Bitcoin artworks I know. It doesn't flaunt a massive Bitcoin logo in the center, but it speaks volumes about waking up from a coma or feeling trapped in the fiat system, constantly pushed down. Life isn't all bad, and that's the essence of this piece, the reality we live in, and the slow, generational shift toward change.Surprisingly, it's still with me. I've often contemplated leaving it as a unique 1 of 1, but I don't want to deprive other collectors of the opportunity. I'm confident that someday, this artwork will find its new home, and when that moment arrives, it will happen swiftly. I can't help but wonder why it's still here with me, perhaps it's biding its time.Â  Let's leave it as 12 of 12 and see where it goes. Each month, each year, I have more to say about my artworks, and I find it cool to wait a few months before writing something about them.Let's see where this journey takes us. Thanks for being a part of it.",
