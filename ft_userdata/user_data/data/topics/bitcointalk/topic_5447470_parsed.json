I don't know if I would be in the right mental state for some days, maybe weeks, if this kind of thing happened to me. The hacker will most likely move the Bitcoins through a bitcoin mixer before cashing out, so maybe you could try to make use of blockchain analytic companies as suggested, but it will be at a fee.If the Bitcoins ended up in an exchange address that is traceable, again you are going to have to get a lawyer, involve law enforcement and the court to try and get information from an exchange about the owner of the accountBut just know, chances are super slim that you could get back even a satoshi.",

Unfortunately, sooner or later they all pay the price of their ignorance and finance various hackers who live a luxurious life with their money.For 30 BTC, I would certainly make an effort to report everything to the police, so that I can at least hope that the hackers will be found one day. Even if they used a VPN, it does not mean that they are completely protected, their real IP address could be found out through a court order. Furthermore, if it is about inexperienced hackers, there is always the possibility that they will make a mistake, but in order for there to be a chance that someone will discover it, the first thing is to report it to the police and have a forensic examination of the hacked computer.",

Some people never understand, no matter how much someone explains to them, they think that Bitcoin is like some kind of bank that will compensate them for a loss if it happens.I would even advise people to strengthen their backup with a passphrase, but for some it is an even bigger complication, especially if you tell them that the seed and passphrase should be kept separately. In any case, a properly stored backup is the most important thing, regardless of what kind of crypto wallet it is.",
