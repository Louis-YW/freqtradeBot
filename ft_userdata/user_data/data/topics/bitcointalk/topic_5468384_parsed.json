As there are different kinds of wallets, and you can pick the one that works best for you.For the newbies, I recommend using a mobile wallet. They are user friendly and easy to navigate. Another option is a hardware wallet, but they can be a bit expensive. You can save up for one because they're super secure. They keep your Bitcoin safe by keeping it offline, away from the internet.You should remember to always do your research and read the terms and conditions of the wallet you choose. And don't download wallets from random websites to avoid scams and phishing tricks. If you want to learn more about wallets, you may consider check-in out this threads[General] Bitcoin Wallets - Which, what, why?Custodial vs. Non Custodial Wallets - \"Not your keys, not your coin\" Explained.",

Bitcoin is a blockchain (list of blocks). Every single transaction that has ever happened is stored in this blockchain.Let's say that I want to send you X amount of BTC. Bitcoin is digital, so I could fake it, right? Wrong! Every computer that runs Bitcoin Core, can download a FULL copy of the blockchain and have their own opinion to whether I have X amount of BTC to send. In order for this to happen, there needs to be a concesus (from the computers running Bitcoin Core) in regards to whether I really have this amount and I am not just faking it.In fact without Bitcoin Core, there can be no Bitcoin. Even if you don't run Bitcoin Core (which is totally possible), you will need to connect to someone else's computer. So you need to trust THEIR opinions and at the same time, you lose privacy.Bitcoin Core, also provides you with a wallet, as I said.So, if you don't want to download Bitcoin Core and since you mentioned mobile device, you can download BlueWallet or Blockstream Green or any other wallet that other users suggest. These wallets will provide you with 12 or 24 words that you need to keep safe (offline) and away from anyone else. It is your wallet's backup. Losing it results to losing all your coins. If someone steals it, they can steal all your coins. Those wallet will connect to someone else's computer that runs bitcoin core.A good tutorial for BlueWallet is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imMX7i4qpmg&ab_channel=BTCSessions. I suggest that you stop watching where he starts talking about Lightning because, for the time being, it will only confuse you. We will be here to discuss Lightning in the future.I know you just started and it may sound difficult, but you can of course re-think my post after a while.",

And which is safer.Let me start with some basics.The bitcoins are not stored in the wallet. They never \"leave\" the blockchain, to say so.The wallet is just a tool helping you to access your coins (OK, especially bitcoin core does much more than that, but that's not our problem now).A wallet will generate you a seed and/or some private keys, for which you'll see the corresponding addresses. Anybody who has the private key for an address, he can spend the coins from there.End of the \"lesson\".Now, what you need is a wallet that generates the addresses for you and allows you handle (spend) your coins.If you only want to play with a few dollars, even a wallet like Electrum would do. It's a wallet software that work on both Android and PC (Win, Linux. iOS) and doesn't need to download the whole blockchain.But a wallet like this is as unsafe as the device. A virus/malware can steal your money. And then, depending on your technical skills and the money you want to keep as Bitcoin, you'll go for a hardware wallet, or air-gapped PC or other safe solutions.So the \"which is safer\" depends on you. Usually the answer is air-gapped computer, but if you don't know what you're doing you may lose everything (and hardware wallet may be more user friendly).",

To run the full node takes a lot of space, and at such some persons find it undesirable in using it to store bitcoin. Note that it does not support or have a mobile version and to download it you will need a PC with atleast 350GB free disk space. Aside Bitcoin core, there are many Bitcoin wallets that you can use but I would advise you to go for a hardware wallets like Trezor, Coldcard, passport because it's the safest. You can also use non-custodial wallets like Electrum wallet, Sparrow wallet or Bluewallet.",

Bitcoin is not stored in the wallet, the wallet helps you manage your private keys and helps you send and receive bitcoin. In the case of Bitcoin core, it helps you create a wallet(generate both Private keys and the corresponding addresses from a seed phrase) and also makes you a node( whether a full or node or prune node, but depends after the initial blockchain download: IBD)QuoteIn fact without Bitcoin Core, there can be no Bitcoin. Even if you don't run Bitcoin Core (which is totally possible), you will need to connect to someone else's computer. So you need to trust THEIR opinions and at the same time, you lose privacy.Bitcoin Core, also provides you with a wallet, as I said.Says who? Bitcoin core happens to be one of the oldest open source client that was built by and for the bitcoin community and till today, it is used by some people as you can run your own node without depending on another node for a reliable ledger of bitcoin blockchain but there are other ways you can run your own node without having to use bitcoin core, there are some of them you can DIY and also the plug and used, all depends on how expert you are with security and privacy. Bitcoin node doesn't end with Bitcoin core.",

You don't really need Bitcoin core for the purpose because there are many other open-source wallet software that you can use to create your wallet and deposit your Bitcoin into that wallet. One of the most user-friendly wallet software that you can use it Electrum. In fact I think it's most beginner friendly way to store your Bitcoin because it's easy to learn and there are many tutorials about it on YouTube. You can watch this simple tutorial to learn about Electrum wallet:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MP_EMxypCEYou should first learn about wallet creation and once you master that then create your own wallet and then save your private keys and seed phrases on multiple secure locations so that you won't lose them and you should never share those with anyone else because if someone else get access to those then they can steal your Bitcoin remotely without any issue.",
