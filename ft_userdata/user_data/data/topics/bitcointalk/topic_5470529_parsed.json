It was also used to launder money for Russia’s largest crypto pyramid scheme, Finiko,and raise funds for the Russian far-right paramilitary unit Rusich.source",

EU is facing a grave crisis and if the crypto is being used to finance the terrorist activities, it needs to stop.

Although it would be possible to create a global framework but it might not be easy as we are thinking. Crypto is very decentralized in nature and that alone make it more difficult to regulate due to lack of central authority to control it. I read somewhere that some countries like Korea, japan and also some international organizations like financial action task force are already working on creating global standard for crypto but there's nothing to write home about it yet. The task is still far from reaching a concrete resolution.Moreover, this issue of crypto regulation is a very complex and complicated issue because it will actually help to check and control the illicit activities but on the other hand, it will also reduce the potential of crypto and make it lose the uniqueness.",

They cannot do anything to help Syria on the ground any more, so want to keep the middle east unstable. Higher oil prices would also be a geopolitical win for them, as oil is one of the few things that the country can produce relatively easy and make money on, plus it would give them a negotiating point with some countries. It's no surprise that they are funding people that are looking to cause chaos, people who could potentially try to hit America and Europe right now, because they have few other options to strike back. There may even be some expected strings to the money, but they may also regret helping Israel's enemies as they don't like to be manipulated either.",

Now I'm completely and utterly against war for the most part (unfortunately there are times where war is a necessary evil) but this does show how helpful /useful bitcoin/cryptocurrency can be.  I know it's being used for a negative thing here, but that doesn't take away the fact that it's providing legitimate utility here.Here's the article, I highly recommend reading it - https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/us/hamas-funding-crypto-invsThat's not necessarily a negative thing, if you side with the US and Israel then you will think that using cryptocurrency to serve terrorists (this is what Israel calls hamas). But if you are on the side of the Palestinian people (innocent people), you will see that it is a miracle of crypto because if they use other traditional methods, they will face many difficulties. But if we ignore the aspect of supporting which side, we will see how cryptocurrencies bring great benefits, something that no banking system can do.",

No one points to cryptocurrency as a “reason” or “to blame.” The problem with cryptocurrency, like many GOOD solutions, is that such solutions have “two sides of the coin.” And this is the possibility of using cryptocurrency in uncontrolled operations to finance anti-human, terrorist and other illegal regimes/organizations. And this is one of the key nuances due to which cryptocurrency is under serious control and supervision.",
