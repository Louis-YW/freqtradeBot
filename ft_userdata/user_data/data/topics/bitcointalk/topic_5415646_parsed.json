The lottery may or may not be manipulated. Because if there is a population of 100M in a country and let's assume that 40M people there bet on the lottery and the price of each lottery is 20 each, that means there is a collection of 800M and subtract the winning price, meaning the rest goes to charity, no we just know if everything goes to charity.In other words, the chances are high that this is rigged or the result is fixed immediately and the chances are low that it is not manipulated.",

The chances would've been the same as any other combination, it's not like the chances for getting the 2nd number adjusts based on the 1st number you chose, they're all the same for each pick. Honestly, if it was rigged, they would've 100% avoided coincidences like these, since as you've shown yourself, can be rather suspicious.

I think some sleight of hand and camera angles/movement would be enough to rig it? I reckon there'd be some way through those tricks. Not saying that they indeed do it though.",

Very curious what happened in the Bulgarian lottery. I'm sure that the fact that the same combination came up in two close draws made many people think that the lottery was rigged, even more than in the case told by the OP.",

It sounds reasonable enough this would happen at least once in the entire life of the lottery.In my opinion is not crazy enough to completely suspect of a rigged process, it would be more blatant if all the five numbers were consecutive, something like: 10, 11, 12, 13...Besides, if the draw was performed on live then the only possible explanation it would be a rigged machine or equipment, but even if they wanted to rig the result, they would have chosen a seemly random result instead only number divisible by nine.

If they are drawing their number live than I wouldn't expect a rigged lottery. Of course there could be a system in place that brings out only the desired numbers, but there should be some checks to prevent it. With lotteries there are usually millions involved and the security should be higher to prevent any scam. I am not sure why certain numbers should be an indication for a scam. If the system is rigged, can't they choose whatever numbers they want? It would be more obvious if the same person wins the lottery multiple times in a row. Or if the lottery winners all come out of the same family or small town. If you really feel like the system is rigged, maybe take a break from the lottery and save your money instead?",
