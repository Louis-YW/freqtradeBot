You no dey signature campaign and you no explain how you take dey get the Bitcoin them, why are you making the post? How people receive their payment depends on what their target is. Some people are saving their Bitcoin for the future and you don't expect them to use CEX wallet when you know that \"not your keys, not your coins\". Those that want to work and sell can use CEX and the decision should be entirely up to them.",

Some of us actually render services for local and international clients and opt to to be paid in bitcoin. There's more bitcoin out the forum than in here. Okay?

Abeg wetin young mani go do?Op, if you think say na to receive your Bitcoin for your CEX account to solve the issue of the high cost of transaction fees in Bitcoin and make your business dey fast. Go ahead and use it, but remember if you intend to hodl the Bitcoin in your Cex account for a long term, I will not advise you to do that because you can lose your Bitcoin if the CEX exchange you are hodling your Bitcoin gets hacked or your Bitcoin can be freeze since you are not the owner of the key. According to wey thing Charles Tim told you about the CEX Bitcoin wallet address changing without your notice, anytime you want to receive payment from people who want to pay Bitcoin for your work you must first confirm the CEX Bitcoin address if it is the same thing with the one you submitted to use and receive your Bitcoin before they can initiate the payment.",

And I come dey reason self say if this go be like this make them comot am for bitcoin blockchain. better still make e shere with BNB or Etherium or make them kukuma creat another blockchain for am. So me self get this similar issue of high charges on bitcoin I come dey reason whether na Binance I go dey use dey received bitcoin or kucoin exchange because the procedure wey dey to use this electron wallet be like say e no easy. Even as people dey fear for CEX no mean say na just this one wey you go put am wey the exchange go shutdown.Come to think of it nobody dey talk about metamask and roqque.

Abeg wetin young mani go do?Look am this way, as you no wan spend more to bump the transaction and the sender too no wan pay more in fees, that means your transaction go dey stock for mempool. But e dey good say you dey use wallet address rather than CEX, because e fit choke you for throat, say you dey in dire need of money and you no go get any option, than to bump the transaction. But if na CEX address you submit, bumping no go dey possible and you just gats wait for as long as e go take for the fee to drop in other to receive the transaction",

      "body": "A lot of Bitcoin forks have approached me seeking this advice before,Â  but to be honest with you,Â  if you want to use an exchange wallet to receive your Bitcoin then it should be taken as a temporary option and not for long-term usage because exchange wallets aside from it many other disadvantages,Â  the wallet are changed at regular intervals. So for that to be on the safer side,Â  if the payment is a one-time payment and forum then you can use the exchange wallet to receive the payments,Â  but if you are planning for long-term usage,Â  then be ready to lose your Bitcoin at some point when your wallet get expired by the exchange,Â  so this is what to consider before you accept to use exchange wallets.",

Abeg wetin young mani go do?It's your choice bro.If you don't worry about your privacy, you can use exchange to receive payment since you will most likely convert it to fiat without any delay, it's better than wasting $5 on a fee now because that amount is worth â¦6k in Naira currency and you can use it for other things you want. But if you don't want to sell to fiat, why not live your thing in the wallet and consolidate everything until after it calm down.Regarding your client, if you need the money fastly, you can do CPFP transaction since you said you use electrum wallet, you can do that but you will be the one to be paying the fee for the parent transaction( the client transaction) and your own transaction(child transaction) I.e if you don't mind the fees. However, if you are not ready to finance the fee, go ahead and use the exchange but not that you will have to do kyc which will harm your privacy.",
