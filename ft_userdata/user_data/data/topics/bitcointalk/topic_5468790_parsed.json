In life, we are judged according to our behaviors as this forum is under watch by some legendary so it is bad if some persons or set of persons will jeopardize the image of this local board just because of their nonchalant attitude. It is important for us to know that our actions and inactions portray who we actually are and that's how the public will address us, reputation is very important in the life of an individual because it's due to your comportment that will make others to give you credits on things you do and give you adequate attention whenever you are trying to pass knowledge or an information. Let's be guided",

It might not be of help to you, maybe because you already know about it but the fact that the forum is made up of experienced and inexperienced persons both in the bitcoin space and the secular society should give you the understanding that the kind of threads you will see in the forum won't be always of high quality. Some persons are not even from English speaking countries and so even when they have something reasonable to say, they might not necessarily put it out the right way and there message might not reflect much on what they intended creating.I understand that some persons don't put in the needed effort to ensure that there threads are of high quality and might even go to the extent of copying out already published write-ups online just to post in the forum but I guess that's the whole essence of the merit system that is designed to reward those that are impacting and engaging in the forum positively and also encourage them to do more.No be everybody go always get quality matter to yarn, some just want talk something make there mouth no too smell as dem don keep quiet for a long time so people go know say them de exist for the forum, allow them breath!

Since wey I enter this forum, I don learn plenty things from plenty people here. I have equally learnt about different things from different boards in this forum and I can only say kudos to every member here putting in their efforts to make this a community of knowledge.After staying in this forum for a while, I got to understand that this forum can be Invariably referred to as an encyclopedia. A knowledge bank where you come and learn about the past and current happenings of life, especially when it has to do with facts about Bitcoin related issues and other aspects of life.As a member of the Wikimedia community, the only difference between this platform and Wikipedia is because this platform is has a sole essence which is targeted at addressing issues around the crypto world, whereas Wikipedia is an all-rounder platform. Secondly, in Wikipedia, you create articles and have in line citations and references to back it up whereas here is more like a free social networking platform, Twitter (X).Like Wikipedia, Bitcointalk deals with genuinity and authenticity, meaning you can not plagiarize because there are moderators on the platform that are empowered with the ability to checkmate spamming or shit-posts as well as plagiarism. Like there's discipline in the level of quality posts one should create in Wikipedia, so it is in this forum which makes most of the information shared here to be relevant and accurate.Unlike Wikipedia which you must attach references to whatever claims you make, here it is more of your own unique ideas and understanding, therefore there won't be need to reference everything. But the most amazing part of this forum is the merit system. When you write something spectacular, unique and result-oriented, you get rewarded with a merit.",

Unless u want to lean on cheating and quite unfortunate no cheating on the platform here and looking at it sometimes we denies our aids of creativities but dancing to the tunes of refurbishes.I note your point sir. But the fact still remain that this forum is like a juggle. Who dey jungle dey do anything to survive. For me as dem Don talk say make people reduce low quality post me I see am say low quality post don drastically reduce. One thing wey you go know be say no matter how you wan eliminate low quality post, you go still see small. But that one no mean say you no go focus wetting you determine do. These things dey dey common for newbie and members who never even dey see money for here. Perhaps if Dem Don involved for signature campegn dey collect better$$$, I no even think say Dem go even reason to create thread any how because to build account no be come chop. Wey small mistake go make them no cash out again consedring the current State of our economy. Note: >that one no mean say me don dey see money but base on refference.This life no be wetting favour you go favour another person. As all of us dey here we get our different lifestyle. Wetting you do wey make you succeed for life fit dey funny for another person. Let's take for instance people dey call zazoo mad man for music industry but him dey chop him money meanwhile people wey dey do good music don dey for street since nothing come out but dat one no mean say I dey encourage such thing but just example. Comedians no dey inpact too much to people but just dey crack jokes and people dey pay money dey watch them. Sometimes people wey you sabi pass for school dey succeed pass you. So grace dey different. Those off topics some people don use am get merit dey continue the journey.So if you want to leave a free life just no dey too much put your mind for wetting forum members they talk. Because you no even know wether wetting you dey talk self make sense to some people. Because when you dey indirectly talk such thing, people don dey ask themselves wether na me this guy dey talk? Morover we don don't get several topics for advising people. So I think make we focus.",

But it's important to remember that thoughtful, well-written posts on board of the forum can make a much bigger impact than a flood of quick comments.Another thing be say our senior members way dey the forum way dey mostly post content for the forum get the abilities and responsibility to set a good example for us..
