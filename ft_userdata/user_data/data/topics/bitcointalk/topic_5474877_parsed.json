I have given up on this centralized token long ago and I don't think anyone who is for long time will invest into Ripple due to unlimited supply nature of this coin. Back in 2017/2018 there was a huge hype for this project and apart from the initial bullrun of 2017 we have not seen much movements in the price and even when it happens it's short-lived. I personally feel there are better project to invest than this.",
