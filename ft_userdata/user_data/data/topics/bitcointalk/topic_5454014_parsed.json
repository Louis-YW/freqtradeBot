  "content": "Anyone send an eth to ben.eth wallet for project psyop? This is a degen that becomes so controversial for the past days. Since the founder of ben (memecoin) has decide to launch its project by presale and accumulated whooping $7m from all those who send. Now some are doubtful that he will launch and rug but he did launch and now its 3x from the presale. I wonder what would be the impact of this to the market esepcially memecoins are really hot now.PS: I send a little bit of eth as degen move dont care if its rug but still up 3x now and still holding.",

Therefore, I did not send my Ethereum to receive coins from this degen. There is no faith in such projects. More used to trust coins. Moreover, with a quick profit, I am unlucky.",

Its not Im saying memecoin are for long term but some cases those projects moon with a little bit of time too. Like happened on shib, pepe and some new meme too. Ive also in and out of some memecoins but it depends on some factors too like tokenomics and my target gains.Just asking for those who are into socials and seeing frequently news about it and their thoughts.",

SHIB seems so stagnant lately, but it did make some faithfuls some good profits in the last bull run.",

SHIB seems so stagnant lately, but it did make some faithfuls some good profits in the last bull runI agreed but there are lots of meme to choose from which has considerable multiplier than shib token. Im not into memecoins or long term holder but like I said it will depend on the traction of the project. A meme booms when its hype and thats how you monitor it not on its fundamental cause we all knew memecoins doesnt have one and if they did its really not the matter at all to some flippers.",
