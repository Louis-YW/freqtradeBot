  "content": "I see lots of mixer ads on this forum, like gambling ads. I think both of these things have something to do with bitcoin. But only gambling gets a special subboardIn my opinion, there needs to be more discussion about mixers because they are often associated with money laundering. To avoid any kind of mixer fraud, is it possible to have a dedicated board for mixer service? Whether it's dangerous or not if the mixer service has a dedicated board, maybe this forum will be accused of supporting mixer service",

So I expect there's will be no dedicated board for mixer as long as the cybersecurity and privacy board not added yet.As long as the mixer pay or allow every user to withdraw their coins regardless of the purpose is, the mixer isn't scam or fraud.However if you still think mixer is associated with money laundering, read this thread Irrefutable evidence that mixers alone are unsuitable for money laundering!",

You don't know who are scammer before they scam.Yes, that's right, there are lots of gambling sites and not too many mixers. However, both have a high potential for fraud and both use bitcoin. Fraud or scam is hard to spot before it happens, but I think the seniors here can give us an idea of ​​what might be going on. And that's important for those of us who don't really understand mixer systemsQuote from: Despairo on September 05, 2023, 04:48:21 AMMixer is associated with privacy, but there was an user propose to add cybersecurity and privacy board, but until now there's no movement about it.

If that board exists it's possible the mixer services subboard could be there",

If mixers need a sub board to avoid fraud mixers, others will need sub boards too.Ethereum with many ERC-20 token projects will need their ERC20 subboards. Binance Smart Chain token projects will need their sub board and more. It is countless.Mixers are services and can make announcements in Service (Announcements) boads. Disussions are in Service (Discussion) board.",
