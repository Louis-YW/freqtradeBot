      "body": "Multiple anonymous \"usernames\" or accounts is actually part of True cryptocurrency principle and should be in the general Crypto space . However, things should be set up in such a way that users/members can't abuse/misuse the anonymity without getting caught. Members should only Â generate as many usernames as possible from a verified account. By verified accounts I mean accounts that have had their true identities safely (decentralized privacy-friendly manner) verified, hashed and encrypted. Â Unlimited & anonymous usernames can then be generated from the verified accounts. The verified accounts will hold all the records of whatever punishment the anonymous usernames receives and will also be affected by the punishments. And if an anonymous username is caught doing something really bad and dangerous Â you could de-anonymize the account by revealing the verified name.The lack of this feature is one of the reasons I stick to only one Bitcointalk account for couple of years till now.",

Some use it to maintain anonymity, others to express varying opinions, and some just for the enjoyment of having multiple online identities. The motivations behind this usage can vary greatly from person to person.",

Â Simply having more than one account isn't grounds for negative feedback, and I don't think there are many examples of that--at least not feedback from DT members, because that would kick up a fuss pretty quickly.Edit:Quote from: FatFork on February 06, 2023, 11:34:55 AMHaving multiple accounts is not an offense by itself on this forum.
