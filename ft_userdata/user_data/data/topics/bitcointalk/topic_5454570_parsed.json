OP, why would you want to be significant? Why do you think the forum needs it? I have always assumed that people come here to make the platform a meaningful place for them, and not otherwise. Do you really think that for several years of existence, the forum needs it?Change your thinking. Explore the forum, do not go out of your way to achieve significance.

Apart from studying the rules of the forum, there are some unwritten rules that you will learn through experience. You will learn these rules through close observation of how members interact with each other and the culture of the forum. The forum has different sections that are filled with important information. Spend time to read through these sections of the forum and you will identify areas that interest you more. Research on that section and be proficient in that area but it will be good to also have a sound general knowledge about bitcoin. Ensure you also avoid using ChatGPT or other AI tools to do your post. Your post needs to be original and if you copied it from somewhere ensure they are referenced accordingly.
