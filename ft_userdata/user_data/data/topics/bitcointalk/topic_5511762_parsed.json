I genuinely believe that this documentary will be amazing to watch but uncovering the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto? Nah, I don't believe that. That might be a good hype to make TV series popular and push people to buy HBOs subscriptions.Btw why did they decide to interview Roger Ver? He is not a pro-Bitcoin person, he tries to label Bitcoin Cash as real Bitcoin and mislead people.@theymos, did someone try to reach out to you and record you for the new HBO documentary? In the trailer, we see that they visited Bitcointalk.org and checked Satoshi's profile. You are one of the most interesting figures in the crypto world too besides Cobra and Sirius.",

I could have loved to click on the link but due to security reasons I wouldn't click to watch. But again don't you think the creator of that post is doing that to gain attention?",

I know they haven't revealed what they discovered until the final episode of the series to squeeze more money from buyers. I Agree with @shield132As for the answer to this question and the puzzling mystery for many, which we have always found, and we have seen many people impersonating the real Satoshi, the truth is that WE ARE ALL SATOSHI. Every Bitcoin holder and Bitcointalk member is indeed Satoshi Nakamoto.",

Can't HBO be sued for using Satoshi's name and possibly taking away his identity to place on to some random white man. Even if Satoshi decided to finally reveal his identity, do people really think that he would do it by making a documentary with a streaming platform? It is funny really. Don't they realize that the creator of the superior decentralized cryptocurrency will not be so eager to produce something with a platform? With a platform that is not even the most popular. Not even in top 3, I bet. This is just so funny and a little annoying. There will be so much misinformation in this documentary.",

On the official site of the documentary (its name is \"Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery\") the following can be read:Quote from: HBOThe documentary film offers a thrilling, globe-spanning investigation, with Hoback immersing himself with key players, uncovering never-before-seen clues, and humorously unraveling Bitcoin’s meteoric rise. So it may bring some few new speculations to the table, like new findings in Satoshi's writing style (a likely element in the documentary could be an AI analysis of his forum posts and emails  ), and even perhaps something another early contributor said during an interview, but the wording of this description is very close to the Newsweek article when they \"identified\" Dorian, who is extremely unlikely to be Satoshi.Edit:Quote from: bitmover on October 03, 2024, 07:00:04 PMIf someone could sign a message proving himself and satoshi and the block Genesis miner, this would be terrible for bitcoin. Bitcoin would have a CEO, this would be the beginning of the end.Nah, I don't think so. There is no formal power for the creator of the Bitcoin software.Informally, if his identity is revealed, he may be an influential voice, but one among many I believe. He could in theory threaten to sell his ~1M bitcoin if the devs do something he doesn't approve. But that threat could only be dangerous in another hard fork, otherwise maybe it could mean a 20-30% dip.",
