The connectors look similar but the horizontal and vertical blades are on different sides so they cannot be accidentally plugged into the wrong mating half.",

Connecting multiple PSU's in parallel will result in them fighting each other and eventually things go poof rather quickly.Use 1 PSU to power the controller and 1 or 2 hash boards (turn this one on 1st) and the 2nd PSU to power the remaining boards.",

There is a lot of guidance and you be redirected here too.https://www.bitmain.com/",

      "body": "To connect your Antminer S9 to a NEMA 5-20 outlet, you'll need a power supply unit (PSU) that is compatible with the Antminer S9 and can convert the 240 volts from the NEMA 5-20 outlet to the appropriate voltage required by the miner.Antminer S9 typically requires a 1600W power supply unit, so you can search for a 1600W PSU that has a NEMA 5-20 plug, or you can use a NEMA 5-20 to C13 power cord to connect the PSU to the outlet.In any case, you can find these recommendations on the Internet, and then you decide how to connect.",
