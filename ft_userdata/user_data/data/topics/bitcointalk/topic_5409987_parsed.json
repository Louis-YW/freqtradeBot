Or you do just lose your initial starting balance?. I am not sure how this works please clear this up for me thanks.",

      "body": "The higher the leverage you used, the higher the risk. If bitcoin is at $25000 and you used 10x leverage to open a long position, the liquidation price would be around $22500, if you used 1x leverage, the liquidation price would be below $1000, that is if bitcoin get below $1000. Because of the high risk, it is done in a way the exchange would gain from trading fee and the loaners would gain from the high liquidation price, only you will not be favoured, but you have nothing to pay after you lose the whole $100.",

      "body": "No, you can't lose more than the initial starting balance aka margin. Just check the FAQ section of the exchange you use for trading and there is all the necessary information about stop-loss, margin call and stop-out price. My advice is to use max 10x leverage and don't take crazy risks with 500x or 1000x leveraged trades. After getting stop-out, the price will be liquidated automatically by system since no more margin left to support your trade position.P.S: In rare cases, your balance can go negative but you are not supposed to cover the negative balance depending on the broker/exchange T&C. Once I lost more than $800 in a quick spike and the price slippery causes a few points above my stop loss point but the exchange/broker has agreed to reset the negative balance.",

In fact, it is easiest way to get poorer.Don't use leverage (any leverage x2, x5, x10 or x100) if you don't know with a specific leverage, at what price you will be liquidatedEach exchange has its own formula for liquidation so you must read it, and answer above questions. Most important, identify your liquidation price.",

      "body": "If you mean you blow your account when you receive a \"margin call\" and do nothing against it, then all your balance on that exchange assuming you set the margin mode to \"Isolated\" will be completely lost, but you don't really have to pay for the negative balance due to the amount of leverage you used.You will only lose the initial $100 in your account if, for instance, you utilized your $100 for a single margin trade that will serve as your collateral on that specific trade and the price goes above/below your liquidation point/price. That's the simplest explanation I can think of in terms of margin trading.",

I am only using Binance for this future trading,  but I believe set up is all the same.  Only funds on your future wallet will be used for your collateral just in any case.  Also depends on what of margin if its cross or isolated. If isolated only set position will be blown out if loss but if cross all your funds are at stake depend on your margin or leverage. Also you cant set a higher leverage if your funds arent enough it will not be set or gonna ask you to add more fund.",

So always remember to read the rule before using a leverage so that you are aware and you know how to manage it.. \"the higher the leverage, the risk will be higher as well\" i know someone already said this but this is the most important you always remember it.",
