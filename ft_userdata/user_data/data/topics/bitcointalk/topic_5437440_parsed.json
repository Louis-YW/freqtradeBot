      "body": "Rice is a good food, my country to be honest is full of unhealthy people consuming junk foods. If we go back 200 years or something though the staple food of my country is probably meats from natural farming & good crops.I think if rice is the staple foods of your area then where you live is unspoilt by consumerism & modern atrocities.Enjoy nature where you are.",

      "body": "I enjoy diverse cuisine and it appears that many people around me do as well. My meals typically include three main components - meat for protein, vegetables for fiber and vitamins, and bread or pasta for carbohydrates. Based on my observation, it appears that people in my area also value diverse and balanced meals, and therefore, I don't think there is a predominant staple food in my community.",

The production process is relatively simple. First, you need to put corn flour and Clear water, then turn on the heat and cook it into a thick substance, and then add more corn flour to the pot one after another. The whole process needs to be stirred continuously until the corn flour in the pot reaches the desired consistency. Let the back cover Cover the pot and simmer for a few minutes on low heat.",
