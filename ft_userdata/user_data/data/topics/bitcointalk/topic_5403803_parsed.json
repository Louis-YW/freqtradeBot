He has many MERITSHe has earned 7 merits since merit system was introduced, the other 100 were airdropped for him being a Full member at the time the system was introduced. The loan request is never gonna be given likely due to noone believes this user has the means to payback. If they had collateral then it wouldn't be an issue.",

If you are a newbie, without any sort of reputation on this forum, why should anyone trust you with a non collateral loan? You have 0 incentive to return the funds you borrowed. You could just disappear and lose nothing, while your loaner gets screwed over. Have some sense man.",

I was being cynical. No offense, but look at your profile. Even you would be afraid to lend a person like you a no collateral loan  Why do you need a loan in the first place? Are you dead because you didn't get a loan? You are not ! Live on!",
