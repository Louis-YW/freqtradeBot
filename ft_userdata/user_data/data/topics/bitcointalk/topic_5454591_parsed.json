  "content": "I think we could all enjoy this prediction coming true.Jurrien Timmer of Fidelity forecasts Bitcoin to reach $1 billion two decades from now, shortly after an earlier $100 million prediction for 2035.One Bitcoin may be equivalent to $1 billion by 2038, according to Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity. Timmer backed up his assertion with a 4-hour BTC/USD chart that combined the stock-to-flow model with his demand model. In Timmer’s words:“Metcalfe’s Law holds that, as the number of its users grows linearly, a network’s value (or, by inference, the bitcoin price) grows geometrically.”The implication is that the utility value of Bitcoin will outgrow its operational network. This operational network encompasses buyers, sellers, exchanges, and ATMs. In addition, it also includes participating retailers, both directly and indirectly, and some leading organizations such as the Dallas Mavericks and AT&T. Rounding out this network are a few insurers, several banks, and a multitude of small businesses.Timmer’s own demand model grows very slowly in proportion to the stock-to-flow combination supply model. The asset management director’s demand model predicts that BTC will reach $1 million by 2030. On the other hand, the stock-to-flow combination model forecasts a price of between $1 million and $10 million by 2030.Jurrien Timmer’s demand model seems to historically represent the floor or the bottom of the price. The stock-to-flow model appears to be a better fit for the peak. However, the gap between both models widens significantly after 2030. One of the suggested reasons for the widening gap after 2030 is the change in the value of the dollar. It should be noted, however, that this reasoning is not set in stone.Bitcoin Could Hit $1 Billion Because of Changes in the Dollar ValueTimmer stated that the value of the dollar changes in relation to other assets. He further pointed out that $1 invested in stocks in the 18th century is worth about $4 billion of today’s money. Going by this assumption, $1 million today could be worth $1 billion in twenty years’ time.Changes in the dollar’s value, especially depreciation over several decades, render the same amount with less purchasing power. This is why huge sums back then appear less by today’s standards. For instance, $1 million could purchase a lot of significant things a few decades ago. To put this in perspective, reasonably higher-end houses in the US cost between $20,000 and $50,000. The same $1 million may not suffice for the same class of houses today.There is an increasing number of billionaires across the globe today. Some observers even believe that we may see the first trillionaire in this lifetime. The same applies to organizations, with several companies now passing the $1 trillion market cap valuation.Fidelity had previously pegged BTC to hit $100 million by 2035 using the same stock-to-flow model. Jurrien Timmer also made those predictions back then. As untested and uncertain Timmer’s predictions are, he is not the only one with such lofty forecasts. Deutsche Bank also forecasts that Bitcoin will dominate by 2030.https://www.coinspeaker.com/bitcoin-worth-1-billion-2038-fidelity/",

      "body": "Although the value of the dollar keeps depreciating year after year due to the plentiful money that is being printed, I don't think there will be a solution to that any time soon; rather, it will keep getting worse. This is not only for the dollar; most countries local currencies are depreciating greatly as well. With all that, I think that in the next 15 years, which is 2038, the price of Bitcoin will really be very high, like above $500k to $1 million, but I don't yet feel convinced that Bitcoin can cross $1 billion in 2038. But it wouldn't be a bad thing if the price got there because of the profit it will make on an individual's investment, and with the low value of the dollar in purchasing power, we're going to need as many dollars as possible to just get a few things at the grocery store.",

Come to think that$1M/coin is already that impossible. How much more on 1B? Im not really that going against about that positivity but lets just really be that realistic on where numbers could be possibly be put up and not something that would be close in our dreams. Realistic approach is always been needed because being that too optimistic would really be leading you into these kind of numbers on which it would really be that a bad idea because even in our life time or even on future years to come, there's no way on reaching out those numbers.Yes, no one can stop you on mentioning those numbers since its our own opinion and its none others business but you would really be making yourself laughable basing up on what you do claim.",

People who could buy now are waiting for 12k because some dumb analysts are still standing by their predictions, but if we fall to 12k they'll be in such a state of panic that they won't buy anything. They also won't buy now because they'll need a strong confirmation the bull market has started.When we reach 80k they'll say it's too expensive and they'll rather wait for another bear market. Then it will go to 200k or something and we'll start another cycle and those people who are out now will say, \"ok it's time for a 20k bottom because I say so\" and they'll keep waiting for it until the 2028 halving. I'd love to see a million by 2030, but I doubt we'll even hit 500k by then.",

If Fidelity thinks it's 1 billion in 15 years, this must mean that it's going to be at least 100k by 2025, so this would mean 4x in less than 2 years, right? So Fidelity should be buying like crazy at this price. If I knew an asset is going to go 4x in 2 years and at least 10x in 8 years, to eventually reach over 100x, I'd be all in right now because there's no better deal you can ever get in your life. If they aren't going all in, then maybe the prediction is there to raise awareness and interest in bitcoin? Maybe Fidelity would be happy with 40k right now and that's all they wait for?",

That is the big question and so far again, we can look at the past and extrapolate data and then come up with our own prediction which might be wrong or correct along the way. But it doesn't mean that we have found the holy grail though, there are a lot of factors that we need to consider and at least we should be putting 100% in this kind of predictions.By chance what if this predictions become true? then good for us, and for those who continue to accumulate and see this modelling as a solid basis. But if the price prediction didn't occur then I guess it will have the same faith as S2F modelling, \"lost in obscurity\".",

Most organizations are using these models to pump their bags at the end of the day, so it is kinda stupid if we expect them to guess it correctly all the time. If anything, I'd be very cautious when a prediction like this starts to go around the market. Who knows, maybe they want to dump on the next few days/weeks or so. I'd rather stick to other analyses that focus on whether Bitcoin or crypto will bring value and whether they can sustain it or not, instead of price predictions that are almost guaranteed to be wrong most of the time.",
