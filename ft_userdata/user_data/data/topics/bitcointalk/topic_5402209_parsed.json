Even if it is tempting, due to the fact that you will get nothing. People would be much better off avoiding bear markets at this time, and more inclined to guard their assets. I have nothing to suggest to you, in fact I think it's better not to invest for now. If you insist, then again, every decision is yours.",

I also share you website and gitbook linkWebsite: https://dragonspace.io/gitbook: https://dragon-space.gitbook.io/dragonspace-gitbook-3/Are you getting carried away by FOMO to invest as soon as possible? you should consider a lot of price conditions in the market today. I don't think you should rush it. Investing just because you are in a hurry will plunge you into the same hole. Investing in a new project is very risky, if I were you I would skip this project.When the bear market conditions all will be discarded, and you are clearly difficult to take a profit. The ambiguity of the project also makes it very shady. Shouldn't a corrected altcoin give you another option?",

So i would not invest in the project that you are advertising just because of that. I took a quick look on the website that you have linked and even though it does not look like a total scam i also think that this project is really nothing special at all. Just another NFT based minigame.Also i have to say that i feel sorry for the team if this is a really genuine project where they ave put their work and time into because i am pretty sure that it will not do very well in this current market.",

We look beyond what is offered. The project mentioned doesn't ring a bell to me. But maybe, they have the chance to survive depending on how the team will develop this platform. So it is up to the OP or user how he will keep up to date with the project if he is interested with it. Some are promising at the start but later on, the dev team will slowly wane their enthusiasm of developing the project owed to various reasons like lack of funds, and no long-term vision.",

Do you know what it is? That things is they have 934.4% forever APY, this is the first I saw this kind of promoting a new project like this. And the big question is how true that it will gonna be happen forever staking for the percentage of 934.4% APY?  is this really forever?Moreover, if you are really afraid of losing your money, my advise is simple don't take part in this project. Because if you believe in somethingin the new project saying the word \"AFRAID\" has no space surely in your mind as an investors, that is because you Believed in it 100%.",

A lot of coins have dropped in price even there are many potential altcoins after having impressive growth days, their current price is almost equal to the initial IEO, ICO price.

If this project had launched in mid 2021, I think it would have raised the necessary investment because at that time everyone was investing in all projects in a row. There was a hype back then, and people thought that by investing in gaming projects like this they would find a gem like industry leader p2e, axie infinity. But now, when even the top projects don't interest many people, what can be said about unknown newcomers in the GameFi industry.",
