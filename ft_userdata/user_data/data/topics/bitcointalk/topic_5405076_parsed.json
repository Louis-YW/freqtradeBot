If that were so, the OPs title would be somewhat misleading, as the Hero account is secondary to the narrative.Regarding email recovery, there’s not much that can be said other than what your email provider will have described in the recovery procedures. Failing that, there doesn’t seem to be that much else to do to regain control, although it will depend on factors that have not been specified (i.e. specific email provider, possible linked email accounts and or phones for recovery purposes, and so forth).As to the Hero account, the recovery procedure has been linked in the posts above, were you to eventually become interested in regaining control.",

The account of jkoil was inactive for some month now and there was no complaining. Then the account was sold a few days ago and the selling was exposed. It is a very interesting coincidence that after the selling was exposed and as a result the account of jkoil was tagged, the original owner appears and writes in bad english that he wants his account back. But I can not judge how is the OP, if he is the owner, seller or buyer. As it was written before you can contact the forum account recovery team. They have all the tools and data to recover and I will trust their judgement. One thing that you will have to consider is, that you first need to regain access to your email account.",

But I assume that you have not taken your time in adding additional layers of security like the 2FA (two-factor authentication), Google authenticator, etc. Also I think your password is “easy” which leads him to successfully change your recovery number and email, but correct me if I’m wrong. But usually if you attempt to change your recovery number, it should have sent you an SMS confirmation on your phone regarding the attempt. If you have approved that without having second thoughts or so, well that’s how the hacker ended up taking full control of your account.  It is your responsibility to take care of your email’s security no matter what. Additional layers of security will make the hacker find difficulty in compromising your email account. I learned my hard lesson back then when my Telegram got compromised because of not setting up additional security layers like 2FA, password, etc., but good thing I have fully recovered and taking back the control of my Telegram account from the hacker.  All of our social media accounts should have added security layers, and it’s not good to store your important documents in your email or in the cloud. Better invest yourself an external SSD drive to store it offline next time.",
