Anyone that mention virus and including it with malware as if it is the most important malware to avoid, the person does not know about malware. Virus only accounts for less than 2% of malware and only what it does to device is to make it to function abnormally, unlike the common ones like Trojan horse, Rootkit, ransomware, spyware and combination of malware.",
