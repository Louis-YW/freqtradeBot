There are also people who just pretend to have the same motive as you for reasons best known to them, but deep down they are not practicing what they preach. There are also people who are openly criticising your investment decision who are also here on the forum. The thing is that the forum helps one who wants to learn from them, and the forum is not the only thing that makes investors hope strong in holding their coins. The decision starts with yourself, followed by the information that we gather from others, and then we add it up to build our faith for those who believe or to increase our holding confidence. One thing about the forum is that you are opportune to learn a lot, adding to the things that you know.",

Some of the members here have a wealth of experience that is valuable. There is nothing about Bitcoin that has not been discussed on this forum. I will say that the forum is an encyclopedia of the Bitcoin ecosystem.Without this forum, many members would have been victims of scams because there is much misinformation on the internet. Many people would have invested in scam projects and lost money. This forum has also assisted many in learning about Investing in Bitcoin. If not for this platform people would have been driven by FUD to sell their coins. One will always get the right answers and the best motivation to keep holding regardless of the uncertainties that are out there.",

I believe many hyip scams could be avoided if people have the forum as their first introduction to bitcoin as opposed to learning about bitcoin from random social media posts. The forum has a lot to offer and helps shape the minds of newbie investors but does the forum really have that much influence on how regularly a person invests in Bitcoin? IMO I think a lot of that has to do with their financial status, how much they earn and their expenses. Encouragement isn’t currency, you need money to invest.",

If many of those investors find this forum, it will be very valuable for them. Surely it is. But I don't think all of the crypto or bitcoin investors have landed into bitcointalk forum and find more motivation to invest. Some are just getting some ideas from their trusted crypto influencers or they are just doing their due diligence to research using their little information about bitcoin. If all of them have discovered bitcointalk forum when they are starting to invest, maybe it will serve as their great guide not to fall quickly on the different scams happening in the crypto market that made them lose their hard-earned money.However, there's no late in entering the bitcointalk forum. You will still have a lot to learn if you explore the forum diligently and understand the important topics that are raised and discussed. This forum is worth to keep just like the members here are worth our trust and appreciation.",

If you are wasting your time among friends who don't care or think about their future and always wasting money on useless things like buying new products i.e. shoes, food, clothes, etc. Then in their companionship, you will tend to do the same. In the same way when you will be reading posts on Bitcointalk about how motivated people are about BTC.You will get motivated too even though you are so disappointed in the BTC and lost all but after seeing people's motivation you will gain energy and think to taking another start.Even sometimes when I don't use to invest instead of investing I am consuming, but after reading member's posts I began to think that I should also save funds and start trading.",

This forum is a good place for those investors who want to invest money into Bitcoin and earn some good profits from their investments. There are many good investors who fortunately are the members of this forum and they have been sharing some details about their investments into Bitcoin with other users. Some users get motivated after reading the investments of those users and I believe if someone who's active in WO thread can easily guess that who those users are. I would say that @philipma1957, @JJG, @LFC_Bitcoin and a few others who share some details about investing into Bitcoin on that thread. I believe that those who give up aren't investors at all because they don't know anything about investing. In investing we sometimes lose while sometimes we gain huge profits. It's a great journey which doesn't ends and if someone is into it then that person will continue to invest.",

Have you seen some dedicated developers in discord channels and X platforms? They are even more dedicated and serious than some people in this forum because they love what they do and they are very good at it. One thing I like about the forum is teaching the things you need at the right time especially when it comes to bitcoin particularly, like seed phrase and scams awareness are top notch on this forum, nobody will tell you some of this for free but we see them literally everyday on this board warning people over and over again.Apart from the investment aspect, I think the forum has United many people from this the same background to a single place which are the local boards where others who don't understand English language learn the ways of bitcoin in their local dialect. I have met some people from my local board and they are very cool in the Forum and after the forum.",

With my own experience, I won't come to survive all these barriers with bitcoin and other crypto investments without some reliable members in the forum that have instilled in me valuable knowledge and ideas that I was able to apply on my own investments. With that, I am more grateful that this bitcointalk forum has been established and until now, its still making a lot of wonders to our crypto investments.Kudos to the person or the people behind this forum. While its still a lot helpful to the old members in the forum that have started from a scratch, but I think it will be more useful to the newbies in the forum as it could help their knowledge acquisition easier and faster with all the legit and reliable experiences that have been shared in the forum.",
