The lack of transparency regarding the team behind CHFP and their experience in managing such projects makes it difficult to assess its credibility. Regulatory challenges in integrating traditional fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies need to be considered, and the risks associated with the real estate market pose a potential threat to the stability and value of CHFP.",

If this is backed by real people with enough funds to push thru this project, they can always hire promoters and not resort to using noobs to post on this thread.They need to provide proof that they have funds that can back their stablecoin. Most stablecoins can't survive once the community knows that they have no actual funds behind it.",
