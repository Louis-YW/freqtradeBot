At least they are transparent of it, probably required by lawyers to be transparent but still i find this unusual.I have been in crypto scene for a long time and i really do get paranoid every time something unusual happens that involves some CEX. I do trust FTX and use it a lot but something tells me that i shouldn't keep money in there right now. At least for a while. This is not fud at all, i am just concerned user and would like to see FTT rise and FTX blossom.So how do you see this affecting the ftt price?",

It's said that there's not that much volume to cover the dumping of the tokens he has received and that's why it will take time until we see the huge impact of it. It's obvious that there's a competitive reason why CZ is about to do this, he has to make known of those competitors in the market and he have to do what it takes for his business to stand out, Binance and its native coin, BNB.",

I think FTX would bounce back and come out and bite CZ in the ass. Friedman would make FTX bigger than Binance, Mark my words I sure hope so but i wouldn't bet on that. I got my money out but things are getting heated as everyone started to withdraw their money: One could make money of the ftt dip if this panic escalates, and i suppose many people are doing that and have shorted FTT. Personally i am too afraid to gamble with that but i will definitely buy it if it drops enough. Things can't be that bad behind the curtain. I am pretty sure this is fud and panic withdrawals are creating a chaos.A Reddit thread about thisAnd another oneOh boy here we go.

Alameda is notorious for playing dirty with projects, devaluing the projects then trying to buy them back cheaply and this time paying for their manipulation. I can't really take sides on this as i don't know what's happened behind the curtains for CZ to do this. He must have known it would wreak havoc inside FTX community if he said anything about the exit, so one could only speculate why he chose to be \"transparent\" and and the same time hinting wrongdoing from FTX crew. That doesn't sound something that's bringing people together. In fact it divides people to camps.So either it was for revenge fud or he noticed something shady happening inside FTX. In both cases he wouldn't be wanting what's best for crypto space. If he wanted what's best for crypto space he would be silent on this or if he got problematic data about FTX, that means he knows something but wants to secure his millions before revealing the reason. Which is understandable.But now someone (Probably Sam) is rugging BTC as response, things are not looking good",

Sanctioning defi meant the blockchain will be affected as well. I see no competition between both but SBF is starting to be involved in US politics. He was donating so much money to democrats and republicans. https://cryptoslate.com/sbf-reveals-he-donated-to-republicans-democrats-as-lobbying-by-crypto-firms-continues-ahead-of-the-midterms/I would like to see SBF still remain neutral rather than doing a bad thing like joining in the politician's ecosystem.",

Yup, one thing that has become obvious to me is that i can't just wait, see and hodl while something like this is going on. I've learned that it's better to act sooner then later during FUD, no matter if there's truth behind the fear, because others will. My support to FTT is that i won't be shorting it and making money. I just sold it and that's enough for me.But now it seems that people are getting their money out. That would mean FTX is not insolvent and everything is probably going to be ok. Well there's still going to be sell pressure from CZ so FTT price might not be as good, but i was more worried about the whole exchange",

I think CZ has a conflict with Sam about something, which is why CZ wants to not be involved in this project in any way. And tried to out the competitor by creating this FUD.

He haven't even hinted about any insolvency, that rumour came from somewhere else, and looks like it has no basis. Was he lying about slowly getting rid of their own FTT bag? Now why would he lie about that then?",
