In the years that will come, their savings will be worth nothing if they'll let it sit there and rot. I don't knoe much about other countries but I am sure that those people who dump their dollars are planning ahead for their retirement, before they'd have limited options to only savings in the bank, but now that there are lots of access and information you can get through internet and web, they can expand their options to so many choices now.",

Unless US government stops printing dollars and stop proving loans to banks at teaser rates, there's no way for USD to regain its previous purchasing power. Moreover, now many countries are initiating international trade using their own currency which is further worsening the situation for USD. Gold has always been a great support for protection the capital investment. Probably that's what banks are trying to achieve as the market forecast stays gloomy. Wise step I would say!",

      "body": "The dollar is currently facing lots of challenges most especially the lack of demand of the currency by foreign countries or the inflation. The high inflation rate of goods and services faced by the US has actually stop the demand for some of its products and couple with the fact that many companies or investors are also looking towards other countries for business because of the countries increasing interest rates. The is two only causes depreciation of the dollar. The lack of demand of the dollar by other countries looks more of a threat to the dominance of the dollar as reserve currency and that is why the likes of China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa are looking towards using other currencies for internation trade. Also the stacking of Gold by most of the countries even Saudi Arabia has signifies that most of these countries are moving towards storing their reserves with currencies or commodities of value. Quote from: avikz on April 07, 2023, 01:58:05 PMGold has always been a great support for protection the capital investment. Probably that's what banks are trying to achieve as the market forecast stays gloomy. Wise step I would say! Aside Gold the biggest threat I see to dollars is the bitcoin. The gold isnâ€™t just gotten or accumulated by a common but since it doesnâ€™t comes in fractions like that but with bitcoin also acting as a store of value and can easily be bought in fractions (satoshis) then investors of dollars might start moving in flocks to bitcoin just to save there funds from depreciating. So itâ€™s going to a tough time for dollars considering how Russia and China are up against it. It wonâ€™t be upsurge easily like that as a international exchange currency but it will be faced serious challenges",

That's why as far as I know there are other countries that have joined forces with those backed by gold so that they no longer depend on the dollar. This is just what I found out recently.",

Many countries are cutting their ties with the Dollar, a lesser exposure can save their own economy. As we've heard some movements in central Asia when it comes to fuel and currency adoption, it looks like they are slowly getting away from the influence of USD and that can tell something. Let's see if Bitcoin will also be their option, the current situation of US Economy can affect a lot, small countries can't afford to ignore this threat.",

Another possibility is that some of them consider bitcoin as another store of value, not fiat and gold.

These institutions rely on having currency reserves because it makes business more efficient -- they accept inflation to be the price of doing businesses if they can grow the funds at a rate that outpaces inflation.

This is the London Bullion Market! This is a wholesale OTC market for gold and silver trading.On their website you can see in the chronology the change in the price of gold. Above is the link - see. And look at the yearly marks. If you notice, then the surges are quite \"synchronized\" with the international economy, and absolutely coincide with the 2009 crisis (a consequence of the global financial crisis), the 2019+ crisis (covid-19), the 2022 crisis (Russian terrorist attack on Ukraine and economic terror against the EU). Those. conclusion #1 - nothing out of the ordinary is happening, the classic flow of fiat stocks into gold.But that is not all. The title of this topic is \"banks are draining DOLLARS.\" We check. If banks drain exactly dollars, then the price in dollars should grow much faster than, for example, the price in Euros. It is logical.We check - in the chart header there is a currency switch. There is dollar, pound, euro. We change - we observe ... The price in dollars since July 20202 has been periodically changing, in the corridor ~ 1800-2000, but in the pound and euro - a systematic ascending chart.Conclusion #2. There is NO purposeful exchange of DOLLAR for GOLD. And there is information manipulation and an attempt to wishful thinking The question is - why MANIPULATE data that is easy to check, and why engage in SUBSTITUTION of the essence of what is happening? No, no matter how much you write such articles - smart countries and people will not refuse the dollar",
