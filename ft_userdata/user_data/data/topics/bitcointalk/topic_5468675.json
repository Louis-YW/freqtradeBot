To OP, i guess you won't find any recommendations here, try to ask on CBD related forums and ask, i'm sure most of them use btc or crypro payments. Also on facebook groups on your area but make sure you use dummy accounts or just use your main account if your area is a CBD-friendly place.",

I'm not vouching for it, but it's simply a search engine for goods and services which are sold or offered by establishments or stores which accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. You may, then, purchase or inquire directly from the store. You can filter your search to the United States and your choice of cryptocurrency. You can even filter it further according to your merchant of choice and your price range.",

Aren't there actual reputable stores in the United States â€” in some states where CBD is actually legal? If OP has no access to these 'legal' stores then he will probably need to travel to the legal states or end up purchasing on the deep web.",
