No, and I don't think that you've just came across with that project because you're likely one of them.Quote from: janembaa on September 18, 2023, 12:03:50 PMTheir mission and vision seem pretty ambitious, aiming to simplify the DeFi experience for everyone and promote decentralized ownership.Yeah, typically that's what we get to heard from those people that are with and works for them. Anyway, these DeFis have been gone in the interest of many.Why? Because of many vulnerabilities and hacks that happened on many of them.",

      "body": "Your first post on the forum is this. Something seems fishy but anyway, I haven't heard of the project and I don't think I want to. New projects come out all the time and a good number of them can't be trusted. The mission of the vision statement always seems catchy. So that's not new. I suggest you tread carefully and be sure of what you're doing so you don't become a victim.",

      "body": "I've noticed that there have been numerous DeFi projects emerging in the past year. If you're paying attention, there are over 1.8 million tokens in the market, and the projects worth investing in are indeed scarce. Of course, you've raised this question because you may not know, or you're seeking advice and insights from experienced individuals regarding Firepot Finance. When I begin researching a project, I typically assess whether they have a substantial investment fund, and whether the development team has relevant experience in the project's field.",
