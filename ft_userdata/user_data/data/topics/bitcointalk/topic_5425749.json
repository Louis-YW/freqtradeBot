  "content": "Hi all,since my post here I have been contacted several times in a short time via DM. This way I would like to try to offer the gold bar of Alpencoin as transparent as possible.You can post offers here or via DM. I will ask each potential buyer if I may post their offer here (either anonymously or even with forum name).It is #22 which was funded with 0.01 BTC by Alpencoin.If this procedure doesn't go quite right or violates against any rules, I will start a new auction with said item if necessary.",
