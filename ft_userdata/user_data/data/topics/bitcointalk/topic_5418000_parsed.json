  "content": "With millions dead worldwide from the Covid vaccines, the CDC wants to start killing little children, full scale. When you combine the info from here https://openvaers.com/covid-data and here https://openvaers.com/faq/what-is-underreporting-and-why-it-matters along with the fact that the CDC isn't reporting all of their reports of vaccine damage, you can see that the new CDC mandate is part of a holocaust against children.Statistics show that little children are barely affected by Covid. But the CDC has mandated (as much as they can) that the Covid vaccine be added to the regimen of shots required for newborn infants.CDC stands for “Child Death Cult” … nationwide child sacrifice ritual disguised as “immunization”Quote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-10-21-cdc-stands-for-child-death-cult.html#With the CDC’s outlandish decision to add covid-19 “vaccines” — which are really transhumanism mRNA experimental drugs — to the childhood immunization schedule, the CDC has cemented its position as a Child Death Cult (C.D.C.). By pushing this unproven, unsafe and unnecessary jab onto children, the CDC proves it is operating as a shield for Big Pharma while sacrificing millions of children to vaccine injuries and deaths over the coming years.This decision by the CDC has no medical or scientific justification whatsoever, and it’s abundantly clear the CDC made this move to grant a liability shield to Big Pharma (all vaccines added to the childhood immunization schedule enjoy absolute legal liability in the United States). Even Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA technology, can hardly believe what we’re seeing here. “I am shocked by the malfeasance,” he wrote. “I have no trust left at all in our public health. It is broken.”Here’s more from Dr. Malone, via LifeSiteNews.com:This means that public schools, which all use this schedule, will then be able to mandate the “vaccines” in order for children to attend public school.This is all being done at the last minute and basically behind the backs of the public, as this received virtually no media attention prior to the vote.ACIP’s decision to add the COVID-19 shots is based on regulatory capture, budgetary issues, politics, and it is not based on scientific data.We all know the adverse event profile of the jabs. It is horrific. The small sample size in the clinical trials were poorly designed and inadequately powered.We all know other countries have completely stopped vaccinating children with these products.If they add these jabs to the childhood schedule, it will completely break the trust of the American family in the CDC, as it should.The CDC, it turns out, is nothing more than a child murdering vaccine holocaust factory....",

      "body": "Left to me alone i don't see any reason why children under the age of 12 should be administered the covid vaccines, there immune is already in good shape and what difference does giving them vaccine has on them than to contribute worsening the immune system when responding to the vaccination, lots of people have already kicked against it even before the discovery of the child death cult come into operations in full.",
