In the morning, I woke up and he told me that he used almost $10 to make the transaction. He said that miners are extorting people. I can defend almost everything people are talking about bitcoin before but I was unable to say anything today. We can say it is not really caused by miners but bitcoin developers which have been unable to make bitcoin mempool not to be too much congested.Did what my friend said somehow right? Is high transaction fee extortion?Some people will say that the more money miners see the more they will want to increase their hash rate and the stronger the blockchain.",

      "body": "It is not extortion in my perspective, extortion is when force is been used and in this regard it will only be deemed if the miners are the ones that set the fees but no it is not them so nothing like extortion. I think they are just benefiting from the chaos and nothing more. Many people will argue that they can actually choose low fee transactions but I will say nobody will be that generous enough to miss this kind of benefits. Sadly this is the position we have found ourselves.Also I wouldn’t blame the developers too because this is a decentralized network and consensus needs to be reached first before any changes are made, do we want them to stop the inscriptions or allow only inscriptions make transactions with high fees? That will be censorship. Do we want them to increase the block size Also? That will have to under go community consensus so we don’t end up with something like a bitcoin cash. I seriously too want this inscriptions to go away but it can’t be done just easily,Quote from: Oshosondy on December 21, 2023, 07:25:05 AMSome people will say that the more money miners see the more they will want to increase their hash rate and the stronger the blockchain.It is actually the more diverse the nodes are more decentralized and protected the network becomes.",

      "body": "I would argue that making the fees so high that most people cannot afford to even use bitcoin at all is a form of censorship. The best use case for bitcoin is as a store of value, and the best way to invest in bitcoin as a store of value is to dollar cost average. But when fees are so high it makes no sense for the average person to dollar cost average, with for example a hundred dollars a week, when the cost of doing that is $10, $20, or $30+  dollars for each hundred dollars you put in. It makes absolutely zero economic sense to invest in something when to do so immediately causes you to lose 20 to 30 per cent of your investment. That is no better than throwing away your money into a scam altcoin.In the long run this will absolutely destroy bitcoin as a store of value and a legitimate asset class, because very few can afford to invest in it. Are we going to prioritize bitcoin as a store of value or as a speculative vehicle to speculate on garbage meme coins and NFTs, inscriptions, or whatever the hell you want to call them??Because if it is the latter then bitcoin has become no better than ethereum or any other run of the mill shitcoin out there -- bitcoin has then lost all the properties and everything that makes it unique. If you want to play around with pixelated images of cats and monkeys then that is what ethereum and a million other altcoins are for! You don't need bitcoin for that.",

Although that wasn't the main question, it's kind of related. In situations like this, using the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) method might not be the best for getting more Bitcoin. Instead, you could consider using the lump sum method. Just save up all the money you want to invest and buy Bitcoin at once. Even though high transaction fees might not last, this approach can help you avoid paying too much in fees while accumulating Bitcoin through DCA.Quote from: Oshosondy on December 21, 2023, 07:25:05 AMDid what my friend said somehow right? Is high transaction fee extortion?He might be misunderstanding. Miners don't decide the fees, and they're not trying to force anyone. Based on what you explained, he chose a high fee to speed up the transaction. The miners didn't make him do it, and if he had more time, he might have picked a lower fee. Times like this when there is congestion, miners focus on transactions with higher fees to increase their total earnings.",

It's important to remember that this is not extortion, and you can wait for the blockchain to be less busy, which may offer a cheaper fee. It's also important to consider other crypto-currencies for daily transactions to avoid high fees when the Bitcoin blockchain is congested.",

Is high transaction fee extortion?Some people will say that the more money miners see the more they will want to increase their hash rate and the stronger the blockchain.What is happening in the mempool now calls for concern, a lot of people who would have easily adopted Bitcoin will be wary of it due to this development, this is as business transactions will prefer to use other alternative coins/tokens. This is happening already, which is why I implore the miners and the developers to come to a reasonable conclusion that will be for the common good of all and not for their selfish interests. Fine, miners would want to make money, but Satoshi wouldn't want the money to be made in the exploitative way we see now. And I can't blame the miners, I blame the system which causes the monopoly in which miners can do whatever they like without anyone cautioning them.We know human beings, it is business as usual for them when they see the opportunity, and if there is no restriction to compel them to do the needful, they will continue like that. This is simply because they don't care about \"Bitcoin\" as a whole but care about their pockets. Well, as it is now, I believe that the developers must still do something, and this time, it must be a lasting solution that will curb the monopoly in the mempool and block mining. There are brains among these guys but I believe they are not doing anything yet possibly because their hands are tied due to the miner's voting dominance. Miners have kinda of hijacked the system now in the guise of Ordinals and BRC-20, all that seems to profit them more. They should vote for a solution if they truly want Bitcoin's transaction to be welcoming to users. As for your friend, so far he is not deeply rooted in Bitcoin, you can't blame him and I don't expect anyone to. Imagine if he used Litecoin, maybe a $0.007 fee at times would have delivered the same amount. Now, compare it to the $10 deducted from his money, it looks exploitative.",

I am typically all in 100 percent for supporting Bitcoin and very optimistic but in this situation I can not be.  Almost every year there is a period where Bitcoin Transactions are too expensive.  This will affect the Network increasingly.  More people are willing to spend than ever and during even worse times like a quick crash or a hack they all become even more desperate so they try to pull out or purchase without thinking about the effect they will have on the Mempool.It is very sad reading so many people, even Bitcoiners, starting to advise people to use Altcoins.  The only Altcoin I suggest using is Monero.  All the rest are pure Bull Shit.But moving to Altcoins in such times is not the fix.  We need a better fix.  You may have 100 Altcoins, but many of us Bitcoiners hold most of our funds in Bitcoin.  I should be able to spend BITCOIN when I want, not be forced to purchase some Shit Coin instead.  It is pointless anyway.  What is the point of purchasing 100 Dollars worth of a Shit Coin that devalues by 30 percent within a day or two when I can simply spend 100 Dollars in Bitcoin plus 30 Dollars Fees instead.",
