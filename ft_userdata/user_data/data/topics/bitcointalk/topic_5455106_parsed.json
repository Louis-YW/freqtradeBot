It is utilizing the benefits of US crack down on cryptocurrency through HK and safeguarding it's mainland retail investors. All major companies from the US have either moved or are under the process of moving to HK. Through HK it will start controlling the cryptocurrency market. I am sure it will make HK a global hub for all cryptocurrency businesses.",

The Honk Kong move is a step in the right direction because the HK is the gateway to mainland China, and I won't be surprised if we see HK exchanges driving the volume in the coming bull market.Before the previous China attack on cryptocurrency, China was the location where most crypto miners reside and seem to be the most cryptocurrency-friendly country then, up until there began a crackdown in the early time. But now that China has begun to make moves to accommodate cryptocurrency again it may have an underlying effect on cryptocurrency activities such as excessive control and centralization which I think was the main reason why China push off crypto in the first place.",

At the same time, Hong Kong has grown economically thanks to the introduction of advanced technologies in science and technology. Therefore, they also have a positive attitude towards cryptocurrencies, because many there register their enterprises to engage in entrepreneurial activities using cryptocurrencies, and this is beneficial to the Hong Kong economy. However, it is not yet clear how this will be reacted to in the future in mainland China. There, as always, they are not in a hurry with their assessments. But I donâ€™t think that China will support the circulation of cryptocurrencies.",

Sure they have lots of people but it's notoriously authoritarian regime. They allow it as long it doesn't start to be a shadow banking system, and also people are afraid how west wants to end privacy and regulate cryptos, you might want to take a look what china has done to privacy. Mass surveillance next level and make snowden leaks look like kids stuff. So if you people think that china of all places would allow it cryptos and their permissionless ideology, you have maybe take 2 steps back and see what they are doingChina is not even trying to hide their surveillance, because they know no one can do anything about it. Ccp doesn't ask for public approval or permissions.I understand that trading allowed in china is good for volume and liquidity but that's all i can see it affecting. And remember that they are allowing trading of few cryptocurrencies in controlled cexes, so i don't see this as bullish for permissionless ideology of cryptos.",

They'll think before that closing their door from crypto helps them a lot and making their own digital currency is in demand. They'll overthink the impact of such action and now, they're getting back to get in touch and wanted to bring back blockchain on their territory and later own, they've thrown it again.Though we can say there us a huge impact of their leaving crypto but we're not sure about this time. If it helps to increase demand and price, then much better but still, we don't have to expect much from it.",

Blockchain in of itself isn't really limited to crypto, so them starting development about it wouldn't really bring any big changes imo (though some waves may be created but that's about it). Plus, wasn't there already talks about China doing blockchain research a few years back already? It being said again once more doesn't mean anything at this point imo. China opening up crypto again might bring some changes but it should be temporary impacts. Though it still remains that China's main identity is of surveillance, so I hardly doubt \"decentralization\" itself would grow from there. As for them being the lead since America's being, well, America, I doubt it. In the first place, I don't think there's any need to tie developments to a country? It is cryptocurrency after all.",

However, do not expect pumps on the Chinese projects immediately. What we should be doing is be the first to know the updates on which Chinese projects are going to be whitelisted in Hong Kong and mainland China.According to some people in social media, Hong Kong's regulatory guideline might start with allowing projects with proven track records before it whitelists newer, riskier projects. It might also not yet allow leverage and stablecoins.",

I would also speculate that the whiltelisted projects in Hong Kong might also be the first projects to be whitelisted in Shanghai once mainland China decides to open their country for the cryptospace again.Further solidifying our growing partnership with Web3 advancements in Hong Kong, Conflux is pleased to announce that it has become a senior member of the Institute of Web 3.0 in Hong Kong.As the only regulatory-compliant public blockchain in China, Conflux holds a unique advantage for projects seeking to build and expand into Asia. Therefore, our decision to join the Hong Kong Web 3.0 Institute as a senior member aligns perfectly with our initiatives. We are honored and enthusiastic about collaborating with other industry players in the Web3 space and actively demonstrating our support for Web3 development in Hong Kong.The Institute will be led by Norman Chan, the former Head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). Li Feng, CEO of China Mobile International, will serve as the Honorary Chairperson. Chanâ€™s extensive experience in traditional finance during his tenure at the HKMA will contribute to establishing a standardized framework for digital currencies within the new Institute.Source https://confluxnetwork.medium.com/conflux-joins-hong-kongs-new-web3-institute-2e14b8bb648",

It has the potential to have financial value similar to cryptocurrency and not only that, it also has cultural value for the community that own and hold them. I would also argue that because of the regulators in America are presently going after tokens and classifying them as illegal securities, some investments in tokens might go to NFT.Also, I am not quite certain if you are updated with the news, however, China has been opening up on the cryptospace again.
