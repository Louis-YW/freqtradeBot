Your hardware wallet does not become useless. The purpose of the device is to keep your seed and private keys protected from online attacks. It will do that as long as said keys haven't been entered into a hot/online wallet. If they go online, you can always generate a new seed that the hardware wallet will keep safe. I have never claimed any forks with my hardware wallet, but I would never put my Bitcoin in jeopardy when doing so. Save your old seed (the one where your current BTC is + the forks) and create a new one. You can then move your BTC from the old to an address on the new seed. If no other coins are on the old seed anymore, you can import that seed into wallets that support the forks and claim them one by one.   But be aware of a thing called replay protection when claiming BSV. BSV doesn't have it, so unless you split your coins before, you could lose one asset when making a transaction with the other fork. Check out LoyceV's Bitcoin Fork claiming guide (and service) for more information about that.",

That way, you could avoid risking exposing your current private key/seed. I looked at the supported assets on Ledger and Trezor as the two most popular hardware wallets today. Maybe the information can help OP to determine which of them to use based on the coins they support. Turns out that there is no difference when it comes to coin support.Both Ledger and Trezor support the following 'popular' Bitcoin forks and forks of those forks:Bitcoin Cash (BCH)Bitcoin Gold (BTG)Bitcoin Private (BTCP)The following hard forks aren't supported by Ledger or Trezor:Bitcoin SV (BSV)eCash (XEC) - used to be called Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA)There are other forks, but I think those above are the most talked about variants.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 05, 2022, 11:42:33 AMThat's true, although BSV is BCH fork though. Yeah, but we don't know how long OP has been involved with crypto and which assets he has used and how often to be eligible for hard forks.",

Forks may be worth a considerable amount of money if they are converted to btc as fast as possible. They are all scams but they are worth money when forked.bch for example was worth 0.1 btc when it was forked.If someone is smart enough and sold all forks anyone could easily increasetheir btc holding by 15-25% just by solding all forks. (it takes some time but it isn't a security problem if you move your btc) Ofc now those forks are worthless and nobody will get even 1% of their btc value in forks.I claimed all btc forks that I could and it was well worth my time. I even claimed the recent ethw fork, which is still worth about 0.01 eth.",

This is something related to Ledger HW, although maybe some other similar devices have an identical number of PIN entries before they are reset to factory values. It is interesting that Trezor allows up to 16 PIN entry attempts before it is reset to factory values, although the delay doubles after each attempt.Quote from: https://wiki.trezor.io/PINTo prevent brute-force attacks, after every failed attempt, Trezor enforces a delay before it lets you try a different PIN again. This delay increases by the factor of two each time. After 16 incorrect attempts, your device wipes itself, making it possible to access your funds only with the use of your recovery seed.Quote from: bitmover on October 05, 2022, 04:21:22 PMOfc now those forks are worthless and nobody will get even 1% of their btc value in forks.It's mostly like that, but there is at least one exception that you probably remember. At the time of the biggest attack on Bitcoin, one of those forks came dangerously close to the price that Bitcoin had at that time, and if my memory serves me well, it was worth about 60% of the price of one BTC. However, this does not change the fact that basically all these forks are completely meaningless in the sense that at least one (and there are more than 100 of them) did something better than Bitcoin.",
