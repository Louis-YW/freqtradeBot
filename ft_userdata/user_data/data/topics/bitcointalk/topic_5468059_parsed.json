It's designed for people who don't have time to reinforce their studies and it's interesting that you manage your learning time. I studied marketing and it was outstanding, it's a good alternative.",

Thx!If you are truly looking for cryptocurrency trading knowledge then why not hire a Mentor or Coach ? there have been plenty of them available Online that can mentor you one on one and can teach you everything you wanted to understand?or at least look for direct teaching buddies seems you are willing to pay like in universities , though hoping that you are not just making this thread to spam because there are 3 other account from your post that almost the same creation date as yours.",
