  "content": "After a few suggestions of Bitcointalk members in our topic \"List of useful Bitcoin block explorers\" here in \"Beginners & Help\", how to improve our table, we are going to hold a survey, where everyone can vote. We'll change our table accordingly because we want to honor valuable input from Bitcointalk members. He are all questions: Question 1Blockchair is curently rated at 8/10 points in our table. Because Blockchair is a very good explorer, there have been suggestions to increase Blockchair's rating. Should it be increased or is 8/10 an appropriate rating?  At how much points Blockchair should be rated? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 7 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 8 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 9 points? - Rating from Blockchair Bitcoin Block Explorer 10 points? (suggested by GazetaBitcoin)Question 2Because our comment section in our table is very large (and not really useful), some members suggested to remove the section from our table. - Remove \"comments\" column from our table - Yes - Remove \"comments\" column from our table - No (suggested by several members)Question 3In addition to question 2, we could instead dislay comments by using SFR10's hover format visualization. It's helpful but it won't display on Bitcointalk's mobile version. You'll find his suggestion here. It would look like that: Quote from: SFR10 on February 20, 2023, 03:28:34 PMWe can create a hover box by using the abbreviation tag in order to combine the \"Usefulness and Comments\" columns.- Comments will appear whenever they hover their mouse pointer over each of the ratings.e.g. this is the result for the row that has the longest comment:Name (link)Bech32 / Bech32m (P2TR) supported?SegWit (P2SH) identifiable?*Usefulness (subjective rating) Works without JSRated by_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________BitInfoChartsYes (09/2022) / No (11/2022)No (09/2022)7 / 10 PointsPartially**ajiz138Should we implement such a feature? - Include comments in \"hover format\" - Yes- Include comments in \"hover format\" - No(suggested by SFR10)Plz, vote @everyone.  We are very happy to receive your votes. You can also leave a comment here or garner support for one of the options.",

I think it will help improving the overall aspect of the table containing all block explorers.I, for one, gave the maximum mark to Blockchair, considering it best one available at the moment. Indeed, it may be improved, yet it's best we have  In case another explorer will contain more features than Blockchair I will lower its mark and give maximum mark to this new explorer.Regarding the other two questions, I suggest to voters to read them well and choose their votes in a non-contradictory manner: practically, those voting for removing \"Comments\" section should not vote with \"No\" at third question and those voting for keeping \"Comments\" section should not vote with \"Yes\" at third question.Practically, if \"Comments\" column is removed, these comments will be shown by hovering the mouse pointer over data from \"Usefulness\" column. Therefore, removing \"Comments\" column goes with using \"hover\" format, while keeping \"Comments\" column goes with not using \"hover\" format.I just wanted to make sure that all voters understand what they will be voting, as probably not all of them followed the discussion from the other thread.",

In case we'll get the outcome from above, we'll do a runoff vote if comments should be added as a column (since remove as a column- NO) has won or if comments should be included as hover format.

If we consider that Blockchair is currently the best option available, I might give it a 9/10 because, let's face it, nothing is perfect, but it is the closest to it.It's a really difficult question and that's also why this column contains (subjective rating  ) because it's up to everyone to rate it who suggested a certain Block explorer. In general, it's really difficult to determine which rating is 100% justified because some of us might like Blockexplorer 1, and some of us might go for Blockexplorer 2 instead.",

Quote from: UchihaSarada on February 26, 2023, 09:11:52 AMCould you include columns for- Privacy score- Lightning network stats/ charts- Information about mining pools, hashrate distributions.Privacy scaore would be interesting but as most Blockexplorers don't offer it, most of the column might be \"No\". Maybe we can add it in the comments? Lightning network stats might also have very little support among block exporers. I would like to recommend my Bitcoin statistics list instead, where many Lightning statistics are listed: List of interesting Bitcoin statistics. Information about mining pools, hashrate distributions are listed in my statistics topic as well.  Quote from: hugeblack on February 26, 2023, 12:52:30 PMWhy do we need to re-adjust the rating when Blockchair already has the highest rating? Because some members brought it up to re-evaluate the rating and we decided to ask the community. I don't know if there's support to increase Blockchair's rating, so I've cretaed a survey.  Quote from: hugeblack on February 26, 2023, 12:52:30 PMPersonally, I prefer to focus on aspects of privacy and UI, as it is the most important information for users, with the addition of a link to user experiences, which are new topics for each explorer through which each individual leaves his personal experience.Good idea, maybe people suggesting a new Blockexplorer could write a few more lines to describe why they've nominated it.

My bad, I thought you did not know the background of the debate... this is why I thought that you accidentally voted like that. Indeed, we did not think about this new possibility -- to have \"hover\" format on the data from \"Comments\" column... The idea was the following:- to make the table a bit smaller, thus fitting the screen well: and for that it was suggested to remove the \"Comments\" column and insert the comments using \"hover\" format on the data from \"Usefulness\" column- to keep the table as it is (meaning to keep \"Comments\" column), since 1miau managed to trim it somehow thus it fits well the screen now (after some implementations it did not fit properly the screen).I don't know why we would keep the \"Comments\" column and write there just \"#\" symbols which can be hovered...

      "body": "Agreed with SFR10.  Thought it may be more logical to rise Blockchair score to 10 since there is no 10 out of 10 scored Block Explorer.  But now that I think about it, it makes more sense to keep it on a lower level.There is a single thing I want to know.  This will make me decide if it deserves a 8 or a 9.  Blockchair offers this Privacy level for TXID's.  Block Explorers generally pick up and store a lot of information.  Is Blockchair's offered Privacy level for TXID's more Privacy intruding or can you generate the same scoring based on information picked up by any other Block Explorer?-Regards,PrivacyG",

Maybe we can just add a picture link of a screenshot from all comments (our current comments section / our current table) below and people can simply view our table on that external picture (imgur), how it is right now.

I'm not a coder, so I don't know how exactly a certain Blockexplorer works and it might not make a difference because all Blockexplorers will have the same \"Access\" to any tx, so it doesn't matter much what's displayed there; it matters more if a certain Blockexplorer stores any data related to people visiting their site and entering tx (in general a Blockexplorer has access to any tx, no matter if it's entered or not). It might be a good question for our Services (or better Technical Discussion board) to get a qualified answer because it's a very specific one.",
