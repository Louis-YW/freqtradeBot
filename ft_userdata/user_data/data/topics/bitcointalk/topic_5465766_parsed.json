  "content": "What happened::  I received this fake Binance (phishing) email to my mail just now. I'm not sure how these scammers got hold of my email because I've never used it for anything other than the Binance exchange, so I'm wondering if Binance database was just hacked or anything. In the email, they ask users to exchange their BUSD stablecoin to FDUSD coin (I didn't click the link) prior to February 2024. If you receive this email, it is almost certainly a fraud or a phishing link designed to wipe your BUSD. Be cautious and avoid clicking it. Why are these exchanges selling our personal information?

I may be wrong though but these are my personal observations influenced by my personal experiences with Binance and other mobile apps in which securities seem to have been comprised or watched by hackers.",

This is the best decision you have made, and due to some of the dormant account policies on Binance, the matter has become scary. It is best, if you are a long-term investor, to hold your crypto on a hardware wallet or reliable decentralized wallets. Putting your entire capital in the Binance platform alone is a big adventure in light of the regulatory wars and the FUD that revolve around it, Binance is not suitable as a wallet only for trading and P2P.The message you got is actually an announcement that was already published on 2023-08-31 with the title (Binance Encourages Users to Convert BUSD to Other Stablecoins Prior to February 2024) -  [ SOUCE ] I clicked on the Reference link, and it directed me to the official announcement link on the Binance official website.As for bntrace.com, it is an official domain from Binance. You can verify this yourself through: https://www.binance.com/en/official-verification. 1-Enter the domain link and click \"Search\".",

I have exchanged and withdrawn BUSD a few times from the exchange, but I don't hold a balance on that, nor do I have any outstanding balance with them.But since all this business of a thing started, I have never received an email regarding this from them. Is it because I don't have an active balance, or am I not a relevant customer to them?ðŸ¤”But other security-related emails usually come through, either when I make a deposit or withdraw a new login from a new location or device, but not this one. Maybe it's for the best, as it might also prevent me from receiving some suspicious emails from scammers.",

They think I am a novice that would rush to Click the link and give them access to my details through their phishing link. It is obvious there is information or data breach somewhere. It is either data been traded or a hack must have occurred and it is kept away from the public notice so as to avoid escalations.

Meanwhile, I have countlessly used my email on several sites. I had one argument with Nwada001 in the past, although I can't find the thread again, where he explained how some of those scammers can steal users emails. I just believe that your email was obtained by those scammers through some other means; I might not be that yourÂ  details was sold out by Binance. Also, I know that Binance is a very large exchange, and they have staffs who are humans like us, and I don't know if I should believe that those staff can have hands in selling user information.",
