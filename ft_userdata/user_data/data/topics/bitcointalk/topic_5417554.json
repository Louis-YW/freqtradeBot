The issue I have is that it looks to be fairly small volume at the moment - or it was when I last went their.I also haven't posted because I don't know what to expect from the community before I do but maybe that's just me - I've seen quite a few \"nice\" threads on there (such as people building connections/starting projects and others trying to advertise services which both seem to have gone down quite well with the community - there were more general discussions on the lightning network and bitcoin too and the majority of the content seems focussed on that).",

What do you think?I like the phrase 'make blog posts payable in bitcoin' this action will not only reward good posters in the forum but also create additional utility for btc. No doubt it is a great idea and will help in rewarding good content, i think it will also motivate others to enhance their ability to post good content too. To gain a more effective result is when there is no such thing as campaigns, you get rewarded strictly base on the quality of your post, spammers and shit posters will be left with two option, either put some effort to post quality content or voluntarily leave as a result of lack of reward.",

Iirc the site offers you the ability to tip authors in bitcoin over the lighting network - I've seen no mention of them having or wanting to create their own currency for doing this or for making an automated system or airdropping funds to users.I guess the issue I'd see is that commenting only costs 1 sat but that might be a positive thing too (it's not costly enough for it to be seen as spending something but is expensive enough it'll stop spam - especially if they have a good moderation team).Quote from: NotATether on October 18, 2022, 05:18:11 PMQuote from: BlackHatCoiner on October 18, 2022, 05:13:42 PMI forgot to say that they're planning to go decentralized:Quote from: https://github.com/stackernews/stacker.newsNext year we plan to begin decentralizing SN on an open peer to peer network.How? Are they going to run it on I2P/Tor or on some blockchain such as Ethereum? They never really mentioned any details about that.You read \"plan to begin\" as \"begin\". On a serious note, from what they've already built it's probably not hard to get something that's decentralised up and running (especially if you're paying a sat to post - you already have to sign something to do that so identity verification is already done). I could think a list of hosts might be all that's needed to start decentralising (followed by an app in due course).",

I think I registered there a few years ago, but it never kicked off for me, and then I forgot about that for a long time, until now.Stacker news looks like a small community, with very tiny tips from what I see so far (probably too tiny to actually be an incentive). I also have mixed feelings about the frequent thunder appearing in the central area from top to bottom. I get it that they use Lightning network, but still, it runs through the text and seems distracting. I'm happy, though, that this community exists and that they're a good use case for LN.",

      "body": "It is interesting that they are using bitcoin and lightning network but I still think the idea is fundamentally flawed. It is like Steemit and nobody could claim it is a success. The reason in my opinion is that there are already alternatives to this system that don't have the payment factor as \"incentive\" and they are working fine.From small Q&A forums like stackoverflow to blog like sites like medium are more popular and I don't see that changing just because they added a payment method on top (still centralized website though).",

Perfect for receiving tips for a project or similar, you just leave your lightning address there.And it's all just so streamlined. You just use the site and everything works.",
