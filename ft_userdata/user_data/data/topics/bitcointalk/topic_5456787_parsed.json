  "content": "Good morning,I'm new here, and new in the crypto world.Earlier this year I opened an account with Kraken and bought some Bitcoins and some Etherums.A few months ago I also bought a Ledger key (with $20 offered in bitcoin)Since I made a first transfer of Bitcoins (for test) from my Kraken account to \"Ledger Live\"Transfer n°1: 100€, Kraken Fee: 0.00020 BTC (about 5€), Arrived on \"Ledger Live\" Fee: 0.00019023 BTC (4,708€)blockstream.info: SEGWIT FEE SAVINGS This transaction saved 27% on fees by upgrading to native SegWit-Bech32Transfer n°2: 1900€, Kraken Fee: 0.00020 BTC (about 5€), Arrived on \"Ledger Live\" Fee: 0.00038385 BTC (9.282€)blockstream.info: SEGWIT FEE SAVINGS This transaction saved 17% on fees by upgrading to native SegWit-Bech32I claim my $20 of Bitcoin Offer: Arrived on \"Ledger Live\" €18.05 Fee: 0.00021581 BTC (€5.23)blockstream.info: SEGWIT FEE SAVINGS This transaction saved 5% on fees by upgrading to native SegWit-Bech32Do all these Fees seem normal for you?But above all, why in Transaction n°2 I paid quazi double 0.00038385 BTC instead of 0.00020 BTC? (I have a screenshot that shows 0.00020 BTC of Fee before clicking on send in Kraken)Should I contact Kraken, or there are other Fees added \"after Kraken\" in the transaction process ?I don't understand.Thank you.",

(I have a screenshot that shows 0.00020 BTC of Fee before clicking on send in Kraken)You didn't pay 0.00038385 BTC. You paid 0.0002 BTC as withdrawal fee on Kraken. The 0.00038385 BTC displayed on block explorers like blockstream is the fee paid for your transaction by Kraken to miners. Kraken probably processed multiple withdrawals in a single transaction and got 0.0002 BTC for each of them. Quote from: maitre.spark on June 18, 2023, 06:12:38 PMShould I contact Kraken, or there are other Fees added \"after Kraken\" in the transaction process ?No need. As said, you paid 0.0002 BTC.

      "body": "I haven't personally used Kraken, so I cannot provide specific details about that exchange. However, I can tell you that many exchanges have different fee structures in place. Typically, there is a fixed fee for withdrawing funds from the platform, as well as a dynamic fee determined by the network for each transaction.The dynamic fee can vary depending on the current conditions of the network. This means that at different times, the transaction fee may differ based on the prevailing network conditions.If you want accurate information regarding your specific case without sharing your private data publicly, it is best to reach out to Kraken's support.

      "body": "If you make a transaction from your own wallet to some destination address, you will have to take care of the transaction fee for that transaction. I usually want to choose a fee based on what my needs are how fast that transaction should be mined into a block. If I don't have time restrictions for the confirmation of a transaction, I can choose a lower fee than if I have to get that transaction into the next or next few blocks.A good place to take a look at current estimated fees based on how fast a transaction should be confirmed is e.g. https://mempool.spaceLook at the middle left part with headline TRANSACTION FEES:*Transactions below the Purging amount are likely discarded from mempools with standard size*No Priority might take some hours or even days to confirm (it depends, hover your mouse over the title and an explanation is displayed)*Low, Medium, High Priority: at High Priority fee should get your transaction confirmed into the next block, though there's no guarantee. The other two are a little vague in the explanation. (I liked the older estimation there better where Low was about in an hour or two, Medium was somewhere around 30minPretty much self-explanatory is https://bitcoinexplorer.org/ where the SMART FEES (sat/vB) shows the estimated fee rate for next block (asap), within an hour and within a day.",

I see. I thought kraken charged a transaction fee on top of their fixed fees, but it looks like they do not. Thank you for the clarification!This is the same also with most casinos, they have fixed fees but if you try to look at block explorers, the actual fee varies according to the actual activity of the bitcoin network. Sometimes they will pay higher or lower than what you paid for them.You can check their actual deductions by checking your account itself as you know how much satoshis you have in your account.In time, the OP will understand that if it is the third party platform doing the transaction, he can't control the fees used to pay the miners.However, if the transaction is coming from his noncustodial wallet, he can easily adjust the fees according to his needs.",

I feel so stupide now  Sorry.No need to apologize! Everyone starts somewhere.The fee you see in Ledger Live is the fee Kraken paid to miners for the transaction which your withdrawal was part of. However, there were also 20+ other withdrawals part of the same transaction. So Kraken took 0.0002 BTC from you, 0.0002 BTC from everyone else, paid 0.00038385 BTC in transaction fees, and then pocketed the rest as profits for themselves.Quote from: maitre.spark on June 19, 2023, 12:12:11 AMWould it have worked in the same way ( with my ledger: https://shop.ledger.com/products/ledger-nano-s-plus ) if i had chosen \"Bitcoin (Lightning Network)\" in place of \"Bitcoin Network\" on Kraken before to send? or not?No, it would not have worked. The Lightning Network is what is known as a second layer, and is built on top of bitcoin. To receive bitcoin over lightning, you must first have regular bitcoin (which you now have in your Ledger), a lightning compatible wallet (which Ledger Live is not), and use those regular bitcoin to open a Lightning channel. This is something you can look in to for the future if you want, but you've done nothing wrong so far.The reason you paid such a high fee is because all centralized exchanges like Kraken charge high fees.",

I saw a couple guys here too explain this to you but let me put it in a language you could understand. You got free 20 bucks from buying your ledger wallet, you installed kraken and you transferred bitcoins and ethereum to it too prior to buying the ledger wallet. When your 20 bucks free came into your wallet, you only saw 18.05, this is normal, you basically paid Kraken 2 bucks for the transaction, and the 5 euros you see in perhaps the transaction hash is not what you paid, but rather what Kraken paid for the transaction to process. This payment goes towards the miners who facilitated your transaction, and is one way for them to profit from this industry besides mining for bitcoin. If you keep depositing money on Kraken, and then withdrawing them to your ledger wallet you'd keep seeing this 2 different transaction fees getting processed. This is normal as you basically bridged 2 different platforms.",
