  "content": "I don't know how reasonable my question is  The question arose in my mind so I mentioned it here . We all know that Elon Musk has bought the biggest social media Twitter. We also know that he always prefers his doge coins over everything else. Yesterday I saw his tweet that you have to run Twitter with money(commercial like Crypto projects) and it is understood that will do it with doge coins. Now my point is that now that Twitter is owned by Elon Musk, if that ever happens to be a barrier to Twitter users using Bitcoin, what can we have as an alternative to Twitter? Because now many big projects do their marketing,branding through Twitter.",

You have nothing to worrry about if you think bitcoin can be affected, it won't.But what I am thinking about is that it is possible for Elon Musk to manipulate in a way doge will be more visible on Twitter while other coins will not, but I still think this will not be possible but just my assumption.But bitcoin does not depend on Twitter, there are other social media and forums too.But definitely that Elon Musk will try to manipulate the market.",
