Some people will say \"But, a crypto user will gonna to support that\" let be honest about that.If you don't get any profitable on #Metaverse, you're not gonna to do it. People in crypto more like it 90% gonna to do it just because profit, take example from NFTs space a few month ago.",

It can't be denied that many of them are already dead before the bear season comes and more had followed at this time. And the reason why these projects don't have backup support in order for them to grow but were just only for socialization development, and we know that not all are having fun with it. Honestly, I don't have any of these projects, not even have the plan to invest in them for I don't see any potential to keep them.",

First a new project appears that is doing something new and people and also institutions find this idea really interesting and therefore the valuation of this projects is rising like crazy. This of course is the reason why a lot of other people also want to come out with a project of the same type in order to hop on the hype train and also earn a lot of money. This happens until the market is over saturated and then 95% of those new projects are dying again.That being said, i believe that the metaverse has a future. Maybe it will not be THE BIGGEST trend of the next decade but it will still be relevant i think.",

I believe a handful of projects will come out with great metaverse games in the near future.If you are looking for the valuation then i doubt people will be spending huge amounts for the NFT unless it has a real use case purpose of using them in the game as a rare product.",
