No doubt the fact that your document contains some known fact about Satoshi and his work but the truth remains that, most information around the internet about satishi personality are just mere assumptions and unproven information.",

I do not even have a new or old name, which I think is useless anyway.There are a few issues to be raised, some of them have not, or rarely and incompletely, been investigated. Let's start with this:Did you ever look at the bibliography of the Bitcoin whitepaper?From a formal, scientific publishing perspective, it is rather \"lousy\".The average age of citations predates 1990, i.e., more than 18 years prior to the release of the Whitepaper.The bibliography is very short, essentially half of the papers [3-5] (plus [2]) from the \"fathers\" of blockchan (Stornetta & Haber), 2 web links [1,6] that have reportedly been added after the Whitepaper was already finished, 1 from the oldest, 1957-edition of a standard text book [8], and 1 citation [2] from a local, 1999 networking meeting from the Benelux that hardly any US-American would have had on the radar, and hard to find and retrieve. Does that raise any eyebrows?",

You find more potential interpretations in the paper.Note that these points, and other circumstantial evidence dug out in the paper, are certainly of speculative character, but you find more evidence that hints towards a certain propensity of Satoshi Nakamoto for \"puns\".So here is the abstract of the preprint entitled \"Satoshi Nakamoto and the Origins of Bitcoin – Narratio in Nomine, Datis et Numeris (There is a Story is in the Name, Dates and Numbers)\":The mystery about the ingenious creator of Bitcoin concealing behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto has been fascinating the global public for more than a decade. Suddenly jumping out of the dark in 2008, this persona hurled the highly disruptive distributed ledger technology “blockchain” that has added the missing native value layer to the internet. Purposely agnostic without advocating any old or fielding new names, this paper first identifies the degrees of freedom Satoshi Nakamoto had available in the design of Bitcoin, and in fabricating snippets of personal data.By interweaving the substantial collection of previous and new circumstantial with direct evidence, like relevant locations and happenings in history and at the time, a consistent skeleton of Satoshi Nakamoto’s biography transpires. The results underpin that the iconic creator of Bitcoin most likely encoded bits of information in his self-chosen alias, dates and blockchain parameters, which particularly point to the numbers 21 and 42, and the numeral systems used in Bitcoin’s framework.Moreover, a psychogram of a reclusive and capricious genius is drawn, which sheds new light on Satoshi Nakamoto’s background, mindset, pastimes, and penchant for puns; this study may also explain the motivation of his abrupt departure from the online community, his continuing abstinence from engaging with the Bitcoin community, and from reaping the fruits of his mindboggling wealth. From a history of science and technology perspective, such an altruistic sacrifice for the benefit of his brainchild is entirely unprecedented.Note: For getting a better grip on the (unavoidably) large document systematically gathering the comprehensive pool of existing and new circumstantial evidence, you might use the bookmarks panel in teh PDF file.",
