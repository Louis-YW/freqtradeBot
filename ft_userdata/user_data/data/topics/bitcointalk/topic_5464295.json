It's not easy to keep on buying when you have an already invested amount dropping down in value when you were expecting a rise in price by this period of the year but reverse is the occurrence, which also on the other hand shouldn't be a thing of surprise for those that have familiarize themselves with volatility of the market.We shouldn't base our expectations of the market to most of these market  speculators, they could be speculating base on emotions and perspective.  Your view on the  price of bitcoin currently now depends on you, to some it's a bad moment but for some others it's an opportunity for future profit. What you do with this moment would matter on your portfolio a lot in time to come .",

The price is going up but I don't know if it will get up to $30k.$26k is the current price, before the end of this week my instincts tells me that we're going to have it at $29-$30...

So it shouldn’t be a thing a of worry but rather a moment of accumulation. But we can’t take away the fear of losing away from newbies during every drop price, because most are early into this and may have invested money that they are not capable of investing into it. The market experts are those that will appreciate the moment because of the prior experience as this will give them another opportunity to accumulate. As for me I will stick to DCA and not panic since a 1 bitcoin remains 1 bitcoin no matter the conditions",

If you remember price of Bitcoin few months back, it was around 16k$ and from there it jumped to 30K$. The price was very much stable on 30k$ and we have to admit that Bitcoin wasn't able to break resistance of 30k$. Now there is small DIP of 4k$ and we have speculations that price of Bitcoin is not encouraging. Just HODL and dont panic, Bitcoin is going no where.",

Common newbie investors or traders are the main ones who do affected with these drops and to those who are experienced then they do already get used to it.The key on here is that never ever make yourself that checks out the price every now and then because no matter how experienced you are, you are really that putting yourself on the chance on being that impulsivesince we are just humans which emotions could really take control of you anytime.",

But at the same time, it’s an opportunity for those that have not invested to buy at a lower price than some that have bought earlier at an higher price compared to this. As it is advantageous to some, it is also disadvantageous to some which no one has control over.QuoteDo not let the price of bitcoin right now make you give up on you investment plans, the drop in price is just a distraction to make you take a decision that can make you regret of the better days of the market coming.There’s no a bad time to enter into the market, if you employ the DCA method since you started your investment, it’ll be very easy to take advantage of this opportunities that comes around with the volatile nature of the market.

If you are buying Bitcoin, you know that the price will rise and fall at certain times. Being able to wait for the price to rise is more important than anything else. The Bitcoin investor has also learned to wait over time. I cannot say anything to those who invest in Bitcoin in the short term, but those who invest in the long term understand what I am saying. The investor who knows how to wait always wins.One of the most beautiful features of Bitcoin is the possibility of its price to rise in a short time. So when the price goes up, it's good to see your investment gain value quickly. Especially if you have made the investment and managed to wait in the long term, Bitcoin will not mislead you.",

Its true that most people are really looking after about increase in price most of the time on which we know that this market is really that volatile in the first place and that what makes it profitable if you do really just know on how to play with the price movement. Its true that checking out from time to time about price drops could really give out that kind of reaction and emotions on which it might really be leading into that possible alteration of your trading decisions which it wont really be that good for you.Always be wise on when to get in and when to get out specially when you are in profits. Market cant really be calm most of the time and there would really be moments where storms and waves do really surges.This is why it is one of the most common risks and scenario that you would be facing in this market. Falling price is common and instead on seeing this as an disadvantage, it would really be rather wise on taking this as an opportunity to have some nice or good entry.",

I think that by visualizing such lower price there will be some individuals who will consider halving period as a wrong information because demand is not such high for bitcoin that was in previous months.The price is greatly related with that of demands so when price reduces and reductions is because of news so may be it negatively impact the demand and I don't know what will be in future but as the price is still lower so holders will be in hope for the correction again.",
