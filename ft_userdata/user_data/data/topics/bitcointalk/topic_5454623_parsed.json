Think about this, Crypto traders that profit on your said currency will always find a new currency to enter for chasing that same kind of profit which means there’s always an opportunity to earn that kind of profit if you will just keep searching and willing to take risk.I missed a lot of opportunity too on other cryptocurrency even though I already purchased it on early stage but instead of regretting about the profit that I missed, I just dedicate my time on research about potential projects on multiple chains. You can start by searching potential Alpha tokens on pre launch or IDO. It’s just a waste of time thinking about what you missed while you can dedicate that time on doing something productive. We can’t enter all the pump train but we can secure a few of it if we have the patience on research.",

No matter how the word investment is preached, the word regret will always appear in our crypto lexicon. Regret is what you will see people expressing at the time the bull run takes off. But I tell you those who will regret are those who will never take the advantage to invest. They misplace advantage to be risk, risk in investing in bitcoin instead of taking the advantage.",

The factor in common with all theae you've mentioned is risk, dont even try them if you can't take the risk at the highest level with altcoins investment, opportunities are coming everyday but we don't actually know which is better or not, we should also see it a great privilege that we are not involved as part of the experience of those who lost their investments at the cause with any of the then collapsed coins.",

I think the key is in your willingness to take risks. because new projects will continue to exist with potential advantages and disadvantages. because when a successful project appears, it will be followed by many failed projects. even after success, there will be those who will take advantage of the hype that ensues.those who are careful in choosing and also brave in taking a gamble on a new project can take advantage. but some don't want to join any project other than their belief in Bitcoin.",

But you must tell yourself that you still have many opportunities to get big profits, so you have to use this time to prepare. Better late to make a profit than not at all. You are still better than those who have decided to leave crypto for good because you still have the opportunity to invest. But not for those who leave crypto because it has already failed.

Regrets about missed opportunities will not make you a rich person.  It is much more useful to conduct a system analysis and determine for yourself - how can you make a profit in the future?  Planning for the future requires an analysis of the past.  Of course, new profit opportunities are constantly emerging.  You need to prepare yourself to conclude new profitable deals.  Reflection in this matter is more harmful than helpful.  You still have time to make huge profits!  In fact, two or three successful trades can make you a rich person.",

Of course we all want the safety of our funds but if we don't risk it for a better opportunities then nothing will change. The volatility it gives people the fear to lose their funds, but as time pass by we are learning. We're already using those volatility as advantages for us to earn and have profit.

Yes agree with you. making profit like investing btc, doge is not over yet and there is still opportunities to get it. i pointed out from all these big coins that we should enter in coins at early stage but question is there are hundreds coin launching everyday then how can we select one which give us maximum profit. The answer is to look for any new coin from mew chain kr new idea not launched any coin on this idea before. Aidoge the first coin in arbitrum also give early users 100x in two days.Now Zksync and polygon evm chain are new and not big project launched yet. If any project with big partnerships start business then we should not miss this because as a early user we will be given whitelist to participate in sell or we will he given airdrop and both are Worthy.",

You're right that there will be always some opportunities from different projects but they're hard to figure out. I'd rather go with the slow-moving of those cryptos that have been there for a while like Bitcoin. It's trusted and tested and that's why going with it is a good way to deal with your regrets. It's not even that late to get some Bitcoin and if you do trust it in the long run, you'll be happy to have it while it's not yet pumping a lot and haven't been back to the former ATH.Quote from: ajiz138 on May 31, 2023, 07:02:13 PMIn crypto there is always an opportunity, make sure we have passed the coin period above but in the future we will see which coins have the same potential so it's better to think ahead and don't look back at the past regrets.It's normal to check those regrets but you're right that there are the opportunities that we can take while looking at those projects that we might interested in investing.",
