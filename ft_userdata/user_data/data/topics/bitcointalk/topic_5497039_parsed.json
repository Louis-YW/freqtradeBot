  "content": "Bitcoin developers are ones which with the aid of proper education, training, research and practical work have helped in improving their skills and knowledge about bitcoin resulting to quality contribution to the bitcoin ecosystem, making it fast and efficient.It is true, bitcoin developers have being increasing over the years but with recent happenings, don't you think bitcoin need more developers?With the rapid adoption of bitcoin around the world where by some countries now uses bitcoin as a legal tender, companies and some other stores or shop now also uses bitcoin as a means of payment and concerning creating awareness or educating new users, I think the need for more developers should be considered.Everyday more people are coming in, more hands are needed on security and privacy of bitcoin transactions, assurance of  the primary nature of bitcoin as a decentralized asset, wallet development and educating now users.I think they should be sent in badges to areas where bitcoin haven't been heard or where their is no knowledge about digital gadgets or have access to the internet.Am always open to learn and to take corrections.what are your opinions?",

      "body": "Since Bitcoin is complete decentralized, Bitcoin needs a lot of developers to contribute for solving issues and improving the current feature to meet the increasing demand. This why Bitcoin is an open source to become open for collaboration with other developers since Satoshi is already out of the picture. But right now, Most of the development notably Ordinals and Runes makes Bitcoin like the other Blockchain flooded by shitcoins that spam the mempool due to the hype. This kind of upgrade? creates chaos to Bitcoin. We need more developers with Satoshi vision and not those shitcoin visionaries that want to apply shitcoin feature on Bitcoin.",

You only need a educated person, who might not even know the technicalities of the blockchain. Speaking of adoption rate, security, and privacy, and keeping these requirements in mind, I don't think we need more developers, we only need some good and loyal developers to the BTC. Who really cares about the true nature of the BTC and don't want to change it.They might be playing with privacy issues, and as we know due to the approval of ETFs governments are taking more interest in the crypto sphere, and trying hard to provide proper anonymity to the BTC users. So I think if government is against privacy in BTC finance then we can't do anything but adopt proper methods in place",

      "body": "This is quite a nice question Op. Now my reason for saying so is quite simple. If you come to think of it, Bitcoin is a decentralized crypto currency and for decentralization to be effective , there should be no sort of primary center of control rather the control or rules should be made by a majority idea not a single unit. In the case of Bitcoin the users, developers,and miners are in full control over the entire Blockchain system except core protocols like the base code of Bitcoin.Therefore in my opinion I believe more developers would be nice for the Blockchain since that would mean more people sharing the total collective power of decision making on the block chain.Quote from: Nwada001 on May 19, 2024, 08:34:48 PMIf there are more people willing to join the team of developers, then they are free to join, after all, the code is open source.Is it the work of the team to protect other teams from being hacked, or do they focus on the main development of the Bitcoin network, detect and fix bugs, and also improve the protocol where necessary? If there is anything that needs to be protected from hacking, it's the Bitcoin network itself and not the team involved.This is one of the more reasons having more developers would be nice. Just like the 51% rule, it would be easier for developers to protect and monitor the block chain properly with a larger magnitude of collective efforts.",

They don't just go out then teach anyone else who is interested. They are the pillars of the development, while sharing the information is for the communities backed by different business, volunteers, etc.Again don't be confused, developers are for bitcoin development and the rrst are for communities. Well, sometimes there are developers who have huge influence do this, either can be seen in conferences, YT videos snd other platforms, but don't expect too much for them because most of them are introverts — only good in communicating by chats, while have different personality in persons or video chats.",

This site is https://brink.dev/donate - is supporting bitcoin developers thru their grants. I don't know about new developers. But I believe, there are other sites trying to help these existing developers. After all, they are maintaining the btc network and other related aspects of it. They need to focus on their works, hence, they need funding as getting out from their pockets is quite hard for them.",

You can start doing what you are suggesting about going to remote areas and try to introduce it with those people. We need more contributors.",

What’s wrong with having a lot of bitcoin developers? At least we can guarantee that bitcoin will always have a room to grow and develop, and these developers will make it work and happen. Although we are currently amazed already how innovative and advanced bitcoin is, but changes are inevitable, so we need to cope with it, otherwise bitcoin will be ignored and left behind. If we can gain a lot of developers for bitcoin, then so be it. I don’t think they’ll be here for nothing, but everyone is still hopeful for more bitcoin features and advantages, that’s why we, the bitcoin community and the smart developers should consistently work hand in hand to create more bitcoin opportunities and benefits in the near future.",

One thing you should understand about bitcoin is that you can't force it on people,  especially those that don't have Internet and electricity.  The major thing one needs to have to know bitcoin is access to Internet.  Going to areas to give people awareness of bitcoin with no access of good Internet is a waste of time because after telling them about bitcoin what will be next step for them. For bitcoin to get more awareness is just a matter of time. You can't force people to know about Bitcoin,  instead you give people time and a day will come which they will develope interest in bitcoin and will be willing to know more about it. If you tell people about bitcoin and they are not convinced or willing to accept it, it will be of no use even if they get some bitcoin because if anything happens you will be blamed.
