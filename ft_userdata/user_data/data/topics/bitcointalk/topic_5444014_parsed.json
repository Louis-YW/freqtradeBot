If he was changing IPs then it should have been obvious from the start. Why ask him for KYC then? From what I can see here they were hoping he wouldn't give them his ID but since he did everything right with KYC they came up with a fraud charge. If OP was making multiple accounts and claiming bonuses that he tried to withdraw and disappear, they would have the right to do what they did, but it doesn't seem like the bonus, or another account had anything to do with his win in slots. Metaspins should provide a solid proof against OP and explain why his deposit wasn't returned. Another IP or another account with the same IP doesn't justify stealing a deposit.",

Metaspins casino confiscate Your money (cryptocurrency) , due to breach of Metaspins terms and conditions.It is very logical for a SCAM casino to do like that, they just keep all deposit and do not withdraw any winnings.Please let me know Your opinion on thatFirst, once you have agreed to the terms and conditions of the casino, you should understand that you may not create multiple accounts without confirming with the casino before your big win. There is a possibility that you could withdraw your winnings if you informed the casino about multiple accounts before they detected multiple accounts on your end.It's true, in most cases your deposit will be processed, your loss accepted and they will not close your account before you try to withdraw the big win. But considering there are terms and conditions that you have agreed to, then I think you have to admit the mistake that sounds like having multiple accounts at the same casino.Quote8. USE OF PLAYER’S ACCOUNT8.1 Only one Account per person, household, IP address and computer device is allowed. Creating multiple user accounts may result in termination of the accounts and suspending of all payouts. If two or more users share the same household, IP address and computer device, We must be informed by the respective Accounts’ holders. You shall not provide access to your user account or allow any third party use of the website including but not limited to minors. Any returns, winnings or bonuses which you have gained or accrued during such time as the duplicate account was active may be reclaimed by us, and you undertake to return to us on demand any such funds which have been withdrawn from the duplicate account. Should We decide to leave one account open, it will be the first account that you opened with us, to which your remaining deposits, if any, will be transferred.Reference: https://metaspins.com/info/terms-and-conditions",

Because withdrawal is the most important part for gamblers, if a gambler withdraw without obstruction then they will recommend the casino and if the opposite is found then this is what happens. And it damaged the name of the company. I will advise the metaspins Casino representative here in the forum to come and say something about the allegation. Difficulty in the process of depositing is better than difficulty in the process of withdrawal. Depositing difficulty would not tarnishes one's reputation while the withdrawal difficulty tarnishes one's reputation. Metaspins should build their image in a good way.",

You are 100% percent true - Metaspins casino management did nothing on registration step, credited account with a bonus, did not request anything in the process. Casino management decided to close account and confiscate balance in about 10 minutes after KYC was successfully completed. pixie85 do You think 10 minutes would be enough for Fraud team to complete investigation  ?     This is Metaspins final decision.",

If that's really the case then I think they want to scam people in a way that it won't be called a scam since they can show everyone that you violated some of their rules liie having multiple accounts and such. Anyway, is your country not one of the countries that are not eligible to gamble in their platform?. There are casinos like that where some countries are blocked in their platform to gamble for some reason.In fact, if you look at TaC metaspins.com then you can see that there is a very small list of limited territories that include countries such as Afghanistan, Cuba, Curacao, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Isle of Man, Italy, Malta, Netherlands and its territories, North Korea, Belarus, Spain, Sudan, Syria, United Kingdom and its territories, United States. My home country is Latvia. It is not in their list.You can see the last reply of Metaspins representative, it is just a copy paste message, it does not provide any evidence, just modern words like \"Metaspins customer experience during their gaming journey with us is a number one priority\" , \"internal procedures\" these are abstract phrases, that do not prove anything.If Metaspins casino is 100% sure in what they are posting , they can prove it.If they can not prove, then I would say Metaspins casino number one priority is NOT pay any winnings, or at least large winnings.",

      "body": "Quote from: Metaspins.com on March 09, 2023, 08:01:17 AMUnfortunately, due to all the gathered evidence, your accounts were disabled and fraudulent winnings were removed.This doesn't make sense. You claim to have removed fraudulent winnings, but you've stolen his deposit. So what is this about, his fraudulent winnings or making a few dollars at the expense of a client?I've worked in customer service for 2 years and we'd never hold client's deposit, even if that client was using multiple accounts or trying to cheat KYC. Your explanation of a bonus abuse doesn't hold because OP won a lot of money. Many times more than the bonus provided by the casino, so the casino did not lose money because he claimed the bonus, but because he got lucky and won and he would've won without the bonus, because according to him he deposited a much higher amount than what he was betting ($420 to play with a $5bet). I don't know what the bonus was, but you could've handled it in many different ways that would satisfy both you and the client, like returning his deposit only, or subtracting the bonus from his balance.Would you mind giving some more details about the case? I'm asking because the multi accounting argument is also pretty weak, since OP went through KYC procedure. Did all \"his other accounts\" also submit KYC? Did all other accounts also have deposits, if yes then how big? Did other accounts also win money in your casino?Did any of the accounts managed to withdraw anything?",
