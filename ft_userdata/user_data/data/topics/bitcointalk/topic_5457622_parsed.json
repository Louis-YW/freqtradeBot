Let us see what will happen after the next halving, I think bitcoin will get there some months, 1 or 2 years after next year halving.Quote from: Wind_FURY on June 26, 2023, 09:52:06 AM- That Gensler CAN'T truly ban cryptoMany crypto currencies are securities just like their father ethereum is a security and becoming more centralised day by day. Ethereum developers are working now to reduce validators from people that stake 32 ETH to people that stake 2048 ETH. Becoming more centralised day by day by all ways.Know that not all altcoins are securities. Litecoin and few others which are not like ethereum are not considered as securities.",

Although the news media has a lot to say about being wary of a recession. but in fact in the field around me, I see that economic conditions are improving. where the level of people's spending seems to be still normal, even I see they have become much more extravagant lately. and inflation is still under control here.For the problems of institutional investors, I think they will definitely come back, maybe even they are slowly coming back. Many large companies today have approached crypto. Even with blackrock's current approach proposing a spot Bitcoin ETF is a sign that big things are coming.",

But again we are hopeful that the global economy will witness a revolution that will catch across the globe, the recession should be treated as a global economic crisis and at that, we must look into other sectors that can act independently e.g Bitcoin which is a global economic tool that can transform the economy if properly engaged. This will give birth to Bitcoin becoming a global economic instrument,  again this is based on hope and wishes or being optimistic.",

But not all will be pessimistic, there will always be two opposing schools in every situation. Honestly, the economic crisis isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it will negatively affect many areas and many people, but not all because when others collapse, it is also our opportunity if we know how to take advantage. Like the covid 19 pandemic, many people have gone bankrupt, but many have become rich because of it because they know how to take advantage and find opportunities with it. Some friends I know, they took a risk when they invested in the health industry during the pandemic, and they succeeded thanks to the pandemic when all other sectors were closed, but the health industry always had to operate at maximum capacity to meet demand.",

Meaning that I don't believe in a global recession this time, it only threatened but subsided already. Except that some poor countries are there already, it's just that when the countries of the world power are not there, it's not always spelt out.Also, it's only God that knows how much the Russian-Ukriane war would escalate, and I believe it all depends on Russia. If they use a more aggressive approach and fought with forbidden weapons or strike NATO nations, it can escalate. As for crypto, regulation is a must and the regulation will even remove the ban from some countries as they would rather copy others over time.Lastly, the institutional investors are already controlling Bitcoin but the next halving period will be the first they are strongly in charge of the coin. It's, therefore, possible that they use their billions of dollars to push the asset further than $100,000 between 2024-2025.",

We indeed should fear that war escalation is a probability, I bet you don't want just to be ignorant about it and take the issue as nothing significant.A pessimist take on the economy is expected. IIRC, citing from a book, I forgot what it is called, there is another example of a good story, the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki completely obliterate the socio-economic condition. Fast forward to now, we know how Japan recover and rather leads the world economy. I believe if they took an optimistic view the day they got attacked, it is truly absurd and won't do much considering the condition.",

But for the first point of market is not going into recession, my POV are different.Because, market didn't crashed even in the presence of severe bans and cases on Big exchanges and crypto tokens, which changed my POV which was pessimistic before but not now.

The state of the economy to be honest is not better than a couple of months ago seen the value of money decreased so that many basic goods increased while the income increase is not proportional to the increase in prices, which can be done by trying to find additional income and re-adjust all the needs that are not so important to be issued in the list in order to remain able to invest.While regarding the state of the world such as war and others, believe that every country will be able to find the best solution so that it does not expand so as not have a worse impact on the economy.",

Like it or not, the EU is at war with Russia, although some pretend that this is not happening.Quote- That Gensler CAN'T truly ban cryptoHe himself can't do anything, and I don't know why people even mention him so much since he's just implementing measures of current U.S. policy, which is actually a continuation of what Trump didn't get to do in his term. After Gensler will be \"Gensler\" again, let no one deceive themselves that the problem is only in one man.Quote- Institutional investors will come back and take Bitcoin to six digitsThey probably will, but they are a two-edged sword and will only be good for those who want to profit from Bitcoin no matter what happens after. All these big investors are with Bitcoin only for profit, and when they start selling en masse we will find ourselves again at four-digit figures. It may seem like a good opportunity for some, but a drop from $x00 000 to just $x000 would be a very bad sign for all future investors.",

Are we going to hit as had as in 07/08 or 91/92 or a couple of times in the 80s? No I don't think so. I think this is going to be closer to the .com crash in 01. Certain sectors that rely on borrowed funds are going to be hit as interest rates go up and borrowing slows. And people and businesses who did not prepare (it's not like we didn't know this was going to happen in 2020 when the governments started to give away money) are going to take a hit.But the people and businesses that saw and planned and don't live an debt see this as a very good thing in the economy, it will cause the weaker businesses to fail the the stronger ones to pick up more market share and profits. Same with people, those who saved and planned can get their larger house or whatever since the idiot who didn't not can't afford it and has to sell at a loss.Just my view, I could be wrong.-Dave",
