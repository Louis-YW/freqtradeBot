I still find it difficult to discuss it with friends and families, not to talk of online that everyone in the world can see what you post. It would be an easy means someone can become victim of thieves. Even on this forum, you do not have to discuss about your holding amount, but you can asked for advice but not letting people know how much you have. It's not called for at all, highly unnecessary. You are right.",

I don't know and I believe it's for the best. I don't understand why you would even need to tell anyone about your crypto assets?It's one thing to talk about cryptocurrency in general, it's quite another to share private and confidential information about how much money you have. You don't even talk about it with relatives and friends, and especially not with unknown people in public.And why would you post your picture somewhere or give personal information, I really don't understand?Simply enjoy this forum and never, ever, reveal your personal information.",

Its up to you how youll protect your asset here. More importantly, is being lie low. Of course thats include your identity if you have a million asset in crypto, you are not going to some place and raise flag of your money, cause a lot might got interested in stealing those. Also dont divulged of any info on it on your friends or even relatives cause even blood line could betray you in the name of money.",

I find this whole idea quite bizarre, because you want to say that people should use the anonymity that this forum provides to brag about how much money they made investing in crypto projects that are just pump&dump schemes? Besides that picture you mention, there are certainly other ways that can reveal (at least approximately) who you are and even much more than that.",

It is absolutely not necessary to be present with your real personality on social networks if they are so interesting to you, and the forum is no exception. Posting photos of yourself, photos of places you visit, and anything else that can further define your identity is a very big mistake.Â The same can be said about the vainglorious boasting of one's income. To whom this will benefit is not at all clear. You always need to remember one simple truth: nothing can be deleted from the Internet, so keep cleanliness.Â But if we talk about the topic that the OP created, then I can say that there is already such a topic, and in it, the members of the forum shared all their reasons why they like the forum.

There's no point in showing what assets you have and how rich you are because when other people hear or see that, they will be very jealous of you.being humble will definitely make your life comfortable and avoid worrying, we don't know what's in the hearts of people who see our success, among them, there must be many people who are not lucky but have narrow minds and jealous hearts.",
