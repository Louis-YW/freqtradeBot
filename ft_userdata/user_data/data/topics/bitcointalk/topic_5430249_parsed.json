Does BTC make you rich or what?Please make it more detailed, dude!  However, it was lucky that you decided to have BTC several years ago. If you bought your BTC in 2018, I am sure you have taken profits in 2021.Honestly, I also experienced it, taken profits quite well in 2021 from BTC I bought in 2018. Now, once again I prepared my BTC for 2024-2025, it's good time to collect some BTC. The situation in 2022 is almost the same as 2018, it is the first year of bearish. We have many opportunities to buy BTC at cheap price (buy the dip).Quote from: Koadharber on December 19, 2022, 10:56:00 PMpossibly changed up someones lives and there are lots of people who are really that thankful for this opportunity but of course it would really be still depending or varying on how you do work for it.There should be nice and bad stories about investing in BTC.Only those people invest/trade in proper way who can take advantage from the opportunities.But those who invest/trade carelessly probably end up with bad story, surely no thankful to the opportunity.",

It's not just stories that are only written in text. anyone can make up stories they like, but the experience in bitcoin is bound to be there and it will be proof that you are doing great things with bitcoin.New accounts with new addresses that don't have bitcoin assets, come with fictitious stories...

Some are losing money literally. Interest into this technology won't be enough; hard work and eagerness are all needed in order to make use of the potential cryptocurrencies as a form of investment. Also in line with being a mode of payment, things are still not in good terms. Many countries are still not accepting this digital currency as a mode of payment because of certain issues of it. Thus, I guess it would affect its emergence, in line with your so called \"boomin trend\".",
