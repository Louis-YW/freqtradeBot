  "content": "I saw yesterday, by pure chance (and while I was on my mobile phone), a topic where a guy was auctioning his Samsung S23 as he could not sell it otherwise (at least, this is what he said)... If I remember well he said the entry is 40.000 satoshis.He sounded a bit shady, as he asked for the money first and make the auction afterwards (lol), instead of using an escrow, but I thought that maybe he is new here and he does not know about escrows. Anyway, I searched again for that topic, willing to suggest him that he may look suspicious for proceeding like he did, but I can't find the topic anymore.Has anybody else seen the topic? Or know what happened to it? I don't remember OP's name... All I remember is that the topic was posted in Games and Rounds or Collectible board.",
