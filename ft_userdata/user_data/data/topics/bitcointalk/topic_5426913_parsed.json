      "body": "The forum in general doesn’t trust USDT 100% since it’s centralized and they can collapse unpredictably since they are very shady project since the beginning. The only why it was being used so far is because USDT has the biggest liquidity so far on all the available stablecoins out there that is vital to protect crypto user on possible during crypto winter. But I personally don’t plan to hold all my asset in USDT specifically for long term period because of its uncertainty. I believe most of the forum user especially the reputable member don’t trust USDT at its finest too.",

Tether never managed to prove beyond doubt that they have all their issued coins properly backed with really valuable stuff.So at least I was never convinced by them. However, the \"community\" is not homogenous and some may be trusting Tether. But I would not count them as a majority.And something more: why are you asking in Bitcoin discussion? Imho this is more meaningful in trading or altcoins areas.",

If you ask this question to Altcoin or shitcoins community of course you will get \"Yes\" answer since they will say USDT is the most trusted stablecoin due to highest market cap and every exchanges accept it. The answer will be same if you ask the other centralized shitcoins project.",

However, this does not erase the fact it is the most used stablecoin in the market.",

I just like how it pairs with most common tokens I use or potentially use. Tether is pushed into different issues now and some of those issues haven't been addressed. One of the biggest issue they have is their token is not pegged 1:1 which certainly dangerous. It's been their issues since now and it's incredible that even today there are still people holding and trusting USDT.",

Overall, it is assured reliance on the character, ability, strength, or truth of someone or something. In this case, I want to gauge how much this community currently trusts Tether ($USDT). Before answering the poll, consider the following:Your trust in a cryptocurrency is not solely indicative or related to how much coin you hold with them, but rather your overall comfortability and blessing given to an entity to decide present and  future factors in your life.I personally voted that i have moderate trust in Tether. There are several reasons for that. First of all i am aware of the fact that there have been discussions about the reliability and also stability of USDT because a few years ago the company behind USDT changed the wording regarding it's backing of every USDT minted from \"every USDT is backed with a real USD\" to \"we have enough reserves to back every USDT minted\", which has left a lot of doubt and uncertainty in the crypto space.I think they have released a little bit more information about their reserves recently but i don't know if that is enough to make all doubts disappear.",

We have to distribute our money among the best other stable currencies and not put all our wealth in the USDT only, We can divide it into USDC and BUSD, and DAI.",

This also means that if people use dollars (Tether), then they don't trust bitcoin (afraid that the price will fall and they will lose dollars, which they don't trust). Perhaps this paradox could be called hypocrisy. Why use something you don't trust?",
