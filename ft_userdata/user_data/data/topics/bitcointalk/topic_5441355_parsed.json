  "content": "Good evening to you all.So i have a Innosilicon T3+ 57th that has been working perfectly, however last night at 4am the miner stopped mining.On inspection the miner is turning on, the PSU is powering up, but the 120mm fans on both front and back start spinning for around 10 15 seconds, then stop.This process just loops over and over, and there is no sign of the miner on my router or network. Any suggestions?Thanks in advanced.",

However, would you mind checking the miner logs copy them and paste them here put them inside the insert code tag it is a # button while editing your post? So that we have an idea of what caused to the miner to stop mining.What I guess is that the miner is overheating or has power failure.",

      "body": "Hey people.So i finally got my new PSU for the T3+Still no luck, I'm now thinking perhaps its the controlboard?I have searched for any signs of burning on hashboards, same for the current control board and no signs of error or damage.I also tried the fans and fan emulators, it doesn't seem to be the fans either as i thought perhaps a fan issue would prevent the start up of the miner.It still doesn't get as far as being able to connect to it via m browser either so i cant get the logs!Any help?TIA.",
