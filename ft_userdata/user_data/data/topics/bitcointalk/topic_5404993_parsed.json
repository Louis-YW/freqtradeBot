  "content": "According to recent updates shared by Cardano's IOHK, the Vasil hard fork is expected to happen on the Cardano testnet on Sunday, July 3. IOHK noted, \"Once the changes have taken effect after the start of epoch 215 at 20:20 UTC on July 3, the Cardano testnet will start to enjoy the new Vasil enhancements and capabilities to be seen on mainnet.\" During the week, IOHK announced it had submitted an update proposal to hard fork the Cardano testnet, thus starting the countdown for the Vasil mainnet upgrade. Exchanges and SPOs (stake pool operators) need at least four weeks of testing after testnet deployment, which puts the tentative date of the Vasil mainnet hard fork at the last week of July.
