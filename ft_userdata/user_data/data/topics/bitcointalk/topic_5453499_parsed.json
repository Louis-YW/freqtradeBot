  "content": "So is anyone seen the pop up on their app regarding the newly changes terms and conditions services?A post here on Twitter emphasized that metamask would withhold taxes on users. As a decentralized non custodial wallet, I think this would break its concept means they are gonna do kyc to identify wallets for taxation or they just gonna cut some tax based on trasaction made on metamask swap? Have anyone tried or seen an option when using it? Its not also clear on how they are gonna do this per country with different taxation regarding cryptocurrency. Image source:https://twitter.com/Ashcryptoreal/status/1660160399998689281?s=20I think many would be alarm on this but Im thinking they are doing this to suffice their partners on the industry to avoid being targeted to violations by SEC.Â  Anyway metamask is a business after all. Any thoughts?",

I don't think those taxes will be implemented on all users crypto transactions, for it would be unwise of them since they don't know the country in which the users who are performing transactions are based or how their tax law is being explained.But what I think is that Metamask might gradually move from being a decentralized wallet to more of a custodial wallet since they have already implemented a few payment gateways to their system, so users can now use their  credit or debit card to purchase crypto directly using their wallet.  This will, at some point, link the user's card and other verifications to an individual wallet that the government can keep track of. So this form of transaction I believe is the way they plan to be charging their customers since anyone who wants to use those options is also showing their identity, which they can use to justify which country the person is using their wallet from and charge them based on the country's tax law. This is just my guess and suggestions. Anyone who cares about his or her privacy will be strongly advised to avoid using those newly integrated purchase options.",

I miss this one when reading the pop-up but this is something new and I also wonder how will the implementation be being a noncustodial wallet they only have it in their terms but there's no formal announcement and how it will operate and guidelines for implementation, there's a lot of confusion in the community on these new terms.All I know is it's the investors who have control when it comes to paying taxes to their respective countries.if they are planning to have a custodial wallet then we will read an announcement and this taxation is just a prelude to that.",

What part of this is \"pure evil\"? The fact that they offered the service to buy with credit card? I guess that makes every shop out there pure evil. Or is it the fact that they follow regulations because they are a technology company based in NYC and have to follow rules or possibly get jailed for not doing so?If you think they are pure evil by developing free services then by all means find a copypaste dex with anon devs that only offer pure dex services. Preferably one that doesn't rug you and is audited by same company who did uniswap v3. Or build your own one.I really don't get this hate.",

That's why it's nice to have your own personal wallet and only use 3rd party wallets when you really need to. That's to avoid some technical issues such as this one and also remain as unanimous as you want because right now the SEC is not slacking about further expanding their terms until they have full control of the crypto industry.",

For sure if they push this idea nevertheless the metamask users will totally decrease without a doubt. People dont like to be treated liks some sort of prisoners.
