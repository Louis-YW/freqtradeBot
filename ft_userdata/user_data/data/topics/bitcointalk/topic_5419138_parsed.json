I guess that's because it is too strong as it was owned by the largest crypto exchange called binance.When there is a bear market I think the volume is supposed to be high because this is the time where people are accumulating more coins while there is still a good amount of volume during the bull run because everyone is active during this time. Many newbies are starting to have confidence and they will now buy more coins even if it's risky.",

Because as far as we know, the market is very much bearish, every coins and project is struggling, even ETH after it's merge and supposedly hitting $2k, it didn't happen.And I'm not trying to bring this project down, but that prediction number is too much that newbie investors might fall for that.In any case good luck though, if that price hits then good for those who follow your lead.",

It has been reaching all time high when bitcoin has been doing the same thing. So, the main concern must be in bitcoin. Im also active users of FTX and holding some FTX for IEO purpose. It's impossible for FTX to reach 50 again if bitcoin will stay sideways. Bitcoin needs to go to the moon to make it happen. IF bitcoin could reach 30k and that might be possible to happen with FTX. FTT will remain sideways if bitcoin will be doing it too.",

It's a wonder though that the token has a very low volume compared to BNB which basically just has the same use case if you are a trader. I wouldn't really try going to FTX exchange only to trade BTC/USDT when I have already submitted docs to Binance. It would just add to the risk I took.

It would paint huge double bottom W and this would indicate that growth wouldn't stop there.Personally i can't see this happening yet but i've been wrong so many times i would bet against myself on this.[",

I wouldn't expect an FTT price of more than $35 this year. Price recovery is not happening as fast as we want it to. Prices can only go down quickly. But all in all, I expect that by next bullrun, FTT token price might go over $100-$120, considering the fact that this exchange is now trying hard to take the lead among all centralized exchanges.",

Maybe it can reach 100 dollars in the future but it has not done so already or at least this is the information coingecko shows.And about your prediction of 50 dollars at the end of this year I do not see it happening, this will require for FTT to more than double its current price in less than 2 months, and this is something which can only happen during a bull run, and since we are still in the middle of a bear market then there is almost no chance this could happen.",

Quote from: inanilujimi on November 06, 2022, 05:49:15 AMFTT can get ATH if the market is bullish again like BTC reaches $60k it is not impossible for FTT to get ATH back, because Ftx is one of the popular exchanges that is widely used, it is easy for them to make profits if the market is very bullish by attracting interest like IEO which must be FTT holders only those who can participate, there are many more advantages of tokens that have an exchange.And that will be harder this time when there's publicity that has been made against them and it doesn't look good because the token is about to be dumped, yeah, I mean a lot of it will.",

Bitpay https://bitpay.com/, Poof https://www.poof.io/, Coinbase https://commerce.coinbase.com/?lang=en-US, Paypal, Square, and so on don't have integrations with FTX token. Meaning none of the third party businesses on them would transact with the token. Only use case I see is for institutions to get lower fees on the trading platform. $100 ATH implies a 45B market cap, which is 4x the size of Coinbase as a token.

Long-time investors are aware of that, it's no surprise that a top altcoin will die or crash during bear season. The surprise here is that FTT is owned by Alameda research, one of the top VCs, and is the token of the world's 2nd largest exchange FTX. Yesterday I had to sell all my FTT even though I expected it to compete with BNB and my target is $100/FTT, CZ has officially spoken and I trust CZ more than Sam. I'm lucky I didn't fall victim to Luna and I don't want to risk it this time either. I also regret selling all the FTT tokens but it's always a risky investment. If FTX does indeed default, it will be as devastating as Luna did.I didn't think it was very serious until I saw thier tweets. I think FTX side already offered to buy all CZ's FTT at $22. They wouldn't have a problem finding funds from someone to take the FTT from CZ. But of course, these are all stunts from FTX also. The exchange could be in trouble but I think the US government can find FTX a good asset in crypto.Another dump like LUNA is the last thing we need this time when we are about to see the recovery of the market.",
