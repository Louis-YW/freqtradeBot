So, apparently, Bitcoin isn't in any kind of trouble. On the contrary, it is in its most bullish form. ATHs have been quickly shattered one after another.Trump is pro-Bitcoin, at least in words. Whatever that means, or whether that's true or not, doesn't matter that much. That the next US president publicly expresses his support for Bitcoin is good enough assurance that adoption won't be hindered by strict, even inimical, regulatory policies. That has somehow made the overall sentiment extremely optimistic. Forget about the crypto that Trump and Elon are associated with. It's either a scam or a shitcoin.",

Why would it be in trouble when the one that wins the election supported it confidently. I believe bitcoin will be more expose and not through major scams or what but US will definitely make some regulationa to boost it more ans generate income and profits for their country unless Trump only said that to win? But I doubt he onboarded Elon Musk together with the vision of supporting the digital era of bitcoin.",

The US government will continue trying to add more restrictive regulations and increase its surveillance and control which is something that never changes with presidents.As for a new shitcoin, there is a high chance some opportunists like Musk will try to create their own shitcoin and being a celebrity they will be able to raise millions of dollars and add that to their wealth.That has nothing to do with Bitcoin nor will it affect it. What they'll create and push would be like tens of thousands of other shitcoins that were created over the past decade and pushed by many scammers.Quote from: platinumsteel2016 on November 14, 2024, 02:22:35 AMI must admit  that bitcoin value did rise once Trump won the election. Can anyone provide some clarification?Zoom out and you'll see bitcoin has been on the rise for a long time and it does not need a centralized authority in some country on the other side of the world to rise! The only thing Trump winning election did was to give bitcoin that little push to get past one of the major resistance at $70k and when it was broken the rest was like all previous rallies, the money just flows in.The other major contributor is the interest rate cuts in many countries including USA that helps inflation go up and recession go down which is a major contributor to bitcoin price rise.",

But Trump hasn't officially become president yet and we don't know what his true attitude toward the industry is, so it's hard to say anything at this point. The only thing we can do is enjoy what is happening and hope that after taking office, President Trump will actually open up to the crypto industry as he promised.Don't speculate too much because there is nothing we can do if he breaks his promise, just think simple and remember that politicians are not trustworthy and we should not put too much trust in them.",

Yeah, Trump used some rhetorics to get people rallied about BTC in a way, and that's no wonder - it's a great point to make many enthusiasts see a messiah for crypto in his image.The question is would he deliver on what he promised.",

I must admit  that bitcoin value did rise once Trump won the election. Can anyone provide some clarification?I'm not sure where you are in the last couple of days, but we have seen the price of Bitcoin going into a new all time high again at $90k. So how can you say that it is in trouble? And then we have followed the US election and we all know that Trump is pro-Bitcoin and he want's Bitcoin to move forward in the US if he won. That's why the market is in parabolic rise right now because he has been elected and so if he fulfill his promise, then Bitcoin could reach as high as $100k. So I guess if you haven't follow the news, this is the right time to do it. Maybe what you heard is some meme coins on both of these personalities, and not crypto per se. Just to remind though that there is a big risk if you invested on meme coins, so just be careful.",

I must admit  that bitcoin value did rise once Trump won the election. Can anyone provide some clarification?While many are bullish towards the crypto market right now that Trump won as the President, the reality is, the market doesn't care about him winning. It's the sentiment of the investor that affect Bitcoin and the market the most and for us investors, it's a bullish sign that Trump won hence, the spike in the price of not only Bitcoin, but most of the coins as well. It's hard to know TBH in the long run if Bitcoin will be in trouble now that Trump is the president, but you know what? Bitcoin will thrive even though Trump didn't win the elections. You've heard of rumors? Always take note that rumors will remain as rumors until it becomes a reality. I haven't heard something about this \"new crypto\" that Trump and Elon is planning to do, and I don't want to speculate on it as well. Don't spoil the fun at least and instead of being pessimistic out there, just follow what most are doing. Buying and buying and buying.  Just forget about it for the mean time.",

      "body": "Actually, Trump has been quite supportive of Bitcoin lately, plans to lessen crypto regulations in a bid to help make the US a global hub for crypto if he gets reelected. He even said that he might put Elon Musk in charge of a government efficiency task force in an effort to streamline government processes and, possibly, indirectly benefiting Bitcoin and crypto by loosening federal restrictions.Right now, however, there isn't any particular new crypto associated either with Trump or Musk, this may just be a rumor. Although the price of Bitcoin did have some sort of short-term boost related to the recent political activities of Trump, the mass in the crypto space are still acting cautiously since this is indeed the case, the market responds more to actual changes in regulation than to promises made on the campaign trail. So, that would be, if Trump wins and moves to actualize such promises, more or less a \"wait and see\" affair.",

Bitcoin has survived many unfriendliness by many governments policies and regulations, yet it's adoption is still increasing, this is because it's power is in the hands of the holders. That being said I believe that there'll be favorable regulations for Bitcoin in the US, this is because it should be obvious to Trump, that Bitcoin can not be pushed aside, the American people have accepted it. If it's not Bitcoin it wouldn't be like Bitcoin, no cryptocurrency can threaten it, so whether Trump, and Elon Musk, are trying to push any cryptocurrency, it shouldn't be a worry to bitcoiners.",
