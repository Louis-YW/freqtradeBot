  "content": "QuoteAn Ohio man was sentenced today to four years and three months in prison for stealing over 712 bitcoin that were the proceeds of the darknet bitcoin mixer Helix and subject to forfeiture in a then-pending criminal case.According to court documents, Gary James Harmon, 31, of Cleveland, perpetrated a scheme to steal cryptocurrency that was the subject of pending criminal forfeiture proceedings in the case of Larry Dean Harmon, Gary Harmon’s brother. In February 2020, Larry Harmon was arrested for his operation of Helix, a darknet-based cryptocurrency money laundering service, known as a “mixer” or “tumbler.” Helix laundered over 350,000 bitcoin – valued at over $300 million at the time of the transactions – on behalf of customers, with the largest volume coming from darknet markets. Law enforcement seized various assets, including a cryptocurrency storage device containing Larry Harmon’s illegal proceeds generated through the operation of Helix, which were subject to forfeiture in the criminal case. However, law enforcement was initially unable to recover bitcoin stored on the device due to the device’s additional security features.Knowing that the government was seeking to recover the bitcoin stored on the seized device for forfeiture in Larry Harmon’s criminal case, Gary Harmon used his brother’s credentials to recreate the bitcoin wallets stored on the device and covertly transfer more than 712 bitcoin, valued at approximately $4.8 million at the time, to his own wallets – stealing those funds and obstructing the pending criminal forfeiture proceeding. Gary Harmon further laundered the proceeds through two online bitcoin mixer services before using the laundered bitcoins to finance large purchases and other expenditures.Gary Harmon agreed to the forfeiture of cryptocurrencies and other properties derived from the fraudulently taken proceeds, including more than 647.41 Bitcoin (BTC), 2.14 Ethereum (ETH), and 17,404,400.64 Dogecoin (DOGE). Due to the increase in market prices, the total value of these forfeitable properties exceeds $20 million.Source 1Source 2This is the latest sentencing of a Bitcoin thief coming from the US. After he successfully recreated the wallet containing his brother's Bitcoin proceeds from Helix and laundered it through two online mixers service, I believe he wouldn't have been caught If not for his lifestyle and expensive property purchases that attracted the attention of government agencies.",

Articles and blogs make these loose associations to make their topic title catchy and maybe attract a bit of the cryptocurrency audience.If could also be a ploy by the government to associate Bitcoin as much as possible to scams which should dissuade people from using it if they were considering it. Whichever it is, we should not promote their low impact financial policies targeted against bitcoin and their role in finance freedom.",

Kind of seems that way to me since other cryptocurrencies were also found in the hardware. The fact that the Bitcoin constitutes highest amount of his brother's proceeds is not enough reason for him to be tag a Bitcoin thief.Quote from: Zaguru12 on May 01, 2023, 09:26:06 PMThe other thing is how the scammer gets his on hands on the bitcoin if at all it was save on cold storage it might be hard but just like they warn on the forum.IRS had the hardware wallet in their possession but they couldn't access the cryptocurrencies because of some security features.

I mean, Mr. Harmon exploited 65 bitcoins, which covers much more than the assets and properties that were confiscated with bitcoins. I can't believe that after 4 years he will spend in prison, he will come out to find himself penniless.Although Harmon agreed to confiscate all the assets he acquired fraudulently, the 4 years in prison as a sentence seems very light compared to the amount that was stolen. I do not know if this is considered a procedural defect or if it is a preliminary ruling pending further investigations. Or maybe it is because of the absence of legislation that exposes thefts in the crypto space.",

Every criminal deserves punishment, therefore Gary James Harmon deserves the sentence. But the stealing shows how backward the government is in the aspect of crypto security. They didn't protect the ceased crypto funds which was why the Harmon brother could access the funds. The young man decided to nail his coffin when he went on an uncontrollable spending spree which attracted law enforcement agencies. When people are held responsible for the crime they commit it discourages others from engaging in such crimes and it also helps to reduce the pains the victims of such crimes go through. Hopefully, people that are victims of FTX criminal activities will get justice when those responsible for the fraud will be sent to prison.",

While the decentralized nature of Bitcoin may make it more difficult to track down and prosecute criminals because of abusing mixing services, law enforcement agencies are increasingly taking action to protect who is the victim of thieves and hold those who engage in illegal activities accountable. Hopefully, this sentencing sends a message to would-be thieves that cryptocurrency theft isn't a victimless crime and that the risks outweigh the potential rewards.  But four years imprisonment seems not enough for me, the money should return to the owner too.",

I mean it was one guys money that government wanted to take, and his brother took it instead, I am not sure if that is considered stealing. Sure the law would say if the government wants it, then government gets it, that's understandable but stealing makes it sound like he go out and stole money from someone, its more like obstruction of justice maybe? That is a bit more like it, government tried to take it, and the brother prevented that, so its obstruction of justice, there is nobody stealing from anyone in this case so it should not be considered as stealing without a doubt. This is more like 200 hours community work type of deal more than jail time, after all he gave it all up too, so it shouldn't really be that weird.",

Only a small percentage of people on this planet have mastered the art of self-control when faced with financial opportunities they never imagined in their entire lives. When presented with enormous sums of money, a big number of the human population display a lavish lifestyle. Many that found financial freedom will continue to brag needlessly without realizing that they are attracting spies to observe their source of money, which led them to spend extravagantly in the first place.",

And even if you do so then don't spend the money like a king because your final destination will be waiting for you and that's the bars behind which you will be trapped. His own lavish style and spending habits made him the target of the agencies, if he was wise enough then he would never spend the money slowly over time. But still crime has an end and no matter how intelligent a criminal is his final destination is behind the bars.I must say that calling the person a Bitcoin thief isn't justifiable because there were other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Doge present too. I think the government knows that creating such news is enough to attack the reputation of Bitcoin and create panic in the minds of the investors that it isn't safe and fraud people can do such bad things with it. Such clickbait title attract people because the word Bitcoin is used in it in a negative way. The thing that's constantly moving in my mind is that why he transferred only 720 coins? what about the other coins that his brother stole? I mean it's clearly mentioned in the article that his brother successfully laundered 350,000 bitcoins. Were most of those bitcoins already seized by the agencies if yes then how could they left those 720 bitcoins?",
