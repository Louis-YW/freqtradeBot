Any experience thats a good match? And maybe get specific about the kinds of roles or projects you're hoping for.   It helps if you can point employers to some solid examples of your work.  Got a portfolio site or GitHub profile you can link them to? That way they can check out your latest stuff and see what you can do.",

      "body": "$5000 at the end of the week? That's possible but I am not gonna offer you anything. It's basically on how you're quick to complete something. Why not look at the websites like Upwork, fiverr and anything of the same? Those employers or projects that look for results based skill since you're a senior full stack developer. You are for sure aware of deadlines and I think that's your best asset right now but you just need to find the right client that has projects on works so, do your search now with those platforms that I've mentioned and others that has the same freelance market place. Might find one as well on subreddits related to crypto/freelancing.e.g.https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoJobsList/https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/",

I am looking short and longterm job opportunities.Let me tell you right now, you'd better look for another way to get that $5,000 or start coming up with an excuse as to why you don't have it at the end of the week.Even if you start a deal with someone, by the end of the week you will not be able to agree on all the conditions and requirements of the job. Plus you need to finish all of that to be paid in full. How did you imagine it, you just fly here from nowhere, nobody knows anything about you, collect $5000 and leave. I see that you tried to sell Pi coin earlier, why don't you sell it and solve the financial problem you have?",

It might help in your job search if you highlight your skills and experiences.As far as I know, Australia and New Zealand are in need of developers, but you might have a hard time finding a job that fits your desires because most of them are long-term projects, and I think you'll need a team to build a project.",
