Bitcoin is the light the government and some billionaires who called themselves Bitcoin antagonists don't want us to see. The come to us with different lies and fake news to delude us so that we are going to believe them with illogical facts. Some claims Bitcoin does not have a monetary values with big grammars that may look complex to the ignorant ones. Banks do not want us to cash out our money and buy Bitcoin but what many do not know is that they are one of the major whales in the market. They want us to keep depositing our money with confidence that future is well guaranteed. There is no future holding that fiat for too long without investing it.  https://twitter.com/take_gains/status/1646117656238624769?s=19Take that money and buy Bitcoin Quote In several articles I come across I see people talking about how can they convince people about bitcoin, convincing people about bitcoin is just a waste of time, it is like trying to convince someone why they should need a light.  There is not need trying hard to convince people on investing in Bitcoin...your result and achievement will make them keep asking questions about how come you are living and comfortable and wealthy lifestyle. They will be the one coming and asking questions trying to be like you. Life is simple and your lifestyle should be the evidence they'll need to join the league of Bitcoin investors. QuoteBitcoin have gone too far and too big for you to keep convincing people about bitcoin. It is not too late to invest in Bitcoin, the market will always come down and goes up to balance momentum.",

Just impart the information. Whether they put the information to good use or remain arrogant is their choice. Let every people have their own financial decisions. It is their responsibility for taking risks or not taking the risk. Otherwise, if you force anyone to believe something they don't really want to. It's either you will get the blame for not making it profit to them or not having any credit when it works. Both is not good for you.

Buying the tops and selling the bottoms then blaming the people whom they taken the advice. Trading or investing is not. It is a professional pursuit. Bitcoin does too. It is either wield your success or break your future. A double edge sword. The main lesson? Be accountable in your own financial decision and let other people be accountable on their own.",

The point of convincing someone is so you can spread the word about the benefits of bitcoin, and even then when you can't convince them to change their stance on bitcoin and otherr related issues, I am sure that somewhere along the way, that person is going to tell their friend about someone who was annoying them about bitcoin and then that friend learns about bitcoin and does some research about it and talks about it.

Simply because if bitcoin is really good and what people need then one day they will find it. Just like a good product in the market, there is no need to run a lot of advertising and sales tricks to attract customers. As long as it's good and meets their needs, people will buy it without promotion. In contrast, poor quality products always offer advertising programs and discounts to attract consumers.

Very good analogy, and I also agree that time would be wasted if used to convince someone to like Bitcoin while he himself never liked Bitcoin. But this time will not be wasted if someone uses it to explain about Bitcoin to people who don't know about Bitcoin and they also don't reject Bitcoin's presence so far. So I think this thing is just about someone who is willing to accept the existence of Bitcoin or not, also like people who are willing to accept the light in their life or are just going to continue to defend their own ideas by using petroma.QuoteBitcoin have gone too far and too big for you to keep convincing people about bitcoin.

It is necessary to soberly evaluate bitcoin without fanaticism and idolatry. Bitcoin is not some kind of shrine, but an investment tool. You don't pray for money, do you? I'm talking about a metaphor with light.Bitcoin is still just one of the early stages of development (in my opinion) and not as big as you claim.As a rule, people's attempts to convince of something usually ends in nothing and most often pushes away from the object of persuasion. I admit the possibility of presenting information about bitcoin, but I reject attempts to convince to buy it.",

Convincing others is obviously good but of course we have to be realistic because by convincing we also have to say about the worst possibility and the resulting impact and I think this is difficult for me personally so I won't convince anyone because when we convince someone then it will also be a burden to us considering that person will definitely be a little demanding on what they believe from our mouth so I don't want something like that to happen.",

The rainbow can be also refer to different types of scenario in Bitcoin like trading, investing, hodling, risk, analysis, calls, volatility, and many more. There's a lot of possibilities when you engaged in Bitcoin, even if you shown them the light but that light might hit the prism which is the reality that Bitcoin is not only have a good benefit for you but also it might risk your funds. In short even you give them the spotlight to grow if they can't see it well, its just useless. That light would stay as a spotlight to people who'd believed and risked in the Bitcoin.",
