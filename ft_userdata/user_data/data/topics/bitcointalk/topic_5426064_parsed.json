So I reached out to them in their Website-Chat today: https://i.ibb.co/C5D98Ny/satoshihero.pngAdditional Notes: I do have about 280 referrals on this Site. All I did was advertise Satoshi Hero and Monster on other Faucet Sites (PTC Ads on Cointiply and Firefaucet), nothing else.",

You don't know who will register under your name and, unfortunately, most of them are known for multi accounting.I know it's your not fault but it is what it is.",

Hope for your understanding.\"OP take the loss and move on from this racist site. Just because someone resides in an area that apparently likes engaging in war with their neighbors, does not mean the whole society there is involved. The people cannot control what their governmental leaders do. On top of that, closing your case without giving you a chance to appeal is pretty shady as well.",

It's still good that you posted it here it exposed that the people running these faucets are racist and it's not the fault of users if they are Russian, they can support Ukraine but not to the point of hurting the accounts of their loyal followers like you OP, since you are good at referring people might as well try other faucets who do not have racist views like Satoshi Hero/Monster, there are a lot of good faucets here.",
