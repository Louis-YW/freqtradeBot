If it is, then there won’t be any problem for the hotel to use Bitcoins as a payment. But will they able to deal with the inflation and price fluctuations of Bitcoins? I mean it really takes guts to take such steps when large amount of money transactions is required. But great initiative by the hotel management, and this will also fetch them more customers, as they have additional payment option than the other hotels in that nation. Really Kudos to the management. Let’s see what more updates we can see from this amazing country.",

If you are in doubt, please visit the Nasdaq website: Luxury Houses Accepting CryptosNonetheless, I love the Binance preference, most people use it and by virtue of this, the transaction fee will be free within it, which is a very good deal for both parties.",

And if its not legal, do you think that they would offer that kind of service?Having said that, I don't think that this news is worthy of a topic anymore tbh. Maybe if it happened 7-8 years ago or if they accepted bitcoin directly, but like this not really (still good news though).",

You can see many blockchain summits and conferences that were hosted in Middle East nations. It's reasonable if you think it is legal in Bahrain that is located in the Middle East area.If you want to check and confirm your thought, you can read this report Countries Where Bitcoin Is Banned or Legal In 2022. Cryptocurrencies are legally restricted (not totally prohibited) in Bahrain and you need to have license for your business.QuoteBahrain. You need a license in order to use crypto-asset services in Bahrain.Legality of cryptocurrencies in other nations are written in another report from ComplyAdvantage.Cryptocurrency regulations around the worldNot sure but a progress for their CBDC is either in Research or Development phase but they did made an announcement for Digital Dinar by Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) in 2018https://cbdctracker.org/currency/bahrain-digital_dinarhttps://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/",

I thought that Binance is there just to exchange crypto to fiat and not to be an actual requirement in order to pay with crypto. Because they are affiliated with Binance so I don't think this is official hotel adoption. Because basically, it is Binance that benefits by depositing Bitcoins to Binance. Users have no other wallet option than using an exchange, obviously this is not something the worldwide Bitcoin community should be proud of when visiting there and wanting to book a room. If I had visited there, maybe cash would have been better and not the hassle of handing over my Bitcoins to an exchange.",

This will be done through a partnership with the “Easy Pay” platform that specializes in providing solutions and means of payment, which in turn is in partnership with Binance, meaning that payment will be through the Binance application and not directly.In addition, payment will be possible not only with Bitcoin, but also with many cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum and BNB, in addition to Bitcoin. Of course, users are forced to register with Binance, so they have to pass KYC.In short, the news is good, but it is not an acceptance or adoption of Bitcoin.",

I know a couple of people who have their money on the exchange despite me telling them to get their money off of it. Their fees are higher because they know that they are the most famous brand in exchanges and they abuse that position. I would like to see a new competitor because Binance are getting to big. When exchanges get to big something usually happens like recently with the exchange taken all the money and declaring they could not pay it back.",

Maybe I don't want anyone else to know about my arrival at the hotel in Bahrain. Binance will be able to determine which of the users paid for the services and where. Like it or not, this seems to be how bitcoin payments will be accepted. There will be no direct p2p (user-business) payments with the help of intermediate providers that perform the oversight function.In general, an interesting idea from the side of the hotel, ideal for advertising purposes. Why is the rest of the business slowing down and using it? Approximate slogans - The first bakery accepting bitcoin! First shoe store to accept btc as payment! At the very least, it will help your business become famous.  And if we discard the jokes, then let's see what will be the dynamics of acceptance bitcoin other hotels after the \"Novotel Bahrain Al Dana Resort\". Will they be able to set a new trend.",

It is happening in the Middle East, and I hope that it will be replicated in other vacation spots in countries and islands like the Maldives, Fiji, Bali, etc. The downside is that if you are concerned about staying anonymous, you may need to have a rethink about staying there as you would need a Binance account for it. As such, I think it is a step in the right direction towards mass adoption of bitcoin. Bitcoin remains king of crypto.",

Judging how the general public hates NFTs and almost always portrays a caricature of it thanks to multiple money laundering schemes and scams arising from the industry. Don't get me wrong. Again, I think it's actually neat that more and more figures and entities are into crypto, it's even seen as a legitimate form of investment nowadays and not some laughingstock like it was back in 2010s. Anywho, I feel like I'm going off a tangent here but what I really mean is that there has to be a way to naturally sell bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to the public without them hating on it in the process. I've seen some people in here pitch really good methods, I think those should be done more often.",

Then you need to consider El Salvador or any other country that has done it before any of those hotels at Bahrain did.This is no longer a surprise, but it is definitely expected to increase everywhere throughout the year.
