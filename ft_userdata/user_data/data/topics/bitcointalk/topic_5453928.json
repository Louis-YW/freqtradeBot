I will also go through it to see if I can understand the project better. He has some points in his arguments on the link from Medium site. I didn't have the time to read his post in the mailing list, but will read it too when I have some time!",

      "body": "I like it! It has elements of my Ephemeral settlements and voting-based Layer 2 designs inside it.Only roadblock is that it depends on opcodes that haven't been fully ratified yet (ANYPREVOUTANYSCRIPT in BIPs 118 or CTV in 119 I believe), so that's got to be solved first so that the network can function officially. But that should be simple enough for protocol devs to do.The more pressing task is to design the Ark nodes software. This doesn't necessarily depend on LN which is good.",

On LN, we already see some \"dominating\" LN node which have lots of channel or big capacity. With Ark, i have concern we'll very few dominating service provider.I think that is going to happen no matter how a L2 protocol is done. There's going to be some providers that are going to take a large percentage of whatever service there is. It's just the nature of how it's has to be done. Once money is involved, people are going to only slowly put their own funds in. However, there will always be people in the beginning that took a larger risk with more money and grew and grew and grew. The flip side is if this particular L2 solution goes away or fails or has other issues then those people will lose significantly more money then some guy named Dave who said what the heck I'll put a couple of $100 into this and see what happens.As for the protocol in general. It looks interesting but as you and others have pointed out it's dependent on other B IP's being finalized and released so it's still a ways away who knows what will change between now and then.-Dave",

There's going to be some providers that are going to take a large percentage of whatever service there is.That's true, but while in Lightning you do gain something from being well-connected even as a regular user (better / faster / cheaper routes for your own payments), I see no incentive at all to become a service provider in Ark. Routing fees (at least in Lightning) are still very low nowadays, so I doubt that is incentive enough.I'm not too worried about the privacy aspects of such centralized providers, if the cryptography / anonymization is done right, but more about availability guarantees / resilience against DoS attacks from state actors and similar.",

I think you people here can easily understand the protocol. Way easier than me. Pretty sure will be easy for you guys!",
