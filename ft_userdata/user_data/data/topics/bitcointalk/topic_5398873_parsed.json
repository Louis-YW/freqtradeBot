If gate.io system will malfunction under any circumstances then that should be a concern.It could be used as an excuse to scam individuals",

Mr okorieemmanuel, How sure are you that the deposit option was still active? What was the point of gate.io announcing suspension of deposit if they still left the deposit option active?Is OP the only person who fell victim? Why are we not seeing more of such complaints about the \"foul play\" on Twitter, their Reddit or Trustpilot?Quote from: Pmalek on May 18, 2022, 09:38:02 AMBitcoin_Arena is correct when he says that an announcement was made that deposits and withdrawals will be suspended 4 days before OP sent those coins.

I can send coins to my account minus checking my deposit option via the  exchange, which is a very bad practice in case they have disabled deposits, and I am not aware.",

I don't think it's a coincidence.Any self-respecting entity would put up a message about services being temporarily suspended, maintenance messages have become a standard nearly everywhere and in every industry. I'm hoping that lotfiuser is just mistaken, and that this isn't another exchange operating beyond poorly. I still stand by my statement about avoiding exchanges like the plague, though.If this user is having this problem with multiple exchanges and nobody else is having these issues with either exchange, then it's probably safe to say that it is a user issue.",

No, not really.

I saw his complaint in their ANN which means OP is likely the one who led to the problem. I don't think it's a coincidenceIf at all OP's claims are true that he made a deposit, I think what he did was make a deposit onto a Luna address to his account that he had already saved sometime back. In this case, he is likely not to have checked the deposit page of the exchange that perhaps blocked generating the deposit address at that time and also had a warning about Luna deposits and withdrawals.He probably just copied the address from wherever he had saved it and made a deposit, only for the account not to be credited at that time since deposits had been suspended.",

      "body": "You are right. However, let me stress out this fact.You mentioned binance and I'm fortunate to use their service. If you exchange crypto in binance, you will discover that using the quick exchange option, an individual have only few seconds to accept a given exchange before the price change. Similarly when trading on other platform, you have little time to make a decision before price surge or fluctuate. People don't check news on site, users probably have done analysis even before entering the platform to trade. If the deposit, stake, offer or deal option is enabled, people will use it without checking. I read market news before trading and I trust my broker. If the currency pairs is enabled, I can hit the trade button for that pair without fear of news flash. And I will be dumb to snap a screenshot of something I always do as proof or evidence for future reference. The real question should be - Was the deposit option really enabled on that faithful day for that particular crypto? If yes, then someone like me can't trade there bcoz I would make the same mistake like this person.Quote from: Pmalek on June 04, 2022, 07:10:37 AMQuote from: saxydev on June 03, 2022, 04:26:44 PMIf you google more on the subject and the matter and the problems in court you will know how wrong and useless your comment is.
