They new?What's their minimum deposit?Things like that...You could just say cool... If you have multiple Twitter accounts and want to use them I'm fine with that... Just tell me how many you can do and post your BTC address to send to. Hoping there are some people who can quickly do 5-10 so there aren't as many small payments but whatever works. I can also do payment via cashapp so drop you $cashtag if you want payment that way. Sending out payments at 1:15 PM me for link",

      "body": "Firstly, can you send Bitcoin worth 1 dollar from an exchange without paying more than 5x of that as gas or even from a blockchain.info wallet without gas fee worth 82% of per post payment.I'll advice you make it a job, get someone with a team that does this and pay for the engagements, I'm saying this cos I do something similar. I'm a shiller/raider and hype man for projects. It's part of what I do. If you want my services, feel free to send me a DM",
