Some of the advice OP gave is not bad at all because they are very important in cryptocurrency trading. But the writer claimed that all these tips are from his personal experience which turned out to be false. Using chatGPT in this forum is frowned at because this forum promotes creativity and lawfulness. It is not bad to use what you got from another author and share it with the forum. But you shouldn't claim ownership of the writeup by using bots to manipulate the content. You can do better than this, just put in more effort.",

      "body": "Trading includes always a high risk of loss because it's impossible to predict how a market will move today, tomorrow or even in a week. For Bitcoin, a way to make a profit is HODLing it. It is very easy to do and much less risk compared to risky trade. Because Bitcoin is a scarce asset and it tends to increase in price over a long time period. For HODL, we only need to have patience, which many people don't have but often, we need to have it to make a profit. It is not easy during bear markets, really. HODL originated from a Bitcointalk forum post here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.0",

Throughout day I’m scrolling hundreds of reels on social media just to see how people are show casing their profits and losses.
