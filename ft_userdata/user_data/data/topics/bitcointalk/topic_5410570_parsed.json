Pedro Porro did Suarez by stopping ball from goal with his hand. He got red card and penalty were given. Porto managed to score it and few minutes later they did score 3:0.As I understand, Benfica skip this round because of Champions League qualifier.",

Although I think Sporting played better. But the Porto goalkeeper was also defending everything, this one really well. Sporting is now 5 points behind rivel Porto, but the season is long and all the big players will still lose points.This journey is postponed for Benfica, so they can focus on the game in the Champions League. Then for the next week, they will have the game missing.",

But I love to follow the nice competition between Porto, Sporting and Benfica here. This league doesn't have so many qualified teams which is a minus for it. But at least the championship race is exciting. There was a significant change in Benfica's performance from the 20/21 season to 21/22. Porto and Sporting left them way behind in the standings. The league has been under the dominance of Porto - Sporting duo for three seasons. However this season might be different. Considering the first three matches, I see a stronger Benfica while Sporting are struggling. Sporting had two difficult matches against Porto and Braga of course but they should still have done better than getting only one point in total.",

It is the club that gives the big three the most difficulties.- Vitória SC, also known as Vitória de Guimarães, is one of the most historic clubs in this league, which is always expected to be in the top 5.- Estoril Praia is a club that has been in the League for several seasons and usually plays good games, a club to be in the middle of the table, and that manages to draw with the big ones.- FC Paços Ferreira is an average club, but they also tend to play good games and cause difficulties for big clubs.- In Liga Portugal, the smaller clubs tend to play in a counter-attack style, betting on always having many players on the defensive lines. This sometimes makes it difficult for big clubs to score goals.- - Boavista is also a historic club, and usually presents a tough/aggressive game, very physical, which sometimes complicates the game of the more technical teams (like the big teams)To bet on Liga Portugal, since it is one of the most renowned in Europe, I believe that most bookmakers have the possibility to bet on these games.On this week's journey, the most interesting game should be Boavista vs Benfica. Despite Benfica having a better team, Boavista usually doesn't make it easy. In addition, Benfica played for the qualification of the Champions League (which they won) and therefore may not have all the players at 100%.If you want any more tips, let me know!  EDIT:Quote from: emrecemsan on August 26, 2022, 07:32:03 PMI think that it might be nice to have a poll for the champion of this season here.  It's done!",

The goals were scored by Brazilian central defender Morato, at 30 minutes, and by Portuguese midfielder João Mário, at 67 and 82. So Benfica remains 100% victorious this season.You can see a 3-minute summary of the match, here:https://rd.videos.sapo.pt/OC1r4nYOn0Jcl37wRETl",

Sporting CP controlled the majority of the match but they were not able to score a goal even with 10 shots on target  .There are reports coming out that Cristiano Ronaldo will be joining Sporting CP, hope his frustration with Manchester United will be over if they allow him to transfer rather than holding him back.",

If in the match with Porto there was a removal and two penalties, then they should have won the match with Chaves, their advantage was very significant. It will be very difficult to compete with Porto for the title, and Benfica is starting this season very well, they need to score points in order to keep up with the leaders.",

It is true that Sporting's defeat is significant, but at the moment the team is not doing well. Porto, on the other hand, had been playing consistently, and was coming off a victory against a rival Sporting. So Rio Ave - an experienced team in this vision, showed an excellent attitude and won the game.If Benfica wins the next game, they will be isolated in the first place and in a more comfortable situation for the next challenges.",
