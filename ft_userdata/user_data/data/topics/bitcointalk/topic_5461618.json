So if any of them even tries to \"attack\" the network, it's probably not gonna be used much longer.",

There's no merit to them in the past cause surprise, surprise, bitcoin's worth nothing back then. Only as the coin gradually increased in value and appreciation did people come to realize how bitcoin is vulnerable to 51% attacks but way back then we didn't have to worry cause why would a large corporation buy 51% of the total supply of a currency which doesn't even go as high as a dollar in value? Plus to add to this there's not even that much of users in the past so jacking the price up will be a herculean task which would require this company to fork out even more money in the process, yielding a negative payout for everyone who'd try this in 2009-2012. Of course as time goes by it became apparent that bitcoin is valuable and the idea of a 51% attack became more real, but as it stands today unless you have a trillion dollars just lying around, I don't think you'd be able to buy bitcoins to that degree that you'd have supreme control over it.",

In early 2009 there was one person on the network (Satoshi), and then there were two (Hal Finney I believe). I would assume by the end of 2009 there were probably at most a few thousand people in Bitcoin, maybe only a few hundred.And all these hundreds or at most few thousand people that were mining were mining with CPUs, \"high-tech mining machines\" didn't exist for years after this. I think GPU mining didn't even start until sometime in 2010? You're asking if companies or wealthy people attacked Bitcoin in 2009...nobody knew that Bitcoin existed in 2009. Probably only a few thousand people had even heard of Bitcoin. A 51% attack back then could have only been performed by one of the very few people that knew about Bitcoin back then and was actively engaged in Bitcoin, which means they had no incentive to do it. Also Bitcoin had no market value at that point either, it was still just an experiment back then so why would those few people involved with it bother to attack it?It's sort of like asking if people were hacking ARPANET back in like 1970 when all it did was connect like 4 universities and nobody else knew about it.Companies and wealthy individuals getting involved in mining or even just Bitcoin in general didn't happen until years later.",

I understand from memory reading that there was a pool who had more than 51% of the hash power at one stage, though miners reallocated themselves and the pool made steps to reduce the hash power, I believe dividing into two pools was the approach.I don't believe that a 51% attack is still something to worry about today if Bitcoin maintains its ability to make the globe compete for it's supply and its hash power.",

Thus, bitcoin was vulnerable to a 51% attack by a big company or an individual with huge resources.But was there any such attack on Bitcoin around that time?Bitcoin has a lot of soft and hard forks, but it doesn't have 51% attacks yet, the closer we get to that was on January 2014.QuotePotential threat averted In January of 2014, a mining pool called Gash.io got so big that it neared 51% of the total mining power. This, of course, created some panic in the Bitcoin community but was fixed shortly after by miners who left the pool in order to balance things out. Additionally, the pool committed to a 40% limit for its future operations.But there are some fresh examples of 51% attacks in the past years in other blockchains:QuoteBitcoin Cash (May 2019) Two Bitcoin Cash mining pools, BTC.com and BTC.top, carried out a 51% attack on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain in order to stop an unknown miner from taking coins that he wasn’t supposed to have access to, while the network forked. Even though some would argue the 51% attack was done to help the network, it still demonstrates the power these two mining pools have over the network. Ethereum Classic (January 2019) Coinbase identified a “deep chain reorganization” of the Ethereum Classic (ETC) blockchain which included a double spend on Saturday, Jan. 5 2019. Subsequently, Coinbase halted all ETC transactions. Another exchange, Gate.io, also confirmed that it had picked up at least seven double spend transactions after conducting its own investigation into the attack. Vertcoin (December 2018) 4 different attacks on the Vertcoin network (a relatively anonymous coin ranking below #200 in the cryptocurrency charts) concluded in the theft of around $100,000. Bitcoin Gold (May 2018) More than $18 million were stolen through double spending in a Bitcoin Gold 51% attack conducted by an unknown malicious actor. Exchanges tried to fight off the attack by waiting for a longer amount of confirmations before approving transactions, but that did not seem to help a lot.But you have a point there, we are talking about the old days, maybe satoshi did some test to verify the 51% attack, who knows. In the end the real risk for the 51% is the exchanges. just think about it, you send the cryptos to the exchange, sell them, then make the 51% attack and get back the coins. Sound easy but to get the 51% of the mining power isn't easy at all.",

But that became more serious and closer to reality in 2014 as mentioned by seoincorporation. But it didn't really become a problem. First and foremost, there was no intention to attack. And that's common sense. The reason is simply that 51% attack is not cost-beneficial. Aside from the fact that it is an expensive undertaking, what you will get out of it if you are successful is close to nothing. And you're success will only be very short. So why do it then?

So if any of them even tries to \"attack\" the network, it's probably not gonna be used much longer. Generally, 51% attacks or the likes of it are one and done schemes. They are not intended to be sustained for very much longer than required and it wouldn't matter if the miners switch or not. Since 51% attack works by shifting the miners to work on an alternate chain simultaneously, the probability of the pool miners noticing it and shifting before the damage is done is pretty much zero.The issue lies with the opportunity cost of executing such an attack. Most pool owners have a huge amount of Bitcoins and it is in their best interests to sustain the prices and keep them afloat. Any attack on the network would tank the price, destroy the mining economy and the probability of their pools ever being used again.
