  "content": "So I was surfing the gamblingnews.com website to get the latest information in the gambling world. I found this interesting story which I kept pondering on to understand whether this is the extreme or a new dimension of gambling addiction or not. I am tempted to think that it is because the gang according to the news, targets only businesses that have video poker and video gaming machines. And so far they have stolen a total of $400K from gambling machines. The logic behind my conclusion is that, if people who are addicted to gambling would do anything at all costs to win money and for this group they have gone the extreme of breaking and stealing the monies in these gaming machines. This behaviour should be on the far end of the continuum of gambling addiction. Below is the story1.QuoteFour individuals are facing charges over their alleged participation in a statewide video gaming burglary ring.On Thursday, Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul released details regarding the recent arrests of three individuals believed to be involved in a burglary ring that operated in multiple Illinois counties. The Attorney General said charges have been filed against Giulia and Gino Wuttke and Alyssa Slouka, over their alleged participation in the burglary ring that stole $400,000 from video gaming machines. Brian Morgan, 42, of Plainfield, Illinois also faces charges for his alleged participation in the burglary ring.The criminal charges are the result of collaborative efforts between the Attorney General’s office, the Illinois State Police, the Illinois Gaming Board, as well as law enforcement and Attorney’s offices in multiple counties.“Members of this burglary ring allegedly targeted bars, restaurants, social clubs and other small businesses that have video poker and video gaming machines. They broke into dozens of these establishments in multiple counties and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash out of the machines.“Raoul commented on the topic in a statement by saying that the alleged members of the uncovered burglary ring primarily targeted businesses that had video poker and video gaming machines. He explained that in multiple counties, businesses were broken into and gambling machines were robbed, resulting in the theft of thousands of dollars. Raoul acknowledged that the arrests and charges are the result of the collaboration of multiple law enforcement agencies. In conclusion, he thanked all agencies involved in the case.Having read the story do you think that this could be the extreme or a new dimension of gambling addiction?1. https://www.gamblingnews.com/news/police-nabs-four-who-stole-400k-from-gambling-machines",

I would not be surprised only certain makers (of the machines) were targeted.",

We don't know if they were addicts. It's like OP would say that if someone stole money from a brothel he must've been a sex addict Thieves will find the most innovative methods to steal money. There's a video on youtube of a planned attack on a jewelry store in Canada that was done in broad daylight and the group used a stolen truck to smash into the store and had another car parked outside that they used to escape.",

OP this to me is pure burglary and at the far side known as stealing. If someone woke up to a taught to take whatever does not belong to them and in fact committed the act like in this case at hand, it is called a crime of stealing and depending on the time of the act which might have been at night or odd hours that security guards or other protective measures are absent so it is burglary being that they broke into or the machine. There is no need to tie the crime to any extraneous cause or act of frustration of not winning bet or being a bet addict or under some influence of drug. They have committed a crime not because they are addict but because they have the intention to break into the machine to steal monies and it was done simultaneously with others in different counties which makes it intention, well planned and executed and not under the influence of addition or drugs",

Unusual way of life but I guess we'll see more of this due to this unusual condition of economy.",

The story which you mentioned is related to stealing and this is not linked with gambling Addiction. There could be a situation where these gangs had lost in gambling in the past and they decided to cover their losses by stealing which is not the right way and they will have to face strict legal action against them in the court of law.",

A big syndicate is surely behind them and it's not that these groups are the only group who are working around.I agree with you. It doesn't seem to be related to any gambling addiction. They have just targeted those games for the money stored into them obviously. We can suppose that bars, restaurants and social clubs owners have not a direct access to the funds locked inside and they can't withdraw them every night before closing their establishment, that's why those robbers have targeted them presumably. But I don't understand what you mean by \"If these guys are addicted to gambling, I doubt they can think properly about how they were able to steal such an amount successfully\" gambling addicts are not only honest people, they can be criminals too. Gambling is usually not renowned to be tied to the most innocent and virtuous environments.",
