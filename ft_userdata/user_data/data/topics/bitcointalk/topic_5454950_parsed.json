So I was trying to figure out but no way and I went to  https://ninjastic.space/user/id/3525774 to see the deleted post when I went there, I saw the comment and I clicked on the link and it took me to the thread, and I checked other people comments and compare to my comment till I saw  that I copied SamReomo probably in the process of making my comment. My intention were to edit and clip the post in a quote but, I can't tell what really transpired and it came out as a copied text, probably because I was feeling dizzy at the time as I was on my bed while on the forum.Due to the ban, I have been scanning the Ninjastic.space to see if I have done such mistake before but I could not find any, though I am not an expert in that search but, just have to try due to this recent development and to better understand what happened. As it is, I am even confused of what really happened because I have tried my best in all conscious effort to keep to the rules and this instance is the very first time I happen to have unconciously violated and most of all, a fellow forum users post. Just how dumb would I be to have done that here if not by some big error. I haven't done such thing before and now, I feel bad to have been sleepy but yet access the forum. I also tried  checking on the plagiarism thread to see any proceedings that followed my case but, couldn't find any. I am not claiming to be right in this but rather, a slip of the hand, and unconscious mistake that has taken a big punch at me but I'm appealing right now, I'm so sorry this happened in my weak moment. I believe I'm not a spammer and I was trying my best to give the best quality I can bring. I believed I have not violated the forum rules before, I always maintain my posts quality in the forum. A mistake is a mistake I am guilty. Please forgive me and look into my issue as some big error.To the Moderators/Theymos and others please have mercy and unban  DiMarxist account for me. I am a student. Please Everyone forgive me",

Although, I'm not against such project but due to limited block size of Bitcoin blockchain it isn't worth to add those things in the blockchain.If you're just want to quote SamReomo's post, you wouldn't add few words or spin his words in the first place! I looked on ninjastic.space he doesn't have edited his post, so it's clear you're trying to copy his post and add few words in order to make your post looks different.You're lying, you're deserved to get permanent banned by the moderators.",

Even though he had an injury and missed many matches recently it still didn't affect him negatively here. He doesn't care about being less fit than the other players. Dybala scored the goal for Roma in first half. Second half the Coach made two changes and the changes have added tempo to the team. Sevilla have equalized the goals against Roma in fifty five minutes which is not something easy. The goal came from a well played cross into the penalty box of Roma by Jesus Navas that caused an own goal from Gianluca Mancini. The ball is already an end eight six minutes, maybe miracle can happen.Quote from: Distraction on May 31, 2023, 08:09:49 PMDybala is a really special player and he proved it once again.

While the Bitcoin halving event has historically impacted its price, it's important to recognize that market dynamics can be unpredictable.

Perhaps we can assume that the OP has a few more alt accounts considering that he used paraphrasing and plagiarizing methods, and such members can very easily maintain alt farms in this way. New accounts are not easy to rank, although in the specific case it was not an obstacle considering the number of merits that the OP collected.A little more caution and additional checks before hitting the merit button would not be out of place.",

Sometimes I might want to quote a post and maybe fail to include the quote code and I will have to edit it immediately. But a close look at your case shows that it is not a slip of the hand but a conscious act. And your case is different because you engaged in what I will call \"lazy plagiarism\". I call it lazy copy and paste because you were mutilating people's posts from the forum (the same thread) instead of at least putting a little effort of lifting from other sources from the internet. It is now clear that you broke the forum's rules more than one time, so you can only plead for mercy.

Those two statements kind of don't jibe.  This guy (like many other forum plagiarists) is here to make money, plain and simple.  If you give him any kind of temporary signature ban, there's little chance he's just going to wait it out or to somehow improve his writing ability.  The main reason these idiots copy/paste other members' content is precisely because they lack writing skills--or they have nothing to say about a given topic but need to make a post anyway.I'd only support signature bans if they were permanent, but since it's too easy to create new accounts I don't think it makes much of a difference unless the account is of a fairly high rank.  In OP's case a permanent signature ban would likely cause him to abandon his account, and he might have a hard time ranking back up to Full member.  Anyway, given that he's lying here in addition to his original offenses he ought to be permabanned.  IMO now isn't the time to lessen the consequences for stealing other people's words.",
