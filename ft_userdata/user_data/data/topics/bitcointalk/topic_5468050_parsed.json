If that's how we are, shouldn't we be thankful for our strong resilience and strength?Â Secondly, concerning climate, haven't you heard of the different kinds of climate around the world?The reason ours is too hot isn't cause of government or private sector activities. Although that has a role to play, the reason is that we're located very close to the equator where the sun hits more than other regions and therefore we feel the heat from the sun more.Â  Â  Think about it, our industrialization isn't even up to half of what you'd find in some other countries, but there are still seasons where snow falls regularly. So, the depletion of the ozone layer is worldwide, not just in our country.And again, don't blame the government, we even need more industries and privately owned production enterprises in this country.",

If government still dey shout for radio everyday make we dey plant trees, Bros no lie, you go gree plant trees when you never chop. Rich men and some VIP areas plant trees and that is it.

Make we dey ask ourselves this question, how many times we dey use charcoal for Abacha stove and we no bother ask about how that charcoal take come. Before you fit use charcoal, person gaz to cut down a timber/tree and burn am.

Since there is no way these industrial activities can be stopped considering the fact that gas flaring has aided us so much in boosting the economy of the country and even if it is being stopped the deed has already been done so I suggest that the allocation that is being given to the various communities should be checked by the various industries to know if they're being shared equally to the individuals. And I also suggest that the industries should also make provision for an eye check to check the visibility of the individuals and possible treatment if there is an eye defect.",
