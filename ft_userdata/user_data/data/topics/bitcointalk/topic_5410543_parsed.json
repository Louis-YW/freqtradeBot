      "body": "Quote from: NotATether on August 20, 2022, 05:54:26 AMClickbait headline. Wladimir never desired to leave Bitcoin, but merely to leave Bitcoin Core development. Those are two different things. Don't mix them up.but even wlad himself admits both in 2016 and 2021 they have become one in the samewhere now he wants to help separate them. but be involved in both when separated. but simple to not be the central boint if it so that he can continue to contribute to bitcoin and core. without being the top guyhttps://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.htmlQuoteI will start by delegating my own tasks, and decreasing my involvement. I do not intend to stop contributing to Bitcoin, or even to the Bitcoin Core project, but I would like to remove myself from the critical path and take (even more) of a background role.in 2016 he mentions that core was not an open door policy, but instead a team that decide who they let and let out (closed door policy)https://laanwj.github.io/2016/05/06/hostility-scams-and-moving-forward.htmlQuoteHowever Bitcoin Core is a software project run by a team of people working together, on an open source basis. People who choose for themselves who they want to work with, and who they don’t want to work with.There comes a point when it is time to break ties with certain individuals which were formative in the beginning but have, over time, ossified and even come to be seen as a toxic influence.in 2016 he mentions quite alot about the infrustructure that bitcoin became QuoteI’m happy with the job I’m doing, happy to work with a few very smart people on an extremely interesting project, involving various entirely new challenges, that could have enormous impact. But on the other hand Bitcoin infrastucture development must be one of the most hostile and crazy working environments in existence, at least in software development.This is my personal reflection on recent events, and should not be seen as any official statement for Bitcoin nor Bitcoin Core.gotta love how he thought he needed a disclaimer at the end of that paragraphin 2021 admits how core are impactful and where he is seen as a central point by being at top of the hierachy of core https://laanwj.github.io/2021/01/21/decentralize.htmlQuoteRecent events have made me reflect on a few things in my life I was already thinking about for a while. Also, responses on social media have made me realize that people have strange expectations from me, and what my role in the Bitcoin Core project is.bitcoin has grown a lot since I started contributing to it in 2011. Some arrangements that were acceptable for a small scale FOSS project are no longer so for one runing a 600 billion dollar system. I realize I am myself somewhat of a centralized bottleneck. And although I find Bitcoin an extremely interesting project and believe it’s one of the most important things happening at the moment, I also have many other interests. It’s also particularly stressful and I don’t want it, nor the bizarre spats in the social media around it, to start defining me as a person.QuoteOne thing is clear: this is a serious project now, and we need to start taking decentralization seriously.",
