But, still it's not correct compare it to betting which is totally a different thing. Futures trading involves buying and selling of real assets in this case crypto-currencies and they have some kind of regulation involved while on pure gaming you are just betting to win and there aren't any assets involved in that.While it's true that futures trading does involves some risks but the gambling is purely a risk in which either you win or lose. With futures trading you have option of cross trading and isolated trading and leveraged can also be set. In a case of sudden price increase if you have put a trade on shorting you can control that with hedging techniques but in gambling there isn't anything that you can do if you face a loosing bet.",

There is no such thing as \"buyers and sellers agree on a trade to be carried out in a future\". You can do whatever you want. buy now and sell in a second or after a year. The only difference is that in spot trading you are buying and selling real assets, and in futures trading you are not even tauching a real coin/bond/metal. In spot trading, you need to have the asset to sell it (or borrow it from someone who has it), in futures you only need to find a person willing to buy, and you can sell as much as you want. You are just finding a person who is willing to accept the opposite side of the transaction, and no one has to own a coin. You just agree with each other that from now on I earn on the rising price and you on the falling price.",

More minimal risk because there are still assets owned. while futures trading in my opinion is a higher risk because every time you place a Long or Short order and make a wrong prediction everything will be liquidated, especially if you use large leverage. Futures trading looks easy, just guess the price is up or down but the risk is very high. This can be like gambling if you only rely on instinct without having trading knowledge.",

Long trade means you have accepted trade in Bitcoin and you have accepted long in future trade. the more the price of Bitcoin increases the more money will be deposited in your account and another is shot in this method the more the value of your coin decreases the more money will increase in your account but if any  Due to the increase in the value of your coins, the money will slowly decrease from your main account and if you cross a certain limit, your money will disappear completely and you will never get it back. That is, in the house of future trading which Liq. Price says. There are certain multiples (X) through which futures trades are commonly accepted such as 5x, 10x, 15x,  20x, etc. The more X you take, the greater your financial risk.",

Because an example will make it more easy to understanding.And in my opinion, future trading is not for newbies as its highly risky and involve so much un-prediction so if you are newbie and have less idea about market sentiments then i suggest you to do spot trading because even if market goes down you still have your money and have a possibility of making profit again or atleast booking your own capital instead of losing it all, like in future trading. The best part i like about future trading is, i can start even with $5 and can leverage even 10x on it but the worst part it, you could lose it all. So i don't recommend it to anyone because i am not in favor of it. Quote from: SamReomo on May 10, 2023, 06:44:14 AMWhile it's true that futures trading does involves some risks but the gambling is purely a risk in which either you win or lose. Agreed, as many used to say it's gambling, like even when a person start \"X\" business without proper knowledge, it's also gambling. So proper knowledge and case study is necassary to avoid gambling situations. But i also agreed with gladiator's point because future is full of risks and a newbie will always lose his money in it. So better to remain save.",

Of fact, there are two sorts of trading: spot and future trades. They are both similar but work in different ways. Spot trading is a basic transaction that takes more balance and strategy creation. It is a day trade that many traders look forward to since they believe it is straightforward. While future transactions are viewed as the oil well in trading, they are fairly complicated to comprehend because they incorporate more features than people can handle. Future trades are divided into two categories: isolated and cross-margined trades, as well as leverages and margins, and there are two types of orders: long and short. Futures trading will appear complicated if these basic concepts are not understood.",
