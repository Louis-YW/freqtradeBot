  "content": "Halloween is coming, so I'm going to be designing a bunch of spooky / scary / slutty avatars for the next few months.  I do a good bit of business in low price, high volume products.  Most of it ends up being someones social media pfp.Honestly, I'm not really in this to make a bunch of money.  I have a real job, and it pays the bills just fine.  Mainly, I do this for beer and pizza money, and I like fooling around with AI generators.  Seeing if I can get them to do something is fun.I won't do anything illegal (kids, animals, etc etc) but I'll make just about anything else, if I can.I prefer stable currencies, but also I collect shitcoins.  So...if you feel like wasting a few doge on a pretty picture or unloading a bunch of shitcoins you got stuck holding the bag on, and you want a pfp / thumbnail that's guaranteed OC (until someone steals it, anyway...but I can't help you there.) then I'm sure we can work something out.",
