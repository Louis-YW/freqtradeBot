The account also has a history of defaulting a loan, therefore this topic serves as a reference for a newbie/guest flag I am creating against the profile",

I would understand if it was a newbie.Yeah, there is a limitation for creating the same trust flag within 180 days regardless of one's rank. I think it was put in place to prevent some members from spamming profiles using trustflags like they did with trust feedback. You know how crazy some members can be.Thanks, @owlcatz.",
