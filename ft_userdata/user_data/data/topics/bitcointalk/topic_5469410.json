Your account may be locked because you have transacted huge amount of money there without doing any kind of kyc.  Or you have engaged in any illegal activity there that violates their rulers. I don't know who can make you do this.  But it is not sure that you will find someone for it",

Which means if the first one that will take it fails, you'll get another one to try it again, is it like that?That casino will notice that you're doing and might totally lock that withdrawal and funds you've got there.",

Can you explain the reasons that prevent you from doing it yourself? I think that the only reason is that you have an account with your identity, and you want to verify an alternative account, and it is most likely that this is the reason for which your withdrawals are frozen. This is inevitably forbidden according to the conditions of use on the site and therefore you want to manipulate the system.",

      "body": "OP if you pay for someone to pass KYC for you from this platform will your account login IP read the same as the persons own login IP? Even if the person uses VPN to login that would make it worse because your account is accustomed to one particular login IP and therefore, you will be called to answer some question. If I am not mistaken, from the looks you seems to sound like someone already using VPN to login and maybe you are from a restricted place and not allowed to play with the casino. I hope you know the consequences of what you are doing and you are ready to take in fate anything that comes up as a result of your actions. Do not come complaining that Duelbits scammed you of your funds when what you have planned backfires.",

But it's better to clarify that in this case there is a serious risk for anyone carrying out such an operation.this account may have been linked to illegal activities (fraudulent use of cards, rigged matches etc etc...) KYC user could get involved in situations that... you could certainly do without....obviously everyone is free to do what they want (even playing blindfolded on the highway) but I would still be very careful no one gives anything away for free....",

This also poses quite a risk for those who might be tempted by such offers. They have no clue about the transactions going on behind the scenes, like where the funds are coming from. Who knows, it might even be linked to some illegal activities, you know?",

Can you explain what’s this kind of experimented thing because this is new to me.Let's wait for him to answer but it's better for those that are in restricted area, better to ask the casino first if they're going to allow that through email or simply contact support.Because with these type of concerns, it's most likely that there's a shady activity that's probably being done although that's just an speculation and we'll never know it actually unless OP answer's it honestly.If there's someone that would like to do it for him, at least we've tried to say what we wanna say.",

You account is locked and you want that someelse do the KYC verification on your account so that you enable the withdraw ? Why would anyone do that, even for money ? We never know where did you bring in the funds, whether you deposited black money or something and anyone who will do KYC become responsible for your bad intentions.I guess no one here will be that greedy to risk his identity for few bucks (by the way you did not mention how much you are willing to pay for this).",
