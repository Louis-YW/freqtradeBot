But if bitcoin does not have alternatives which are the other cryptocurrencies that we are talking about, it would be better. Instead of people buying those altcoins, thinking they can not make enough profit in bitcoin, they would have rather invested their money in bitcoin if there are no shitcoins.

If we talk about competition then it occurs between altcoins, such as ETH and BNB. As in the business world, the more product competition there is, the more people will promote the product, consumers just have to choose which product is the best. This also applies to bitcoin, and bitcoin is the best so no matter how many altcoins there are, nothing will be able to shift bitcoin's position.",

So, rather than being upset or sad because there is a competition, we can look at it in a positive way.Bitcoin is open source, which means the codes that describes how it's built is opened for everyone to see, so there is no way for Bitcoin to exist alone as the only cryptocurrency. Even the bitcoin has been forked many times due to disagreement between the developers that have different ideas about it, even though bitcoin win all of them at the end.However, even if we are to assume bitcoin as the only cryptocurrency, small investors will find it challenging to enjoy it because only the big men with the large money will dominate it,bitcoin price will be big that you will only be able to own some fractions and for the price to double, it will take forever. Imagine bitcoin price was at 100k and you invested $100, you have to wait for it to reach $200k to be in profit which can take forever or even slide downward in value, it's going to be discouraging.",

Why? Because if there is no competition, the buyer's thinking is \"should I buy this or not?\" however if there is competition, the buyer's mind is \"should I buy Bitcoin or these alts?\"1. Bitcoin would be at a higher price if it was the only cryptocurrency developed. This is practical, all the money being held in other cryptocurrencies would be held in it alone, and that amount is at $1.32 trillion according to CoinGecko. By simple calculation, Bitcoin should be far higher than it's current ATH if it was the only cryptocurrency existing.2. I don't believe that Bitcoin would develop faster than it has if there was no competition. It has tried enough and has broken the record of an asset that has been so much appreciated in a very short time by the world. It can't possibly do more as it's even the reason why other cryptocurrencies were ever known.3. Your opinion is wrong my friend, Bitcoin speaks for itself and it's not thriving due to altcoins, but altcoin thrives due to Bitcoin. And as a matter of fact, Bitcoin is the most trusted cryptocurrency today, not otherwise.However, the only issue I see that you didn't mention is that, if Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency, it might cause some issues even though it supposes to be good. The miners would earn more due to monopoly and the system would be congested thereby delaying transactions. It's better this way but I wish Poopcoins should be abolished if possible.",

If we talk about technical development, then in the absence of competitors to the bitcoin, it could develop faster thanks to developers who work on other projects. The more specialists are involved in one project, the faster this project can progress. This is in theory. But whether they would actually do this is an interesting question.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on October 29, 2023, 01:37:05 PMMany people believe that if there is no alternative cryptocurrency, the price of Bitcoin will rise because it has no competition.You can count me among these people. Still simple. The money that was “stuck” in other projects or “lost” in scam projects could significantly bump up the value of the bitcoin. The more money flows into the system, the higher the bitcoin price.Quote from: jeraldskie11 on October 29, 2023, 01:37:05 PMBut, in my opinion, the price of Bitcoin is lower if it does not have a competition. Why? Because if there is no competition, the buyer's thinking is \"should I buy this or not?\" however if there is competition, the buyer's mind is \"should I buy Bitcoin or these alts?\"The question is formulated incorrectly.The buyer would be thinking, should I buy bitcoin, gold, stock, real estate or wait until my money loses value?Quote from: jeraldskie11 on October 29, 2023, 01:37:05 PMAs a result, not just Bitcoin but other altcoins will benefit. So, rather than being upset or sad because there is a competition, we can look at it in a positive way.You may be sad or you may be happy, but this will not change the current state of affairs in the market.

That's what's going to happen definitely but I am sure that there's going to be more skeptic about the capability of bitcoin because when there's more people that will invest in bitcoin then the more it's prices will increase obviously (supply and demand) and with the unprecedented increase in prices, that's going to make people suspicious about how fast the pumps in prices are which will make them think that bitcoin is a scheme that's going to attract you to invest in and then suddenly pull the rug on you when the price is just right for them, that's why I'm thankful that bitcoin isn't the only cryptocurrency out there, the spreading of detractors are just right.",

Needless to say, Bitcoin cost next to nothing during that time, but as the crypto market was growing, so was Bitcoin. There's a strong positive correlation between the growth of the altcoin market and the Bitcoin price, but a big question is whether they're causally related at all. The way I see it, altcoins aren't taking anything away from Bitcoin. They're growing out of the newly created demand, and so is Bitcoin. A big market draws more attention, so it's a positive influence. If altcoins had never appeared, I think Bitcoin would have been taken less seriously, as a standalone weird thing rather than the best currency out of a huge market of similar currencies. So I agree with the op that it's a positive thing that altcoins exist.",
