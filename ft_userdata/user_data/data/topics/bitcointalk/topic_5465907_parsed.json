  "content": "üèá Horse Racing (UK & Ireland) odds, predictions, discussions üèáThis topic is about racing and gambling, so I would love to see posting people who know about gambling it although I would love also discussions about why a horse is a favorite in this race, ground, trainer jockey combinations.We're users from all around the world here with different timezones so for some UK/FRA/IRE racing would be a pain in the ass to watch so feel free to drop anything about races in Australia, US or Japan or where you're living, I might focus on my favorites but it's not a determined theme.Please keep it about gambling no stuff like as xxxx is a favorite, I think he'll win.Most odds will be taken from betfair,paddypower or from skysports for finished races.If you're interested can watch replays for free :https://www.racingtv.com/videos/horse_racing_replayshttps://www.attheraces.com/replaysLive is available on Betfair on the betting race, I don't know any legit free streaming service that covers all the races as I have the premium sports package but if anyone knows please post it. Other internet stream services, there is a ton of them but so full of ads and crap I will not recommend any to date.Also due to complete boredom, I will sponsor for a limited time a free prediction game for most Garde 1 festivals and meetings probably once a week, the links to both active and ended rounds will be listed in the second post.PS.Not to scare everyone from an already \"exotic\" sport for some, I decided to keep the topic unmoderated, but that's not an invitation to make your quota here.",
