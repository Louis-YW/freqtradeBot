  "content": "Hi. Looking for coins like KSM and DOT.From reading about DOT and KSM i understand i can delegate my coins and earn staking rewards - but staking rewards can be paid out to different address. Like multisend in old days. Any other new coins(tokens) with that feature anyone know of.All i can find are manual withdraw - pay fee - send to custom address - pay another fee...Thanks.",
