  "content": "I was quite shocked when I heard this news and when confirmed it. Well, to all those who don't know what is Ordinals and what is Wikileaks and what are war logs. Listen to me. Ordinals have allowed one to inscribe video, text, images, etc. into the BTC blockchain. Some take it as a loophole while some take benefit of it. And the Wikileaks is a website more like a news website which is nonprofit and full of all the war crimes done by the US in several countries. Many of the readers of this post must be well aware of WikiLeaks and the journalist ( Julian Assange ) who created it and is in jail now for publishing the secret logs of war on the website. Now coming to the war log, consists of 92,000 documents on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Which is full of sensitive data.Now someone is inscribing all of those war logs (which are the top secret of the US and removed by them ) in the BTC blockchain. I mean, whether they are doing the right thing or not I will not get into this discussion. But overall we might see some hot things against BTC as the documents which are already on the BTC blockchain now, cannot be deleted or altered. I cannot say anything that what those authorities would do but one thing I will say for sure is, that BTC has not provided us the financial freedom only but provided the freedom of speech too. And now I have started to think that BTC is legendary and really has exceeded the expectations of Satoshi (answer to those OPs who ask mostly --> either BTC exceeds Satoshi's expectations or not?) Well, the group who have taken responsibility is known as Project Spa-rta-cus's and they have initialized a website to inscribe the logs on the BTC blockchain. Well, now from the technical point of view, we might see a surge in the transaction fee because if someone has decided to inscribe all of the 92,000 documents then we might see some congestion on the market. So, be prepared for it. And what do you guys have to say on this? I mean regardless of the differences and being as a BTC enthusiast, Do you think BTC is being used for good purposes or not? I mean my mind also told me, that this might be a divergence to divert some attention of the economists (BTC enthusiasts also) from the Palestine and Israel war. I mean, who knows, next time a journalist like Julian Assange, will not have to go to jail to bring the truth in the front of the world as they can simply use the BTC blockchain. Or I am wrong here?https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/someone-is-inscribing-all-of-wikileaks-infamous-afghan-war-logs-on-bitcoinDisclaimer* I don't know, if I broke any rule of the forum by sharing the news, if I did, then please correct me by suggestions.",

Fortunately, Bitcoin has since taken a good seat and this time it's less worrying, I think.On the other hand, I don't think BTC is profoundly anti-capitalist. I tend to agree with the author of this article from Unijoin's blog:QuotePro-capitalism. The White Paper stresses Bitcoinâ€™s advantages to commerce and merchants as a free-enterprise payment system.

I don't know, it seems this effort is a statement that reminds the US government that they're still in this kind of war. I'm afraid this won't benefit Julian. This might instead cause a backlash and the UK might end up favoring the US' extradition request. Anyway, everybody can join in this effort. This is being outsourced in a way. This is probably because the amount of information to be published is massive. Anybody can publish a log paying only the network fee. You can also choose the quantity of information you want to publish. And then you'll provide a Bech32 Bitcoin address for the information.Right now, the fee is just 2 Sats/vB even in high priority transactions. The number of inscription is growing, probably taking advantage of the cheap fees. If many will help in publishing these information, we should expect transactions to flood the mempool. The fees will certainly rise as a result. To those who want to help, please make sure the address you'll provide will never be linked to you as it might expose you to certain risks. I'm not even sure if this effort is actually coming from the real supporters of Assange. For all we know, this could be coming from the government itself or from certain individuals who want to clog the Bitcoin network.

This might benefit the cause, yes, but Julian is already in the hands of the government. He is in jail. If the fate of Julian is not as important as the cause, he can rot there, for all we care.

The government, after all, is not anymore hiding from all kinds of crimes that were committed in Afghanistan. That the military was actually a cruel pack of wild animals in that foreign country isn't something new I guess. Leaked materials are far better than useless ape jpegs. Nobody would join a movement broadcasting transactions involving poor artworks. Many might, though, if it involves information of war crimes committed by no less than the government.

It was not meant to be some Google Drive or any cloud storage that provided decentralization features and other things. It is only meant to be used in finance to digitalize the financial world and free it from centralized authorities. But the uploading of data, like pictures and videos, poses some next-level threats to the BTC blockchain. What if someone uploaded the leaks of someone on the BTC blockchain, like a big celebrity or a video of some top-level person who has big connections?The bad thing will be that this will not be altered or deleted after. I think to deal with this, we need an upgrade that would filter out the sensitive data and allow the validators to reject those entries.I would not say it's diverted from the current war, it's just a thought of you. But I do agree that BTC has provided us with freedom of speech too. Like in our country, many political leaders are doing what they should not do, and all social media and new agencies are with them, and if anyone raises questions, we don't know where they go. The point is, that blockchain does provide us with freedom of speech now, and I like it, but it will also compromise the blockchain, and the fee will be high.",
