  "content": "QuoteWASHINGTON—The U.S. said it would allow Chevron Corp. to resume pumping oil from its Venezuelan oil fields after President Nicolás Maduro’s government and an opposition coalition agreed to implement an estimated $3 billion humanitarian relief program and continue dialogue in Mexico City on efforts to hold free and fair elections.Following the Norwegian-brokered agreement signed in Mexico City, the Biden administration granted Chevron a license that allows the California-based oil company to return to its oil fields in joint ventures with Venezuela national oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA. The new license, granted by the Treasury Department, permits Chevron to pump Venezuelan oil for the first time in years.Biden administration officials said the license prohibits PdVSA (Petróleos de Venezuela SA) from receiving profits from Chevron’s oil sales. The officials said the U.S. is prepared to revoke or amend the license, which will be in effect for six months, at any time if Venezuela doesn’t negotiate in good faith.“If Maduro again tries to use these negotiations to buy time to further consolidate his criminal dictatorship, the United States and our international partners must snap back the full force of our sanctions,” said Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.The U.S. policy shift could signal an opening for other oil companies to resume their business in Venezuela two years after the Trump administration clamped down on Chevron and other companies’ activities there as part of a maximum-pressure campaign meant to oust the Maduro government. But the Treasury Department action didn’t say how non-U.S. oil companies might re-engage with Venezuela.Venezuela produces some 700,000 barrels of oil a day, compared with more than 3 million barrels a day in the 1990s. Some analysts said Venezuela could hit 1 million barrels a day in the medium term, a modest increment reflecting the dilapidated state of the country’s state-led oil industry.The Wall Street Journal reported in October the Biden administration was preparing to scale down sanctions on Venezuela’s regime to allow Chevron to resume pumping oil there.Under the new license, profits from the sale of oil will go toward repaying hundreds of millions of dollars in debt owed to Chevron by PdVSA, administration officials said. The U.S. will require that Chevron report details of its financial operations to ensure transparency, they said.Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr said the new license allows the company to commercialize the oil currently being produced at its joint-venture assets. He said the company will conduct its business in compliance within the current framework.The license prohibits Chevron from paying taxes and royalties to the Venezuelan government, which surprised some experts. They had been expecting that direct revenue would encourage PdVSA to reroute oil cargoes away from obscure export channels, mostly to Chinese buyers at a steep discount, that Venezuela has relied on for years to skirt sanctions.“If this is the case, Maduro doesn’t have significant incentives to allow that many cargoes of Chevron to go out,” said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy. Sending oil to China, even at a heavy discount, would be better for Caracas than only paying debt to Chevron, he said.The limited scope of the Chevron license is seen as a way to ensure that Mr. Maduro stays the course on negotiations. “Rather than fully opening the door for Venezuelan oil to flow to the U.S. market immediately, what the license proposes is a normalization path that is likely contingent on concessions from the Maduro regime on the political and human-rights front,” said Luisa Palacios, senior research scholar at the Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy.The license allows Venezuelan oil back into the U.S., historically its largest market, but only if the oil from the PdVSA-Chevron joint ventures is first sold to Chevron and doesn’t authorize exports from the ventures “to any jurisdiction other than the United States,” which appears to restrict PdVSA’s own share of the sales to the U.S. market, said Mr. Monaldi.The license prohibits transactions involving goods and services from Iran, another U.S.-sanctioned oil producer that has helped Venezuela to overcome sanctions in recent years. And it blocks dealings with Venezuelan entities owned or controlled by Western-sanctioned Russia, which has also played a role in Venezuela’s oil industry.Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the Maduro government’s delegation to the Mexico City talks, declined to comment on the issuance of the Chevron license.Freddy Guevara, a member of the opposition coalition’s delegation, said the estimated $3 billion in frozen funds intended for humanitarian relief and infrastructure projects in Venezuela would be administered by the United Nations. He cautioned that it would take time to fully implement the program. “It begins now, but the time period is up to three years,” he said.The Venezuelan state funds frozen in overseas banks by sanctions are expected to be used to alleviate the country’s health, food and electric-power crises in part by building infrastructure for electricity and water-treatment needs. “Not one dollar will go to the vaults of the regime,” Mr. Guevara said.Chevron plans to restore lost output as it performs maintenance and other essential work, but it won’t attempt major work that would require new investments in the country’s oil fields until debts of $4.2 billion are repaid. That could take about two to three years depending on oil-market conditions, according to people familiar with the matter.PdVSA owes Chevron and other joint-venture partners their shares of more than two years worth of revenue from oil sales, after the 2020 U.S. sanctions barred the Venezuelan company from paying its partners, one of the people said. The license would allow Chevron to collect its share of dividends from its joint ventures such as Petropiar, in which Chevron is a 30% partner.Analysts say the new agreement raises expectations that will take time and work to fulfill. “Ensuring the success of talks won’t be easy, but it’s clear that offering gradual sanctions relief like this in order to incentivize agreements is the only way forward. It’s a champagne popping moment for the negotiators, but much more work remains to be done,” said Geoff Ramsey, Venezuela director at the Washington Office on Latin America.https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/chevron-gets-new-u-s-license-to-pump-oil-in-venezuela-again/ar-AA14AEd7....According to this article, iran stepped in to extract and refine oil in venezuela after the united states imposed sanctions on them.

I personally believe the government of Maduro is seeking to demand recognition from the USA and the future administrations to come (both democrat and Republican) in exchange of turning the economic model from a socialist project to a open capitalism, in favor of transnationals and private sector (USA companies among them)I can let you know that they are already take the first steps by relaying some services to private companies, Chevron is the biggest example, there are other ones which are not mentioned very often:Maintenance, Transportation, Sanitation... Added to the adoption of the USD in detriment of the local currency.",

But sometimes the reason for their meddling in countries internal politics is just to outsmart or prevent competitors from dealing with such nations. Venezuela went through a lot of economic problems because of the sanctions imposed on them by the US. There was high rate of inflation and Venezuelans suffered from high cost of goods and poverty. The US claimed that they wanted to remove the perceived socialist government President Nicolás Maduro. But they fail to understand that these sanctions affects the common man on the streets of Venezuela than the government. In this trying time, other countries assisted her to overcome some of those economic problems caused by these sanctions. Now because America wants Venezuela to return as its partner, they are ensuring they destroy the relationship between Venezuela and nations that stood by them in times of trouble. Now they are enticing Venezuela with economic aid or lucrative oil deals so that they can push its close business partners aside.",

Some ONG even talks about 199 spills in 5 years.https://www.dw.com/es/ong-venezolana-documenta-199-derrames-petroleros-en-%C3%BAltimos-cinco-a%C3%B1os/a-61264572That being said, if I had to guess why the Biden administration is allowing our oil to be exported again, I would say it has to do with geopolitical reasons, historically my country has been within the range of influence of the USA, until Chavez appeared and since he appeared we slowly became a Russian-Chinese-Iranian stronghold.Chavez is dead now and their successors are ideologically weak, Biden maybe trying to flip us back to their sphere of influence through diplomacy and a \"taste\" or good economical relationships, the international pressure and sanctions have failed to get rid of the people in power here.In the end, USA is close to us and Russia/China/Iran are far away. Europe needs energy we have and Biden wants us to distance from Putin.Perhaps, he is trying to shoot two birds with one single bullet: Oil supply for Europe and lure us away from the Kremlin.",

Venezuelan oil does not pollute!!!!I don't know how it had not occurred to me before. They should give him a Nobel Prize or something.LOL.. the exact chronology goes like this - 1. Biden gets elected. Suspends crude oil extraction from federal lands and cancels the Keystone XL pipeline. Then threatens the American shale oil and gas producers with even more regulations and oversight. 2. Crude oil prices shoots up by 100% to 150%. Biden's friends in the OPEC are swimming in wads of money. 3. Russia launches the invasion of Ukraine. Biden can't impose sanctions on Russian crude, because if he does that then the crude prices will rally even more4. Biden goes to Saudi Arabia with a begging bowl at hand, to meet price Salman. The price shows Biden his middle finger. 5. Biden enters in to secret negotiations with Iran, to increase crude oil output. Again, the same result. 6. Biden asks/threatens the American shale oil firms to increase their output. Once again, the same result. 7. Plan C/D/E..  - Biden goes to Venezuela with a begging bowl. Whether he gets anything or not, needs to be seen.",
