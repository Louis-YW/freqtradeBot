No matter a wallet is lost or not, the coins will remain on the address they belong to, no matter what. And that's because there are many cases that addresses from very long ago are actually not lost (one example is collectibles / funded Casascius coins). And if bitcoin would implement a way to get those coins, that would be stealing.2. You say that those addresses can be easily hacked, still, I've didn't hear of any such hack. Do you actually have any proper info that can back this assumption of yours?",

      "body": "You seem very confused and it shows in the way you asked your questions. It's difficult to follow your thought process. To spend bitcoins, you need the signing keys - the private keys for the address they are on. Nowadays with HD wallets, we use seeds and don't have to worry about individual private keys. The software takes care of that. If you don't have your keys/seed, you can't spend your coins. A completely lost seed or private key is unrecoverable. If some characters or words are missing, you might be able to bruteforce it.The only way you could spend coins where you no longer possess the keys/seed is it you still have access to to the wallet they are imported in. If everything is lost, your coins are out of your reach.",

So, let me try and explain it in simpler terms for you.Basically, if a wallet is lost and the private keys cannot be recovered, then the bitcoins allocated to that wallet are essentially lost forever. They cannot be credited to any other account or used in any way.Now, you also asked about tracing the wallet back. While transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are public and can be traced, it's still really hard to figure out who a lost wallet belongs to, especially if it hasn't been used in years. That's why, for example, we can't know for sure which wallets belonged to Satoshi.I see you also mentioned something about hot wallets. But just to let you know, that's not necessarily true. There are actually different kinds of \"cold\" wallets out there, not just hardware wallets, if that's what you meant. And lastly, Bitcoin wallets cannot be easily hacked, no matter how old they are.",

This explorer enables individual to have a clue of transaction destination which stands or serves as evidence of payment or issuance however the case maybe. However dormant wallet addresses are mostly accounts holding for long. Some of those wallet you see that has big volume of bitcoin in them and have not done any traceable transaction can likely be seen as a hodler account in which the owner have been holding for a long time. Off lately there have been series of accounts hodling bitcoin for long that have been activated with bitcoin transferred. You should not be worried about that as it does not affect the total supply of bitcoin.",

This means that they will not be accessible to anyone, and they will not be able to be used or spent. Over time, these lost bitcoins will become increasingly rare, which may have an impact on the value of the remaining bitcoins in circulation because they will be stuck forever in that wallet not unless someone has a private key stored on a backup, the user may be able to restore the wallet and regain access to their bitcoins.
