  "content": "My business partner recently disappeared on me, leaving me somewhat hanging in the wind, hence why I'm here.  Looking for a 1 - 3 BTC loan / investment which will return a good ROI.  I'm a highly skilled and experienced back-end developer and have been involved within crypto since 2010 just a little after bitcoin came out.  At my peak was tech lead for a previous main client, and was responsible for developing and maintaining around 40 different bitcoin related operations.  Everything from web wallets, exchanges, mixers, escrow, debit cards, auction site, P2P exchange, HYIP, and much more.  He became filthy rich in the process.When it comes to entrepreneurs, that's all I've ever done.  Started my own software firm at age 16, and professional firm at age 19 which I sold 5 years later.  From there, only ever worked with highly intelligent and ambitious serial entrepreneurs who taught me alot.  I'm not exactly the 9-5 type.Have three business plans, first, largest and most foundational one is ready to go, second one is partially ready to go and third is still in idea stage.  They are:## 1.  Apexhttps://apexpl.io/.  Open source PHP based framework with built-in commercial marketplace among loads of other things -- designed to be modern day replacement to Wordpress.  Business plan can be found at:      https://apexpl.io/Apex_Business_Plan.pdf.  After good handful of years and several iterations, this one is ready to go.  Apex also allows me to quickly and efficiently develop, deploy and maintain dozens of quality, customized online operations, which brings us to the next two business plans.## Multiple Crypto OperationsDon't have business plan for this yet, but can have it written within 24 hours if desired.  Basically, want to replicate same model my previous main client of 9 years (RIP) mentioned above had.  Setup dozens of crypto related operations, most of which will have both, clearnet and darknet addresses.  Basically, just throw tons of mud at the wall, see what sticks, and concentrate on those operations.Now that Apex is 100%, necessary foundation is in place to quickly churn out quality and secure operations including but not limited to:- Coin Mixer (see below)- BTC -> XMR exchange, and vice versa- P2P Exchange ala Localbitcoins- BTC / XML -> PayPal / CashApp / Venmo- Debit Cards- Secure and Anonymous Web Wallets- Merchant Payment Gateway ala CoinPayments, Bitpay, PayPal, et al.- Traditional Exchange- Lottery / Gambling / Dice- Hosted GPUs / Mining - Anonymous Web Hosting (probably not, buth worth looking at)- Telegram and Discord Trading / Exchange Channels- Multivendor eCommerce Marketplace- Sports Betting- Crowdfunding- Escrow- Auction- Job Board- Ad Network- News SitesAnd the list goes on, unlimited ideas.  Again, just throw as much mud at the wall as possible, and see what sticks.  Can even span multiple of the same site (eg. coin mixer) but just market each differently to a different audience.  Several operations already done minus the design as I suddenly went totally blind 6 years ago.#### Coin MixerRight now, have a mixer done, which can be viewd at the below URLs.  Please note, I did suddenly go totally blind about 6 years ago, hence obviously this still needs a theme overlay.Homepage: https://mixer.envrin.com/Example Mixer Status:  https://mixer.envrin.com/status/mjovfd8qWzqMjiufnfg3tpu9mYbhoFCS1y Admin Panel:  https://mixer.envrin.com/admin/Typical coin mixer with some nice additional features.  No user registration required, you just submit your payment address you'd like mixed funds sent to and are redirected to a mixer status page as linked above.  Users can continue sending funds to their mixing address anytime they'd like, or have a new mixing address generated.Also supports premium mixing at a higher fee allowing user to specify multiple payment addresses instead of just one.  The system will randomize the output amounts and send one transaction to each.  Also has a REST API allowing website owners to modify their software system and have incoming funds automatically mixed.#### Localbitcoins CloneHomepage: https://peertrade.net/Having issues generating a Google Maps API key so unable to post a demo trade right now, but even though the home page obviously needs some design work the trade page is identical to Localbitcoins both in design and functionality. I know the admin panel isn't the greatest UI as it's very old system.  If this site starts gaining traction I'll port everything over to Apex v2 with the same admin panel as the coin mixer.Considering LBC recently closed, this could potentially be a good earner as millions of people were left stranded## Multiple AI OperationsOnce crypto operations are in place, start in on the AI operations.  Same principle, throw as much mud at the wall as possible, and see what sticks.  Unlimited possibilites here -- interio design, fashion / clotes selection, landscape architechture, design personalized board games for your kids, personalized coloring books, personalized travel / vaction itinerary planned, and the list is endless.This one would be catered to non-tech folks who have no real idea about AI except what the see on the news.  They'll see an ad on Facebook or where ever, think it's cool, share it with their friends, pay $8.95 for the service, et al.  Multiple that by thousands of people and dozens of operations, and looking good.## Investment TermsObviously requires discussion, but what I would propose is strict royalty payments on a monthly basis, meaning you get a payment every month.  Higher roaylaty at first of say 25% of profit until principle + say 30% (TBD) is paid at which time royalty drops to say 5% in perpetutiy.  I would also want some mechanism to buy you out of that 5% though, but again, needs discussion.You'd have full root access to all servers (three atm) and administration panels allowing you to view all the going ons of every operation.  ## ConclusionGist is woke up one day 6 years ago to find out I'm now totally blind for the rest of my life.  A while after this revelation my main client of 9 years suddenly disappeared.  A good while later I found out he had been murdered, hence the disappearance.  However, FBI estimated his net work at $1 billion, much of which I was an integral part in helping him make.Got to work on Apex, as I've been developing software frameworks since 2006, but Apex is the first one I'm comfotable enough with both its quality and simplicity to push it out into the public.  All previous frameworks have always remained in-house and only used for my personal clients.  Apex is ready for public consumption though.While developing Apex ended up retraining myself within online software as was quite outdated.  Plus taught myself multiple other languages such as Rust, Typescript, Golang, et al and brought myself up to speed on a plethora of various new technologies.  One main reason Apex took so long to develop is because I found myself always stuck contracting myself out to keep money flowing in.  Plus the more lucrative and better contracts I was landing required more than full time work, forcing me to put Apex on the back burner for months at a time.On top of that, the current state of the contracting field within the online software industry is for the most part terrible.  There are good paying contracts out there, but few and far between, and they generally require more than full-time.  Now that Apex is ready to go, I simpy don't want to continue doing that and would prefer to take a hit on the interest and offer royalty in perpetutiy than continue spinning on a hamster wheel never getting anywhere.Goal is to have hopefully dozens of various income streams from all sorts of online operations.  I've done this all my life, have made alot of people alot of money, and now it's my turn.  I know what I'm doing, and know I can get it done.Initially went looking for a replacement to my previous business partner, but quickly realized it wouldn't work and would be better to just contract out to folks, provide bonuses for good work, et al.  Otherwise, there's just going to be problems -- they'll treat it as a side hustle or won't provide quality work or whatever, leading to disagreements, and just not worth it.  Best if I have control to bring on and let go contracts on an as needed basis.Should work fine, as I'm an excellent boss and everyone that has worked for me in the past always loves me.  What I need mainly is both, marketing help and driving traffic, but even moreso than that just folks putting in time to execute things such as the marketing strategies outlined in the above business plan.  I'm an excellent back-end developer, but horrible markter, although have learned enough from previous clients who were all markters.  Plus being blind means I need to contract out for things such as web design, video editing, et al.If desired, to get a better idea of myself, you may view my resume at:    https://apexpl.io/Resume_Matt_Dizak.pdfIf anyone would by chance be interested in a venture such as this, please drop me an e-mail at matt@apexpl.io.Best,Matt",
