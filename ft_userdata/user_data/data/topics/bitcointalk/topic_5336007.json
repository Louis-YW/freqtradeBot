  "content": "Watching the lately spot about Musk appearing on live tv this weekend for showing what all the hype is about and if he will actually have a mention of his favorite cryptocurrency doge, it seems the media are jumping all over this appearance.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWWzszskgmAWhat are your thoughts about this North American appearance and what do you think he will do or say about doge or even bitcoin?I think since Miley Cyrus is the musical guest he will have her dress up as a dog and call her doge. She likes cats and had dressed up as them on stage during her concerts, so you never know what these two crazy people will do on this episode.",

What makes it so unappealing to the bitcoin maximalists and not some other coin such as ethereum? Anyways the last tweet from elon really rallied the musketeers right before the big show tonight.Think this will be the movement to mass media, whether that be good or bad for bitcoin, that crypto was waiting for.I am not sure if I have succumb to the FUD but I think most who have suffered in the past year from what has been going on in the world (and still is!)needed a break of this kind even if it is just a joke!",

I wonder if he took advantage or if he just did it for the lulz.Probably for shit and giggles.Â  Anyhow, it's an interesting and bold move from him, and it's could be a win-win for his Tesla and for us crypto enthusiast as well. For bitcoin yeah, we already know that they have invested billions already pushing the price and them liquidating some to make some profit.For Doge though, he might be doing it for fun and obviously Doge is a meme coin and he just prove it.And for Tesla, still doing good I guess, and it really pump during their bitcoin announcement, but it's been trading sideways, it touches almost $900.00 in February, and around $670.00 today.",

I am paraphrasing, it's easy to find. Some relatively young guy (30's) was celebrating loudly because he became a millionaire (on paper) with Doge. He had invested his life's savings (hundred-something K USD).He said 'I grew up poor, I'm not selling any of it. I'll wait until it's 10 million, then I'll withdraw a million dollars.' Poor guy.It's this guy...https://twitter.com/ProTheDoge/status/1389559038896054273There was an interview with this investor who put all his life savings into it on the robin hood exchange (why hold it on there I do not know  ):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OZMdWxJe_AThere was a follow-up with an update on his holdings on the platform after today:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAKKsohaaUoUp over $2.79mln is no joke.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBqwhGaE9nMBut him mentioning he will only sell once it reaches $10mln.After tomorrow let us see what happens as it is reaching the $1 prediction as most were hoping for before the controversial event.Will Elon mention it or not and it dumps?I do find it strange that an alt coin requires someone of influence to mention it just once for it's dependent to either survive or die. Clip of these so called financial investors discussing about this guy's phenom investment in a cryptocurrency and not selling.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0fc3-Itg58",
