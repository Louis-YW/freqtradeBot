  "content": "Hello,I just created an Electrum multisig in Tails (totally offline), and one of the signatures must come from a Trezor one. When I try to sign, there's a message: \"missing previous tx\".Can someone help me about this error?I was using Electrum 4.0.9 and now tried 4.3.4. Same problem. All the process was done totally offline, I don't want to go online to sign anything.I try to sign with the Trezor first, or last, or in the middle. Same problem. All the signatures go well except the Trezor's.The wallet created just has master keys for the other signatures, except for the Trezor's.Thank you.",

Are you sure it is a valid transaction?Secondly, make sure the Trezor is up to date, and also ensure that you have the correct wallet open on the Trezor. Did you use a passphrase when setting up the wallet and have forgotten to enter it this time?There have been a number of problems in the past with Trezor devices and multi-sig in the past, so this might be nothing you are doing wrong but rather a problem with Trezor.",

It's a watch only wallet since it has all the cosigners master keys only. So I can create the transaction and sign using my offline devices.The transaction is valid, and it works when I sign with other cosigners other than Trezor.",

Maybe this is the problem. I will try to change and answer here.The passphrase is correct. When it is not, the Electrum show an error message. And the addresses are correct, and the sign button is there. I tried to do it again many times. Same error.I try to run Electrum with Trezor - not multisig. Create an account, received btc, and when I try to send them using the same procedure, from my watch only account in my cellphone and sign in Electrum, surprise, same error: missing previous tx.",
