But I dont know which wallet I installed (Bitcoin Core...)If you have a seed phrase, it's not bitcoin core. Bitcoin core doesn't support seed phrase at all.Most wallets use the BIP39 standard for generating seed phrase. We have also electrum which uses its own algorithm for generating seed phrase and supports importing BIP39 seed phrase as well.Download electrum from its official website, verify your download, create a new wallet and select \"Standard wallet\" and then \"I already have a seed\".Enter your seed phrase and see if it allows you to click on \"Next\" button. If the next button is grayed out, click on \"Options\" and select \"BIP39\". If you see a message saying '\"BIP39 (checksum: ok)\", click on Next\".",

If that is the case, you can use the procedure stated by @ hosseinimr93. If, on the other hand, by phrase you mean passphrase (i.e. a single word), then the scenario is obviously a different one.The structure available on your disk has two of the three directories that are coincidental with Bitcoin Core’s data directory structure, though \"/bit\" isn't I believe. If you did install and use bitcoin core as a wallet though, you’d certainly remember having done so.Quote from: nc50lc on December 16, 2022, 10:43:17 AM<...>semi-snap",

Thanks againThe easiest and quickest way IMO, is to use the Ian Coleman BIP39 page offline https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ - you can also safely download it from his Github https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39/releases/latest/ - and to try common derivation paths from main wallets. Then you will just need to check the obtained addresses onto an online blockchain explorer to check if they are empty or not.",
