  "content": "This is not a poll to know which managerial succession has produced the best result expected of the handover, but it is to know which succession has satisfied fans with good performance from players and the much needed goals. Am using Manchester United since the time of Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement and him being succeeded by David Moyes till currently Ten Hag,  while Arsenal's Arsene Wenger retirement and Unai Emry taking charge of coaching duties till  Mikel Arteta who is doing fine currently as the coach.*I want to know in your own opinion, which manager or coaching succession between Arsenal and Manchester United from the time of Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger till now, has made the team better or worse than it was before succession?*Also what other team manager's succession or replacement upon retirement has been successful under a new manager currently? (No league exempted).*What do you think about retiring managers picking their own succession? Is it even legal?Let's discuss!",
