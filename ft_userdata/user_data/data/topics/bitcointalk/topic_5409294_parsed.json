It is possible that he left some valuable tokens on that wallet, but which are not transferable. So anyone who tries to send some ETH for gas will lose their money. It means scammers set up the software so that once they detect a new transaction, they automatically transfer funds from that address to another scammer's wallet.",

This is how many unsuspecting victims will end up loosing their eth or bnb to the scammers",

Waw that's a smart move, we just have to be very careful, I don't really know they are after the gas fee you are depositing.",

Makes sense. Initially when I saw the recovery phrase and private key, I thought this would be about giving the victims links to fake and malware-infected wallets. The victim tries to recover the wallet. It doesn't work and all they see is an empty wallet. They get in touch with the scammer who would then say something like: yeah sorry, for security reasons you have to use this new type of Ethereum wallet. No other software can recover the seed otherwise. The victim downloads the fake thing and infects their device.",

I suspected that something was wrong with the whole setup but I just wanted to be sure my instinct of it being a scam trap was right. It was a risk which I later abandoned to avoid any issues. I don't believe in free cash and so anything that comes up in that format raises my alertness, except where I asked for it. OP, avoid that. There's no free money anywhere on earth.

I'm getting several messages from scammers asking for seeds as well as scammers providing seeds as described in the OP's thread. Eradicate scammers is to hand them over to other scammers, so that no one is fooled.But this method needs to be wary of, because beginners only see the nominal sent in the message without thinking that they are being targeted and will become victims.",
