This is a forum, it will not be good if someone because of campaign have some posts without posting it yet until certain time. I will always prefer to read and post to what is presently happening.",

But my response in any case would be this: OP, you've been around long enough to know that either reporting burst posters to mods and/or to the member's campaign manager would both be appropriate, although I'd say it depends on the quality of the posts themselves.Â  There was some member a couple of years ago who was throwing down very well-thought out posts in a rapid fire manner, and despite him obviously not being a shitposter he got called out on it publicly.Â  Wish I could remember his username.Is the member in question here ramanlop0 by any chance?Â  He posted after Poker Player in PP's second to last post, and looking at his post history it does look like he's making posts very quickly--and they're very short ones.Â  Those I would report.",

That's some thought and would be one way to stire reactions but, I think it was an error from OP as I don't think OP would be this eager to put himself in the spotlight of some negativity as he clearly knows post bursting isn't okay. As this is mostly aimed at meeting campaign quotas, ninjastic.space could detect and campaign managers frowns at it which makes it some unacceptable act.In anyways, I also checked his last seen and its way back to 4am UTC in contracts to when most of these responses started pouring in and as such, his yet to realise the mistake he must have made in that link.

But if the content of the posts are OK and it isn't spam except the posts coming in quick succession one after the other, I personally wouldn't mind it. I did think of something though. Imagine you were reading a few threads or posts and then you had to leave or go to work before you can come up with a decent reply. During the time you are gone, you might write a draft of what you want to say or write it on your work computer and save the content somewhere. Later when you get home where you are safe to access Bitcointalk, you come back to your attachments or drafts, check that you aren't repeating what others have already said, and you post it in the appropriate threads. Since the posts were already written in advance, you can post all of them relatively quickly, and they will look like burst posting.
