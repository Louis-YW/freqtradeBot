If you decide to proceed then what you get is probably some spammers, plus a chance to get negative feedback since most user views ponzi as a scam (me included). CMIIW.",

There's no other way on this scheme to earn for all members but to push to refer people and have them pay the signing up fee. That business model won't stay for so long thus, it's considered as a scam. If no new members and money comes in, that's how the pyramid will collapse.",

And why does he want to promote it in the bitcoin forum in the first place?This kind of matrix is actually a Ponzi scheme based on the referral system done by the old subscribers and the subscribers below them, so I don't know what they need to run a promotional campaign here on the bitcoin forum?",

Best example is 1xbit campaign. It runs for few years already and they have enough participants. And they don't care about getting negative trust. So, probably it's possible to find someone to run such campaign and potential participants.But offcourse, I suggest OP not to do it. Better GTFO from Bitcointalk with his scams.",
