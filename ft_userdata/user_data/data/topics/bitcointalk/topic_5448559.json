Why do you chose to trust bitcoin over any other investment?Bitcoin has a progressive reputation that built through the years. I’m a doubter too on Bitcoin the first time I saw it due to its high volatility that is much worst than current condition due to limited liquidity.Bitcoin liquidity is now huge since many people already trusting. This is the result of converting non-believers to believer every time Bitcoin defeat the bear market multiple times for every 4 year cycle.More than a decade of continuous price growth and unwavering decentralized feature of Bitcoin gave high confidence to all holders to trust more Bitcoin as time passes by.",

Why do we have this so much trust on bitcoin that it not die easily? That bitcoin is a long term investment with confidentiality. Why do you chose to trust bitcoin over any other investment?I have always avoided any investment that promises instant or huge profit. Bitcoin unlike other crypto investments suits my belief that any business that promises instant money doubling is a scam. Bitcoin promotes the virtues of patience and bravery. Bitcoin has also been consistent for a long time. Many cryptocurrencies have been created and within a few years they disappeared from the crypto space. But bitcoin has remained in existence since it was created. Everybody wants to be associated with the number one or the champion of any industry. Bitcoin has remained the number one cryptocurrency and I want to be part of the winning team. I am also attracted to bitcoin because even in the face of attacks and unfriendliness by different governments and financial institutions, the coin is still growing stronger every day. The selfless and humble nature of the creator of the coin is proof that it was created to for selfish reasons but to give the world privacy and freedom.",

Why do you chose to trust bitcoin over any other investment?My answer is because of its decentralization. If bitcoin was just like any other project that would fail then we wouldn’t be here today after all the troubles from the government.The ability of bitcoin to a store of value is also of great importance of why I choose bitcoin. In the past it was very hard to do cross boarder transactions or international without the hurdles of the bank but it with bitcoin it is a smooth move. Although there’s the bitcoin volatility but it is much better than the inflationary volatility faced by the fiat currencies.",

Why do you chose to trust bitcoin over any other investment?The world now is now driven by technology, and everything is becoming digital.We make physical investments and profit from them, but we also fail due to a lack of trust, which is mostly influenced by third parties.Some of us get involved in Ponzi schemes due to a lack of proper knowledge, whereas gambling is done for fun, even though some people become addicted to it.The entire Bitcoin process is transparent enough for everyone, and Bitcoin provides us with financial freedom in that we can now conduct our transactions without the involvement of a third party, and there is nothing unclear about the entire Bitcoin process. Given how far Bitcoin has come and the rate of adoption that is increasing on a daily basis, it is clear that there is a future in Bitcoin that no one will want to miss out on.",

You are right mate,and I'm with you on this one.Bitcoin has changed so many lives,and I don't think without Bitcoin,I would have been like this.BTC has had so many positive impact on my life and I don't think I can ever switch it to any other source of money.When I first started Bitcoin,I felt I was just wasting my time and energy,unknowingly to me that there were several things I didn't know,and uptill now,i've not known all about Bitcoin.But when I continue to make research about what I was doing,It was then I understood what Bitcoin is the king,that Bitcoin has the capability to change one from grass to grace,it was also then I knew i wasnt on the wrong  path.I got involved into it,and I can recommend anyone to switch to Bitcoin now,and there lifes will never remain the same.",

Bitcoin has been around for a very long time and has had a progressive reputation over the years, and in fact it was the right choice because Bitcoin is decentralized, and the level of risk found is unlike any other. besides, the level of popularity of Bitcoin is already very popular and worldwide in various countries.",

I chose it because it promoted values that I care about like privacy, having full control over your money, not being oppressed by the government who can threaten to freeze your accounts. I bought it because I felt it could be worth much more and I wasn't really into making a lot of money but I didn't want to lose it. Since I made money on this investment, I appreciate and value bitcoin. Bitcoin is a part of who I am financially and politically. IMO 10 years from now politicians will use it like a trading card. There are many such slogans that people are always for or against like abortion, or capital punishment and bitcoin is becoming one of them.

Satoshi created Bitcoin as an open source for everyone to take control of their funds in a digitalized approach instead of leaving our funds in the hands of financial elites, and today the Bitcoin price has skyrocketed and demand is so high compared to 2010 and 2021. Bitcoin still has a lot of years of halving left. Bitcoin still has more ATHs to come. All these reasons are why I chose Bitcoin, and I also fell in love with Satoshi's idea of being in total control of my funds, which is why I chose and will still choose Bitcoin over every other crypto. Investing in other assets without investing into Bitcoin is a risk for me.OP, people invest into Bitcoin, I mean a lot of people! but majority of these people still have others investment.",

The trust I mean is based on the power of bitcoin that can bring someone to the investment stage. Decentralization and the total supply of bitcoins are very limited, this also makes bitcoin have an advantage, so that the strength of maintaining investment value in the long term is guaranteed.There are many advantages that we find in investing in bitcoin and this is not found in other investment concepts, the level of price fluctuations is never separated from the journey of bitcoin and trust in bitcoin must be based on the benefits it offers and that is why many people trust bitcoin.",

Secondly, Bitcoin is trusted today simply because it has proven itself to be the safest place to save our funds for the future in it, that has great potential of going either 10x or 20x, far better than what banks now offer as  investment rate (i.e 5 to 15% annual investment profit)",
