Later I found it's blocked by defender and that file Trojan:Win32/Malgent!MTB was found. This is a less secure device so I removed it from Quarantine and TOR is working. On my secure device it's the same. TOR is not working for the same reason. In both device same problem. My question is what should I do in this situation. I don't want to risk my secure device but I need to use TOR there too. is it okay to do the same on that device too.Suggestions please.",

And if possible recover the important files and format your all drives. Because since malware is detected I think it's best to start all over again in that case. It will be better to run Tor again on the new operating system.",

If you are thinking of privacy and security, windows should probably be your least secure OS. Switch to Linux as soon as possible. Use windows for other less important activities like playing games. I don't know about windows, but I have never has such an issue with my Linux and… I don't need any Antivirus on my device because I don't click on malicious links or download suspicious apps aka Cracked premium apps.",

Your browser fingerprint includes everything unique about your browser, from what version it is, to what fonts it has installed, to what resolution you are running it in (which is why Tor opens in a window and you should not maximize it), to what extensions you have installed (which is why you should not install any extensions on Tor beyond those which come pre-installed), and so on. By using Tor, your fingerprint matches tens of thousands of other users and makes you impossible to track. By using a Brave, you probably have a unique fingerprint (or share with only a handful of other users) and therefore you are much easier to track.And then of course there is the issue with cookies, which Tor either refuses or deletes by default, while Brave will store and again will be used to track you. And all the other issues with Brave's awful privacy policy, ads, code injection, and more. Last I checked there was even code from Binance embedded in Brave!Looks like Microsoft have confirmed this was a false positive and have updated Windows Defender definitions: https://forum.torproject.org/t/torbrowser-12-5-6-no-longer-flagged-by-windows-defender/9522/. So you should be safe to update the definitions and then remove Tor from quarantine.",
