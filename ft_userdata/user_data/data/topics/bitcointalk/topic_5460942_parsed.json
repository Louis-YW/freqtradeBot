My point is what is the need to get into trouble or identify as a crypto currency user. For now, even if you use cold wallet without thinking about hardware wallet, may be it works ?",

Aside hardware wallets. I have read about how all this non custodian wallets like electrum wallet can work almost perfectly when air gapped, why not try that way instead and then if your country restrictions towards bitcoin lessens you can buy yourself a hardware wallet",

Although buying one could attract attention of authorities, but I'd say even that isn't very likely.As for how to buy it - ask people in your local community, every country is different in terms of international shipments.And remember, there's always an alternative way - using old PC or laptop as cold storage by never plugging it to the Internet and signing transactions offline.",

Also why would they still invest if they're from that country? Your money would be on deep sleep if ever the restriction won't be lifted by the government. Also, this technology is not the only investment option so don't push it here. Let's say you are able to invest, but how would you pull it out? Let us not be too optimistic, there'd be a time you'd need to pull your investment out. If you are still that eager, I guess electrum wallets would be enough to allow you from doing so. It just depends on the ctual situation whether it is toatally banned or just not supported by governments.",

Or if you have a friend outside that lives in a country wherein crypto is legal or at least government are crypto friendly then you can ask your friend to purchase it for you. But still, it's either your friend take the risk of bringing it into your country by concealing it, or you yourself going out of your country and you are the one carrying it when you come back.As for the hardware wallet, it's either,https://trezor.io/https://www.ledger.com/",

What thinks make you worried is if your Bitcoin assets are on an exchange and online wallet. Because if you have an asset where the country banned crypto then your asset on exchange and online wallet will be banned and frozen also. About hardware wallet, Now it's getting cheaper, you can choose a hardware wallet that many people use it. Or, if you don't enough money, you can use electrum where you can use it offline and save your key in anywhere.",

Now is there anyway to import a hardware wallet to any country where crypto currencies are illegal ?And one more things I wanna know that how can I chose a best budget friendly hardware wallet?  I would recommend you to go for a cold software based wallet instead of a hardware wallet because the software cold wallets are also very safe and one can use those without any issue. As far your cold wallet is not connected to internet your security is far higher than those hardware wallets, and in a country where Bitcoin is banned one should opt for software based wallet instead of hardware wallet. I suggest you to go with Electrum if you made your mind to go with a cold software wallet because this wallet is open-source, and is currently the best wallet most of the investors use. I'm quite sure that most Bitcoiners who use Electrum are very sure that this is the safest option when it's used as a cold wallet. I highly recommend you to go with this wallet instead of looking for a hardware wallet, and yes, you should still be careful because there can be legal problems for a citizen if he/she is doing something that's banned in a country. Do it at your own risk my friend!If you still want to go with a hardware wallet then try to build your own instead, and for that you can find many tutorials online which teach you that how you can built such a wallet yourself. I would recommend you to watch this video whose link I will post below because I think this video can be very helpful for you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeqP6oVnlIs",
