The user Cryptovator has changed its user name about two times. And I saw a thread where the users said their request was accepted in a short period of time. So those all depend on which ones are relevant.",

But I don't find that option in my account. Are there any specific requirements to change the username? or every legend account can do it?First, about changing usernames. You will have to be either a VIP members to change it or have to send a request to theymos and get his acceptance to change your username but you need to have good reasons like doxing to get approval.only moderators, Donators, and VIP members can change their names automatically. Other members should contact theymosIt's not possible. Just abandon it.How to edit my username?Second, about custom titles, it is another thing. It's custom deal like memoriam.Users with custom titlesTECHSHAREGleb Gamovparaipan",

Donation is back then for custom title and all of that not for change of Username. For change of Username Little Mouse already said above no special thing needed, just be contributive and have a good reason to why you want your name changed, then leave the rest to the admin to decide if it's good enough to approve your request or not.",

If no good reason for changing your username then I don't think it will be honored to change it that faster from Theymos. The customized title isn't something too special, they can still be panelized if found violating the rules they just like every other users here but different is just the indications as donators or VIP although it has some regards and respect seeing a titled man just as in a real world scenario.There are lot of guidelines share by few users above, I think you should followed them correctly to understand how it works.",

This is an unreasonable amountYes, it is a direct line but no longer used for a long time. The last donator is Claymore in 2017 and Claymore did that donation not to change username.Else, if you have reasons to change your username for privacy, you will get apporved and it is free.If it is because privacy, you will have both changes, username and display name.If it is for display reason only, you will have only display name change and your username will be the same.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMQ: I want to change my forum username. What should I do?A: You can either donate 50 BTC to become a VIP or PM theymos asking to change your username (although he rarely accepts such requests nowadays).Quote from: theymos on June 06, 2018, 05:24:34 PMQuote from: TheQuin on June 06, 2018, 01:19:43 PMMaybe they didn't donate 50 BTC but were gifted the VIP status because of their contribution to Bitcoin and the forum.Right. I posted about this somewhere when I did it.IIRC MagicalTux also got VIP without paying 50 BTC because he contributed significant resources in other ways.Quote from: theymos on January 10, 2020, 02:10:26 PMEach user has a display name, which is the only name ordinary users see, and a username, which is what you use to log-in with. Almost always, they are the same.If I change a name for reasons of appearance, then I only change the display name. The username remains reserved, the user can still login using the username, PMs can still be sent to that username, \"search member\" allows searching for the old username, etc.If I change a name for reasons of privacy, then I change both the username and the display name. In this case, it is possibly hazardous to reserve the old username, since it allows someone to test for the existence of that username, possibly defeating the privacy benefit. If you're worried about being impersonated, then simply don't seek to have your username changed.",

Even the prominent members sometimes find it hard to even get it approved most especially if the new name requested belongs a member.
