Quote from: General_Bitcoin on May 20, 2023, 10:33:35 AM Furthermore, I have part-time jobbed and can lose this any time just because of this now looking for full time is this OK or no? First it is a wrong thing to quit your job no matter how little it pays to focus on bitcoin or cryptocurrency trading. Trading is easier when theirs is another income come else where. With this you can be able trade with patience and not worry too much about losing because this could create panic. Since you already have some knowledge about trading them i would say your journey is a lot easier and only consistent practice could get you the experience to be much better.

I'll advise you to keep that part time job, since you're still testing how the market will be you've got no assurance through it. You can learn while working with it and that's why whether you've got full time or part time job and you want to sacrifice it, don't do that yet.

You are fortunate to have stumbled upon this topic because it has a wealth of information that can teach you a lot about bitcoin. But the forum has some rules governing it and you must abide by them so before thinking of any other thing I advise you get familiar with the rules. On different boards there are pinned threads where the rules are stated.

Trading isn’t that easy but with your experience I’m sure you must be knowledgeable to some extent. It doesn’t necessarily matter how much you invest in it, all that matters is that you know what you are doing and that you don’t invest the money you need later into trading. You can learn alot about trading on this forum which can make you grow into a successful trader.

Please give your ideas and views, hopefully someone will work for me and I will be able to have better things in life.As a full-time employment, bitcoin trading is not ideal and can be quite risky. it is not completely secure, despite what you may believe about your current earnings. Since cryptocurrency trading is extremely risky and uncertain, it is advised to have a stable paying job that can meet your demands. You never know when you will make a profit or when you will lose money that’s why it can’t be only source of income. Read carefully, pay attention, and ask questions when you need clarification, forum users will always be happy to assist you in learning the technical aspects of bitcoin.",

It is best if you choose a part-time job to support a living and this is much better when you hope to adjust to investing. Everyone should have a job in real life and investments also you can develop while working, it's more rational when you try to invest but you don't leave part time job and that's fine for me.Quote from: General_Bitcoin on May 20, 2023, 10:33:35 AMI am 31 years old with no technical education and have experience of accounting as this is my job so can be successful in this or no.

It is important to have awareness of the financial value that you have and if the money you have is not productive then it is not certain that you can manage a much better financial system in the future.You can invest even if you don't have to stop working and I suggest not leaving a part time job. If you are worried about losing your part-time job in the future, then you should learn how to invest properly and the monthly salary you earn can be set aside for investment. From your story I conclude that you are not new to investing as you have previously purchased Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. My advice is to put more money in bitcoin compared to Litecoin and Ethereum.",

Forum are not offices, nor are they places to get a full time job to make money consistently. You should own a business instead of just hoping for one source of income, but if one day you manage to grow well and become a useful user then you have the potential to make money on forum through signature campaign or whatever your other skills are.You should also consider trading and investing as a high risk activity, it will never guarantee you the returns you expect. Be careful with any offers that are tempting and promise big returns in short term, it is a ponzi scheme and you have to get used to learning new things before making a decision.Quote from: General_Bitcoin on May 20, 2023, 10:33:35 AMI am 31 years old with no technical education and have experience of accounting as this is my job so can be successful in this or no.

You should consider the financial implications and the uncertainties that come along with it. Make sure you have a solid plan, backup funds, and consider seeking advice from professionals or experienced traders who can guide you.

But since you had no bakcground on others might as well to catch some since its important to gain some experience or atleast apply for a company.  You dont find jobs here but just knowledge and using that might get you something anywhere.
