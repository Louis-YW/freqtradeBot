      "body": "sorry for your loss but this is why you or anyone should never make a transaction online with someone without an escrow, especially if they are not reputable. also, it is always suspicious when someone tries to sell a verified account to someone. I hope this incident would be a lesson to you to be more cautious when transacting with someone.quoting this for visibilityQuote",

If that happened after the deal was done then it happened when you were in the possession of the account.I am not taking the side of the account seller but technically he gave you a clean account. I really don't understand why anyone needs to buy an account at the first place?By the way what is WolfCould?A quick search gives me amazon links. university links and says something about wolfwill LOLLOL I got this thing wrong.",

      "body": "Sorry about the loss of the money, but;1. Why are you buying a hetzner account in the first place, yet you can create your own and verify it using your own accurate data?2. Why are you not using a trusted escrow service for such deals?You should have it at the back of your mind that people who sell such types of accounts probably obtained them illegally or even hacked into someone's account. You can't tell me someone comes in the forum here and sells 10 \"verified\" accounts, and they are all his and legally created.",

      "body": "This situation is really hard as we don't know who's the liar and honest person, each other will keep arguing their own opinion. I don't find the seller have previously scammed other user and he's not creating a self moderated topic, so I don't feel the seller has suspicious activity. As the @OP, the proof is still not enough to convince me, there's still a chance if he's lying too.I will not draw any conclusion in this case, it's still unclear.",
