First of all it is actually the transaction fees of the bitcoin network that is increase or let me at is high due to the congestion of the mempool but not the transaction time that has increased. Although the default time to mine a transaction is 10 minutes there is no definite time as to when a block is been mined. Even as we get this congestion of mempool the blocks are mined within 1 minutes or less. So there is no actual time but to get your transaction into the next block you will need to pay a higher fee at the moment to compete others. Not withstanding the current fee saga has actually projected something like a challenge to the bitcoin network and the need to look for a viable solution to this growing congestion which to me doesn’t look good to use bitcoin as a means of payment. But just like satoshi said it is an alternative payment method so at critical times like this it is not bad to use other means convenient and secure to you, hopeful the devs will do something about this problem.",

So we can say the transaction time is actually increasing when the block confirmation time is not definite.",

I think if this continues it will make bitcoin unviable medium of exchange.What do we think??Bitcoin has repeatedly demonstrated its unsuitability as digital electronic money used for daily use for the purchase of goods and services. At the current cost of this, buying a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer will be expensive due to high transaction fees, and you will also have to wait a while for the transaction to be confirmed. Would you be willing to wait 30 minutes or so for a cup of coffee?Bitcoin has long moved away from its original concept and turned into a speculative investment instrument that is unlikely to be used as electronic money. Institutional investors have been in this area for a long time, which means they will not easily give up the high returns generated in the cryptocurrency industry. Therefore, there will be no outflow of large capital, there will be no decrease in the capitalization of bitcoin, which means that the cost of btc will not fall, but on the contrary, it will only grow. Well, in this regard, commissions will remain high and will only grow. After all, they still want bitcoin at a price of 1 million, right? Now imagine what the transactions will be like at this rate. It's terrible to even imagine.If a technical solution is not found to reduce fees and transaction processing time, that is, the improvement of bitcoin itself, then in the near future there will be further problems with the congestion of the BTC-network.",

It is all because of an ongoing attack known as Ordinals. You can find a lot of topics about it already. In short: Someone found an exploit in how nodes verify transactions and created a method to use that exploit to inject arbitrary data into the blockchain.  Then they created a fake market where they scam people by selling them the transactions containing \"arbitrary data\" by lying to them and calling them \"tokens\" or \"NFTs\".  That market has created the incentive for regular users to join in this attack and create a lot of the same transactions using the exploit so that they can participate in the ongoing scam market. That has created an artificial network congestion and fee rise.Quote from: Eldestyoung on December 30, 2023, 02:59:19 AMI think if this continues it will make bitcoin unviable medium of exchange.Unfortunately that can be true and this attack will continue until the exploit is fixed.The only good news is that despite what your title says, this is not a feature of bitcoin. This is just an attack using an exploit that is fixable.",

For some reason after summer the popularity dispersed for Ordinals but eventually came back and clogged the mempool again at the end of the year.Now you can still get a transaction confirmed for less than $25, especially if you use segwit.",

If you need it for transactions - you can use lightning, but I prefer simply using altcoins for stuff like this.Well, it can't be helped as we do transactions based on bitcoin, or some are earning through bitcoin or making payments through bitcoin, so there are many transactions happening in a day, so even if they treat bitcoin as an asset, it still can't be helped to make a transfer in a day because that's what we do. But the thing is, in these days, the transaction fee is too expensive and the waiting time is getting longer, so what we can only do is wait until the fees are lowered and the transaction will be faster. That's how bitcoin works; it indicates that many people are using bitcoin, and that's why the transactions are being congested. Using altcoins for transactions is also not bad; it is in fact an alternative, but instead of altcoins, why not try using stable fiat currencies like USDT if there is a transaction needed to be done? Bitcoin should not be touched in these days because the fees are too expensive.",

The ordinals are one of the worst attacks on the Bitcoin network and that's the main cause of huge fees but the developers are working day and night to find a better solution to cope with those ordinals and once the ordinals issue is solved then we may again be able to get our transactions confirmed within few minutes by paying less fees. Another thing you didn't noticed is that people are now considering Bitcoin more as an asset to hold for long-term instead of a day to day P2P solution that it was intended to be but we can't ignore the fact that still there are a group of people who use Bitcoin for day to day payments and it's working fine for them. I know they might be paying higher fees due to network congestion caused by ordinals but they're still getting confirmed transactions if they're willing to pay higher fees in such times. I hope the Bitcoin network will have less congestion when the ordinals issue is solved but meanwhile you can purchase it as an asset for long-term holding without any issue.",
