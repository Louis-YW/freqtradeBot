  "content": "The DreamLeague Season 19 will officially start later, the tournament consist of 16 teams. 5 of it from Western Europe, 3 of it from North America and two teams each from Eastern Europe, South America, China and Southeast Asia.  Group stage 1 will begin later and it is a single round robin. The winner of this match will be immediately qualifies to Riyadh Masters 2023 and the price pool is $1,000,000. This kind of  tournament is really unique because of its prize pool and a lot of strong teams are now looking at the prize.The invited teams are:Code:Gaimin GladiatorsTundra EsportsTeam LiquidEntityOGShopify RebellionNounsTSMTalon EsportsExecrationEvil GeniusesBeastcoastTeam Spiritex-HellRaisersTeam Aster Nigma GalaxyIt is so sad for the chinese fans that PSG.LGD won't be able to participate in DreamLeague s19 due to Visa Issues, the Midlaner of the Shopify Rebellion which is Abed cannot also participate because of Visa issue also.Last night there is a news that ATF has been moved to inactive roster and Miracle will take its place. There is a high chance that we can see that the Nigma Galaxy will be strong in this tournament but anyway there are more strong teams. I actually bet in outright which is ex-Hellraisers where ramzees and solo play in. Their chemistry is good even though there team is newly formed and the odds are high which is 44 odds. As for my predictions; the teams that will dominate the tournament are: Talon Esports, GG, Liquid, ex-hellraisers and Nigma Galaxy. Who do you think will be the champion in this tournament?",

      "body": "The match is about to start :Gladiators vs Ex-HellraisersTeam Aster vs Evil GeniusesOf the 4 teams that will compete, I predict Gladiator and Team Aster will win.For Team Aster they have very strong players and if you look at last year's TI match Aster was able to place 4th in Dota 2 TI 2022.Meanwhile, EG was only able to rank 9th in Dota 2 TI last year.This is what makes my prediction a little sure that Aster will qualify for the next round with a truce from BoBoka.As for the Gladiators' prediction, they were one of the winning teams in the last Lima Major matches and managed to beat Team Liquid.The strength of my mind is getting stronger if the Gladiators will win this match.Even though my prediction is only limited to seeing the previous matches, I only believe that Tundra Esport will win the DreamLeague Season 19.",

Hellraisers were able to sweep their opponents in EEU in their last DPC tour. Though they are now ex-HR, they are still the same roster that swept EEU. Team Liquid is still a strong contender so as are the other WEU teams like GG, Tundra, and OG. This will be a tough tournament since it has a decent prize pool but the real prize here is getting qualified for Riyadh Masters which has a 15M prize pool. I bet all the teams are eyeing for that. Stake does not have lines opened for this tournament. Where do you make your bets?",

We have 12 hours difference, so maybe stake picked it up already. Anyway, there are too many games going on at once so we have a lot of chances to make bets and make money. I'll bet later on Team Liquid, Tundra and Team Spirit later. These teams have higher chance of winning over their respective opponents.",
