Do you agree?There is much more to learn about Poker, which means it requires skills too, but that does not mean it is not also a game of luck. All are games of luck. Gambling generally is luck, but we have to gamble responsibly because of house edge.",

To think luck was just a coincidence on game of skills, I think it's not, luck comes to those who mostly take the chances just to win.",

I can see why you favor the game of chance but we can agree to disagree on this. I choose the other side even if it's done online since the player still has more options available to him. He can choose to add one more card or just decide to settle. He could also split pairs when given the opportunity. Those kind of decision making involved in the game makes me think it's more of a game of skills.",

Or putting a lot of card in the deck so that it will be hard for you to count the cards.So Baccarat, there is no strategy, either Banker or Player, or Draw.Poker, require skills, there's already a pro circuit in the US with millions of dollars as winning price.Slots? we all know that answer to that.",

Do you agree?All type of gambling is a game of chance or else it is not gambling anymore. Poker is commonly categorized as game of skills because you can increase your chance of winning to optimum level if you have skills since you are up against other players and not the house but it doesn’t mean that it’s not a game of chance. There’s some point on the poker which you will rely purely on chances of hitting the right card to win so there’s no guarantee that you will win even if you have a skills unless you are playing with bunch of newbies that is scared on you.I believe Blackjack can be categorized as game of skills too on some table that doesn’t have continuous shuffling deck because card count can increase your chance of winning like the poker scenario.In conclusion, even if the game is heavily relying on skills to win. We can’t ignore the fact that you still need luck on side to win and this is when chances needs to be on your side.",

Only few gamblers play poker flawlessly and the rest is just giving money to the better player.I’d rather play slots that purely rely on luck rather than poker which I don’t have any chance of winning. Atleast on slot I have a chance to hit huge win by just spinning without any effort to think on how to beat other players.",
