  "content": "The digital currency business is worth around $1.5 trillion today. I predict that in 10 years it will be worth 10 times what it is today: 15 trillion dollars.The question everybody here needs to ask themselves is: do you want to be part of that future, or not?Getting to $15 trillion is going to require different thinking than the original Bitcoin and crypto community is used to. This is a future where almost all citizens in the developed world posses digital currencies that they use for both daily payments and longer-term speculation. One where there is a vibrant market for thousands of meme currencies, and memes come and go with fashion every year.And it's a world were consumers find a safe and easy and convenient mechanism for buying into the latest meme or an established name like Bitcoin.Many in the business today are going to find the requirements of \"mainstream\" consumers baffling, annoying, or even infuriating. What you thought was good will be bad, and what you thought was bad will be good. In this future, players in the digital currency market will either evolve or get left behind. Bitcoin has its roots in the cyberpunk-libertarianish-grey-market-quasi-criminal realm. It's a fascinating, tantalizing, exciting realm for several million people around the world.But it's also terrifying for several billion people around the world, who aren't interested in risking their life savings to things that are unsafe and untested and clunky. And they have no interest in fighting their government, or doing something that could be considered illegal.The blockchain architecture was designed around the notion of perhaps dozens of transactions per second, and was made to be intentionally slow and expensive. In the future, there will be millions of digital currency transactions per second worldwide, and tens of billions of transactions per day. There will need to be other architectures besides blockchain to handle that.The original crypto community hated the government, and hates any concept of regulations. They started their movement as explicitly \"anti-government\". Average consumers love regulations and government protections because it makes things safe for them without needing to think about it.The original crypto community focused on changing the world and ending the idea of central banks and central governments.  Average consumers want their Social Security check to come when they retire, and they like the protection from crime their government gives them.The original crypto community fought against things like centralized stores of your assets--not your keys, not your coins, they said. Average consumers want their wealth to be stored in a financial institution, because they want to pay somebody else to guard it, not hide it on their own person. Average consumers want their small transactions to occur without an exchange of identity--like what digital currencies give them; but they want their big money stored in their own name so it's safe.In short, the $15 trillion dollar future is about digital currency going after the mainstream of people in a hurry, people in other professions besides technology, people who don't care about politics or cyberpunk lore, people who are happy with the status quo of their job, their bank and their government.This future won't be for everybody, and there is already quite a large market--today's $1.5 trillion--for those who do not want to evolve to divide up. The $15 trillion dollar market will be for those who are willing to think outside of their technical, ideological and political bubble--and embrace the mainstream.",

It is designed to be secure and require PoW to add new blocks to the chain, making it immutable as layers and layers of blocked are stacked on each other. It was designed to keep transactions at an average duration and the fees are determined by the network.Quote from: legiteum on August 13, 2024, 06:05:27 AMThe original crypto community focused on changing the world and ending the idea of central banks and central governments.  Average consumers want their Social Security check to come when they retire, and they like the protection from crime their government gives them.You are including your own rhetoric here. Bitcoiners do not want to end the idea of central banks or governments and replace that. We just want an outlet to the system. Bitcoiners are also still part of the system and pay taxes so get every protection the government gives.Quote from: legiteum on August 13, 2024, 06:05:27 AMThe original crypto community fought against things like centralized stores of your assets--not your keys, not your coins, they said. Average consumers want their wealth to be stored in a financial institution, because they want to pay somebody else to guard it, not hide it on their own person. If decentralization is not for you, you have a choice of almost every existing system in the world to choose from, surely the one truely decentralized system doesn't need to change for you to have \"another\" centralized institution. There's a bank down your street, use that.Quote from: legiteum on August 13, 2024, 06:05:27 AMAverage consumers want their small transactions to occur without an exchange of identity--like what digital currencies give them; but they want their big money stored in their own name so it's safe.Use CBDCs or one of the altcoins that has instant transactions.",

In that case, Bitcoin is likely to cost around $600k, and I don't think that's unfathomable.But as for the rest, I believe we shouldn't dwell too much on what Bitcoin used to be like or what the early crypto community was like. Honestly, I think that with that antigovernmental sentiment, Bitcoin wouldn't have reached its current heights, and the crypto market would have remained tiny. It's bridging the gap and a lot of interest in Bitcoin as an investment that brought us to $1.5 trillion market capitalization, and it's more of the same approach that can bring us to $15 trillion, in my opinion.Perhaps you're making the same point, op, but I'm not sure about that.",

Yesterday some people thought that way too but today they are using bitcoin as an alternative means for their savings again inflation.I sternly believe that curiosity and  knowledge is what raises people's interest in getting involve in anything which would mean that the lack of interest of the billions of persons in the world that are yet to embrace the bitcoin idea are doing so out of ignorance with a lack of curiosity base on whatever fallacy they would have been fed by the anti-bitcoinists but what is certain is that in as much as bitcoin continue to exist to many more decades to come a lot of those folks would eventually gain an interest. To perception that taking an interest into bitcoin is akin to fighting the government is laughable and entails in brighter view the extend of their ignorance. Bitcoin is but an alternative digital currency with it's own blockchain (transparent for all to view) independent of the trust system of centralized finance. Maybe the absence of control on bitcoin by the government is what you're referring referring to fighting the government, but when does making for an alternative becomes a fight?",

There's a bank down your street, use that.Bank transactions, including credit card transactions require an exchange of personal information. Most consumers don't want that for small transactions (whereas they very much want this for large transactions so they can be protected by the government---this is a phenomenon I call Anon Paradox--that people want anonymity for \"small\" money and personal identity for \"big\" money).Quote from: anarkiboy on August 13, 2024, 07:07:06 AMDid you do a public survey ? if not, then your claim has zero value.My evidence is the way most people use crypto today, which is through an app or broker that stores their account centrally using their personal identity. Consumers are voting with their feet on this one. Whereas many here, brave people and early adopters, are content to hide their life savings in a proverbial floor safe, most people keep their life savings in a financial institution under their own name. QuotePeople who own substantial amounts of money want privacy. They don't want anyone, including government to know how much they've got. I did not make survey because it's written in history of banking, Swiss accounts back in the day and other safe haven places today are a proof that people value privacy the most when it comes to storing their wealth.Yes, they want privacy, but you are talking about two kinds of \"privacy\" here, and they are very different:1. Privacy from criminals, marketers, other citizens, the media, and their friends: this is the kind of privacy everybody wants.2. Privacy from their government such that they can safely engage in illegal activity: this is the kind of privacy that very few people want.While there is certainly a small (percentage-wise) market for people who want to evade their government, my thesis, based on, well, the history of banking, is that most people don't want that kind of trouble--a \"Swiss bank account\" is almost synonymous with somebody doing shady things, which is why such accounts had never been more than 1% of the money stored in banks. 99% of people aren't interested in going up against their government.And look, I get it, most here would say that those 99% of people are wrong and that they really should fear their government, and so on. I voted for Ron Paul for president before many here were even alive. I get the ideology. But that's not the reality of the average developed-world consumer--but that consumer is the force that will get us to $15T. The \"Swiss bank account\" market is finite, and I think it's fair to say that it's saturated now. Growth is going to come from the mainstream, not doubling down on the fringes.Quote from: letteredhub on August 13, 2024, 07:14:05 AMWhere do you place those ardent bitcoiners from the developing world that currently makes up the whole bitcoin ecosystem today. Because for what it is not only the developed world that makes up that $1.5 trillion valued of digital currency in today's world. You are absolutely right, and I probably used the wrong terminology here. Digital currency is a value for all consumers, no matter where they live.QuoteMaybe the absence of control on bitcoin by the government is what you're referring referring to fighting the government, but when does making for an alternative becomes a fight?Almost no product you use on the internet is \"controlled by the government\". If you use a VPN, it's controlled by the private VPN company, not the government.What I mean by \"fighting the government\" is people who wish to hide their money from the government should that government inquire into their finances. In other words, people who are interested in breaking the law in some fashion, usually for tax evasion.Most people don't want to do that, and my thesis here is that the way we will get to $15T is by addressing the 90% of the market who just want to trade anonymously and safely with their fellow citizens and want to speculate on memes.",

[...]Even in the bitcoin rainbow chart theory, the lowest price we will get in 2028 (4 years away) per 1 bitcoin is around $161,678 [1]. This price creates more than 2 times the current market capitalization, so it is realistic to see $15 Trillion in the next 10 years even at bitcoin's depressed price. My calculations are still calculations with a small level of hope, i can't imagine how big the market capitalization of bitcoin + altcoins will be in the future if we find crypto becoming mainstream in the future.[1] https://www.blockchaincenter.net/en/bitcoin-rainbow-chart/",
