This person has already not assembled his cabinet and has begun governing. It raises concerns about whom they are consulting with when making crucial policies. The price of fuel has risen to 500 naira, and today's newspapers are reporting the devaluation of the national currency. Inflation has reached its peak, putting immense pressure on the people. However, instead of taking measures to alleviate this situation, their first course of action is to exacerbate it further. The issue of subsidies is pervasive, as acknowledged by the NLC executives. It appears that the primary objective of this Government is to increase the size of their own wealth accumulation, plain and simple!",

We Nigerians are tired of the hardship wey the politicians don cause us. No be every new government wey we go d experience another level of sufferness. Make things better for the country kwalu. Em no go be bad thing if it does for a whole tenure. Only Tinubu few days in office, petroleum product don hike throughout the federation because of the removal of fuel subsidy without any solutions put in place before that.",

I like the idea say him dey try new things wey the previous governments dem never try. Worst part e no work den to go back to a system wey no dey work since. Abi una no hear say Cameroon dey protest subsidy wey Tinubu commot for Nigeria. As I see the news the thing just weak me, e mean say Tinubu no been dey joke when him talk say we just dey subsidized fuel for other African countries dey suffer our own. Signs already dun dey should say we dey in good hands.Sha make we no dey too quick to judge am because na so Buhari government start, everything been dey go smoothly but in the next tenure na so yawa just gaz. You know say when something dun too bad, the next person just get dey receive praises even when dem no do anything. As the country dun bad so, anybody fit enter the seat and make the country breath small air because no how dem wan worst past the last administration.

Many of our leaders was scared that the 4 Republic will not succeed like others, and they allowed bad eggs take advantage of their absent and Dominate the 4 Republic.  Obasanjo took the advantage and became president,  he brought his old friends into politics,  till date they are still running leadership in this country,  our best brain has no option than to work as slave to them.

So Tinubu isn't different from the rest.In digress, cryptocurrency has existed under the governance of few past regimes now and which of the past government has frustrated the crypto industry like this Tinubu regime does?If he truly had the good intentions on the masses particularly on the youths as said, he'd had considered how lucrative cryptocurrencies has been a means establishing and empowering this same youths but yet he came forth battling with the same empowerment crypto industry in distabilizing the good returns the same youths makes out of the technology.So, nothing good is promising with this government yet and I don't know what border you mean the government has opened for operations as per said.",
