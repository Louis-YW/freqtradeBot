I haven't heard about them in a while, the last time I checked they have no volume on exchanges anymore..The main issue must be such very high APY will give big inflation. I will personally said that if the most risky investment for now. If you can't get out once it was getting listed and then it will be going down slowly but bottom may be reached very soon. You must see how inflation has been ruining the price for helena token. It's like a pump and dump token with no utility on it.",

Why do i say this? staking itself leads to more tokens in circulation; thereby causing inflation on the long term which leads token to dump mercilessly on the market. Now if you have a very high apy, it means more tokens will be released into circulation even more quickly which will inadvently cause more selling pressure from investors or stake farmers, as an investor; you need a strategic module to scale through the staking process in profits",

I have been in many chains BSC, OKT, KCC, Dogechain, etc. And all of them were doing the exact thing, creating A project and then dump. Afterward, they create another project with a different name.The cycle is just like that, they are exploiting peoples' greed to make money and it worked.",

Who invests with those APYs and it's likely the devs and a few early investors will be the ones to enjoy that high APY.But the rest that will get into those projects that offer too much APY are the ones that will suffer because as soon as the devs and the others have already taken their exit, you'll see the value of the project itself falls even if there's that much apy.",

The fact that almost all of tokens offering non sense APY like that will be alive only for a few months and then after people have been dumping their tokens from daily staking and then they will be moving away to the another project. This is how crypto market works right now. I think that you can understand this correctly. You must remember that if this was based on the fact happened in the market",

The returns are very high, take the money of the latter to pay for the former and projects like this usually don't last long. They are projects that are labelled as scams from the very beginning and only those who are greedy, do not want to do anything and want money will accept to invest in them.",

I expect a tragic ending story for that project and losses for the investors. We'd rather stay away from this and put our money into the projects that we have some assurance, unlike this HIYP that will cause us losses.

How they gonna pay for all of that and still sustain in the market with high volumes? It’s not possible, any project has multiple wings which needs to be pampered with financial support otherwise the project will end up in junkyard.
