Is he playing by the rules, unleashing the biggest and bloodiest war since World War II with the goal of capturing a neighboring state, where about forty thousand shells are now fired every day?All states are now experiencing difficult economic times. Great Britain will survive this period too. The question is, will Russia survive them or will it disintegrate into a number of small republics?",

Therefore, I do not think that you are presenting realistic data despite the abundance and availability of this data.The only evidence is that armed conflicts will reduce the concept of globalization and make the world a small village of concepts where every individual in society tries to appear better at the expense of others.It is true that the global economy is affected, but it is still resilient, and I hope that nothing will happen to it because countries will resort to zero-sum options.",

For example China, Russia, Japan, USA, and India also. After the end of the Cold in the early ''90s and the disintegration of the USSR, a treaty was signed between the White House and Moscow in which Russia wanted the US will not to expand towards the Russian boundaries now you can see that through NATO they are expanding towards Russia and the aggression of Russia towards Ukraine is the chain of this treaty that US voilate the agianst the treaty. In the case of Great Britain, they are nowadays going through an economic crisis not only in Britain but the whole of Europe because they are running on the Gas and petroleum of Russia as they did not support Russia in the Ukraine invasion Russia closed the pipeline. But there are no worries whether today or after a day the UK will find any alternative and they have but they are so far from them. The other European countries are fine a little because they have found an alternative but the UK is fully dependent on Russia. There is a way the UK will improve its diplomatic relations with Spain and Morocco be they will provide them the gas and petroleums.",

No agreements were ever signed between the USSR/Russia and NATO, including the United States, on the non-expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe. Some Russian officials, including President Putin, state that such an agreement, reached in one form or another between the USSR/Russia and the USA in the late 1980s and early 1990s, was oral. However, leaders of the NATO alliance believe that no such promises were made and that such a decision can only be made in writing. The NATO Alliance has always officially adhered to the principle of “open doors” to new NATO members.The Soviet Union did not receive written guarantees about the non-expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe, just as the post-Soviet Russian Federation did not receive them. Thus, we can only talk about the presence or absence of an informal agreement.The demand to “roll back” the military unification within the 1997 borders, that is, before the extensions in 1999 and 2004, was put forward at the end of 2021 in Russia’s large-scale military unification in Ukraine in 2022. However, Russia's defense in Ukraine led to the opposite consequences. Sweden and Finland applied to join NATO last year, and on April 4, 2023, Finland became the 31st NATO member. With regard to Sweden, consent has not been received only from Turkey and Hungary.After Russia's military failures and receiving a 1,300-kilometer border with Finland as a NATO member, Russia no longer puts forward any demands for NATO non-expansion.",

And it is called this: the West often \"turns a blind eye\" to \"convenient or favorable\" bastard regimes. If in 2000 Russia had been \"smeared\" by the whole world for the slaughter in independent Ichkeria, there would be no PMR, Abkhazia, DNR, DMR and many other points of terror in the world. Some people of course think that Russia is such a European, civilized country, albeit with a few \"oddities\". Some in both Europe and the U.S. have a direct benefit from Russia. That is why they have been pretending that \"nothing is happening\" since 2000. The affairs of Russia will somehow be sorted out, but don't break our money-making scheme.  I would like to hope that in 2022, the world will UNDERSTAND that Russia is a country of terror, a country of lawlessness, a country of criminals, a country with which any agreements are worthless.... Because first the USA and Britain, and then Europe suddenly realized that if Russia destroys Ukraine - further on its way will be \"stable, relaxed Europe\", which does not want a World War to roll through it again. A new world war. But there are still idiotic thoughts in the heads of many world politicians - \"let's negotiate\". No, you can't negotiate with a cancerous tumor! Rashism is a cancerous tumor of the modern world. And we, Ukrainians, do not want to die, replacing complex treatment with attempts to \"talk to the tumor\".",

They dream of regaining the “greatness of the Russian Empire” and the “greatness of the USSR,” but not by creating a powerful, progressive state, but by conquering and linking to Muscovy (as Russia is actually called) the territories of all former republics, Finland, parts of Poland and others.\" primordially Russian territories.\" just a year and a half ago, they boasted of their bravado - “yes, the West will be afraid to even utter a word against us, otherwise we will wipe out everyone on the face of the earth with a nuclear strike, and no one will stop us or respond.” Understand a simple thing, preferably by first listening to Russian propaganda, the so-called “Russian world” is a cancer of today’s world. Do you want a metastasis like the DPR/PMR/LPR/Abkhazia/... negotiate with them, come to an agreement, do business... But these metastases will soon be in your country...If you want to live peacefully, qualitatively and humanly - help fight this brown plague of the 21st century - sanctions, pressure, isolation, help to destroy the army of terrorists!",

The Ukrainian Armed Forces managed to hit it while it was moving, and the railway cars exploded and burned while still moving.Oh, you're still here? When joining the glorious AFU on the Eastern front? Your Motherland needs you!   I guess we don't deserve to know the sources of this info? If you can't provide the source, just write there that it appeared in your dream...  Anyway, regarding the BS you're posting here: AFU were close to Tokmak (10-15km) already back in August! So it means there's no moving forward. Russian defence lines are located near the village of Rabotyne, that's where the AFU is now, so it's not even confirmed they pierced the first line of defence, just barely reached it. Which means the whole counter-offensive is a failure, leading to catastrophic loss of life. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers were destroyed in this useless bloodbath. Oh, and btw, artillery range is much further than 12-16km so AFU can actuallly reach Tokmak from the area of Robotyne of even further away.",

In Ukraine, people are one of the highest values. Yes, our soldiers also die, but they defend their country from terrorists, and they are not forced to break through, simply because they need to create a “positive picture.” There is a slow, systematic destruction of terrorists virtually along the entire front. Yes, it’s difficult, but the goals are achieved.Another indicator is that there is no regular mass mobilization in Ukraine. Unlike the country with the “second army of the world”, where its under-fuhrer has already signed a new order on a new open mobilization, and is also collecting criminals from all prisons for the Wagner PMC, deceiving himself with the hope of salvation And some news from a terrorist country:- “We are in slavery here.” At one of Gazprom's largest fields, wage delays and worker riots began- The authorities classified Putin’s decree on the mandatory sale of foreign currency earnings and the list of exporters- The Russian Federation’s reserves decreased over the week due to revaluation by $5.6 billion to $562.8 billion- Gazprom reported a record-breaking collapse in gas productionhttps://deepstatemap.live/#12/47.4642/35.8254",
