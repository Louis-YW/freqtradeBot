Bitstarz Trust Page: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=307265Quote from: Heyui67 on July 11, 2023, 06:10:39 PMI want to withdraw before I ilose everything but they refuseIf I don't wager will i lose deposit amount??This is scam I didn't request that bonus Is there no option to forfeit the bonus on their bonus page? Their bonus ToS is indeed scammy if they doesn't allowed to withdraw while you already wager x4 of your deposit. Also bonus should be automatically forfeited once the bonus amount is already loses. Use trusted casino next time.Typically, I ask for proof but since the casino reputation involved is negative reputation here, Asking for proof doesnâ€™t make sense.",

Here is the terms of BitStarz no deposit bonus:Quote from: https://www.bitstarz.com/bonus-terms-and-conditionsIn addition, no winnings accrued in connection with any Free Bonus may be withdrawn/transferred until the wagering requirements have been met.)And here is the terms of the deposit bonus:Quote from: https://www.bitstarz.com/termsBefore fulfilling the bonus turnover conditions if you transfer or withdraw the main deposit amount, bonus funds and all winnings from this bonus will be forfeited.For the no deposit bonus, you aren't allowed to withdraw without completing the wagering requirement (you have taken this bonus). And for the deposit bonus, you are allowed to withdraw your deposited funds. But they will forfeit your winnings. You should ask their support whether they will allow you to withdraw the deposited funds only or not (for the no deposit bonus).",

I thought that the no deposit bonus should be completely separate from the deposit you made and wagering requirement for the two should be different.I also slightly blame you for not reading the terms of service and also the reviews about the casino. They have a very bad reputation in this forum alone, that should have given you more than enough information not proceed and use the casino.What made you sign up for Bitstarz among all the casinos around?",

Their scam casino platform has a rating of 4.5 out of 5. They write these fake and positive reviews to trap and mislead players and to make their reputation look as pure as water.First and foremost, the OP shouldn't have relied on a single source in making the decision to deposit money and play at any casino he came across or heard about; there are a lot of scam casinos out there that look legit. I hope he contacts their support and also writes his case on Trustpilot and attaches the link of this thread so he might find from them a solution to withdraw his deposit if they find that the OP poses a danger to the false reputation that they are building and understands from them how things will go.[1] https://www.trustpilot.com/review/bitstarz.com",
