Pogba will be support Dusan, Morata and Dybala on front. He will support the half-back also. But only if he changes not to be selfish again. In between 2 weeks, Pogba will medical check-up with a free transfer and sign in 3 years contract. Is Pogba will be the same person in 2014?, Allegri is at his coach at that time.",

We know in the last session Juventus did not reinforce Ronaldo who move to MU, so make their strength is reduced, and lost their prestige, which means unstable. But for the next session, I felt it was different Juventus is beginning to revive when Pogba is already in the squad, on another side, Dusan already found his best performance in Juventus, he was the soul of Ronaldo as a suitable substitute.",

So, in the next match they have to care about the opponent, On Napoli's side, Lazio must keep Khvicha Kvaratskhelia to don't move in the forward area, because that winger is very high performance. while in Lazio side, Napoli must focus on Milinkovic to not move to the center area.",

      "body": "There are interesting things if we talk about the competitive map of the team that excels in the Italian League Serie A this season, we remember that in 2021 ago Inter Milan won the Serie A champion at that time, many question whether history will repeat itself for the Inter Milan team, of course it is still a mystery, but something that could happen considering Inter are still adding to their strength in the Italian league Serie A this season, seeing striker Romelu return from Chelsea.I also see AC Milan not standing still this season, adding strength to defend their title in the Italian league Serie A, By bringing in striker Divock from Liverpool, I believe that if Inter Milan & AC Milan met in the league this time, it could be something extraordinary in the Italian league this season.Napoli & Juventus also have to be wary of in the Italian Serie A league this season, overall these two teams are also a serious threat in the 2022/23 season, they are also doing the same thing to bring in the best players to defend in the league this season.For now, I can only conclude that these four teams, have a good chance in the Italian league Serie A this year.",

So until this session is over, we have much time to guess. Napoli is enough consistent where got the winning versus Milan, They have the same point with Atalanta. but they have to actually worry with Udinese where have 5 winning in the row",

Now they are spreading rumours such as he can be Milan's next manager. However I don't think it will happen either. Mourinho should choose his next team wisely. He has a traditional system depending on defending. Milan are rather an attacking team as you know.  Mourinho rejected Saudi Arabia offer once while he was managing Roma. But now maybe he could find that option reasonable for himself, what do you think?",

He has a traditional system depending on defending. Milan are rather an attacking team as you know.  Serie A is not a favorite league with Mourinho and so far he has managed clubs in Portuguese League, Premier League, La Liga, Serie A and only two big leagues in Europe he has yet experienced, Bundesliga and Ligue 1. Ligue 1 seems to be not attractive with Mourinho and Bundesliga is only above Ligue 1 a little bit.His main target recent years is a coach position of Portugal national team and I believe he will continue to add a special term in his contracts with any club in future, that he will be free to end the contract to take a job from Portugal national team. Milan, Inter Milan or Napoli might not be favorite destinations for Mourinho in next one or two years.QuoteMourinho rejected Saudi Arabia offer once while he was managing Roma. But now maybe he could find that option reasonable for himself, what do you think?Mourinho rejected offers from clubs in Saudi Arabia a few times and it seems he is not interested in that league and money there. It can be changed when he becomes older and feels like he has very last years for coach management job, he might take a good offer from clubs in Saudi Professional League, to get an extra big money for retirement.",

Thuram was able to score a brilliant goal on 82nd minutes to put Inter on the lead.Unfortunately, Besseck handball inside Inter box stole all three points from Inter as a penalty was given and it was an opportunity for Genoa to equalize the second goal scored by Thuram.

Genoa instead gave us a surprise when made the first goal on minute 20. it's always tradition if depending champion does not always create a win in the first match. Maybe because Inter are looking for new strategies and situations so that it is not easy for opponents to read like previous session, and I think it's normal, but if Inter continues like this in the next match, I think the trophy for this session they won't take it again.

But it would indeed be very disappointing if Inter Milan were really made helpless by Genoa and his ability is just like that, I also think he will not get it again this season, but you have to calm down, it's early in the season, there is still plenty of time to make better changes.",
