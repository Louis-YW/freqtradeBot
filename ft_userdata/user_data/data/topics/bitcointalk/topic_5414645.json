  "content": "So many folks have tried to claim they are him. Not that I really think that he will ever make his identity known to the world, but if he does say on his deathbed or something, how would Satoshi go about doing so? IF he did want people to know who he was whenever he became ready to do it, how would he do it in a way that everyone could believe him? From what I have observed, any person who has come forward and declared themselves Satoshi has not had sufficient proof that they are. So, if we were to discuss this, what would suffice as sufficient proof that they are in fact the real Satoshi?On a side note, if Satoshi ever did come out and be able to prove his identity, how do you think that the world/governments would respond? Its honestly a scary thought, because there are so many people that hate crypto and bitcoin. Someone like him would surely become a target. Which is no doubt the reason he has kept his identity a secret. It is curious though, what is he doing now? Has Satoshi ever tried to leave a message since his disappearance? Perhaps something hidden in plain sight? The biggest mystery of bitcoin, is he alive and well or was he Hal Finney and already passed? What is he like/where is he now? What does he like to do in his spare time. These things all come to mind, and I wish we had some answers. Wouldn't it be incredible if somehow he left a \"final goodbye\" message somewhere or like a book or something when he is ready to give it to the world. After BTC has turned a certain age or something. I wonder if something like this will ever come about, maybe its just wishful thinking but if I created something like this for the entire world I would want people to hear my passion for its creation & also to leave some sort of closing message somewhere down the road as opposed to just peacing out at the first mention of the FBI. He is out there! Somewhere, doing something. He's got to be. Wherever you are Satoshi, i'm sure that you're having a great time and living your best life and surely safe and secure, one would hope.",

      "body": "I think I am an open-minded person. I try to give a chance to all sorts of things and remain open to ideas that are probably not true. If there's an empirical proof, I'll take it. If, however, there isn't a proof (in a sense that only those who already believe it or are very keen on believing it will find it convincing), I'll disregard it.When it comes to Satoshi, just saying \"Hi, I'm Satoshi\" doesn't work. But there must be ways for Satoshi to prove identity. This can be a signed message from a Bitcoin address that's really old and belongs to the earliest of days. It can also be something like an early version (dated accordingly) of the Whitepaper, or screens of chats with someone who can also confirm the authenticity of the chats about Bitcoin from very early days. I think to me it would be a mix of things that would not convince me 100%, but that would allow me to roughly accept that this person is most likely Satoshi Nakamoto.",

There are many ways of which one of them is for him to sign a message with his account on the forum, but i doubted he will ever thought of coming to reveal his identity or oroof himself to be Satoshi because the bitcoin network was designed itself to be privacy conscious and that's one of the reasons for the p2p that has been effective, the mathematics he wrote odown onbthe Whitepaper could be a lie if eventually everything turns away from how it was meant by his past works, anonymity and privacy are things you can't do without idf you must truly enjoy bitcoin, in this regard, he would rather be someone you're familiar with on the forum without you knowing it's Satoshi and maintain his privacy.",

Since we do not have any answers yet or we never heard from him we can safely say that he do not want to present himself to the world. With the time it does not matter at all because system is running just fine. The folks who claims themselves satoshi will come and go all the time.",

He would always come with a proof that shows it was him, for instance his account here can clearly state that for those in forum here and all post might be linked to the forum to his official account. Eg, if he tweets on twitter, he might copy the link or a screenshots and update here through his btt account, then we the user here can clear understand his is real satoshi, i understand that this forum has already hits millions of users and these people can tweet and give a proof his is the real Satoshi if he chooses to reveal himself, so you don't need to worry about the real Satoshi",
