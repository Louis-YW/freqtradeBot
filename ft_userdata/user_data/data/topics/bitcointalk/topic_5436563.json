What is the secret behind BTC?For the fact that bitcoin is volatile doesn't mean it's a currency that has high risk and tendencies of loosing the investment made on it like other cryptos did, bitcoin can fall and rise back while other cryptocurrencies may actually finds this a difficult task to do, which is one of the reasons they ended up being a scam projects, bitcoin has never fallen down to where it started from and will not, other alts do, bitcoin is the only decentralized digital currency while others were centralized, bitcoin is a profitable investment and a digital asset.",

      "body": "Personally, i've never been interested in all those market fluctuations... buying, selling, fud, banks telling us bitcoin is up to no good... I don't really care.I'm here for the technology. Bitcoin ha been secure and stable from a technology point of view for a very long time. It still is a peer to peer cash system that cannot be stopped by any government or organisation (eventough they do influence the price and sometimes even make it illegal for their citizens).If you focus to much on what \"inluential people\", banks, governments, old guys/girls that still use a mechanical calculator because they don't trust \"puters\" say, you'll lose faith pretty soon. If you look at the technical aspects, it's pretty easy to keep believing in crypto",

What is the secret behind BTC?is the secret behind bitcoin you mean > manipulation? there is no secret behind bitcoin, the current bitcoin price is created because of people's beliefs. so it's unreasonable to expect people who own bitcoin to sell their bitcoins when the market crashes, as long as there are many bitcoin holders, the price of bitcoin will never fall drastically.Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on January 24, 2023, 07:30:29 AMFor the fact that bitcoin is volatile doesn't mean it's a currency that has high risk and tendencies of loosing the investment made on it like other cryptos did, bitcoin can fall and rise back while other cryptocurrencies may actually finds this a difficult task to do, which is one of the reasons they ended up being a scam projects, bitcoin has never fallen down to where it started from and will not, other alts do, bitcoin is the only decentralized digital currency while others were centralized, bitcoin is a profitable investment and a digital asset. if we use DCA as a benchmark then we will see the price volatility of the bitcoin price but if you use the concept of 1 BTC = 1 BTC then nothing changes with it. until whenever bitcoin is a safe asset because it is purely decentralized while the average altcoin is centralized.",

But it amazed me that BTC is gaining more rage and a multitude of people are still rushing BTC. What is the secret behind BTC?The secret? Just read the whitepaper until you understand how important Bitcoin is. Its a money which provably cannot be controlled or regulated or frozen by anyone. The reason being that that very control is distributed among miners. And anyone can become a Bitcoiner miner at any time as long as they have internet. This is also the reason why most of us are strictly against implementation of PoS for Bitcoin, but thats a different discussion.Its also based on a system of being a public ledger. So saying that criminals can stay anonymous with Bitcoin is nonsense. The underlying value is not merely speculation but also the cost that mining. So it has provable value and a free nature. Thats next gen money.",

      "body": "Bitcoin was developed for a decentralized purpose and for that purpose I have faith in which no one has autonomy over. Over the years, there hasÂ  been market speculation about bitcoin being a scam, fud, this and that but bitcoin still strived on without any barrier. This alone built my hope and faith in bitcoin. Bitcoin started right from scratch then it grew very strong to a global technology which in years cannot be wiped off. It has already been recognized globally and the adoption rate is growing up stronger and stronger every day so therefore it would be a nice idea every one single individual take advantage of this opportunity of the current market to be a bitcoin holder. Nevertheless, to the best of my knowledge, various governments at different quarters have been trying to regulate bitcoin but they could not which makes be believe in the bitcoin movement. This alone is a strong indication that bitcoin has come to stay.",

What is the secret behind BTC?do not equate your thoughts with bitcoin investors who have been involved in bitcoin investment for a long time, they have calm, mature analysis, and long experience.they are not worried about the falling bitcoin price, and they are also patiently waiting for the bitcoin price to rise.patience, serenity, and experience.",

      "body": "Why I like BTC is because of the opportunity it provides for everyone around the globe. It's not centralized or owned by a private body. Bitcoin is not banned for anybody. A country can decide to ban bitcoin, that doesn't mean its citizen are not eligible to use bitcoin. For instance, when PayPal was the only viral payment method for online stores and businesses many people complained about one issue or another. Some countries were restricted from using PayPal by their officials. Such things never will happen in bitcoin, everyone enjoys its decentralized nature, and loss of funds are mainly the fault of the holder. Nobody is to be blamed that's why we do our research. On the other hand, bitcoin will grow higher in value and get adopted by many people that likes the features that it possess. When that happens they'll be more opportunities. So, the technology will help those that sticks to it in different ways, the best investment for bitcoin today is buying gradually and garnering information about the technology too. It'll build everyone in the community when the price goes ATH again.",

What is the secret behind BTC?Since its launch, Bitcoin has been known for its volatility, so we should not be overly concerned when it significantly falls to the extent of 80% or more, as long term investor and continue sticking with it. The strength of Bitcoin is its decentralization & limited supply which are reasons behind strong faith in its potential to grow faster than any other asset. This is what caused it to gain widespread attention of investors and become a topic of discussion on all social media platforms.",
