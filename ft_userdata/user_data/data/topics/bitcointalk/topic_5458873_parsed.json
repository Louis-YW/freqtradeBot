As for the currency value, I guess you're not from a country that uses USD as it's official currency that's why the whole amount seems like a big amount to you, I can't really tell the country you're in since you've never made any post in your local board but you should try to start with a little amount, after all the first rule of investment is to \"always invest what you can afford to lose\".TL:DR. Don't persuade your mum to use something she knows nothing about, let her continue using her normal Fiat, if she's interested in Bitcoin she can buy some and hodl. --> Always invest money you can afford to lose, that's basically everything you need.",

It's easy to find them on peer-to-peer platforms or even on the forum here in your local section.  Everyone here will encourage you to invest and provide you with affordable solutions.",

And most people here agree that bitcoin is the solution. But not always anything bitcoin-related is going to be great. You say it's hard to buy bitcoins where you are, how are people going to pay your mother if they can't buy bitcoins? I think you are putting bitcoin in the wrong place, you are making people difficult, not making it easyQuote from: Mia Chloe on July 06, 2023, 05:02:49 PMI intend on explaining it to her first then if she agrees I will pay for the Bitcoins she gets from customers If the next goal is to buy bitcoins from the payments your mom got.

I really do not know about your country and does it mean that there is a possible ban on crypto in your country since it happens that government frowns at it? Anyways there is no big deal about it. You can actually succeed in doing it as it would be more of a p2p transaction in the sense that her customers will pay directly to her wallet without having any third party interference.You can interact with her customers or tell her to do so which would convince her clients but since you have more knowledge about bitcoin than your mother, you can help her because there would definitely be some client who are into crypto and would also give in to making payment with bitcoin.I  would advise that you do not hodl all her income in bitcoin but rather there should be some certain percentage for which she should take as cash for her profit, some to reinvest in her business while some percentage be paid in bitcoin for her hodling as you have said.Your plans for your mom is quite a good one.",

Well, the reasons you have provided are also weak because my currency is also losing its value but we can buy BTC in p2p trading which might be available in your country too.Look for a centralized exchange to buy it or maybe a decentralized exchange, it depends on you. And government is also not in favor of crypto in my country too. They had banned the usage of crypto. Which indicates you could still buy BTC and thus your customers too.",

Here, I would definitely advise a good education first, and only then any use, especially payment for your services through Bitcoin.One of the things you must also research is the legality of cryptocurrencies in your country. There are different possible restrictions, and it's best to be sure before making any announcements.",

Thereafter you can guide her through the steps to make her funds secure. Secondly and the most important thing is your government is against bitcoin, so having it as a public payment method might make you a law breaker which could actually be a threat your life and that of your family. So I would advise you leave that off first till maybe your government relaxes the laws against cryptocurrency. Quote from: Mia Chloe on July 06, 2023, 04:41:32 PMSince I joined this forum I have always wanted to invest in Bitcoin however Bitcoin investments in my country is not easy because of our currency value This should actually be the sole reason you buy bitcoin. Since the value of country’s currency is deteriorating then you should consider saving some of your money into bitcoin because it offers you a better store of value. Many people actually buy bitcoin discreetly in countries where the government is against it. All you have to do is to be private about it and not anybody needs to know just not to land your self into government troubles",

When you have done that you should allow her sleep over it then let the decision to accept bitcoin be solely hers. Unless you are going to bear the risk of her losing her funds, then you shouldn't convince her. What I think is that people should invest in bitcoin from a place of proper understand and not because others are investing in it or I want to be the first to invest in it.",

If yes then I would advice you to take your time for now and try to understand how everything works, the Blockchain technology is not something you rush into as you might end up loosing your funds. Just as everyone has said, governments restrictions doesn't stop you from buying Bitcoin (it's decentralized nature) you just have to know how and when to buy thats all.I don't think Involving your mom's business with Bitcoin is a good idea, since you are not yet into it. For now get familiar with the basics and try putting little money(spare money you can afford to loss) and practice from time to time. And later when you are now familiar with the whole process of buying and trading Bitcoin then you can think about involving your mom's business.",

But as you said that the governments of your country are not in support of Bitcoin, I will advise you not to go against your country's laws because it may lead to trouble if you are caught. I advise you to keep learning, but if you think you can do it secretly, I may say you are good to go.Because Bitcoin is not recognized as legal tender in your country, it is never a good idea to try to persuade your mother to accept it as a form of payment in her store. I may add that it will be very challenging for customers to use Bitcoin to make purchases from her. The best you can do is to educate your mum about Bitcoin incase of future maybe your country will later legalize Bitcoin.",
