  "content": "I got this man (a friend to my family), he invested in bitcoin in 2011, and in 2015, he bought some more bitcoins, he's been living well here in Nigeria together with his wife and children, if I will not use the word \"rich or wealthy\" I would say that, they are living a very comfortable live(i.e, him and his family).Of recent, he sold most part of his bitcoin hodlings, which according to a reliable source, fetched him over $850,000, he traveled to UK, bought a house there, then he came back, got visa for his wife and children, moved all of them over to UK, he stayed back in Nigeria for a while, later on, he sold his house here in Nigeria, and joined his family in UK.This man left Nigeria for good, and now is a permanent resident of UK, last time I had a chat with him on Facebook, he told me he does not have any plans of ever coming back to Nigeria again, except he dies and his family decides to fly his corpse back to Nigeria for burial..Like I mentioned in the subject, the questions are nothing serious, but I implore you to be sincere with your answers...Question are..1. Would/will you leave your current place of residence(your country), and relocate to a place you think is better(another country), if your bitcoin investment pays off, making you a millionaire, or almost a millionaire?2. Yes or No - what is your reason.?My thoughtTo be sincere, I've never had any plans of leaving my country to become a permanent resident in another country, no matter how wealthy I become, I could travel for business meetings and return. But for some time, it's become a trend, whoever makes money from bitcoin(not only bitcoin though), travels outside Nigeria never to return, just wanna know if this is something peculiar to Nigerians alone, or it's happening in other parts for the world as well..Lets have a healthy discussion..",

Yes or No - what is your reason.?I've been in our countries before, and to honest, I don't like what I'm seeing. I'm not saying I don't want to go out of our comfort zone, because we won't Â grow. However, If I become a self made millionaire then I would rather stay where I'm right now. I know that people around me, I have my friends and families I can purchase a home for them put up a business and bring my kids to good school and hopefully they will also learn how to invest (not just in crypto). Perhaps we can travel all together to experience what it is going to a different places and see their culture. And so if they have plans to go travel and stay on another country then that's their decision.",

      "body": "Well, to be honest with you with my answers, right from when I was growing up, I always had this mindset of going outside my country (Nigeria) for study. I always had that passion for studying abroad, but those dreams have been killed by the same me. I no longer see anything very special about studying abroad. If I make enough money today to sponsor myself away, I will definitely travel out of this country, go somewhere else, explore, and learn new things. If possible, I will fight to have citizenship in my desired base so that I can travel from my country of origin back there with ease. The truth of the matter is that I can settle wherever Bitcoin (crypto currency at large) is not restricted. I don't have any intention of permanently relocating to a new place, but it needs to be who I am.If not for the Bitcoin earnings in general, I could have suggested this thread be moved to our local board since the discussion and question are centered on Nigerian citizens, unless the question means something else and is opened to the floor.",

I would probably move to Italy or Germany and use part of my holdings to establish some business there and create more wealth for my family, myself and the community I join. Even if I decided to stay in my country, I could not live as a millionaire because the insecurity we have to face here. I mean, as a rule of thumb, people are supposed to leave their phones in there homes if they plan to walk fairly long distances and also, they cannot have the nocturnal life they would like to. So if I stayed here, I could only be a millionaire in private, doing what I want in my small room.",

If it happens that after HODLing and I saw a bigger profit that would make me a millionaire, I'd rather invest more here in my country than going off to another man's country, I could make out chance visiting my family over there.But I'm never leaving my country for good, like they say \"home is where your heart lies\".",

I am also a Nigerian citizen, and I am very happy for the person whose story you shared about his success as a result of patiently holding his Bitcoin as you stated until he made good use of his investment. But I love my country; I don't think such a large amount of profit or money will make me leave my country permanently, as you stated the person did; I like enjoyment as well, and I know that my country is not a developing country, so there is a lot of enjoyment out there; the only thing I will love to do is go on vacation in different countries and return to my own country.QuoteMy thoughtTo be sincere, I've never had any plans of leaving my country to become a permanent resident in another country, no matter how wealthy I become, I could travel for business meetings and return.

This is what our leaders have been doing, and it is the reason we have yet to reach our pick when it comes to development; they prioritize other countries better than their own, and as a result, they do everything there, including medical treatment and normal vacations, and as a result, they fail to focus on making their own country a destination for others to visit.",

      "body": "This is nice to discuss with. I will say Capital NO. I will go with the OP thought of the argument. Though everyone has their opinion on an issue, and also everyone sees things from different angles. If you become rich in your present resident and the place not your taste again, and if there is money to change the place you can do that for your comfort zone. Leaving entirely your country to another with your wealth is wrong. Nigerian is a developing State and it needs people like to develop the country with little wealth gotten. If the guy used the money to build a very fine house in Nigeria and stay, he would have developed the country in his part. And also the economic benefits of the country. Like the money which will be spending every day over there would have been spend in Nigeria and his locality business Women that is retail business in his environment would making money from the daily selling. One thing people don't understand in this migration is that most of your assets would not return back to the home country. The matter what even though you naturalized in the country, your children will trace back their origin to find out their nephews and nieces and other relatives. And they might want to come back again after your dead, and at that process most things would not return. And that would also cause double expenses. As for me,I never leave my present resident for another country permanently but can only make a visit to the Oyinbo country and come back again.",

Yes or No - what is your reason.?I will not move to another country or place just because I'm already a millionaire or close to one. I might move to another house in the same city and focus on finding other business opportunities to make more money. So my answer is no.Maybe it is a good decision for those who managed to make a lot of money from bitcoin but it is not for everyone. Each person has their own plan and will try to achieve it.I thought that if I moved to another country, the cost of living would not necessarily be cheaper than where I am now. Besides that, I had to adapt again to the habits of living there, the culture, and so on. So staying in my city would be better for me and opening up a new business.",

If he had $800,000, buying a house, assuming the average price in the UK, would have cost him $300,000. Other expenses, such as decorating the house and moving him and his family, could easily have cost him $50,000.That leaves him with $450,000 in the UK, which is not a cheap country. What does he plan to live on? If he has no other income, he can live modestly for about 10 years, and that's it. That's why I say that being a millionaire is nothing to get excited about. If he had 10 million dollars it would be a different story, but a million is going to run out soon. It's probably a lot of money for someone living in Nigeria, that's for sure.",

One of his buddies from California was one of the first employees at Coinbase and so he went to the conference just to see him again after 10 years. While we were in line to get our food he told me all about his plans to vacate the US to another country, he was bidding for citizenship in this strange land that opened up their citizenship (I honestly can't remember where this was, the way he explained it to me sounded like a scam lmao). Anyhow he bragged about how he had millions and this and that, anyways this guy was set on going to costa rica for good & getting out of the US, and he had a few fall back plans if that didn't work. He had already worked out the exit tax to revoke his citizenship and that incurs a pretty good ding doing that. It was pretty interesting, never met anyone that wanted to leave america as much as this guy, and he was born and raised here too.",
