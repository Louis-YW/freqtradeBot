FBI might want a piece of that.I think he's using stolen cards from internet to pay people's bills since they accept any kind of cards and pretty much without any verification and he obviously can't use those stolen cards These kind of offers will only get you in trouble and i don't think anyone will be dumb enough to try that and handle this guy his bill accounts",

You are offering to pay the bills and also taking 50% as your own fee.I don't get it how the service receiver can benefit. If you have stolen cards and you pay the bill in full and get 50% from the receivers, then this is risky because we will get caught on using a stolen compromised credit card to pay our bill. That's why you are not asking for upfront payments as you have nothing to lose Seems like a shady service to me.",
