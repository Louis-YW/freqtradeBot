Furthermore Lampard needs to go and I can’t understand how has he survived so far?, and lastly do you feel that Chelsea will be able to get revenge on City for yesterday’s loss or do you feel that they’ll be defeated by City again?.",

FA cup is not easy and to know the club that will be the FA cup winner is very difficult, there are many other clubs that are good in EPL that are eager to win FA cup too, Manchester United team can try their best, but they may or may not be the winner. But as for today's match, this season has been a bad season for Everton and they are on the relegation position in premier league, that is enough to let us know that Manchester United is having a better chance to win.",

As for Lampard, I have no idea how he has survived so long with a dismal record at Everton. I expect Manchester City to win their FA Cup game against Chelsea because Potter and his team have not been good enough most of the season.Quote from: _act_ on January 06, 2023, 11:51:38 AMFA cup is not easy and to know the club that will be the FA cup winner is very difficult, there are many other clubs that are good in EPL that are eager to win FA cup too, Manchester United team can try their best, but they may or may not be the winner.

This team that Erik Ten Hag has put together is definitely one to be feared and even more in attack with rumours of Felix and Aboubakar from Cameron likely to join them on loan.I wonder why they don't use VAR in FA cup games, VAR technology should be used in all competitions since it has improved decision making process although some decisions with it are still biased, but majorly I feel VAR should be used generally. Some decisions from the officials in the game was not completely accepted as correct and should have warranted a VAR check for verification.",

Lampard's csso I don't know if I will fire him, but if he leaves and takes on another coach, I very much doubt that much will change, probably the thing that would change would be the team not being close to the relegation zone",

Though neither team wanted a replay that is what will happen because unlike last season the games will revert to replays and then extra-time and penalties if necessary. I preferred the previous format last season where domestic cup games were decided on the day rather than replays because it adds to an already congested fixture list.Liverpool will have to travel to Wolverhampton (for the replay) and then winner will move in to the 4th round of the tournament.Quote from: Majestic-milf on January 07, 2023, 10:59:17 PM Liverpool 2-2 Wolverhampton Wanderers Honestly this game was a shocker.

The winner in this game will be the team to play the winners in the game between Oxford and Arsenal tomorrow.

The League Two club have caused a major shock but this is the magic of the FA Cup, smaller clubs can occasionally beat the much bigger clubs.Quote from: Rruchi man on January 08, 2023, 04:41:22 PMAnother big test for Chelsea after loosing already to Manchester City in the Premier League. Well, Chelsea are in big trouble when it comes to the Premier League. There is no real chance of them finishing in the top four this season therefore they will not play Champions League next season. On merit alone, Manchester City,  Arsenal, Newcastle United and Manchester United deserve to finish in the top four but as the season goes on that could change. As for their game today, Manchester City absolutely took them apart and exposed their weaknesses with a convincing 4-0 win. Even though Manchester City put out  a weakened team, Chelsea tried to field a team as strong as possible because they have to try to win any domestic cup they can. Chelsea are out of the competition and they continue to have a miserable season. Potter is the wrong man to be their manager or coach.",

Opponents just do not fear facing Liverpool, they have dipped in form after selling Sadio Mane. It just goes to show how important Mane was for the team (more than Salah). If Liverpool owners sack Klopp they will have to pay compensation and then give the new manager time to rebuild and spend on players he wants to bring in. As long as Klopp does not resign the board will not sack him because the club is now for sale they would prefer to sell it and let the new owners make decisions.Quote from: Juggy777 on January 30, 2023, 03:40:09 AM@JollyGood I’m really happy for Manchester United, and the way they’re playing is making every Red Devil fan’s proud and it’s hard to imagine that we were getting  Rabiot instead of Casemiro .
