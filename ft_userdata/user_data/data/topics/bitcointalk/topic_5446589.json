  "content": "ChipMixer, which was launched in 2017, was formally taken down on March 15 over its involvement in money laundering activities. German authorities seized four servers, around 1909.4 BTC and 7 terabytes of data. Source : https://coingeek.com/coin-mixer-chipmixer-taken-down-by-global-authorities/Now, this is my concern...and nobody is really talking about this... What data are stored by these Mixer services? I was under the impression that ZERO data are stored about the mixing of tokens/coins.... but yet ... 7 terabytes of data were seized. Disclaimer : I am not concerned about this, because I do not use Mixer services for criminal activities.... but I do use them to break the chain between my main hoard and the other wallets that I use for my daily needs.",

You get the idea though.Also CoinGeek is shadowbanned on the press board. /s",

BTW how different are mixers from coins like monero, i really dont get the fuzz of closing down tumblers The fuzz is the \"message\" that are being send by the authorities to other people who wants to operate mixer services. So, if they take down the biggest mixer service, then they will send a strong message that they are coming after the smaller ones.... and they hope it will scare those people enough for them to close down their service by themselves. They did not learn from what happened to \"Piratebay\" and all the other Peer-to-Peer services that they closed down. These guys just create several more sites and they pop up like mushrooms .... and it turns into a Whack a Mole game.",

ChipMixer painted a target on their own back, by being one of the largest coin mixers out there, so law enforcement zeroed in on them as a primary target.",
