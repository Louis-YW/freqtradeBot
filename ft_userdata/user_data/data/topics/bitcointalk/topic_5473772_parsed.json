  "content": "I have heard someone (Vivek Ramaswamy) calling Zelensky a \"comedian on cargo pants\". There was a moment in which Zelensky said \"I want weapons no at ride\", while he was in Kyiv when the Ruzzis were at the gates and missiles were landing in the middle of the city. Vivek has never seen war, nor even anything close to serving in the military. He is a hustler in a suit that has built his \"career\" fooling others into giving him money. What would have Vivek said if he had been in Zelensky's shoes? Weapons or ride? I think we all know the answer, don't we. Yet there he is, insulting and following the Kremlin line. Who is paying this guy? I think we all know that answer too.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qliw4lIzi_M1- Ukraine is not a paradise of democracy - true, nor the US.2- Parties have been banned and elections may not be held - true, Kremlin financed parties were banned. Elections during war may be impossible. However there is opposition in Ukraine and there are radio and TV channels that openly criticize the government.3 - Zelensky is a Nazi (Warning - Kremlin line red flag) - unlike, since Zelensky is Jew.4 - Zelensky is a comedian in cargo pants - False, Zelensky is a commedian in military clothes. Ronald Reagan (ex-US president) was an actor in cowboy boots, Swarzenegger (ex-California governor) was an actor on steroids.5 - Luhansk and donesk are of majority Russian speaking - True, and Russian is an official language there since 1994 without any problem whatsoever.Oh, BTW, US is mainly English speaking, so... should the UK take over?6 - These were not Ukraine before 2014 - False. Just false.7 - \"I am saying something that is not in the mainstream media\" - False, it has been commented a million times.8 - This is not a battle \"good\" vs \"evil\" - It is democracy and Western values vs Putin dictatorship. It depend if that is not \"evil enough\" for you.9 - The are \"banning Christians\" - False. Ukraine is a Christian country, mostly. Some of the Orthodox priests that were doing politics pro-Ruzzia (instead of actually doing religion) have been banned but you can practice Christian rituals in Ukraine as much as you want - but risking getting Ruzzian missile while doing so.Overall - Repeating directly Kremlin falsehoods and then going for the half-truth, half-exaggerated and a third half of plain lies. (yes three halfs, it is ok for the Republicans as long as you speak in the name of God).But to understand the guy, is better to know himhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivek_RamaswamyHe is a hustler, has lived his whole life taking an loosing others money. Perhaps is ok loosing the Kremlin's money too?",
