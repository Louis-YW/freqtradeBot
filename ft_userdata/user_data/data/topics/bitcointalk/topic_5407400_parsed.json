  "content": "cttoDate: October 8, 2022Venue: Los AngelesThough this is not a big fight for everyone but I think this is big for Filipino boxing fans out there because this is the chance that the Philippines can capture a belt in boxing once again.Personally, I'm inclined to believe that Jerwin Ancajas has the potential on bringing glory again to the Philippines in the world of boxing because he has the tools, he just needs to be focused more on training and not be too confident because that might be the reason on his loss to Martinez in their first outing.No odds yet but I'll post it here once available.",

Fernando is tough no doubt but I think if Ancajas will focus and not look for that knock out punch, he can outslug him late and could win in the scorecard.",

But I would agree that this is somewhat a redeem not just for Ancajas, but for the Filipino boxers who lost their belt this year. He has all the tools in his arsenal no doubt, he just have to believed that he can get back his belt from Fernando Martinez. Ancajas is still in his prime, most of the time, it's good for boxers to suffer a defeat so that they will go back and vindicate themselves.",

Fight against Naoya Inoue will just make his record bad since he completely can't make an upset.",

Though the announcement was a month before the fight but i think that was not enough to study Martinez.I have a feeling though that Ancajas would reclaim the belt he once held as Filipinos are all going to watch this fight, that will serve as his motivation to bring glory/belt to the nation who loved boxing and basketball.",

Might be a good motivation for Jerwin Ancajas to become more aggressive but if only his first performance against Martinez is close and toe-to-toe, I can bet that he might have a chance for the title. He was clearly outscored back then and it just shows that he is having a hard time with Martinez. But even with that mindset of mine, there's no way I will support Martinez and my bet will always be on Ancajas.",

But to be a great boxer or even to be put on the elite level, he has to motivate himself and avenge his lost. Filipino boxing legends such as Elorde, Pacquiao and Nonito has that kind of mentality that's why they were able to stay in the game for so long.So that is up to Jerwin, he need to be have the advantage in the mind game as well and I do hope he had that in the rematch and be influence in a positive way with that lost.",

Hopefully someone will take him under their wing to provide him with the necessary training and equipment for him to get the best out of his skills and his technical abilities. Most of the boxers here in the Philippines have the chance to be the next Manny Pacquiao only if they got the proper training that they needed to level up their game. Then again, it depends on the will and determination of the fighter in the end. The last loss of Ancajas isn't really pleasing given that he lost to an underdog.

Going to toe to toe isn't a good option for him. He should learn how to use his height and reach advantage. I know this could be an easier fight for him if he uses his boxing IQ.",
