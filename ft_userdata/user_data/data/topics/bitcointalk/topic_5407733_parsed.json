Most social media allow you to curate what to see, I personally don't have commercial content in my news feeds. As automation of our industry increases. more and more jobs will move towards the Internet, perhaps in a few decades a majority of work will happen there, so it's not strange that social media are increasingly more commonly used for business.",

      "body": "There is a high percentage of stolen content circulating on social media platforms. Most of the smart content is published by accounts with fewer than 1k followers. Then reposed by accounts with more than 50k followers. It is a strange dynamic.Everyone is scrambling for clout and credibility. Trying to increase their follower count and marketability. All of the clickbait angles and begging for retweets, likes and followers seems to have devalued and cheapened some of the relationship between content creators and their followings.And after decades of being bombarded by commercials and advertisements. A high percentage of people appear to have stopped blindly believing everything they see on a screen. And on some level, began to think more for themselves, independently.Having lots of views and follower interaction translates directly to more money from ads. And so yes it does seem that profiteering motives and business is a leading motive behind much of it.",

Most people have been able to provide their basic needs by engaging in business activities on social media. But this blessing comes with its own challenges. Social media scam and fraud has increased drastically. Now we have fake business claiming they offer certain goods or servicing but their sole aim is to dupe people of their hard earned money. We have also seen celebrities or public figures with high fellowship advertising and promoting these fake or fraudulent businesses. Regulating the social media might be an affront to freedom of speech but I feel businesses on social media need some form of control.",

They're there for communicating with friends and loved ones who are either near or far. But the convenience of social media in terms of communication and socializing in general has actually made a lot of effects outside plain socializing. And these social media companies are quick to take advantage of them. Users, for example, are bombarded with ads of products and services to their interest and liking. And since social media have larger populations than towns and even cities and countries, it has become a honeypot for businesses to promote and sell their products and services. Social media companies are allowing all this not only because it makes them more popular but also because it increases their revenue.",

Previously, a person would have managed with his circle of acquaintances and spent money to advertise his product; today, all of this is much cheaper, and in some cases completely free.It saddens me that the intrusive ads that users are offered to view are so strong that many have to give up social networking altogether.Initially, the idea of creating such networks had good prerequisites, but today it has turned into chaos, where it is very difficult to guess whether you are communicating with a normal person or a scammer who is sitting on the other side.",

Considering the fact that every person carries phone with them and continuously sticking to it, its best way to reach out to peeps and get into their heads. What we talk, we search, we see everything is getting traced and literally after few minutes AI will start displaying the advertises for the same products or services. On one side its also giving us amphora of life while on the hand its blooming business. I donâ€™t think its bad in anyways.",

So many people have used social media for business and also socializing because they can socialize while running a business so they can get additional income for their lives. So it would not be wrong if there are many people who take advantage of this opportunity to compete with each other through business.",

I think it's not something new. Though it is done over the internet, but business has always been making social relationships, expanding your connections, and etc. And it all starts with socialization. Now, social media was created because it is a business as well. Haven't you ever think that business minded people have always thought of using the platform to expand their business and find their target market more effectively and efficiently rather than meeting people personally.",

We are in the middle of an era which can be rightfully described as \"social media revolution\". Social media has become way more.powerful that we can even imagine. So if such a powerful platform can provide tools and opportunities to showcase your goods or services which can generate some extra income for you, what's the problem! This way, social media can maintain its relevance in the ever changing technical landscape.",

Things are becoming modern these days and anything, where people can interact and put up a post for their products or services, can now be done on almost every social media that's open to everyone. Well, some social media are subscribers based yet still, it's now become a place for selling anything as well.",
