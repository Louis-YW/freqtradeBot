Do you think Baby doge can bring better gains than Shiba already did in near future.If you ask me then i would pick none of those two projects for a long term investment. Simply because they are meme-coins and don't have any use case. It is true though that early investors into Shiba Inu have become rich but i am pretty sure that these times are over and that the whole meme-coin hype that is already at a very low level at the moment will be completely dead in the near future.Shiba Inu is probably to big already to become completely dead, but i can hardly imagine that we will see another x10 from now on for Shiba Inu. Maybe if the whole crypto market starts to explode again but not on it's own. I think the longterm trend for meme-coins is downwards.",

I hate it when I say that, but it seems like there is nothing that stops people from investing in these meme coins in the long-term.I have not looked into Baby Doge since Doge already exists anyway, so I am not sure what these two are different from each other.If you are going still for the long-term, go with BTC or ETH. It is still worth it in the end.",

Maybe for some reason, it was called unique but yes, as they are meme coins, I really felt confident with Shiba Inu, especially when talking about long-term investment.

Maybe in this question, Shiba got the huge vote but is not really considered the favorite coin for investment, unless we don't have any other options to pick. Dogecoin is a leader of meme coin and has oldest history. In the last bull run we have Shiba Inu and together these meme coins lead the meme coin branch. However, when more meme coin projects launched, they create something toxic for this branch. No idea for products, bad control against inflation, their finance is bad and price will be dumped.Because products are what will help a project to survive and keep its existence with time. With products, marketing and partnership, it will have more usability and will increase the survival of a meme coin.Dogecoin is always in my following list. Shiba Inu is the same but it has a lower priority than Dogecoin. Dogecoin has a big advantage when it is a Proof of Work coin.",

The meme coin with the largest community is only from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu that's why I believe in Shiba Inu for the long term.Community is still small? These two projects have millions of follows more than many good layer 2 projects out there, it just seem like people like meme coins more than other I don't know, Doge coin for example is one of the most love community coin ever.",

Baby doge was full with so many crazy people. If you are still expecting the shit token like baby doge to become even bigger than shiba and then you must need think about it or at least see its community. Bunch of toxic people and stuped people who keep dreaming about that to happen. I think that you shall choose shiba inu. that's more trusted rather than baby doge.",

Meme coins don't have a good purpose so I don't think they're worth investing in the long run. As for me, they're just good for short-term investment and take advantage of their pump. There are lots of bigger potential coins that would be profitable in the future. You could be right, even if one have to invest in meme coins it should be when the bulls are back, right now there are too many good altcoins that are good for long term than buying meme coins.",
