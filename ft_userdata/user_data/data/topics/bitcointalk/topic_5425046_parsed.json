You should really improve the loading time of your website because most of the casinos today are quick in loading.I do not know what factors has to be done and changed so that it will be faster but every suggestion that one may say to you guys could be of a little help for improvement.",

Considering only deposit/withdrawal option is Bitcoin , at least at the moment, why don't display players balance in bitcoin directly ? Maybe using bits like some popular gambling sites do? They are using credits as there currency with the given conversion rate on your quoted post. This same idea with Duelbits that converts crypto in there $ so that the value of the user balance will fixed based on what they desired currency which on this case credits. There games is lotto based which means each ticket has fixed bet size. They probably want to peg the ticket value on credits quantity. Probably credits might be there native utility token for there website which they want to be use on there casino for betting. I really like the idea if this the case since this will drive the price up of the tokens. This should be the number one feature of all web 3 casino that has there own native tokens.@OP, does credit is a token? And are you planning to list it on exchange aside from your built in exchange.",

Provably-fair is offered on the Keno game but for the lottery game, being player-vs-player, we do not yet have such a system. The images are those of the accounts, you can change yours from the profile but if you do not send one then a random avatar is generated.Quote from: piebeyb on December 02, 2022, 09:01:32 AMwelcome to the forum, i didn't find any faucet button on your site but i just got 20 credits from my new account and tried the game buy tickets there, good luckI just checked the credits value from the deposit button for 500 credits equivalent to 0.00029477 BTC whether it's a fixed price or will change at any timejust a little suggestion to add other crypto will be more interesting there@piebeyb in addition to the Faucet link as described by @hopenotlate you can use the banners and the Support menu to find all the important links.

And are you planning to list it on exchange aside from your built in exchange.Interesting @Wapfika, but currently 100 credits will still make $1 when withdrawing in BTC (minus blockchain fees). The value of the credits does not change, nor does the price of the tickets, only the winnings change according to the number of tickets sold at the time of the draw.",
