Wait until it has completelyshut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run theinstaller (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on macOS)or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL ispossible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated. Oldwallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.CompatibilityBitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systemsusing the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  BitcoinCore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not asfrequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core onunsupported systems.P2P#26909 net: prevent peers.dat corruptions by only serializing once#27608 p2p: Avoid prematurely clearing download state for other peers#27610 Improve performance of p2p inv to send queuesBuild system#25436 build: suppress array-bounds errors in libxkbcommon#25763 bdb: disable Werror for format-security#26944 depends: fix systemtap download URL#27462 depends: fix compiling bdb with clang-16 on aarch64Miscellaneous#25444 ci: macOS task imrovements#26388 ci: Use macos-ventura-xcode:14.1 image for \"macOS native\" task#26924 refactor: Add missing includes to fix gcc-13 compile errorCreditsThanks to everyone who directly contributed to this release:Anthony TownsHennadii StepanovMacroFakeMartin ZumsandeMichael FordSuhas DaftuarAs well as to everyone that helped with translations onTransifex.",
