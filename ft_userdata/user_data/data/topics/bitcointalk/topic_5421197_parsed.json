That's the safest option.Anyway, since you you want to hold, then you should go with a paper wallet.For BTC: - Just download Bitaddress source code from Github[1], run it offline locally and print the private keys.For USDT: I'm not sure which network you're using, but if it's any EVM compatible chain, then you should use something like MetaMask to get the private keys and print them as well.[1] https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org",

Start Electrum, create a new wallet, write down the seed to paper (at least 2 copies top be stored in different locations), copy an address as deposit address (keep in mind though that by default a seed generated by Electrum will work only with Electrum - but in case Electrum dies off there are solutions, so nothing to worry)",

You're gonna regret it.I agree with the point and about Ledger being a very well-trusted company, but if the op doesn't want a hardware wallet, wouldn't you agree that Electrum is totally fine? It's secure, it's non-custodial, and it's convenient. Is there a good argument against using Electrum and opting for a hardware wallet like Ledger instead? To me it seems to be more about personal preference and a sense of safety, but that Electrum is secure enough not to worry about needing even more security.",

But if the OP has $10K - $20K more in bitcoin right now then not having a hardware wallet certainly doesn't make sense. It might be worth saving it in Electrum if it's not much, but it's not recommended to keep it on a device that's always connected to the internet like an android or whatever.In addition to the advantages of asset security, hardware wallets also support altcoin like USDT, ETH or more, which makes it easy for users to have only 1 piece of hardware to store multiple assets.",

I use it because it is simply a multichain wallet, very convenient for storing multiple coins at the same time and managing seed phrases is also easier. For now, everything is fine with Trustwallet but it is difficult to say what will happen in the next 2 years, it is a non-custodial but closed-source wallet so in my opinion it should not be chosen for long-term bitcoin storage.
