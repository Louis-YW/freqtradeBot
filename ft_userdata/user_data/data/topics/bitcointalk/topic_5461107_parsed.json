If a user changed his username, his past posts will be changed to a new username but quoted posts will show the old username.",

It would be nice to have the quote of the ignored user to be collapsed (and while we're at it, collapse/reduce wall-quotes and large images too) but hiding the whole post would be too harsh IMO. it's one of the many reasons actually.",
