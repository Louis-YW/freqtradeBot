If you are planning to DCA, then do it now. Do it even if the price has gotten back to $30,000. That's DCA. DCA is not only started or done when the price bottoms. That wouldn't be DCA anymore. You are actually risking missing the bus if that's the case.",

Lets DCA after 15KAnd because of the recession, the price of BTC will drop to $10k? As far as I know, you are not some kind of expert, but someone who until recently asked beginner questions, and now you are repeating what various yt experts have been repeating like a broken record for more than a year. I'm not saying that something bad can't happen, but that a 50% crash will happen just like that because everyone wants to buy cheap Bitcoin is nothing but the wishful thinking of those who say all the time that Bitcoin is too expensive for them. If $10k happens, don't think that it will stop there, maybe in that case you will do your DCA at a price of $5000.",

Right now I imagine that people in Japan or Europe are probably rushing into Bitcoin to preserve their purchasing power and not be decimated by their local currencies being destroyed in value. What happens when their currencies aren’t sinking like a stone anymore and Bitcoin starts to drop in yen or euro, whatever? Will be interesting to watch.",

I hope you can understand that.I could say that 30k is around the corner and I have pretty much the same chance as you.Yes, speculation is pretty much worthless.So the conclusion is that it could be safer to start DCA-ing now.

The current market rise is not surprising considering how the bitcoin market fairs during the end of the year. But there are more experts who will still find a way round it. Even if there is another bear market maybe during early next year mostly because of the halving in 2023 I strongly doubt if it will get back to 15k because during this past bear market bitcoin has proven to have a support at 18k and I don't see it going below.",

But there are more experts who will still find a way round it.(....)Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is always possible this time, take note that we are still -70% from the all-time high of Bitcoin, and for me, Dollar Cost Averaging during these price levels is still possible and worth it. Because for example recently we just had a hard time to get back again to above $20,000 and few months before we already experienced a lot of time to always falling down below $20,000. So even if you are buying on every dump below $20,000 it's good.",

There's no clear prediction when the perfect entry to purchase Bitcoin or waiting at the bottom will come.  However, I didn't against the DCA way of purchasing Bitcoin but it will need time for you to have a perfect buying point.",

I also think that the low price of bitcoin could be at $10k but maybe it could be above $10k and below $15k. But whatever it is, if the price drops, it's a fair price to buy and we have to prepare a certain amount to buy it and then hold it for a while. Buy as much as you can afford and stay within the limit you can afford because you have to split your money to buy at another low price.",
