      "body": "Aren't you looking for a bounty manager already? That should be a good option for marketing. You can't force managers to accept your proposal even if you pay them a lot of money if their credibility is at risk unless you want to hire someone with no reputation at all. It might be a good idea to introduce your project first. As far as I can remember, there are also marketing services if you want to promote your project on other media in the Services board, just need to search for them. I doubt any of them will accept mindless spam posts though.",

Dm me on bitcoin talk with existing works What do you mean by shilling service? Shilling service is more sort of spamming service, and it will not help your project in the long term.If you are really interested to promote your service on this forum, then my recommendation is that first you should make and publish an ANN on the relevant section of the forum. Then you may start a signature campaign for your project. It will be sustainable marketing and your project will get good coverage.",

Such people just post and never look back on the forum. The reason for this is that no one is willing to work with their scam services. For a moment think that will they pay anyone in advance to perform a shilling service ? No way, it's just a marketing stunt and when you contact them, they have their own terms and conditions.Quote from: Zoomic on June 08, 2023, 11:41:12 PMQuote from: digaran on June 04, 2023, 01:50:18 PMActually now that I think about it, since I'm an extortionist (don't even know how to spell it) You have to pay me $1000 just for letting me know about your request.ðŸ¤£ Add more $1000 to this, OP can run signature campaign for 4 weeks Â If OP had money, he should have opted for a better means to promote his business.

I think that budget is enough to have at least a good marketing manager or a team that will work on your project and market it on platforms that you wanna get known. If you wanna hire someone that's gonna be shilling your project specifically in the forum, I doubt that you'll get one. Most of those that are doing it are likely to get avoided and ignored in discussions. Or if you're specific to campaigns, there could be some that will put their reputations on line but not as reputed as the one's that are known and existing here.",

Dm me on bitcoin talk with existing works  Shilling within this forum can be identified quickly, and it will ruin your reputation. Also, the Shiller accounts may get neutral/negative tags for their spam in the forum. However, you may find the bounty campaign interesting. A bounty campaign is also shilling that can be done on various platforms, including Reddit, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter. There might be many more other channels. However, you must spend a lot of money to hire a bounty manager and bounty workers. Now I am curious what is your service/platform that needs shilling marketing. Isn't it good to spend some money on advertising and get some real exposure?",

Well, it's forbidden here to shill any project here as they will be counted as spam. However, what do you think all the bounty managers are doing?

Exactly, that's what I mentioned in my previous post, but you have quoted the last part of my post. Anyways, The whole bounty campaign is all about shilling their project. They hiring bounty hunters to spam all over social media to get paid, and those projects are paying for that. The bounty managers only manage the campaigns. Most altcoin campaigns scam their participants as they don't escrow the funds. Some of them pay, and some of them don't.",
