Although I am suspicious of this project itself and not in their commission, pool management would mean something like a wealth manager right? Someone that's managing multiple investments for different people isn't necessarily a suspicious thing since this is mostly done in fiat and you can see who's managing your money and investments so there's no risk of people running away with your money unlike with crypto where I assume that this is going to be entirely anonymous, the risk of giving the whole funds to one person or people affiliated in a group is going to increase exponentially since it will be easier to run away with the funds so to anyone that's trying this service, be careful and know that you're risking something.",

When a pool's draw time is reached, the algorithm first checks the number of participants and the reward distribution count. If there are enough participants and rewards to go around, the pool is successful, and winners are announced.However, if certain conditions aren't met, the algorithm may extend the pool, giving more users a chance to join and increase the reward pool. These conditions include factors like the number of participants, distribution amount, and time limits.We've designed our algorithm to ensure fairness and to maximize the chances of winning for all participants. Imagine three users, A, B, and C, joining a pool.User A enthusiastically participates with three tickets, while User B and User C each join with one ticket.Now, consider that there's only one reward distribution in this scenario. It's important to note that User A, despite having more tickets, doesn't have a guaranteed win. Having more tickets simply increases their chances of winning.Now, let's say there were multiple reward distributions. Even in this case, User A would still receive only one reward if they happen to win.In summary, having more tickets boosts your odds of winning, but it doesn't guarantee more rewards. It's all about increasing your chances in the game!If you have any more questions or need further details, please feel free to ask. Your understanding and trust are important to us!Thanks",

Due to the decentralized and pseudonymous nature of these technologies, trust is indeed built differently compared to traditional financial systems.Regarding our commission, we believe it's justified given the complexity and costs involved in running a secure platform. Plus, blockchain technology enables efficient and transparent payment processing, especially for consolidated and substantial transactions. Every transaction is securely recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and integrity.Rest assured, we're committed to providing a trustworthy platform, and we appreciate your understanding of the intricacies of the crypto world. Your trust is valuable to us, and we're here to answer any questions you may have along the way!Thanks",
