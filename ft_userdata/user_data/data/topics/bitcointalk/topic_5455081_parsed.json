  "content": "When Jesus was baptized (at about age 30) by John the Baptist, the Holy Spirit came on Him in the form of a dove. John saw this. Then, after this happened, the Spirit drove Jesus into the wilderness, where He ate nothing for 40 days and 40 nights. Why?There were probably several reasons. I think one of them was that He would lose all the waste products that his body had gained over the years from His Mom's good cooking. Also, I think that this was the time that He cried out to His Heavenly Father for life (as talked about in the Book of Hebrews in the New Testament), where it says that He was heard for His reverent submission.I'm thinking that the part of the method that the early people in the Bible - the Old Testament people who lived for hundreds of years - stayed alive that long was, they reset themselves to their DNA pattern by prolonged fasting. Part of the reason why Jesus would have lived longer was His reverent submission to His Father.Along with the gift the Father gave Jesus, came the ability to be healthy enough that He could pass the health to sick people through His ministry. In addition, Jesus learned the method for maintaining His healthy body through this fast, so that while being crucified, He never gave up on the perfect holiness He had learned, even when it killed Him. His death on the cross was simply like a prolonged fast, except that it happened much faster than His earlier food fast.Our benefit knowing this? It comes in at least 3 parts:1. We have Jesus we can pray to (as well as the Father) so that we can ask and receive from Him;2. We have the Bible, especially the New Testament, that can fill us with faith easier than the OT, if we are willing to not reject it, but fill ourselves on it, daily;3. We also have the ability to fast - to reset our genes and genetics to the health we had earlier in our lives, or even to health we didn't have.So, we actually have a chance to live for loads of years longer than we normally think... maybe hundreds of years.",

      "body": "Actually it's mostly about the spiritual gains. The less you feed the flesh the more aware or active the Spirit becomes. And you will see visions and recieve messages from above. The 40 could signify the 40 days of fasting by Moses on Mount Sanai while receiving the commandments and other messages from the CREATOR. In Acts of the Apostles Peter fell into trance while he was hungry or fasting. Someone was once told by the CREATOR that fasting (while feeding with the Word of GOD) will make him be as a wave or light(wave was actually shown to the person). He was further told that the enemy uses gluttony to weigh people down, probably spiritually. Try feeding yourself with the Word of GOD while fasting and you could have a life changing experience.

The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”Notice when Satan came to Jesus to tempt Him in the wilderness. It was after Jesus had fasted for 40 days. Satan probably thought that Jesus would be weakest at that time. But, there is a trick in fasting that Satan and many people miss.Often when a person prays, it is prayer out of need or desire. But a person who prays with great need, is going to be more earnest in his prayer. What greater need is there than for food when you are starving?A person who has fasted as long as 6 weeks (almost) has a natural need that pushes itself into whatever prayer he prays. The NEED for nutrition being shouted out from all the cells of the body, translates itself into the prayer, making the prayer to have or reflect NEED. The prayer becomes more earnest, naturally.Satan couldn't see the way the Father answered Jesus's prayers internally in Jesus. But it was in part the earnestness of Jesus's prayers that strengthened Him... strength from the Father. So, it might even have been that God wouldn't let Jesus be tempted until Jesus had fasted and been strengthened through His earnest prayer... prayer having been made more earnest by NEED, for food.",

In this story, the Trinity must be a metaphor, but it is not.Over there they are ONE or Single Entity. It's hard to see any difference.. The best way to understand this is to picture a human body, it's a unit made of different parts. The Head is the FATHER, the next to the Head is the SON, the blood is the Holy Spirit... then there are other parts which you could call the angels. They all act as One but the FATHER is the KING of all who they all pray to. JESUS is the Prince and next to the throne of our FATHER. HE is greater than the rest after the FATHER. When you see JESUS you have seen the FATHER... HE is the KING too and the Son of the FATHER, the FATHER is in HIM forming a single entity called JESUS, and all things were made through HIM.",

      "body": "God is an alien. He built a 'computer' the heavens and the earth. He programmed the computer with all kinds of programming, including life. As the Creator, He exists within his computer and programs, and without.It's a bit like a person who builds a house. The house is not him, and the things of the house are not him. Yet he exists both within the house at times, and outside of it at other times.The difference with God is that He actually became part of the house when He became Jesus... Jesus Who is both part of the House as man, and part of God Who is outside the house.The 40-day fast that Jesus did, was something that was a righteousness and a perfection that fit a being Who was both God and man. Remember, God made the universe, and made it to act perfectly. So, as the Perfecter of the universe (through His life, death and resurrection), Jesus had to act and live perfectly.Remember, it was the Holy Spirit, who settled on Jesus in the form of a Dove at Jesus's baptism, Who drove Jesus into the wilderness to fast for 40 days.My real point in this thread is to figure out the reasons why Jesus fasted, that is, how His fasting was part of perfection... why He had to fast to be part of perfection. Then, once we figure it out, perhaps we can become more godly by acting out Jesus perfection, knowing what we are doing and why, rather than simply imitating some of His activity.",
