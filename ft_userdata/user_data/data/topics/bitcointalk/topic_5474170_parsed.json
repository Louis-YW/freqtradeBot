They are thinking using their balls instead of their brain when it comes to Bitcoin. Their company probably missed out the dip or just recently take profit that’s why they resort to this kind of shitty prediction just to fuel FUD in times of correction.I bet that they are spouting now about Bitcoin target price is 1M if they are holding Bitcoin right now. Quoting what my girl Taylor Swift said:QuoteAnd the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hateBaby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shakeI shake it off, I shake it off (ooh-ooh-ooh)Let’s just shake them off!",

Analysts have been known to give their two cents on the price of Bitcoin over the years and while some of their opinions should be taken with a grain of salt, I'd prefer to ignore this one. There has been so many predictions concerning Bitcoin price and although they are trying to prepare investors to not get carried away by the sudden jump, I feel it's not necessary. If this is their way of spreading FUD, they are doing a pretty poor job at it. What do you expect of them though? Sitting in their fancy offices and making these funny assumptions about Bitcoin just goes to show how little they know about it.",

They have been critical of Bitcoin in the past and seem resistant to acknowledging its successes, despite being proven wrong multiple times. So, my advice is not to pay too much attention to this company; they may not be presenting an accurate picture of the situation.Some of the news in the past involving this company. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says he’s still a crypto skeptic: ‘I’m not a bitcoin supporter. I have no interest in it’’Jamie Dimon’s infamous 2017 bitcoin takedown still serves as a warning as the decade winds down",

I empathize in advance with those who would listen to their BS and decide to invest based on whatever garbage to have to spew out of their mouths against bitcoin.

I know JB Morgan have interest in Bitcoin even though they have not had the boldness to come out openly. The rally they referred to actually caught a lot of them unawares and also show them that Bitcoin is not to be written off as most of the big cooperations are making people think. They will continue to be wrong as far as Bitcoin is concerned and soon they will realise that \"if you can't beat them, join them\"",

Haven't we have learn from the past? Remember Jamie Dimon statement about Bitcoin wayback in 2017?Quote6 years ago from today, the JP Morgan CEO said that Bitcoin is only used by \"drug dealers and murderers\" and he still does not believe in Crypto, yet we got mainstream adoption without him. We don‘t need institutions.https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/1227695So it's pretty obvious that they have their own intentions to create another FUD. But the good thing is that majority will not fall for it. Better just ignored this noises, when we goes on a bull run, they will obviously back pedalled again or we don't know just like what they did before, they could be simply accumulating and wanted to buy at a cheap price.",

Morgan are based on the research report that the Bitcoin ETF might not bring the perceived turnaround that investors are predicting. They are of the view that spot ETF is already operational in Canada and some part of Europe yet it has attracted fewer investors. They are of the view that the positive impact of the spot Bitcoin ETF has been over-hyped because it might not attract billions of dollars as predicted. You don't have to pay attention to these predictions that are based on mere speculations or hearsay. A few months ago the same analysts came up with two predictions on the price of Bitcoin.JPMorgan Predicts Bitcoin (BTC) To Revisit $45,000, Here’s WhyBitcoin at $146,000? JPMorgan Thinks So",
