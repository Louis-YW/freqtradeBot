The ruling leaves the Biden administration dependent on passing legislation if it wants to implement sweeping regulations to curb emissions.The opinion from the court's conservative majority said that \"a decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body\". The justices added they doubted Congress intended to delegate the question of \"how much coal-based generation there should be over the coming decades, to any administrative agency\"....Quote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-06-30-supreme-court-destroys-biden-climate-collapse-agenda.html#Another Supreme Court decision has leftists howling as they discover their “green” dreams for the country may never come true.According to reports, a majority opinion authored by Chief Justice John Roberts states that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not have the authority to reduce carbon emissions, which leftists says is necessary to stop “global warming” and “climate change.”The landmark ruling effectively curbs the EPA’s ability to limit greenhouse gases, a move that sides with coal miners, the fossil fuel industry at large, and various Republican-led states that are not interested in seeing an economic collapse.Fossil fuels are a necessary part of modern commerce. They also fuel the production of food. Without them, society and a large percentage of the population would disappear.When the EPA was first established in 1970, authority was never granted to it to restrict what types of fuel people and companies could use. This means that Joe Biden’s recent decrees in promotion of the left’s radical climate agenda are null and void, unless Congress decides to pass legislation for them the constitutional way.“The opinion from the court’s conservative majority said that ‘a decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body,'” reports Zero Hedge.“The justices added they doubted Congress intended to delegate the question of ‘how much coal-based generation there should be over the coming decades, to any administrative agency.'”Justice Kagan and her left-wing cohorts believe that CO2 is a “pollutant,” allowing it to be regulated by EPAJustice Elena Kagan and the other two leftist justices issued a dissenting opinion, arguing that the EPA has the authority to regulate “stationary sources” of substances that are deemed “harmful” to the public.The left, in case you did not know, believes that carbon dioxide (CO2) is a pollutant that must be eradicated. The truth, of course, is that plants breathe CO2 so that we can breathe their released oxygen. Without CO2, in other words, everything would die....",

Because if it is true that the globe only has decades until we all drown from rising sea levels, then a bit of nuclear waste would surely beat drowning in sea water. But they are not sincere with their efforts, they just want to ram their agenda down peoples' throats and use climate change alarmism as an excuse.",

      "body": "Now we are finding out that things like climate change and global warming are really government permitted and backed FAKE NEWS. How are we finding this out? By what governments are doing when threatened to go without energy to keep their country industries going.In other words, Biden and other world government leaders placed sanctions against Russia. Russia responded by shutting down sales of energy products (oil and gas) to European countries. Now the European countries are going back to coal. To do this, they are calling coal (and other energy items) green, so that they can stay within their own green laws and save face.It took the Russian war in Ukraine to expose the scam of “green” energyQuote from: https://www.naturalnews.com/2022-07-10-russian-war-ukraine-exposed-scam-green-energy.html#The West’s forced transition away from reliable fossil fuel energy into “green” energy alternatives has proven to be disastrous. And thanks to the war in Ukraine, Western economies are finally waking up to that fact.As we reported, the European Union (EU) is slated to bring oil and gas production into the green energy fold – something that even just a year ago would have been unheard of.Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin’s decision to stop the deep state from using Ukraine as a proxy nation to commit atrocities led to sanctions, which led to energy shortages, which led Western Europe to realize that if it does not revert back to fossil fuel use, it will be lights out very soon.Even the corporate-controlled media, which has long praised green energy, is now admitting that we had better get those oil pumps and drilling operations going or else we can all expect a third-world style collapse come winter.“… an energy-starved world is turning to coal as natural-gas and oil shortages exacerbated by Russia’s war against Ukraine lead countries back to the dirtiest fossil fuel,” the Journal reported.Going “green” means destroying your economy and going into POVERTYIt turns out that fossil fuels do not have to be the “dirty” sources of energy that the greenies have long claimed they are. There are clean, safe and efficient ways to pull up fossil fuels from the earth and use them to power businesses, homes, vehicles and so much more without destroying the planet.The EU plans to keep policies in place to ensure that fossil fuels are generated cleanly and responsibly, but no longer will they be on the chopping block for a full phase-out and ban like before.Even “clean coal” is making a comeback as it is needed along with the others to keep heaters going, plants growing and the world economy flowing. Wind, solar and wishful thinking are simply not enough to keep the lights on....",
