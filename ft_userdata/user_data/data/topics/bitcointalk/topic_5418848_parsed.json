      "body": "When you say weak bits, you are referring to the ECDSA signature in the DER area?If so, then you are probably referring to weak keys. It is nonsensical to talk about weak bits individually because all of the bits are processed together, and there is no way to determine a partially (percentage) weak key because the result wouldn't look like a weak key in those cases.According to the link I just posted, nobody has found any weak keys in ECDSA... yet. The same is not true for RSA, though that only happens when you have insufficient entropy. So just use a large amount of entropy to generate your private keys or seed phrases and you should be fine.",

And if someone of you do the same we can discusOk can you tell me what are the inegality you want to resolve?for what i learned the HNP problem is based on the following assumption: α is a secret integer  (it can be the privkey, or the nonce k for R). The attacker is assumed to be given an oracle that given a random sequence of integers ti , for i ∈ {1, . . . , m}, returns a sequence ai such that|ti.α − ai | mod q ≤ Cti is a partial \"leaked\" information knowed by the attacker. so if you don't have ti it's impossible to resolve the inegality system. An other thing intrigues me.. if you are able to guess the upper bit of a nonce , you will be able to guess every bit of the nonce because you just have to multiply R,S,Z by a power of 2 (mod N) to shift the bits at the desired place and redo the guessing..so ECDSA will be broken. In modular arithmetic every bit of a number have exactly the same \"weight\" unlike classical arithmetic where the upper bits have more weight that the lowerIn this paper : https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f8f7/ad041226bb4d2afd504d1372feafafa7efe8.pdfsome techniques are explained to guess certain bits of a nonce but for example you can guess the third bit of the nonce (at a certain index) only if you know the two previous bits and you need for that a minimum of 80 leaked signatures.",

And if someone of you do the same we can discusThe elliptic curves points do not retain the properties of the numbers they represent in such a way that you can perform a modulo operation or check the last digit. The points on the elliptic curve are the solutions of the equation y^2 = x^3 + ax + b (over some finite field), and they don't correspond directly to integers in a way that would allow you to check if their remainder is 0. Lattice is useless unless you know either the corresponding MSB or the LSB for each specific nonce and you cannot use lattices to find them, so why would you create such delusional topic?",
