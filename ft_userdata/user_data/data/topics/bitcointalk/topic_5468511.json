Some people and analysts are predicting that the price of bitcoin may increase in October.

But generally speaking, I do not think bitcoin price is going over $30000 in October. That is just my guess.",

This time the scenario was a bit different, so wait for the opening of the month to get a better prediction. BTW, this post should be moved over to the speculation board. This board is not for bitcoin price discussion; there is a dedicated board that serves that purpose.",

Historically, this is supposed a good month but then again we know that there are times when Bitcoin is simply getting unprecedented with its volatile nature that can be affected by many known and even unknown factors. Seems to me that the market is really expecting an approval of any ETF application before it would have a big bull run and in this case this doldrum can be ongoing into the end of the year. Sometimes I am feeling frustrated but this is something we need to accept.",

However, this month we have the increasing energy price and as we get close to another Hard Winter, for the second year we are going to see increased inflation and I don't think the increasing interest rates policy can help anymore which means this time the inflation won't be accompanied by recession and as a result bitcoin price can finally start going up.As you can see, it is a big chain of events that is affecting bitcoin market, not just the month we're in and what happened in the past!",

A policy change in the US or China can affect the price of bitcoin next month. Interest rates and the economic performance of some nations is also a determinant factor. The price now is around $27,000 which is encouraging,  however, my prediction for October will be $29,000.",

The target within two years is that I can gain knowledge with the experience I gain by following and comparing it myself.Based on the reading I found in all sources, October is a different month from September because September is said to have never been good for the price of bitcoin.I just opened the coin price chart, the difference in bitcoin prices appeared from 26k to 27k. I'm not an expert in this area, but the signs of movement towards 28k in October are already felt based on the situation.",

The least gain in October being 5.5% is a huge rise if you ask me and if we maintain that this year, it might signify that the bulls are getting involved earlier than anticipated in respect of the bull market that is expect to kickoff next year following the Bitcoin halving. I will keep this post in mind and use it to monitor market developments as we enter the last quarter of this year. I think it is wise for those still expecting further dips to start thinking twice.",

There are always several green months and some red, but the number of green months is more on average.Bitcoin price is currently governed by the 50- and 200-day EMA at $26,648 and the momentum is still not enough as the 27777 level is becoming more difficult to break, which may indicate that if we close the month of September at these levels, it will most likely be next month.

The most important thing isn't price action today, I mean all those hoping for a bullish October, what is your plan? To take profit in a bear market? It makes no sense to me because the long run is my main concern. Bitcoin is free to perform anyhow, it doesn't matter because we are in a bear market anyway, and even after the next Bitcoin halving I believe we won't see a pump until we are closer to the end of 2024, many people who aren't in this crypto thing already will feel disappointed, because the majority of FOMO online are pointing towards the next Bitcoin halving, as if after the halving, a massive pump will follow.",

Everything is still a mystery and even though we have analyzed it based on the history of Bitcoin's journey so far, it also cannot give us a guarantee to see whether there is a pump or not.And if next October there will be a pump for Bitcoin prices, I'm still curious about how high the pump will be. At the current price of Bitcoin, it would require a very large pump to reach $40k or even $50k. And it also requires a lot of positive news to push the price of Bitcoin up.So we can only wait patiently and prepare ourselves if the pump comes in October. Hopefully, we will have a lot of Bitcoin to sell a little bit to take advantage of. But we can also save the Bitcoin for future pumps.",
