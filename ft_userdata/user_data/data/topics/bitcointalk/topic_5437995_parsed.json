I'm the one who not act anything about Bitcoin in my local and never spread any news because there's no any reason for me to do it. In my country there's few local countries, but I never use one of them and only use P2P platform. I think even we're not doing anything in the country where we live, but it doesn't mean it will make Bitcoin adoption is decreased, because many investors and people who're looking to make money via online, will recognize if Bitcoin is one way from many.After all, any people who hold Bitcoin regardless how much the amount is, already give an impact on Bitcoin adoption.",

However, it needs more adoption, but this will not happen overnight. You will hardly see anyone in an urban area that has not heard of Bitcoin now, only that some have not adopted it due to one reason or the other, while the government of some countries are not helping out.Notwithstanding, Bitcoin will always prevail and more time is needed for many countries to reconsider, and this will help in more adoption. Also, we have to do our homework if we are truly helping the situation as BTC enthusiasts.I have actually started mine already as I teach people about the coin for free.",

However, I am not hiding from those around me that I am a bitcoin believer and I have an investment in it. I provide genuine responses to questions they occasionally pose. I even explained to them what bitcoin is all about and my own predictions regarding the price of bitcoin in the future. Therefore, it is their decision whether or not to invest. I do not care, and I am not going to be criticized if something happens to the bitcoin price, which is normal given its volatility.",

Bitcoin's popularity didn't suddenly spread worldwide after Satoshi Nakamoto invented Bitcoin. Rather, after the discovery of Bitcoin, few people knew about this Bitcoin, then with the evolution of time and necessity, Bitcoin has now become the most talked about digital currency in the world.I tried to explain the matter with a very simple example. Â For example Bitcoin Forum was created in November 2009 when there were only four new members of Bitcoin Forum now Bitcoin Forum has 3516956+ members.November 2009 bitcoin forum new members 4November 2010 bitcoin forum new members 374November 2011 bitcoin forum new members 1993November 2012 bitcoin forum new members 2708November 2013 bitcoin forum new members 19683................................November 2017 bitcoin forum new members 97283So today bitcoin forum members amounts 3516956+See ref:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=statsThe popularity of our bitcoin forum was close to zero in the beginning, now the popularity of bitcoin forum is very high worldwide and constantly new members are joining the world and trying to occupy an important place in the world. Just like the Bitcoin forum, the popularity of Bitcoin will not be created in a day, but more time is needed to spread the popularity of Bitcoin around the world and more advertising is needed to spread the popularity of Bitcoin widely around the world.",

There's no way a large part of the population will accept bitcoin as a form of viable currency exchange in their lifetimes. But the tech enthusiast can be convinced otherwise. There are programs to make people more and more involved in understanding bitcoin, its use, why it can become the new money standard that can be used worldwide - without conversions and centralized oversight. Things like Summer of Bitcoin is definitely helping people in my country get more hands on with bitcoin (albeit its mostly just university students), but nonetheless, these initiatives come with courses that shed light on some of the aspects of bitcoin that make people avoid it - mostly because they don't know about it all that much.",

Remember it may not be globally accepted because I think today there are still some country who don't have internet facilities to access the digital world, it may be lack of electricity and modern gadgets in such country.

If Bitcoin needs in-person convincing, it's a sign that it's having problems with adoption. People didn't preach adoption of TikTok or Facebook or the Internet to their friends, those things grew on their own.
