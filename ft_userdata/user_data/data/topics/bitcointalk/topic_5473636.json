So many people face this particular challenge with Bitcoin rising which is selling at the wrong time because if the anxiety and anxiousness of seeing little profits added to their portfolio but only if they can hold it a little longer they would discover that would be more better.",

One reason for this is because plenty people are already buying Bitcoin to hold for long at least until the halving. So since there will be no major dump, I don't think price will drop hard. Besides, since next year is halving, an event the whole Bitcoin community is looking up to and preparing to cash out, the bullish sentiment is expected to start this year. This agrees with what I stated before that many people are already taking position to prepare for rhe bull run that will following from the Bitcoin halving of next year. My plan is to join the smart guys that are already buying now because the longer the wait, the higher price go. Today Bitcoin price is above $37k and it might go higher soon since the momentum is still high.",

Bitcoin is something that everyone should HODL now although it is not yet certain of how the price will be by the end of the year but if the price actually continues like this then a 45-50k target can be crushed.",

Since the value rate of Bitcoin is high, so as high amount is also expected to be invested if one must earn appreciatively profits so the risk to paste one into the Bitcoin industry would be very highily expensive too.",

If you continue waiting for Bitcoin to be low before you buy, you might be missing out or get disappointed. Already we are in the starting stage of the bullrun, and it has not reach the hight of being afraid that is too high to buy. When you want to invest in bitcoin always have that mindset that you are embarking on a long journey that will be profitable in the nearest future. For example if you buy Bitcoin now and set you plan to be like ten years from now that is 2 bullrun because it takes 8years to aquare 2bullrun so I think after 2bullish market Bitcoin can never be the same. Is just like a retirement savings but if you set your mind on cashing out too quick you might be missing out. Or probably regret just many are regretting right now.",

It is generally recommended to diversify your investment portfolio, not invest more than you can afford to lose, and make informed decisions based on your own financial situation and risk tolerance. Timing the market and trying to predict price movements is challenging, so it's best to consider a long-term investment approach rather than trying to time short-term price fluctuations.",
