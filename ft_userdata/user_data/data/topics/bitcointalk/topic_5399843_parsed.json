  "content": "The youths have a strong say in politics but they have failed to realise it ,the youths are the most populated in every country ,they should be able to influence the right person,if they come together in one voice and unity under one umbrella to determine who rules them next but greediness and impatience is affecting the youths due to selfish personal reasons to benefit themselves.90% of protest ,campaigns activity are been dominated by the youths,yet they have failed to realise tge have a say in governance, it is been said that the youths are the leaders of tomorrow in politics yet the old are the once ruling in power determining how the country will be runned .Rise up youths and take your rightful place in politics ,you have the energy then put it in use ,make a way ,have a say in the runnning of every country.",

      "body": "Yes, most of them are not politically savvy, they will just show up at the rally, take part in elections and, when the voting is over, will just go back home and go about their business. The youths should be actively involved in politics by participating in political parties and making the electoral choices and voting choices they want.They should be giving their opinions about the type of environment they want to be governed by and whether they are contented with that environment or not. They should also be having robust debates among themselves and with the people of their generation about why they think certain things should be and should not be done. They should know that whatever they do, they should do it for themselves and for their generation, because that is the only thing that can ensure their future.",

      "body": "We might need to compare youth from different countries and compare the influence of some factors on countries youth. Most countries have their larger population in the youth, for a country that spend to help the country, it will have a significant effect. I will consider the following factors to help youths in any country;1. Education will improve the cognitive thinking skill of their youth in choice of leader. They will be able to analyze aspirants, considering the track record in leadership, confidence, articulating his idea and convincing the populace on his or her idea of leading.2. efficient and sane media channels will educate the populace especially the youths on the state of the country, the countries aspirants without bias and more discovery3. Youth that are self sufficient because of available jobs and good income may be difficult to be influenced by politicians with money to buy his vote or use against a peaceful election",

In Nigeria for example, the amount for a presidential ticket in a political party is alarming, there are very few youth who can afford that. And even if a youth buys the form, the next day the police will start investigation on him how he was able to raise such an amount of money.And I the youth manage to vote for their favorite candidate, the system always fine a way to change the right person.If they decide to use their voice and walk round so that the world should see the they end up killing them. Sometimes it's not that the youth run from politics, but the system chase them from politics.",

With that being said, I think there need to be a fine defined line in age that particularly differentiates at what level do an individual starts or stops being a youth.What is obtainable in my country I 40years and below. Without being sonical I think that's pretty much high. I mean, I don't consider someone at 40years of age to be a youth anymore. I think the UN recognises 18-29years. If that could be defined then, you can start defining the roles in the politics of a nation.",
