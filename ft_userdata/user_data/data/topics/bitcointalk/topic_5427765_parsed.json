You can start by working with a reputable escrow[2] on the forum to make it safer for customers.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=53.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=276897.msg2955628#msg2955628- Jay -",

The plan, I will promote my business on social media.It's a brand new world out there. Plain and simple. And the more we all get involved, the better it will get. And the truth is, in this industry anyone can run a successful business. It just depends upon how committed you are in reaching your goals.Quote from: Portgas D on December 10, 2022, 06:22:37 PMI want to ask, is this kind of thing allowed in this forum?Yes, you can start your own cryptocurrency exchange business on this forum.Quote from: Portgas D on December 10, 2022, 06:22:37 PMAlso, is there any way we can make our reputation good and be trusted by consumers?Because definitely in starting this business there needs to be consumer trust in us.It would take a lot to build a reputation as trusted, so your best bet is to put out an excellent product that people want. Also, it is important to be transparent and responsible to your customers.Ultimately, there is no guarantee that your exchange will be successful. There are many factors that can contribute to its success or failure, but with careful planning and research, you are more likely to succeed. The key to success is to focus on marketing and finding new customers but also make sure that you offer something that no one else is offering in the same niche. Also, do some research into all of the regulations that you will have to follow when dealing with cryptocurrencies because some countries have strict laws regarding this, and you can find yourself in a lot of trouble if you don't follow them. You may have to register as a money transmitter or even fall under KYC and AML regulations.",

The social media market has nice traffics, but it'll stop flowing the moment they is a bridge in your capital or you cannot maintain your ad campaign. I think beginning here and posting on some cryptocurrency related blogs about who you are and the services you provide will stand out and give you great rewards when you run out of capital and it'll keep bringing juice to you for years. When the profit is enough then you can decide to switch back to social media and run continues campaign, influencer marketing etc and you'd be surprised at the numerous amount of clients that'll come your way.",

      "body": "That is possible if you really want to do it but I will give you an advice about its risk when you want to become an exchanger. Set aside the risk I mentioned and just focus on safety first which you will surely have to spend money for escrow if you really want the transaction safe or the one who wants to exchange their crypto doesn't use your service unless you allow the user to use escrow. It is not that easy to gain people's trust when you want to start that business. About the risk, there is a chance that you might get scammed but there is a solution for that. An example of exchanger with a platform and very very low chances being scammed. Capital is also important. Maybe you'll do the same and here's the site for you to check https://fixedfloat.com/en/.",

But first before our services and products could start to market themselves, the first reputation that I noticed was considered before clients gave us jobs as a new business was the reputation of the people who have the business. Are they by nature, people who keep to their word even before they started the business?, these are things that can be checked, either by extensive inquiry involving some sophisticated methods, or simply find out from people that know you.

I will prove when what I plan has been realized.Building a reputation on this forum starts by staying longer, and doing small business first. If you just registered and make one or two posts, it will be difficult for others to trust you since nobody knows who you are, and there is no trade history either. Participate in forum discussions, make valuable posts for others, be helpful, etc.Most scammers don't want to use escrow for any transaction, so you might want to use them for a start regardless of how much your deal is worth. There are many escrows with years of reputation here, so there risk is lower for both your client and yourself as mentioned above. Of course, you'll still get a negative reputation even if you use escrow if the deal/business itself is scammy. If you're not going for P2P and instead build a website/platform where the user needs to trust you without any safety net, it would be incredibly difficult to get customers IMO. Unless you post more details about yourself or your business, nobody will use it since there are other reputable alternatives. You also need to be unique, if what you can offer is only a cheaper price, you'll probably struggle a lot in competing with other businesses. At the end of the day, you'll need to be flexible and react according to the situation, so good luck.",
