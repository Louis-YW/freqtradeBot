      "body": "So, we need to ask ourselves, what is God's will^^? >>> God would have all people to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.Jesus says:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/matthew/7.htmAsk and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.Then He repeats it in stronger language:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/matthew/7.htmFor everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.Jesus's disciples asked for faith:Quote from: https://www.biblehub.com/niv/luke/17.htmThe apostles said to the Lord, “Increase our faith!”He replied, “If you have faith as small as a mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree, ‘Be uprooted and planted in the sea,’ and it will obey you.\"Go to that place in the Bible and see what Jesus says following this.Also, in several places Jesus says, \"According to your faith it will be done to you.\"Here's the point. You ARE getting what you ask from God. But often He has to fight your unbelief to make things happen for you. So, they happen slowly... slow enough that sometimes you can't see them happening.Also, whenever you pray for a specific thing, and you don't seem to be getting an answer, consider ALL your prayers. You might be praying other prayers that contradict this one. God is absolutely almighty, but what is He supposed to do about that?Consider what we call the Lord's prayer. Everybody who prays it says these two things, \"...your kingdom come, your will be done... .\" Have you contradicted some other prayer of yours when you ask for this?When your prayers align with God's will, ask anything and it will be given to you. But they DO align with God's will, because it was Jesus Who said, \"Ask and it will be given to you;...\"I really need to learn how to get my faith strengthened.",

      "body": "I think there are 3 ways God answers our prayers.1. Allah will grant it soon, so we are grateful.2. God will delay the answer to prayer. So that we are patient.3. God replaces our desires with the best. It could be that what we want is something bad for ourselves, so Allah replaces it with something better for us.So, let us not be prejudiced. Because God knows what is best for all of us. and of course when we pray our hearts must be sure. This is my opinion..",
