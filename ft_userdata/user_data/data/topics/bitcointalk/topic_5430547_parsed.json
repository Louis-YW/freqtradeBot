  "content": "Hey everyone, today I wanted to check what is the most important goal of a trading strategy.The source: blog.cleo.financeWhy do I need a trading strategy?Creating a trading strategy is like plotting a course on a map before setting sail. A trader needs a well-defined trading strategy because it provides a roadmap for decision-making and helps to navigate the complexities of the market.Without a clear plan or direction, traders may make impulsive or emotional decisions that put their capital at risk.A well-defined trading strategy allows traders to approach the market with a structured and disciplined approach. This makes it easier to make informed and consistent decisions based on the strategy's rules and guidelines. This helps traders to:Navigate the market effectivelyIncreasing their chances of successMaximizing their potential profitsMost traders don’t fail at trading because it is hard. They fail because they are not willing to put in the work to create a detailed plan, test the plan, and then follow the plan.The most important goal is to develop a strategy with positive expectancy. In other words, a trading strategy should have a higher probability of making a profit than a loss.Without a well-researched and tested strategy, trading can feel like gambling, with unpredictable and potentially costly results (looking at you WSB!).In other words: You should not enter the competitive world of financial markets unless you have a trading strategy that produces positive expectancy!You need to know 3 things to determine if your strategy has a chance to be profitable:Win rate – the percentage of trades that are profitableRisk-reward ratio (RRR) – the ratio of the average potential profit to the average potential loss on a tradeTransaction costs – commissions, fees, and other expenses associated with executing a tradeEXAMPLE:Trades: 100Win rate: 50%RRR: 1:2Transaction costs in total: 5% of balance for the 100 tradesExpectancy = (Win rate x Win Size) – (Loss rate x Loss size) – TC = Expectancy per tradeExpectancy = (0,5 x 2) – (0,5 x 1) – 0,05 = 0,45 R per tradeOver the course of hundred trades, you would win half of them (50). But because you can win twice as much as you’re risking (1:2 RRR), throughout the 100 trades you would on average win half of what you’re risking (avg. profit of 0,5R). If you deduct the transaction costs, this comes down to 0,45R of profit for every open position*.*If you risked 100 USD per trade (R = 100 USD), on average you could expect to win 45 USD for every trade you open.The more data you have in hand the better the prediction can be, but these three data points should be enough to tell if the trading strategy is likely to be profitable over the long term or not.The confidence gained from knowing your trading strategy has a positive expectancy is why you’re spending hours building and testing it. You don’t have to decide on the spot, you just mechanically execute what your system tells you.",

The strategies that you're talking about are just a tool in trading but don't give a guarantee that you'll have an accurate win rate, there's no assurance for that in how good you are in trading.QuoteThe more data you have in hand the better the prediction can be, but these three data points should be enough to tell if the trading strategy is likely to be profitable over the long term or not.No, it made you confused, stick to one strategy and switch if it isn't working.QuoteThe confidence gained from knowing your trading strategy has a positive expectancy is why you’re spending hours building and testing it.

If a trader of any standard get greedy, he will be tempted to chase profit and leave out the important trading strategy which will guide them. This is a serious thing for traders, greed makes a trader to increase leverage and sometimes trade in martingale style.",

Trading is not about detailed plan but you must have the confidence and emotion required for trading and if you don't have control over your emotions then you will struggle for more longer time.Trading takes time, you can be a trader within few days, but it takes months or years before you will understand how to use trading to make profit consistently. The mistakes of the new traders are emotion, using high margin ratio, quiting open trade because they do not risk low and not having a backup plan in case of losses (a kind of plan to minimize the loss or that can finally result to profit).But some people will trade and later realized that trading is not for them as they will continue losing and if they do not stop, loss will continue. Some people just have to prefer holding than trading as they are still losing after many years of experience.",

It requires a lot of effort work, time, patience, and experience. If I would like to cover it all here it would take pages and pages. So I wanted to put just one of the perspectives on being successful in trading. And just having positive expectancy is not the magic formula but a crucial one.",
