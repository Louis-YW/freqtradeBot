Do you still use your old Nokia from 1998? I guess not, although 2G is still supported by the GSM network.If something better, faster, safer it's invented, it has the potential to replace Bitcoin.But keep in mind that for this it also has to be at least as profitable to mine as Bitcoin is, else the miners will not change, hence the network safety (for the new coin/system) may not become safe enough.",

I believe most of new blockchain nowadays is much faster than Bitcoin in terms of ToS since they use PoS and other protocol.There’s no second Satoshi just because much better blockchain arrive. Bitcoin is special because it’s the only real decentralized blockchain since there’s no centralized entity or company that control the decision making on blockchain. No one will ditch Bitcoin just because faster blockchains existed since Ethereum exist a long time ago yet Bitcoin still at the top.",

What will happen?There are millions of possibilities out there so we can consider one possibility that another genius besides Satoshi might come up with another blockchain and some other token that would solve more blocks, can process more transactions, and would have lesser fees, more rewards, etc. in compare to the BTC blockchain but BTC or its blockchain has become a brand now.Even if those new projects came into being, which is in the market, because there are many blockchains that can process more transactions, have lesser fees, and can create blocks quickly with more rewards in tokens. But those platforms are not able to replace BTC because they are not being adopted by the crypto community and BTC has gained so much attraction and market cap and trading volume that none of the others can compete with it. So, for the next 20 years minimum and 40 years maximum, I don't think if any other coin can come up that could give solid competition to the BTC market.",

If it is lacking in just one of them, no matter how good the project is, the potential to displace Bitcoin is very unlikely. To be honest, we have often heard of projects that are represented as being able to displace Bitcoin by crypto project developers, but in reality these projects are gradually fading and their value is below Bitcoin and some even end up bankrupt and even scams. This explains absolutely that Bitcoin is a monument to cryptocurrency itself that cannot be replaced.",

So, for the next 20 years minimum and 40 years maximum, I don't think if any other coin can come up that could give solid competition to the BTC market.I cannot agree more with you. BTC really has become a brand, just like old and reputed companies, which are the first choice of all investors to invest money in. Why would an investor spend millions of dollars on a project with a high risk that is being launched in the market in competition with BTC? That would be so stupid, but even though, as you said, many new tokens or coins have been launched into the market, the funny thing is that most of those meme-shit coins make posts on social media platforms.If you missed BTC, ETH, BNB, or some other two or more coins, then buy our shit coin and make 100x. Yeah, many platforms try their best to lure as many people as they can, and then all they do is rug-pull them.Overall, if one does know the potential of BTC like you mentioned, the market cap or dominance would be great to mention here, then that person considering the new upcoming BTC would definitely delete that thought. And for OP, no, we won't ditch BTC at least. I will not do that.",

Also POS dependent coins aren’t even the fastest. We have something like Ripple which uses neither of both and is faster than them, but at the detriment of what? Centralization.",

This is where Bitcoin will always be King and why it isn’t easily replicable. Decentralization is only seen in Bitcoin. None of altcoins have decentralization and fair distribution is harder to achieve by altcoins. They have centralized teams even not anonymous and usually have considerable coins premined by founder teams or minted with smart contracts.With unfair distribution when their blockchains initiate, it is impossible to see fair distributions years after genesis blocks on altcoin blockchains.Because their chains are centralized, rollbacks are big risk like Vitalik team did after the DAO hack and in 2022, some Solana blockchain based projects wanted to do the same or Binance Smart Chain can be halted by Binance team anytime.",
