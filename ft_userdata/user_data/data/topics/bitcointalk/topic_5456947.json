The bitcoin reward is very small. When I checked it in 2021, it was 0.00000007 BTC per hour, which is absolutely a waste of time. Others that I have seen before are like freebitco. Faucets are waste of time now.",

I hope they will not regret there decisions.Quote from: Alphakilo on June 20, 2023, 06:49:07 AMDo we still have legit websites like this today that gives out free bitcoins?Yes, we do have many websites giving bitcoins but not free, we have to perform some tasks and believe me, once you start to perform some survey tasks on Free BTC Faucets, you will disappear in the streets of tasks, and will never complete more than 2 survey tasks, but all you can do is claim free BTC after every 30 minutes or 1 hour (depends on the project schemes) and after 24 hours. But you are not going to be rich even if it would be hard to make a living on these websites.",

Then the price of Bitcoin was very very low and people was newly knowing about it. So faucets paid a good amount for every claim which is much worthy in current price. So now it's impossible to earn any big amount from faucets. Even I think it's just waste of time now a days. Anyway there are also running some crypto faucets but thay are paying just a few Satoshi's . One of the most popular faucet is https://freebitco.in/You can play gambling also in it.Anyway now I will not suggest anyone to work in faucets and waste your time. There is a lot of alternative works which may generate you more funds than any faucets.",

It makes no sense if someone has already done it before, this is not those news that need to be share few times on the forum to warn people about some hacks that's ongoing so as to reach many people in a short time.

There are still a lot of faucets these days but I don't think it's worth of your time to gather all of it and check them out hourly or daily. There are referrals for which you'll earn from the other people claiming on these faucets using your referral link and that's affiliate marketing. That's one strategy that you can do for making quite good amount in there but without such and just plainly doing it, it's an absolute waste of time unless you're having fun.",

Currently, you have to mine, buy or earn your bitcoin. I have not seen anywhere where they are giving people free gold even in Gold Coast (Ghana) where gold is mined in large quantities. So don't expect to get bitcoin cheaply like in those good old days. Getting free BTC faucets is time time-consuming and the price is not encouraging. Don't also be in haste to join any platform or website where they have promised to give out free bitcoin. Most scammers use this mouthwatering offer to swindle unexpected investors. Many people have been scammed or their accounts hacked because they trusted these scam sites that offer free Bitcoin. I have read the thread by Gavin Andresen and I have always wished I was part of the people that benefited from his liberality. These are bitcoin legends that sacrificed and invested so much to make the bitcoin project a success. But I doubt  if I would be able hodl my coins to date because I might have sold them just like many impatient people did.",

I missed my chance to become rich. I don't think we have any website available from where you can get free bitcoins anymore. The faucet websites used to give couple of Satoshis but they all have died down. The only way to make significant amount of bitcoin is through trading or mining. The signature campaigns also gives out some bitcoins to the participants. Nothing is free anymore.",
