  "content": "Didn't get the Covid vaxx? You are a 'Pureblood' on the global eugenicists' To Do list. But don't worry. You (we) know better this time around. Let's vote the bloody sons-and-daughters-of-b****es out of office.Hunting Down And Slaughtering 'Purebloods' On The Global Eugenicists 'To Do List' As They Unveil More Draconian 'Solutions' To The 'Problems' THEY Created To Usher In Tyrannyhttps://allnewspipeline.com/Globalists_Will_Turn_Truth_Into_An_Executable_Offense.phpWhile we had hoped that by now, with 2022 coming to a close, we'd be long past reporting on COVID and the globalists rush to impose medical tyranny upon anyone who still has the ability to think for themselves and rejects their 'mRNA death shot concoctions' that have been PROVEN to be killing and maiming people while they aren't stopping anyone from getting COVID nor passing it on to others, nor dying from it, we can't do that right now with more and more stories that keep popping up showing us the globalists are far from done in their rush towards all-out medical despotism.Perfectly seen in this new story by Dr. Paul Alexander reporting the World Health Organization has just put out a video calling 'Purebloods' a \"major killing force\" who are responsible for more deaths than gun violence, global terrorism, nuclear proliferation or cyber attacks, the WHO none-the-less ignores all of the previously young and healthy Americans and people all across the world 'dropping dead suddenly like flies,' most dying of heart attacks and strokes and dying without any discernable warning signs.So as Dr. Alexander's story pointed out, not only is the WHO calling the unvaccinated 'a major killing force,' they're also calling for 'political solutions to address this,' most likely the kind of 'political solutions' they're unveiling now in Australia where anyone questioning 'the science' behind the vaxxes is being designated a 'terrorist' as heard in the 1st video at the bottom of this story.Reporting that Australian Police have announced counter-terrorism teams will be monitoring \"anti vax conspiracy theorists\" who show \"concerning behavior\" (which they regard \"conspiracy theories\" as), encouraging Australians to report anyone who engages in what they deem as \"conspiracy theories\" to contact police directly, or contact crime stoppers, while advising the public they'll be looking at all social media sites for 'conspiracy theories' being posted, they continue to ignore the exploding 'death count' among formerly young and healthy Australians who'd taken the death shot concoction. ...Murder They Wroughthttps://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2022/12/28/murder-they-wrought/As readers know, I am concerned that the neoconservatives' drive for US hegemony is the road to nuclear war.  But we also face demise from other directions.  In this column I share thoughts on the use of orchestrated pandemics to destroy economic independence and civil liberty and to reduce the world population, a declared goal of Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.  In subsequent columns I will address other threats that go unattended.Professor Michel Chossudovsky, emeritus professor at the University of Ottawa and Founder and Director of the Centre for Research on Globalization, has made an important point.  The injection of a dangerous substance into a large percentage of the world population was not a mistake, but an intentional act of murder.  https://www.globalresearch.ca/video-pfizers-secret-report-on-the-covid-vaccine-beyond-manslaughter-the-evidence-is-overwhelming-the-vaccine-should-be-immediately-withdrawn-worldwide/5780561 Pfizer and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), charged with protecting public health, knew in February 2021 that the Covid \"vaccine\" that went into use in mid-December 2020 was deadly and under law should have been recalled.  Pfizer's own internal documents recorded 1,200 deaths from the vaccine and tens of thousands of adverse health effects including cardiac disorders and spontaneous abortions over a two month period.  Understand, the report, which was to be locked up for 75 years, was a forced release resulting from a federal court order to the FDA. It is Pfizer's own internal report.  It is not a report by independent medical scientists that some pretend \"fact checker\" can label as \"misinformation.\"...",
