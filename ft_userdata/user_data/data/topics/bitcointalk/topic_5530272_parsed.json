I wanted to ask you up to what amount users are protected, but with a quick glance at the footer area of Fold's website, I can safely say that the earlier quoted part from the article isn't accurate: \"Reward Accounts and bitcoin assets are not FDIC or SIPC insured.\"Quote from: fredericktaylor on February 11, 2025, 07:07:51 PMWill this card from Fold be profitable in the long run?It depends on how those rewards are given to their users and the freedom they have in using them [judging by how other platforms that provide a lot of rewards do these types of stuff, the end result tends to be less enjoyable].",

Marketing 101!If you want Bitcoins, just buy them directly using your money, not through some rewards program.And likely to be that whoever using the credit card for purchase with the interest of earning rewards would be more attracted to sell their bitcoin just for the rewards and that seems stupid. Question should be that how long are you to keep running transactions there before you can accumulate tangible values of Satoshi that can be valuable?To an extend, it's wise enough to be skeptic and critically obsessed to why the centralized technologies on bitcoin are you he ones offering users rewards. That certainly seems unsafe and an architect of comprising the dividend of utilizing the decentralizations potentials of bitcoin if time not taking carefully with those craving for something cheap on bitcoin.This impending risks of using the credit cards is equivalent to those holding their bitcoins on the centralized exchanges.",
