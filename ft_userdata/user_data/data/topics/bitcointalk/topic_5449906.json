It's a great topic, otherwise I only stumble upon the thoughts of lonely people. But sooner or later everyone starts a family where you no longer have your freedom, and all decisions must be coordinated. The family always makes decisions based on the fact that everyone is happy. And of course a double investment is much better than one. But then the husband (most likely he will be engaged in trading, or creating a wallet for bitcoin holding) has a double responsibility. You need to think through your investment decisions even more carefully. And especially if there are children.",

      "body": "I agree that investing in Bitcoin can be a really good option especially for long-term investments, if the married couple thinks it's a good fit for them then why not? It has the potential to provide a great profit that can benefit the entire family, including their children and themselves when they're older. In addition to that, it can serve as a backup fund in times of emergency, avoiding the need to borrow money from friends or take out loans. However, it's important for both partners to educate themselves on how to use it and prioritize security measures (Seed phrase and private keys) to keep their Bitcoin safe.",

In families where both the husband and wife manage their finance together, there is a need for both parties to understand the sector before investment. No party should coerce the other to invest in Bitcoin because of the risk involved. Just like any other investment, Bitcoin can be profitable if the family is focusing on long-term investment and not just to get a quick profit. I have seen families buying stocks or company shares for their children with the intention that it will appreciate in the future, I consider Bitcoin better than most stop. So investing for your children in Bitcoin might not be a bad idea. But note that we will be always counseled to invest what we can afford to lose because profit is not certain or guaranteed.",

Agreed but if the couples must invest with knowledge that it is not a get rich quick scheme. They must also know that it is money that they can afford to lose that would be wise to invest in bitcoin. Never assume that investing in bitcoin for 1 or 2 years will get rich quickly because it is a get-rich-quick scheme too, so if a partner plans to invest in bitcoin with the hope that their children will grow up in old age then that is good but one thing for sure they must be prepared for all risks because the price of bitcoin is very volatile.Quote from: Davidvictorson on April 23, 2023, 07:35:29 PMQuoteIt will also help their childrens future and also their old age.True, but nobody truly knows what lies ahead for bitcoin in the future. Everything for now is simply speculations and hope. Rather than investing all their money in bitcoin for the kids. A portion should be invested in real estate. The couple should practice diversification. But bitcoin has a good history of speculation, hope we always believe in how Bitcoin will go forward, so we always try to invest in what can be done.For me asset diversification is important, never put all your money in just 1 asset because that's wrong, so try to diversify in several assets, Real estate, Gold, and savings are important as stable assets and can also be used as an emergency funds.",

It is such a brilliant idea that I would also love to try as well, it is such a bright idea seeing couples going into the same investment, especially Bitcoin among every other coins which are not too rest assured to venture into. Also, understanding the support and resistance point in trading is very important in order to avoid investing on crypto when the market is at the bull point instead of buying when it is at the bear points.",

      "body": "Bitcoin could be very good investment option, besides real estate and gold, for couples who had the orientation before tying the nut or with partners who are open minded and have started learning about how it works. Love and money don't bond well in a relationship without trust, and the economic times hasn't made it any better. Stories have aired lately like that of Hakimi, the PSG player. Such divorce sometimes cause huge fines and the sharing/splitting up of investment including crypto assets and property. It is always a gory tale.  If both has made long term investment in Bitcoin and happen to divorce before the said maturation of the Bitcoin investment, the forceful withdrawal and sharing of whatever was invested might cripple the dream to earn big from long-term investment in cryptocurrency. If it is to trade and earn too, a miscommunication or quarrel might even discourage both from making the crypto trading idea work.",
