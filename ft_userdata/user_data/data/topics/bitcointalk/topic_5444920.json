I mean as a watch-only wallet?If the password is your concern, are you able to remember some characters? Or hope the characters not long? You should be able to recover few characters with btcrecover",

If you can't remember where you save it there is a low chance that you can recover this wallet.You can do brute force but you also have a low chance to recover passwords if you forgot them you can only increase the chances to recover them if you remember the password partially.",

This is automatically checked, so in the vast majority of cases adding a password also encrypts the wallet file and therefore prevents you from opening it without the password. You can, however, uncheck this box, which will then only password protect the private keys. So you can open the wallet to view the transactions and addresses, but cannot spend without the password.Quote from: Lavey666 on March 15, 2023, 01:00:11 AMi think i opened without a password the back up file, then its a watch only wallet because i can see all the transations but still cannot use the btc, i believe this btc is lost, thank u for your helpIf the wallet is truly watch only, then it will say that at the top of the wallet window. Something like \"Electrum 4.x.x - WALLET_NAME [watching only]\".If it is not watching only, and you have simply forgotten the password, then you could attempt to bruteforce it using https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/. This will require either for you to have some idea what the password might be, or to have used a weak password in the first place.",
