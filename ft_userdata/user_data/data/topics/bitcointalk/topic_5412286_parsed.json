      "body": "The delays that altcoin exchanges have when a chain split takes place is because of all the problems that the shitcoins have which is why the delay is usually the same everywhere. Considering that ETH centralized power will attack any remaining chain that splits, there is a high chance that you could see a lot of problems.If you don't want to face such delays and not want to have your shitcoins stuck in the exchange you have to store them in a wallet where you can control the keys but then you would need additional software to claim the shitcoin on the other chain(s) which could be challenging since a lot of shady software are released at times like this.Then you can see which exchange opens up deposits first and send both your shitcoins there to dump. But again you'll face a risk of the exchange starting to let people dump their shitcoins but not open deposits until the price goes lower.",

      "body": "I think all exchanges have the same latency and the fact that you will receive the fork coins sooner does not mean that you can sell them immediately because exchanges once they haven't done the distribution, they won't rush to open trading for that coin fork.The best way is to wait instead of thinking that it is more profitable to get early and sell early, regardless of the risks and hassles you face when using another platform.In my opinion, binance is safe enough for us to use, then they will have the best solutions so as not to affect the interests of customers.",

Binance is a superb exchange is just that they are lousy when it comes to distributions of such event which are proven in the past. There are some airdrops that not even reflecting yet that occured last year. So Im not gonna used binance for this kind of fork support cause it will take a while for sure.",

You need to store 100 ethereum coins ($155,000) on exchanges to possibly earn $3,200. This is shitty risk management.It is better to create a new wallet in a metamask and transfer money there before taking a snapshot of the blockchain, then return the ETH coins to your wallet. Then try to sell ETHW.",

Supporting and listing a new coin does not affect them as they are just an intermediary providing services.Quote from: AbuBhakar on September 04, 2022, 01:55:50 PMBinance is known for supporting all kinds of fork coins during the hard fork of blockchain. They are the most reliable centralized exchange when it comes on handling hard fork because they always support fork for there user conveniency. It’s better for a user that has low knowledge on fork to leave his token on Binance rather than put his money at risk on handling the fork token alone since we don’t know exactly what’s the procedure while Binance has a top rate developer that doing this job for there customers.I’m not suggesting that leaving tokens on exchange is good. I’m just suggesting that it’s much better rather than make the completely newbie user DIY on this kind of things that might put his asset at risk.Indeed, binance is the top exchange we have at the moment so it is futile to look for an alternative. In situations like this, I still recommend everyone to keep assets on top exchanges to avoid unnecessary fork problems. Storing assets on a centralized exchange is not recommended, but short-term use should be fine.",

But if you don't like it there, still take time to research about popular wallets like Ledger, Trezor, MEW, mycrypto, etc.The usual wallets that are supporting ETH. You will have the idea if they're going to support the fork through their blog pages and if you've missed it and they support it, they'll just automatically credit it.",

I also wrote there that OP will not be able to sell the received coin there as a result of the fork, if it takes place, since according to this message https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/205de0801a4741c98270fdea6cb06697, binance does not guarantee its listing.",

The exchange site will lots of whales but i think that you must not always think if the fork will happen. This is a speculation if there might be a fork but it may not happen as well. It doesn't matter how long it will take but im sure that binance will halt all of its activities related to the ethereum  and so ethereum fork receiver will not able to trade on binance. That will always have different value compared with another exchange site. Storing in binance will give you more advantage rather than another exchange site. So many whales on binance.",
