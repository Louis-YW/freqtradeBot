If you visit the homepage of the website in question, you will see that it's the cloned website of coinb.in. I recommend everyone to avoid coinbin(dot)homes and any other service that is advertised by coinwalletonline.",

However, after clicking the coinbin.homes indeed it's a clone version of Coinb.in.It's weird on the first access on the site because they pointed you to a different page without exploring the site you will never know that there is a trap.",
