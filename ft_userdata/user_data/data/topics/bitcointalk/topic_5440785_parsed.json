Or the amount of money you will want to exchange when they will go away with your money or making it inconvenient for you? No matter how low the money is, if they see your coin as a tainted coin, they will force you to provide KYC documents. But aside that, I think they are trustworthy exchange, I mean the one like ChangeNow and Changelly. But as for forcing KYC, do not trust any of them because they are centralized and they have control over your coins once you send to their address given you.Quote from: mk4 on February 22, 2023, 05:45:43 AMPersonally, I just use the typical spot exchange like KuCoin as they currently don't enforce AML/KYC.

Also not good to leave coins on exchanges like Kucoin if not using it to trade.",

Let me know your opinion and personal experience, if any. I undergo KYC on my exchange account which makes my limit a bit higher but my highest withdrawal that I made on exchange in one transaction is around 20,000$ when Bitcoin first hit that amount last bull run. Honestly, I don’t trust exchange and I’m not comfortable sending my balance in there but the lack of trusted alternative push me to do this kind of transaction.In reality, I don’t trust exchange even a penny. In regards with the withdrawal amount. Having a bulk or multiple transaction doesn’t make sense at all as long as you didn’t reach your limit because exchange measure your total balance and not the amount you are withdrawing out.",

      "body": "I used different instant exchanges in the past but never go past $100 per transaction. Personally, I also don't trust any of them even if they claim no KYC for any trades, no auto-lock, etc. Whenever I trade using this kind of service, I always assume my money is gone if they don't send the promised coins/tokens I trade within 1 hour. You should not follow this. I think what I did was a bad practice if security and reliability are major concerns. I stop using them after most services that I use support BTC.Quote from: libert19 on February 22, 2023, 04:56:29 AMWould you agree that it's better to do several small transactions rather than one big one? Giving up bit of convenience for safety of your assets? It is really hard to tell. Who knows, maybe they implement a volume policy without giving you any notice, so that if you hit that $1k mark, or whatever number that they set, you'll need to undergo KYC, or your address get flagged for malicious purposes. It means even if you only send them $10 per trading activity, you can still get flagged. I'd suggest following other methods suggested above, especially if the instant exchange service that you use is new or has a terrible track record.",

Let me know your opinion and personal experience, if any. Well-established instant exchanges won't kill their reputation for some thousand dollars, at least I think so. Also, several small transactions in a short time-frame may look suspicious. If you don't want to submit your KYC documents in case they request them, then I suggest you to never exchange instantly more than you can afford to lose.You can find a good list of instant exchanges at Bestchange.com | They have a good list with reviews from users.Some instant exchanges have lower limits, like the max amount to exchange instantly is 0.6312228 on FixedFloat but the max amount on EasyBit is 100.84 BTC. Definitely, no sane one would trust them with that much BTC. FixedFloat's max amount looks logical and honest for me.",

Yes but it's only to make it less risky for you.As you already know, most instant exchanges are centralized and can freeze your funds. The idea is that when they do, only a portion of what you're trying to swap gets locked as you did not send them all at once and did a one by one exchange. Further, there's a notion that the higher the amount, the more likely for it to move up on their radar. However, do remember these exchanges also collects user information e.g. addresses connected, IP, etc. that could identify related transactions so I'd say make it different each time.",

I cannot remember the maximum amount I transacted with them, but it was a few hundreds of dollars. I started using it with small amounts. Everything went smooth and quick. I eventually trusted them with relatively large amounts. Nothing untoward ever happened. I also got significant amounts parked in centralized exchanges before. I experienced a number of incidents. As a matter of fact, I only got lucky with Cryptopia because it reopened very quickly before it went dead for good. I got my Bitcoin back. The rest of the coins sunk with the exchange.I don't actually trust any of these platforms. Even P2P trades are not worth trusting. Escrows and other security mechanisms should be in place every time. I prefer to have a number of small transactions rather than a single large one, and for obvious reasons.",

After few days of self-deliberation I eventually went through with it as amount was far from negligible and I simply couldn't pass this opportunity to buy dirt cheap btcLesson learned though so now on non-KYC exchanges I send only the money I am willing to lose and ofc I am extra careful with 2fa recovery codes.",

Especially back in the days when they charged ridiculous withdrawal fees, I sometimes withdrew a low-fee altcoin and used an instant exchange to get Bitcoin again.As a test: try to exchange 0.1 LTC from your wallet into Bitcoin in your wallet, and see which exchange gets you the most. Many \"classic\" exchanges won't even let you withdraw the Bitcoin because it's under their minimum amount to withdraw.For large amounts, instant exchanges are usually more expensive than \"classic\" exchanges.",
