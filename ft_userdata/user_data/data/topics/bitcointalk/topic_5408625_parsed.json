I know they did(distributed??) the sol noctis and many other coins I've purchased, that seem to be not as limited as they said, but otoh, you can't believe any site anymore IMO... I remember they always seem to take fckn forever to send the coins as well. I recall the delay on the sol noctis bulls was quite a few months, amounting to a pre-order basically... I do like the design too, so not complaining there.  Go doge! Edit it's themed like this one as well... https://www.topworldcoins.com/en/liberty-united-crypto-states-1-oz-proof-silver-coin-1000-satoshi-2022-united-crypto-states",
