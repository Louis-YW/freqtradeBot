      "body": "According to my findings, this is the first time that Spogomi go internationally, because 2023 is the first Spogomi world cup. Although Spogomi is not new, it started in Japan in 2008 which is aimed at good ways of collecting unwanted materials/trash in a specific areas and dropping the unwanted material in the correct places in categories. This is nice to know about. As it is going internationally and more countries are knowing it, more people will watch it and know the rules and how they can gamble with it. Probably with time, gambling sites may start to include Spogomi as one of the sport people can gamble with in their sites. Gambling sites will first make their findings too, to know how people are watching Spogomi matches, how locally in each country too that they love watching the sport. The more people watch it, the more gamblers that know about it. If many people are watching it and well recognized, gambling sites will introduce its gambling into their site.",

Maybe in the next couple of years, when the sports becomes a major one or at least it got the hype surrounding it, maybe some top tier platform are going to list this sport.So short term, No, doubt that it will be included. Long term and again if it gain audience throughout the world, then there might be a chance for this sports. And to be honest, this is the first time that I have heard about it, so I might do some research later so thanks to the OP for bringing this up to the community.",

Spogomi sounds old fashion to me to be included in casino games since the process of playing the game may be difficult to be encrypted into online casinos, since this game is about the cleaning of trash and collecting unwanted material I am kind of surprised how that will work, but I am sure that if casino fine the game lucrative and being able to generate passive returns there will find their way to develop it.",

If this sport become popular and more practiced in countries the amount of waste and trash in our marine life will greatly be reduced, which is good for our earth. This is the kind of sports that should be encouraged and not that rubbish of a sex competition, showcasing sexual immorality in daylight.",

Maybe it's not so popular in my country. With 20 nations competing against each other there must be a lot of people following it already. Picking up trash is a good thing, so the sport would actually better the life of many and should be supported. The problem is that casinos will add things only where there is real demand for it. Do you know many other people who are interested in the sport and would bet on it? Maybe contacting a sport bookmaker directly and tell him how high potential demand would be for the sport. Another point is how competitive the sport actual is and how fair the tournament is organized.",

      "body": "Huh interesting. I don't think it's ever going to be one though, cause idk, the entire game seems like it focuses on uncontrolled factors. To compare it to eSports (which I mostly watch), it's like the sense of randomness BR (such as Apex) gives, but it can be balanced out due to the skill of the player themselves (and the other factors that the game added to fix that sense of randomness), unlike in this case, where it's well, completely random. It'd probably be better if tournament organizers were the ones who scattered the trash around to create a sense of control, but that'd defeat the point now wouldn't it? But hey that's just me. It is a relatively new sport though (imo) so that may just be the simple reason as to why casinos don't have it. Maybe give it half a decade more to grow and we might just see them in casinos.",

Or other ideas such as the pokemon game, picking up trash at the point that has been provided by the game in a certain time, so you can go to the next level.",

In this game, you need garbage.  Even if Spogomi added, not one Bitcoiner will bet. I don't think someone in here are actually a fan. Would you be considered athlete in playing this game?",
