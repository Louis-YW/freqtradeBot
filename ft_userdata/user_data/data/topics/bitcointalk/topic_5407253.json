      "body": "The language doesn't work this way. It can't be spoken the same way everywhere. Language is a way of perception of reality which means that even the people from the same family who were taught language in the same time will have slightly different, their own language. In England there're lots of habits and cultural features which can have nothing in common with Irish English, AU English and so on. Also when language expand its sphere of influence it goes through the way of simplification and variability. It's a natural process which can't be stopped",

If you share similar mindset with a country or you enjoy/like their contents you will likely learn their language quickly. I don't really think deep accents or different in similar language is the issue.Back then I enjoyed the British English because of BBC but when I started knowing things that should never be known by foreigners I started finding it a bit repulsive & difficult to understand. Likewise the American English... you tend to like it when you watch their movies but things begin to change when you interact with them or watch their independent contents on the internet.",

      "body": "Well, I think the English language is spoken differently in different parts of the world. It's not a matter of one being right or wrong, it's just a matter of dialect and regional variations. So, while you may find it easier to understand the English spoken in the US because it's closer to what you're used to, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's more correct or more proper than the English spoken in the UK, Australia, or Ireland.",
