I think you are mixing it all up in terms of the sequence of events. You consolidate a domain, set up the forum software and then you hire the mod positions.That forum last few posts seem to be AI spam as well.Do you even own this forum or are you just pretending to be the one owning it? Sign a message from that forum for your own sake if you want to prove even an ounce of legitimacy.",

Since it is voluntary OP has nothing to lose if finally sells it. But the website looks good (but a copycat of bitcointalk.org) and the domain name is suitable. I suggest you make it a paid Job position since he has intention to sell it. But Â a deal with some conditions can be signed and a volunteer can take the job. But it will be painful to work for free expecting to grow the business and it is finally sold and you go home with nothing.Quote from: Yamane_Keto on October 26, 2023, 08:13:50 AMThe maximum number of views for many topics is 25 and the number of connected people is 5.

If you want to have a paid moderators then surely you'll get a few moderators because of your this post but if you want a free moderator then I'm sorry to say but you won't get anyone from this forum who would moderate the forum for free. Let's be serious if you are really in need of a moderator then you should at least offer that moderator a salary for his hard moderation work, and that way you may get some moderators from this forum. But, still I don't think that any reputed member will trust you because your account is still a newbie rank account and that's why you should also have someone as escrow if you want to offer a position to a member of this forum.",

Do you have resources to fund the project.Â  Speaking from experience, I have much experience working as a forum moderator as I have done with with forums as well as communities but I want to know if you have enprovisioned resources to cover for it.

I checked, it seems like it has no traffic and just a couple of posts therefore why do you require moderators?

If that is the aim, he will fail because at this moment in time there is nothing of interest in that Ethereum forum.",

      "body": "@OP I agree with everyone that you don't have much visitors yet and what you need to focus for now is to increase the visits that you get. There's nothing to moderate yet on your forum and that's why if you're optimistic in increasing that, you need to do something. Basically, some other forums have already done the advertising through bitcointalk through different marketing methods like campaigns and other advertising stuff. We're just giving you the idea but if you take that as an advice, that's good for you. But if you don't take that as something helpful for the growth of your forum, that's also okay and we can't do anything about that. And I guess they're also right about you saying about \"growing together\" this is like a volunteer post and not paid.",

I'm sure you're still considering selling, right? Then thinking about hiring someone for your purpose with the simple machine forum 2023, sounds like making a pond in a pond.Â  The purpose of people in forums is also to benefit many people with knowledge and loyal activeness, and there is reciprocity from the project owner to get provisions (worthy of his work) to continue to be active, either daily survival or additional for him, of course it is balanced, right?Â  I don't find your offer for people interested, you can correct sir, your journey is still far away and prove that you are serious, it doesn't hurt while you continue to be active and synergize in bitcoin talk, in my opinion this is good and you can work on it.",
