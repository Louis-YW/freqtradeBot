In the short history of Bitcoin, this has proven to be a fact, but given everything that can happen in 100+ years, the question is whether there will be people at all, let alone Bitcoin. Far from being pessimistic, but when I see what is happening in the world in the last 2 years, I wonder if some super virus will erase us or if some lunatic will do it by pressing the red button.Quote from: virtualdn on May 09, 2022, 12:33:11 PMGo on, make the rich guys richer. They will be happy to buy it from you, but remember, once you give it away it's gone.It's always the same game, big fish eat small ones and that can't be changed without completely changing the way small fish think, which won't happen in the near future. Yet anyone who sells BTC at any time has the opportunity to buy at any time, the only question is at what price.",

Unfortunately I do not have extra money that I can hold and therefore for me I have to sell more of what I have from the campaign to take care of everything. Because of holders like you the whole network is more or so stable. There are more than 50% major holders and whales maintaining the balance against trading. It's amazing how you held onto even after the high in 2018-19. I have known plenty of people who exited from the whole thing after making slightest amount of profit. Right now there are people already placing bets on : 1. Bitcoin hitting all time high in 2022 I also do believe that it would be the central body around which the whole concept of currency will revolve considering the adversities that the world is facing right now, from pandemic to the war. It's only going to get better.",

When you go through different market cycles, the thirll of price increases does not impact you much, neither does the panic of price drops, it's just a series of ups and downs, depending on the season, and the assurance that the price net direction is upwards.Quote from: death69 on May 09, 2022, 02:30:43 PMYou are a true Bitcoiner among us all.

Selling your Bitcoin a times when you needed the money does not make you mad of a bitcoiner, it was something you had to do.My advice would be to manage your investment and only put in money you would not need in an emergency situation, that way you will not need to panic sell.Quote from: death69 on May 09, 2022, 02:30:43 PMThis cycle is deadlier than all the previous.

I don't think those who have sold some of their coins along the way will be happy reading this and seeing that they are have been called \"weak hands\". Your act of HODLing for long since 2013 is really commendable, but still on... doesn't justify criticizing others who maybe have faced more difficult situations than yours. Some people did not sell just because of the dip which we all know is temporary, some other situations necessitated it and everyone has their thresholds.",

Its really good to see that someone who had been able to hold for 9 years which is something that someone could not easily be done due to lots of ups and downs where you could really potentially able to sell or cut loss whether its a pumping or declining market.Its hard when you do really make yourself aware on the condition of the market or simple been seeing or checking activelyunlike when you are just simply holding and dont stress out yourself when it comes to price and make yourself that fixed mindset on selling out on near future or in the right time.",
