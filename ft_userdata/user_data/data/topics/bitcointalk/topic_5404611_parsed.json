The downfall will still continue if bitcoin was not getting a recovery. You must see how worst the current chart is. Massive dump is still happening and prepare yourself for another drop that may happen soon. We didn't know how low bitcoin can go but 10k may be possible for bitcoin before it will  reaching another ATH again. It's still years away. The project like metahero can be dumped even more.

That's a dreamer's price, as for those saying Metahero is not like BNB and ETH well you are right, it was like when PYR was trading at 2$ years ago and went up to 40$ each, Bigger coins dont hold the key to massive gains and moreover, no risk no reward, OP DCA on Metahero if you believe in the project.",

With the price of bitcoin going back to 19k and sliding even below, downfall is definitely possible - but this is a price and not a project's downfall.Specifically giving statement is not possible because every project is unique and prices dont necessarily indicate the current development status of any project. For altcoins, if you have faith in a coin, do invest in it at the low price, but the faith in important.For bitcoin I am expecting further crash and therefore my suggestion is to put a hold on the buying for sometime and observe the market for further movements. Day trading should be stopped by any newbie at this point.",

That's why anyone in the crypto should have prepared themselves for this situation. Im sure that bitcoin will be going even deeper soon.",

The current situation is still very unstable, and we must be prepared to deal with anything bad that may come our way. At this time I won't be choosing P2E or NFT projects, but I will instead choose the top coins. As a result, I believe that a lot of coins will disappear or will never recover after the bear market ends, so be careful in your choice.",

For example Metahero.The market is still unstable, Bitcoin is still correcting so I think another downfall are really possible to happen especially with the altcoins. It’s important right now to invest only on good coins so you can know that they can still have the chance to recover, it can be more safe as well. I do invest on top coins as of the moment, hoping that they can survive on this bear market because if they do, more profit will come to those who also bought at a cheaper price.",

For example Metahero.I don't think that anyone can give you a clear answer on that because all we can do is just guessing. I personally think that there is definitely another downfall possible maybe even way more than that. I also think it is possible that we have not even seen half of the bear market that is still coming, but of course that is also just my personal feeling. The last few days have been pretty bloody already again. Bitcoin is below 19000 USD at the moment and Ethereum is just barely above 1000 $ per coin.For me it is kinda unexpected that Bitcoin is losing just as much as most of the bigger altcoins. In bear markets in the past Bitcoin was more stable in such situations.",

It would be unlucky to hit something like that, I would guess that only 1-5% of the market will go to zero, most of them will either go down a lot or go down a little during bear market, but not to zero.But, there is a possibility of a few of them going down like that. Considering there are tens of thousands of projects just on CMC and at least that much not listed on CMC that means if you see like a thousand tokens go down to zero, that's still under 10% easily. Those could go down, but if you are lucky then you will be holding one that didn't go to zero at all.",
