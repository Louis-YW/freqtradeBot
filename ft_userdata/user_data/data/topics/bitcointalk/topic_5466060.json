Also, yahoo is another campaign manager that has managed a lot of campaigns and known doing this stuff.I see it the same way. I have worked with both Yahoo and Hhampuz for several years now and can highly recommend both from a campaign participant's perspective. Who I have not worked with personally is icopress, he also enjoys an excellent reputation in our German-speaking community as a bounty manager and also shows again and again with new ideas that he wants to get the best possible out for both sides - the company behind the campaign and also the campaign participants. @OP, so I would just contact them and get in touch with the one that suits you best.",

The format is same with Reddit and nothing to see that much on the forum.I suggest to improve the forum first before you start advertising it because thereâ€™s nothing to do there with limited content available. @Julerz12 is your guy if you want a budget friendly campaign since he manage few campaigns before with not that huge budget.",

You project looks like a reddit news scrapper, It would be best in your interest to start a reddit social media campaign than a signature campaign. Above all it is your choice, as I feel you won't be able to generate the required traffic through a signature campaign.If you want I can help you in promoting your project at a cheap price. I am sending you a proposition letter with how all the details through a DM. Please do check and reply.",
