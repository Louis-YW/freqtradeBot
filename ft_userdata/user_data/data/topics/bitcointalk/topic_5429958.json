  "content": "What happened:Fake team member and possibly another hit and run project by the \"dev\"Suspect's Profile Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1234777Suspect's Website: https://fifafanbattle-club.com// | the archive I did kept redirecting me to \"Socios\", anyone knows why?Suspect's ANN thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5428603.0 | archivedSuspect's whitepaper: https://fifa-fan-battle-token.gitbook.io/whitepaper/ | archived archived team section too Fake Team Members:They introduced following people as their team members:QuoteOur TeamThere are 8 people in our team, not counting investors. Those involved in the promotion and development of the project:https://t.me/Dave5907 MOD, he follows the chat, answers questions.https://t.me/Peter_FFB admin chat/owner the creator of the project.https://t.me/Luella_Collier_FFB manager battle organizes and conducts battles between fan tokens.https://t.me/Henry_MltchellFFB | https://t.me/FFB_Sophia manager CEO develops project marketing, buys advertising, conducts events to increase the audience.https://t.me/Fifadeveloper DEV the developer of the project.We also have technical specialists who monitor the safety and performance of the project.​Then you got Peter as well. He is the creator of the project, and he is actively contributing to a majority of aspects in regards to the development of the project. Again, inspired probably from others as well, because success is never granted. Lou Ella is actually the battle manager. She's going to take care of that particular fan battle. I'm going to say improve part. Right? Because you will need to improvise a lot when it comes to that particular utility. We're going to get to that part in a second. Then you got Henry. He is the CEO of the project. He's the one that actually got in touch with me a couple of weeks ago to talk about the project. He's actually pretty much involved in a bit of everything when it comes to marketing strategies, advertisement, various opportunities to expand, conducting events to increase awareness and attract more audience as well, which is probably one of the main aspects of the project. Sofia is one of the other managers, pretty much developing strategies of progression, whatever that might include.And then you got Phil, who's the developer of the Smart contract. These are six of your core team members and there are two other contracts hired to analyze and review the performance of the project.Three out of six of these people they listed as their team and contact, Peter, Sophia --by the time this post was made, you can find her under \"FFBc_Sophia\"-- and the account dedicated as DEV didn't have any identifiable photo, while the MOD himself, Dave, is MIA. However, Henry Mitchell and Luella Collier are kind enough to put a very professional profile picture to convince us: For anybody watching Twitch --I don't--, there's a slight possibility you're familiar with Henry's face, username GODofDANGO, whose introduce himself as Eugene of Moscow on his IG profile, not Henry. He probably didn't even know where'd Henry come from. As for Luella... err... I'm not sure I'd like to spell it here, just conclude them yourself from the image, LOL. No plagiarized whitepaper --that I know of-- so far, since their Whitepaper is very very light, a very strange thing for a project who claimed they've partnered with big league organizations like LALiga, UEFA Champion, and Serie-A, and other 120+ partners, which they are yet to provide the proof of partnership that I've been asking for.Additional Notes:It might be wise to mention that the OP for the project, GubiMixa1292 has a history of hit and run project in the past, [ANN] Brick Worlds Play2Earn PinkSale Whitelist which clearly very dead as per today and their website themselves are now offline. Suppose they tried to defend themselves by saying that they're just a hired community manager, they did a very poor job on DD since they accepted projects with such quality as that and this one.GubiMixa1292 might also used their alt to fake enthusiasm and traffic, username john.eck that's already tagged by Avirunes back in 2019 for multi-acc and bounty abuse were necromanced back online after a very long period of sleep to \"participate\" in their event --yayy!!!-- and on the next post suddenly became their part of team.Quote from: john.eck on December 14, 2022, 04:16:13 PMI will try get the 60$!Quote from: john.eck on December 17, 2022, 10:40:26 AMWhitepaper on progress.

These people will develop an attractive site, show all sorts of fake partnerships and get fake profiles from LinkedIn to attract investors to invest in their project. Most people will fall for this scam and invest their hard earn money in these fake projects.Quote from: Saisher on December 18, 2022, 02:30:25 PMThey even launch a bounty campaign where the reward is their shit token bounty hunters should be made aware that they are going to get a worthless token.Most bounty campaigns are already running on this model, where they get literally free advertisements as they will give you their own tokens. I am seeing this trend for last few years and it is still continuing. I wished if the bounty campaigns were limited to btc or stable coin payment and not in the native worthless tokens.",

And according to that trend they start planing about the next scam. Currently Avatar 2 is trending in various mediums, I wouldn't be surprised if scammers use this Avatar 2 trend to come up with a scam website. Because they can do whatever they want to scam people, and spend money to promote it. After observing their activities so far, I understood this.",
