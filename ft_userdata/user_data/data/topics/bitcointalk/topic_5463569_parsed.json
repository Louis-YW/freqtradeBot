This topic will be suitable in politics and society or off-topic boards. It has no relationship to individual, organizational, national, or international economics. Discussing the economic effect of the change of the Twitter logo would have been ideal. However, Elon Musk is a lover of the alphabet X and he has always used it to name most of his firms such SpaceX, xAI and X Corp.,",

And i actually like the formal twitter logo it was different and unique i don't really fancy this new logo which is x and i feel elon is trying to use this name for all is assets starting from tesla and space x and i think elon is even more obsessed with the space project i think that is were the x is coming from, and some times i have problem identifying twitter since i have to start looking for x and since we the user does not have a say on how he runs is business if not for that am very sure a lot of users are not that comfortable with the way elon change the name and the logo and very soon tesla to might have a change of name over time and since elon has interest in crypto he might invest in a project and also call it x.",

Maybe he is a fan of \"The X-files\" TV series of the Triple X(I remember that there was a wrestler with that nickname). The new X social platform will become a major competitor of the social platforms owned by Meta(FB, Insta, Threads) and it will be more censorship free and maybe more oriented towards the right wing conservative people. This is means that it will gather users from the former right wing social media websites like Parler.",

I saw some topic related to the twitter change, but I most of them more focused on Elon Musk, but then again the X company is actually Elon's personal obsession. Elon has been wanted to make the X company since he was still in PayPal, he wanted to change PayPal to X company but the boards reject that. He finally made SpaceX, and now when he has twitter as his very own company no board nothing, he could do what he has been wanted to do. Finally established X Company. Some people really bothered by this, but for me I really don't care, the platform is still offering the very same service nothing is changed, just some renaming, Retweet >> Repost. What's bothering me is acually the blue check mark submission, I use to rely on twitter to contact a customer support, and there are a lot of scammers pretend as a customer support, I used to just check whether it has checkmark or not, now I need to double check it.",

Haven't your heard of Intellectual property right? The trade mark and copyright. Elon has been the same person with the same dream from day 1 and the reason for choosing X will remain his trade mark, nobody can explain the reason why he chose that except him and the people around him, everything that surrounds Elon Musk has X and it has the relation with Space X. There could be more reason why chose that to replace Twitter platform to X but in my opinion, the name X has already a big brand that is globally known and its reputation, it will be easier to brand it for to that instead of using the parent name Twitter.I am not sure, but it could also be attributed to the similar app(Thread) Zuckerberg created some days ago that mimics Twitter, and to protect the code and copyright, they have to change it to X to keep it from other people from abusing the creation.",

I make use of Twitter regularly for getting updates and other things, and the changes were not pleasant to me at all.

There was no reason changing the iconic bird with generic x except the fact that elon is obsessed by brand \"X\". He has already tried it before (naming things as X), and then there's the SpaceX. Thing is that Elon doesn't seem to understand the point of branding and what it means to have 15 year old brand that was working. I am guessing elon is also losing his mind over the fact that meta owns the name X related to social media.I wish i could say that naming it X was the most moronic thing in this fiasco but you only have to follow his tweets to see that he has completely lost it. I got tired and stop using it with several accounts.Too bad, i used to like twitter. It had it ups and downs but now the whole experience is so toxic that i am not touching it. I guess i have to try threads to refill the void when ever it comes to europe.And i am not going to call it X. I am just calling it twitter that died.",

He brought the design of the back of the phone in front of the camera and the same logo that is used on Twitter on the back of the phone is used in Elon Musk's phone. That means maybe he is going to open a mobile company where he will make phones like the famous expensive brand phones which will be called X phone. This is just my personal opinion, I don't know what is the meaning of his sharing this phone picture but initially I think he might be bringing a phone in the market.",

Well, we all know that twitter was sold to Elon Musk which works for NASA. If you could do your research about Elon you can find that he had a company called \"SpaceX' so maybe he took the inspiration from it. I think for Elon there's no really particular reason to change it maybe he just like to change it. Since he is a billionaire where he could do whatever he likes without thinking of the sales if it could have a bad impact to Twitter. Actually at first I'm not used to Twitter becoming to \"X\" but it really gives me a modern and futuristic design which really suit to Elon Musk. But for me minor changes could have a bad impression to users just like you OP.",
