  "content": "Hello crypto bros.Today I want to discuss a pretty big problem that bitcoin adoption is facing. Bitcoin is great in means of anonymous transactions and getting away from the banks and government control, but the problem is, it's the exact problem why criminals are using it. And it's a pretty big one. I'm not saying that criminals use bitcoin more than fiat, but we all can see that illegal services are widely accepting bitcoin.The problem here is that the system should have some way to fight these criminals because we don't want bitcoin to be associated with drugs and sex trafficking,  but the problem is, by solving these problems we should get rid of anonymity which is a pillar for the bitcoin technology, so it can't be done. And this problem might be a big obstacle in mass bitcoin adoption and regulations that are coming. So I want to hear your opinion: how to make bitcoin technology \"safer\" so we could fight a crime committed with crypto and help with bitcoin adoption without taking away the main features of bitcoin like decentralization and anonymity?",

It was already pretty common since then, and one thing the government did in order to prevent criminals in doing illegal acts such as trafficking and laundering, they introduced the KYC system which is up until now the problem for every person who just wants to do trades peacefully and anonymously.Even in the real world, there are still illegal activities we keep seeing or hearing on the news daily, while people say that money is the root of all evil, there are people like me who believed that it just an instrument and the people who are doing those illegal activities are the ones evil. Money or even bitcoin only served its purpose of being a currency, coz if money is literally the evil here, all of us would be arrested and be put in trial on the court for using such illegal instrument. In conclusion, until now there is no exact ways and methods to keep bitcoin safe, since privacy and reputation (by reputation I mean, bitcoin's reputation), will never go along together and also impossible to happen.",

I don't care if Bitcoin to be associated with drugs, money laundering, sex trafficking etc, as long as I don't use it for bad purpose, there's nothing I should need to worry. Ask yourself, can you make sure and verify if every fiat money you get from banks or other people are clean money which not associated with drugs and sex trafficking?Money is money, there's no dirty or clean money.",

Means they are indeed compromise those illegal people. Comparing to bitcoin and decentralized, its really contradicting the situation. We cant argue with OP since criminals are really taking advantage Satoshi made and that has been seen everywhere. Like the seized of chipmixer, whom discovered been used on laundering.OP since bitcoin is fully decentralized, I doubt anyone can stop from using that as a means, unless someone regulated a thing concerning that which I think can be implemented on the ongoing space of bitcoin. Maybe for other coin can still be salvage but not in btc.",

The police and the juridical system must find and punish those criminals. We can't do anything, in order to stop the criminals from using Bitcoin.Fiat is being used by criminals as well. Do you think that the central bankers around the world care about this fact? Maybe they do, but that's not their main problem. Do you really think that the criminals around the world would ever stop using fiat currencies? I don't think so.Many criminals and scammers are using gift cards. Do you think that Amazon, Google, Steam and all the other major corporations are going to stop issuing gift cards, just because scammers are using them for criminal activities?",

I don't think so. the same goes for the use of Bitcoins for money laundering. it's not Bitcoin that will be the focus. but it is the bridge between fiat and Bitcoin that must be controlled. therefore KYC solutions on exchanges are indeed quite important. there is no denying it if you want to combat this abuse. and that means it will be difficult to be truly decentralized and remain anonymous. when everyone remains anonymous, even the perpetrators of the crime there will be untraceable.",

It's not like nothing we can do, we could actually report some addresses that doing illegal stuff to be aware with them. Much better to get traced but due to its decentralized system it would be hard for them to get caught that's why most of the criminal deeds are also open in Bitcoin. And some scammers who caught some newbies that doesn't have an idea to their crime. It would be hard to retrieve what's loss.That's the pros and cons of Bitcoin, it give people power to control and decide for themselves wether to win or lose without exposing your identity. However the cons of it is that its also open to illegal activities especially the volatility of it unlike fiat money.",
