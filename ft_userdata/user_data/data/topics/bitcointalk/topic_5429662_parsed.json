      "body": "I will answer \"can\" instead of \"could\" since it's not surprising anymore to see centralized exchange collapse, including the popular and biggest one. Back in the days, Mt.Gox was a biggest and popular exchange at 2013-2014, but they got hacked and then the customers lost all of their money. Although there's many article said Mt.Gox is trying to recover their customers money, but until now there's no realization at all.If you hold centralized coin that can be easily get manipulated and can't trade in decentralized exchange, better to sell it e.g. ETH, BNB, etc. But if you hold Bitcoin, you don't need to worry since your coins will be safe 100% as long as you hold it on hardware wallet, if all CEX collapse, you can still use DEX e.g. Bisq.",

The way they are defending themselves, which seems like blackmail, doesn't seem like someone who is 100% sure that if their finances are reviewed nothing will happen. And on the other hand, the authorities have to investigate Binance regardless of the effects that the investigation may have on the cryptocurrency ecosystem.",

Although it did not disclose this amount as a percentage of the value of coins deposited by customers on Binance, it has confirmed that the scale of Binance customers’ withdrawals has skyrocketed.From my personal point of view, I don't want Binance to collapse, because this is a channel for me to realize my cash, but there are indications that centralized exchanges have received a huge impact. The coin withdrawal movement is more enthusiastic, which also indicates that centralized exchanges are facing great challenges. There may also be a chain reaction.I saw similar news again today, and felt like another huge thunderstorm.QuoteOn December 17, the Dutch cryptocurrency trading platform Bitvavo stated that it has lost access to 2.8 billion euros (about 29.7 billion U.S. dollars) in assets stored in DCG.",

These are just cries of a drowning ship wanting others to get drown with them which in no way is possible. Binance has made name for themselves so why don't they do the same by making a good name for themselves instead of wanting others to sink with them.  So far to the best of my knowledge, binance has been up and doing in the blockchain industry as a decentralized exchange.  For years since her inception, there has been lots of drastic changes in the decentralized exchange as a result of the good policies implemented by binance which forced others to follow make such on their platforms. Binance has made many centralised exchange sit up in the course of rendering Services by their Reformation policies and development. A niche binance has created for themselves which will be very difficult for anybody to pull down. The fud peddled by rumour mongers will definitely be invalid.",

I would say yeah, Binance is one of the Top crypto exchanges in the crypto world but that wouldn't mean that if Binance was taken down the whole crypto ecosystem would collapse over their head. It would be more like MTGOX and it would bring the industry to its knees but it wouldn't be the end of it. It would be a terrible shakedown, but mostly, who would be affected would be those shitty cryptos and other centralized cryptos that are good for nothing.The story of crypto is full of FTXs and each time that happens the real cryptos get out even stronger. Even so, I do not think Binance will go down. What can maybe happen is a US clampdown on the company. And if that so happens Binance can easily flee to another country and keep its operations running elsewhere.",

Most of the traders including whales use this exchange for there trade and imagine if this assets will be forced to sold on the market just to pay all there customer when they file bankruptcy.

If the collapse of the Binance happens, then the damage to crypto currencies will be huge, due to which many projects will simply cease to exist, and the entire industry will slow down in development for an indefinite period.

It will be too late to save your money after an accident, so it is always better to prevent (prepare for a negative scenario) than to try to solve problems when they arise.It is impossible to predict events, especially when don't have insider information.
