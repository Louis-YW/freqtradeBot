  "content": "Hi guys,If it happened that you read my previous post about dumpwallet: I updated it as I have done dumpwallet.It was my second dumpwallet :-)I have a question about reserve addresses which can be found in dumpwallet file.I can see 3 different kinds of addresses in dumpwallet file.1. Labeled addresses. The ones that are visible in the wallet, they are the ones I ever received btc to.Labeled addresses obviously may contain btc.2. Change addresses. These ones that are invisible in the wallet and accessible through dumpwallet.These ones may also contain btc. After my first dumpwallet I found the whole balance on change addresses.3. Reserve addresses, the huge list.The question: May those reserve addresses also ever contain btc while listed as \"reserve\"?Additional question: What are those lines in the down part of dumpwallet file which contain \"script=1\" ?Thank you!",

      "body": "I thought reserve addresses were your keypool addresses (addresses that haven't been used yet but might be).For backup purposes, the keypool used to store 1000 addresses in your wallet by default (I think) so that backups could be done much more infrequently without the chance funds could be lost.There's a chance this still exists even if you have an HD wallet as the addresses can be scanned through for received blocks to see if there are any utxos designated to those addresses on the blockchain.",
