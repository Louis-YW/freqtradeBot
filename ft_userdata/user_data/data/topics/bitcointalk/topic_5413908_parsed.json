  "content": "Mike Maloney, author of the popular video series \"hidden secrets of money\" and a prominent investor in gold and silver, is very optimistic about HBAR.I'm not very tech savvy so it's hard for me to make an educated guess as to why this technology could be successful.But Kevin O' Leary, multi millionaire investor known from Shark Tank, has also invested in it.Please share thoughts about this project.On their website they claim that bitcoin was gen 1. Ethereum gen 2 and they are supposed to be gen 3 of public ledgers.From their website:QuoteBitcoin pioneered decentralized infrastructure and Ethereum brought programmability. But earlier proof-of-work blockchains consume massive amounts of energy and process transactions slowly in order to achieve acceptable levels of security. Heavy bandwidth consumption by these technologies leads to expensive fees, even for a simple cryptocurrency transaction.The Hedera proof-of-stake public network, powered by hashgraph consensus, achieves the highest-grade of security possible (ABFT), with blazing-fast transaction speeds and incredibly low bandwidth consumption. By combining high-throughput, low fees, and finality in seconds, Hedera leads the way for the future of public ledgers.Well known companies like Google, LG, Boeing, IBM are on board with them.",
