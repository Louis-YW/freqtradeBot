  "content": "Your college degrees are racist, so you should burn them. Everyone who disagrees with me is not just a racist but is also a racist racist. The only thing worse than being a racist is being a racist racist.I was a professor. Universities promote violence. Universities have promoted violence against me. Don't even try to argue with me unless you were a professor too. Universities have refused to apologize for their evil because they are f@$%ed up. You probably don't see this as a problem because you are also f@#$ed up. Your racist American money has racist images of racist slave owners on it, so you need to give me your racist money so that I can dispose of it properly because if you don't, then you are a racist racist.You may send your racist money to github.com/sponsors/jvanname so that I can dispose of it for you. I won't even charge you for all the effort I take in disposing of your racist money properly.",
