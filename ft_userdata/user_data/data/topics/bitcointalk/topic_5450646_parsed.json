If your dressing looks so catchy or rough in eyes then people will address you with what they see from you but if you dress a decent way despite any expensive phone you are using I don't think if police man will badge into your privacy wanting to know whom you are or not, or even seeing you to be a yahoo boy and whatever they feels. With the way I do dressed I have never come encounter with any policeman for any reason instead others will be embarrassed while they leave me to go my way because i always looks responsible.",

Here no be oyibo land wey you go wear rag and nobody go send you. We get our culture and na dat our culture mindset na him police for our country dey use still discipline the youths. I no dey try justify the brutality against youths for our country but sometimes we suppose know how we go dey dress comot for public, because the way we dress naso dem go address us. I know of some people wey get money and still dem no dey harass dem but rather respect dem because of the way dem dey dress for society. To the police and we the masses, we all have dis mindset say person wey dey do yahoo dey always dress anyhow and dey made it look so because thatâ€™s what dey always do and dis has affects even those that knows nothing about that. If we no wan make dem take us the same, make we know how we go dress and look for public because those men no get joy, before you go explain yourself finish you for don chop beating finish by then. So make we dey careful always and pray all this harassment ends soon.",

To be frank with una no be every body wey Sabi approach or even talk to somebody. Some people dey talk like say the person wey Dem dey talk to no be human being. So tell me wey somebody to talk to police man wey dey vex in that manner why them no go harass am. Na una area be this wey people need to look into. Police officers na human being too so make people mind the way Dem dey talk to them too because them too na people husband's, fathers etc. Them deserve respect irrespective of the nature of their job.",

Them they always think sae youths no suppose to the excel for this our country base how the country be like. Na why the IG of police suppose to organize training and seminars for them to make them understand that there are so many legit jobs out there apart from Yahoo that a youth can get himself into and successful in life. A youth wey get car or look flashy no be crime. Quote from: CryptSafe on May 01, 2023, 03:10:23 PMAnyways wetin una de Yan here make sense o becauseÂ  e get the parable way say dress the way you want people to address you. In as much as dressing get side effects for our daily life engagement and activities too e good make we look responsible where ever we find ourselves because dressing follow de command respect too for where person dey and that one too dey pave way for person as well.Na correct talk you talk so. Em get one phrase wey people d talk so ''the way you dress na so people go take address you''. If peso dress in a responsible way, police no go get mind to embarrass you or begin question you unnecessary via em source of income. I don notice and witness am on several occasions that a young guy wey look responsible hardly draw attention for policemen dem eyes than the ones wey no look responsible. But Inasmuch peso dressing code tells more about peso doesn't mean that those that dress flashy are not cool-headed. For this our country, it's better to stay and play gentle than to enter police wahala because their accusations no be here once they find out you d stubborn and you go by their bindings",

For Nigeria, the law dey only apply for the poor masses, because if police arrest big men or their family members, them go just call one commissioner of police and the case don close, unless na big man versus big man. Them say bail na free, but make them arrest you, carry you go police station, person wey come bail you must pay money, unless you call one force personÂ One day for FESTAC i see police peopleÂ  just come down from them motor, begin dey drag one young guy inside them motorÂ The boy startÂ  to resist, na so them begin to beat the am, eventually them push am enter the sienna, and drive away. If the young man no be suspect and dem treat am like criminal, e dey very bad.Â The thing move me to intervene for the matter before them drive off, but who I be, dem go end up arresting me join the guy, Ã®Ã®and if I no get person wey go bring money to bail me, my name go be sorry. Na fear make me no record them, because them dey see me, assuming say I record, them go intimidate me, collect my phone to hide evidence and arrest meÂ I don see am happen well well.

Person no go fit drive car or use expensive things again for this country..Abeg make una help join mouth for this matter...This issue of police officers frustrating youth in this our country too much and it getting out of hands.but if anyone want to avoid frustration from police officers or any security personnel we need to be addressing decently all time because many people and police officer believes that bad addresses are done by bad people.so addressing properly is what we always need to consider to free ourself from this police officers harassment because I always found see that youth addressing decently are always free from frustrations.to be honest police officers were not that acting in this manner to youths before but some few Â years back these are know to police officers that many youths are doing illegal things Â now are days like take drugs or they are sources of income is more not legal.One adage goes, \"It's one bad apple that spoils the bunch,\" which means that simply one poor apple among many can cause people to assess everyone else negatively.Someone might not be a nasty person, but depending on how it may address them, they might think you are one of them.Therefore, if police officers are attempting to separate the bad from the good, I do not see that as harassment but many are just simply perceiving it in that way but they are doing their duty to protect the citizens, so if you are not doing illegal things, I think you should allowed them search you, sofar it is their duty too.",
