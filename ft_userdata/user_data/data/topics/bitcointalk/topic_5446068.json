And for it to have a value of about $28,000 and be listed in the world's electronic trading means that it's a high-value asset that is tradable.It's you that should plan your investment in this asset very well and will always be making money. Even if you do not know much about Bitcoin and trading generally, just be sure that you learn how to read the peaks and bottoms of the asset.Then invest when it's always at the lower levels to maximize your profits.",

But I hope you don't force them to accept your explanation because, for other people, bitcoin doesn't make sense, especially since there are already people who have benefitted from it. It's not easy to teach bitcoin to them but it's also a challenge for you.I suggest teaching them slowly and trying to open their minds to the fact that technology has advanced and we must be able to adapt to it. Bitcoin is such a technology that it takes a willingness to learn to accept it.",

You could try being a bit calm and focused and your sure to have a better composition than what you've got now. A lot of repeated ideas that isn't coherent.Meanwhile, its never idea to invest more than you can afford to lose. Selling your property to invest in bitcoin or cryptocurrency isn't the best of ideas, you might profit in the long run but, its best to be safe than sorry becuase, you might panic sell should the market go bearish and coin dumps.Always invest with spare coin, it would save you save you the pressure of having to think about either your profiting or loosing.",

The deal of investing my property money in Bitcoin has been done already.Sometimes taking quick decisions just because you want to invest in bitcoins can end regretfully. I am of the opinion that rather than you quickly deciding to sell the property, you would have first considered leasing it especially since the property was just shared to you. Real Estate (Property) is still a good investment because the value of real estate appreciates with time. By leasing the property, you would have still had some money to invest in bitcoins and although not as big as when you sold, but that would have been okay still since leasing will give you some constant amount of money based on agreement.From how it looks, since you sold part of the only property which you have that was shared to you, the amount you have invested in bitcoins is an amount that you cannot afford to loose.",

I hope you won't be offended and feel bad because of some of the responses from other people.Because everyone has the right to express their opinion according to their own thoughts.I think you've made a good move when you're not greedy to risk everything just to invest, I think what you do is you just try to take advantage of the big opportunities with the property you own in order to get the maximum profit too.I hope you don't regret your decision and focus on your goals and I hope you will be successful with your investment plan.",

I have also read about men who made fortunes from bitcoin; they did not sell anything to buy bitcoin; it was the opposite. But in this forum, there are a lot of stories by some users who claim to sell one thing or another to invest in Bitcoin. Selling real property to invest in Bitcoin is, in my opinion, absurd.But in the OP's case, he said he divided the property into two portions, so the second half is his plan B, should the virtual asset fail his expection. At the same time, people who make this type of decision should always be prepared to accept the outcome and not live their lives as if everything depends solely on their Bitcoin investment.",

You need the information to make financial decisions. And from your thread, you don't have enough knowledge about investing in bitcoin. You said you have already sold half of your inherited property and invested all the money in bitcoin. This decision is not a bad one because you might end up benefitting from your investment. But one of the golden rules of buying and hodling bitcoin is to invest what you can afford to lose. You also said you want to start educating people about bitcoin. I hope you will teach them the basics of bitcoin and don't just introduce Bitcoin as an investment but also teach them about Bitcoin as a currency. Don't persuade them to invest in bitcoin because they might not know the risk involved. After the have embraced the coin, some of them mightt decide on their own to invest in the sector.",

It means that you're putting money where your mouth is. And by that, it's actually the great initiative that you did, unlike the others that keep on talking about how they've discovered bitcoin and how they admire and hope to have one but never did anything in taking risk of it. Good thing that your father didn't discourage you and forced you to take back the money you've already done investing in bitcoin. Because with other stories that I've read, they've been forced to take it back due to the uncertainty that owning bitcoin is portraying. Yeah, there is that feeling because this is an asset that's highly volatile but worth it to have if you understand it wholly.",
