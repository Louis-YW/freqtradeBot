  "content": "Mining Reward The MizarCoin network follows a meticulously planned reward system for its miners. Currently, miners are rewarded with 6000 new MizarCoins per block, and this reward is subjected to a halving event approximately every 6 months, or after every 262,800 blocks have been mined. This deliberate reduction in block rewards ensures controlled supply. In line with this strategy, the MizarCoin network is scheduled to produce a total of 21 Billion MizarCoins, which is 100 times the number of currency units compared to Bitcoin. This carefully designed supply model establishes MizarCoin as a resilient and attractive digital currency, with ample availability for users and investors. Join us as we shape the future of digital finance with a thoughtfully planned ecosystem.M-Scrypt The M-Scrypt algorithm, in comparison to certain other encryption algorithms such as SHA-256, exhibits greater resistance to ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) attacks. ASIC attacks are a form of targeted attacks on specific encryption algorithms, where custom hardware is employed to significantly boost the mining power, potentially compromising security or accelerating cryptocurrency mining. Here are some reasons contributing to M-Scrypt's resilience against ASIC attacks: High Memory Requirements: The M-Scrypt algorithm was intentionally designed with elevated memory requirements. This means that when executing the M-Scrypt algorithm, a substantial amount of memory is needed to store intermediate data and states. This complexity makes the design of ASICs more intricate and expensive, as they must incorporate high-capacity memory chips, driving up costs. Lower Parallelism: M-Scrypt, in contrast to algorithms like SHA-256, is less amenable to parallel processing. ASICs commonly depend on parallel processing to enhance performance, but M-Scrypt's design hinders high levels of parallelism. As a result, ASICs have a relatively smaller advantage in terms of performance when applied to the M-Scrypt algorithm. Higher Complexity: The M-Scrypt algorithm involves more computational steps and intricate operations, increasing the complexity of ASIC design and manufacturing. ASICs must support various operations and calculations, making them more costly and adding to the difficulty of their design.In order to prevent malicious exchanges from listing our tokens, we will not disclose the source code for the time being.
