And the reason behind this is a prior to FTX collapse that it would save people from third party risk.Needing a third party, middle man to confirm your transaction, to complete a trade, to play as an Escrow is nothing wrong.It is only wrong if you choose a bad one to use. Bitcoin with its Peer-to-Peer transaction design and its strong, decentralized network, can not be attack (in practice) and no censorship is a good third party, a middle man for you.There is chance for a network 51% attack but cost is bigger than benefit and today with bots to nearly instantly detect wrong things on-chain, many full nodes globally to detect suspicious things, such attacks will hardly to gain profit.Lastly but in my opinion, most important, don't read any news from bitcoin [dot] com. You have bunches of websites to read news, don't read news from that site. Because it is from Roger Ver team, a scam team of Bitcoin Cash. You don't want to be a free shiller for them, do you?Archive https://web.archive.org/web/20171212053559/https://www.bitcoin.com/They only changed to Green theme after failing to say Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.",

Most politicians' interest in cryptocurrencies stems from the collapse of FTX, so I expect that any law will be passed that will protect their investments. Therefore, I expect that there will be further tightening of licenses for CEX or any exchange platform based in the United States.I do not expect that there will be a law that encourages people to use wallets that give you full access to your transactions, and they may ask you to deposit them in banks.",

These are just publicity stunts to get some attraction from the new adopters (newbies) who are adopting BTC due to the bull run and the hype of ETFs.No is my answer to your second question. Senators, governments, etc. hate DEXs and they love CEXs, and the meaning of this is not to embrace the use of DEXs; instead, the purpose of this act is to embrace the use of non-custodial wallets, those whose keys are under your ownership.",

This is aimed to destroy bitcoin in the US, because they know nobody will use it if people have to go through KYC before they can download a desktop bitcoin wallet like Electrum.

Sometimes the unexpected happens, but this isn't going smooth for the democrats and this is democrats that really want to stop bitcoin.Next year, Democrats may no longer be in power and their anti-bitcoin acts are receiving a strong resistance right now. Imagine what happens when they have a minority and the president is a Republican. I'm speculating, but you can in a way predict if these acts will get a strong or mild resistance and all the \"ban this ban that\" acts usually get a strong one, like when they were trying to ban mining and states begun to add the right to mining as a local law.",

But it's unclear if this ever actually happened and if it did than how common it is. So it's probably just a preventive measure. But I doubt that such act will get passed, legislators have a lot more things to do than to bother regulating Bitcoin.",

Sure plenty of people use hosted wallets on exchanges to make things more convenient, but those things had to be built into the bitcoin ecosystem, bitcoin itself is all self-hosted naturally. CEXs vs DEXs doesn't have anything to do with this, if this became law it would just keeps things as they are.The only reason I see for this sort of legislation is because some politicians who don't yet understand Bitcoin are too used to money in the banking world so they think custodied wallets are actually the norm and that self-hosted wallets are not the norm. It's those few politicians who think that there is something wrong with self-hosted wallets because they aren't educated up on Bitcoin and blockchain enough to understand that self-hosted is actually the natural/normal thing in this space. They are trying to fit blockchain concepts into banking concepts so they think keeping your money with companies is the way to do things. We see a few politicians occasionally bring up such silly ideas over the year due to their lack of any understanding of how blockchain works, like when they talk about only allowing custodied wallets, or only allowing exchanges/businesses to take money when they know who it is coming from, etc - just stuff that simply isn't at all how blockchain works. This legislation just is trying to point out in law that it is legal for people to use blockchain in the normal way it is intended to be used since some politicians still have an upside down view of how blockchain even works.",
