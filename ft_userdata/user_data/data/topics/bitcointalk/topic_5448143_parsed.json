I think practicing your answers to common interview questions and maybe trying some relaxation techniques to help with the nervousness. Just remember, you've got this!",

      "body": "It is always good to prepare the day before your job interview and make sure that you get enough rest. Another thing that you should strongly consider on how not to stutter is to get in front of a mirror and practice how to introduce yourself. Also, try to answer any questions you think your employer might ask you. Remember to do as much research as possible on the position that you're applying for, this will help you very much. The more knowledge you know about your position, the less stress during the job interview. Speak with the truth and if there is any question that you don’t know the answer to, it is better to say I don’t know than to stutter and try to come up with an answer. Remember to relax and breathe which is the most crucial thing to do you may begin to start feeling nervous but as long as you remain composed and cool, you will be fine and won't have stutter problems for your job interview.",
