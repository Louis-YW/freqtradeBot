Doing it again todayReport the post to the moderator and leave in the comment that it is a plagiarised post, the moderator will do what's left of the job, i do not think moderators come to the reputation section to look for or handle plagiarism reports, if i understand well this section is not for that. You can also make this report in the thread that Poker Player directed you too, this one. *Edit* i have checked, and i see you have made a report in the thread (1), you can leave it to the moderators now.",

Although these accounts are wearing signatures of 1xbit as they were in their pervious seasonal campaign but not selected in their latest active campaign.
