Recently there was a flood and a notebook containing a offline wallet was damage and it destroyed part of a WIF private key, so now I basically have:Kw**********(I have the next 40 characters, just not posting for obvious reasons), so I am missing 10 characters in all.I also have the public key. Is it possible to use this software to start a search at Kw... and iterate over the missing 10 characters with the known 40 characters also in the key.For example : 1B2Q8vPm5E5b8yxaNWUW5ZfdCR5Zu1KMJn - is the public addressand for the WIF private key I'd have Kw**********jcQmKRPNTF8CU9H1thzC981DCrZgmS4m8ygXFCEk (this is just an example, no funds are here)basically I want to always have search for private key start at 'Kw', then search for missing 10, and end with 'jcQmKRPNTF8CU9H1thzC981DCrZgmS4m8ygXFCEk'Any advice is appreciated and examples are even more appreciated. I do have a programming background, but I don't have much experience programming to use GPUs, which I imagine I am going to need, so I am open to any and all suggestions, other than just giving the key over to someone. I will offer a reward to anyone who successfully helps me with this too.Or is 10 characters just too many possible combos. All advice is much appreciated!Thank you,S.1PfNh5fRcE9JKDmicD2Rh3pexGwce1LqyUHe said he had a pubic key, so he must have the public key but its not a outgoing transaction for this address 1PfNh5fRcE9JKDmicD2Rh3pexGwce1LqyU",
