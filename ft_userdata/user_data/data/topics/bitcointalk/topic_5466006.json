BTC exist there alongside the US dollar so I think they will be okay. Countries (the people)  with out of control inflation stand to gain the most. The thing to watch is how evil entities like the IMF treat them.",

This means investing $101 million or 0.16% of GDP or 1/5 of the left over budget of 2022 into bitcoin is nothing and there is no need to sell it off!Instead bitcoin is acting as the reserve currency of the country in the long run. In fact I believe they should dump more of their left over budget into bitcoin now that there is a much bigger discount and bitcoin is undervalued.",

It seems that people on the street don't use it much but companies and bitcoiners have gone there, the most famous being I think Max Keiser.With the volatility it has, I doubt people are going to prefer it to the dollar as a currency but I hope the next bull run will encourage more Salvadorans to save in bitcoin.",

The president of El-Salvador knows that and that's why he is not worried about this previous purchases. Bitcoin has a lot of potential left and we are still standing at a very nascent stage of adoption. As the adoption continues to grow, the more bitcoins are mined, the price will go on higher. But what El-Salvador can do, bigger countries can't do that easily. El-Salvador has a very limited population and it's easy to manage. So it's easier said that done.",

It would not happen that when Nayib Bukele wants to sell bitcoin, there will be no access to the wallet with BTC. I am not sure that El Salvador is a role model for other countries and their presidents, because El Salvador took this step with the purchase of bitcoin not from a good life.",

El Salvador is doing well to promote BTC, but many people in the country still need to learn how to use BTC in a totally decentralized and self custodial way, many of their initiatives are focused on centralized solutions, but it is understandable as it is a centralized government behind it all.",

      "body": "It seems that some trackers have lost track (pun intended) of the total number of bitcoins bought by El Salvador’s government. The article in the OP references 2.381 BTCs, which is the figure provided by  buybitcoinworldwide as of 21/07/2022 (same figure as show on this other site).Bukele claimed on the 17/11/2022 that they’d be buying 1 BTC per day from the following day onwards. Were that to be so, the figure nowadays would be set to 2.675 BTCs (2.381 + 294 BTCs purchased at a rate of one per day since the 18/11/2022). Of course, nobody can contrast whether they are still being faithful to this daily purchase, and by the looks of it, bitcoin treasury trackers are giving it a pass and seem to have stopped time on November 2022. No sales mentioned, but also no transparency to allow anyone to follow the government’s stock of bitcoins.I don’t know where the article referenced in the OP draws the idea that the government there has \"set a target of owning 100.000 BTC by 2024\"(100K BTCs). I haven’t managed to find any references to it to contrast the figure, and it does seem pretty far-fetched coming from the potential of 2.675 BTCs it has/may have/who knows now. He did mention BTC to have a price target of 100K $ for 2022 (obviously not met), which makes me wonder if the author of the article referenced in the OP has not muddled-up.Note: '.' taken in my post is a thousands separator. It does sometimes get messy reading '.' or ',' to that effect depending on where we reside or who wrote this or that.",

So basically it's a negative impact on those who were wondering to legalise Bitcoin.

Very soon, he will see the result of his patient and the bold step he took in investing so much in bitcoin. Good things takes time before the results can be seen.
