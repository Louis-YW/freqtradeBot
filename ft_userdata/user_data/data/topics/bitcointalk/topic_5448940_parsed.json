  "content": "Hi all,I hope everyone is doing well. This is an announcement of hardcore community members coming together to see a vision through.What's ANARCHY ERC-20️N️RCHY was deployed on ETH back in July 2022 as a community driven memecoin. The liquidity is locked for 100 years, the tax is 0%. Hundreds of lowcap investors gathered and pushed it to a few millions, then it followed a downtrend. Given the concept of ANARCHY, further people gathered afterwards even if the chart was bottomed and started building on it further, adding LP pairs, bridging to BSC and so on.ANARCHY now has a new vision, a long term vision. One anarchist wrote a new whitepaper:The ANARCHY Thought Experiment: A Dangerous Wondering Aloud About a Red Paperclip MaximizerThere has been a consistent encroachment on the ability of people to freely, privately, rapidly, and directly transact. ANARCH has always been alive and it was always about people coming up with ideas and taking initiative. Although many have abandoned the projects, anarchists with a true vision for a complete decentralization were silently working. The whitepaper draft is available https://docs.google.com/document/d/1du85bamJbjM_x_Jg73JcFqrAwFNQ920Z6oHQ94KxFH8.The ANARCHY protocol works by having defunct projects join ANARCHY protocol by contributing part of the LP to the ecosystem.ANARCHY has multiple LP pairs, a handbook and a new whitepaper. A new vision for Freedom to Transact. Using anarchic methods in blockchain #ANARCHY will guarantee a true financial system.Handbook: https://anarchydao.io/Anarchy-Handbook.pdfWhitepaper: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1du85bamJbjM_x_Jg73JcFqrAwFNQ920Z6oHQ94KxFH8Chart: https://www.dextools.io/app/ether/pair-explorer/0x0883012fd201384f03ca6f68d025e934328c3437Website: https://anarchydao.ioTelegram: https://t.me/anarchyportalANARCHY is essentially a safe community-driven memecoin that could turn into a whole protocol easily, given the name, virality and energy it contains.What are we looking for?ANARCHY is currently about x40 to previous ATH, so we are seeking to achieve a strong reversal. Apart from just a reversal, we are seeking for builders, for true believers in decentralization. If you are a blockchain dev who can help, join the ️ Movement.If you are an artist or just an investor who likes OG vibes, join the ️ Movement.If you are an advocate of privacy and freedom to transact, join the ️ Movement.If you are an anarchist at heart, join the ️ Movement.If you just wish to build something and want to leverage ANARCHY's LP, resources, foundation, join the ️ Movement.We strive to have no leadership, just trying to organize our movement a bit. We have paid 0$ money all these months, have gotten listed on MEXC for free, and done everything for free, just purely from people contributing.",
