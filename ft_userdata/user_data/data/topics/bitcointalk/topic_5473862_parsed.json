The two requirements your transaction can be accelerated are: the fee you use at least 10sat/vbyte or more and the size is no more than 500 bytes. You don't have to see the average fee or such, make sure your transaction is still pending (if not then what's the point to use viabtc lol).Quote from: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txacceleratorFREE Submission    01 Enter the TXID    Paste or enter the TXID you want to accelerate.

Well since it worked for OP you have your answer.  But I can also confirm that it still works. I used it 2 or 3 times in the past 2 months and every time I go a confirmation in the next block, so it works like a charm.To0 bad the limit is only 0.5 kb per transaction, that's the only thing that annoys me sometimes. But hey, it's a free service so there is nothing to complain .",

Can anyone helpYou can't be using the highest priority from the fee rate as shown on the mempool to still experience being stucked.Ofcourse it will be stucked when the mempool is congested and the amount nyou used is high in your own eye while low to what the mempool demands, try use a mining pool if you're sending from a wallet that is non custodial, also make use of RBF function to boost your transactions, it happens sometimes that the network gets busy with Ordinals but everything can be tracked on the mempool to know how the transaction fee is going, your lower transaction fee used is what's causing it not to get confirmed.",

Well you should also know that miners are scamming ONLY Bitcoin users by including dust transactions with garbage as attachment just because they pay more fees, otherwise all it would take would be to have the top big 6 miners to exclude ordinal, NFT and other associated junks from their mempools and include or at least prioritize native/normal transactions to go first, then guess what happens? Spammers/scammers will have to keep bumping their fees so much that such floods of junks would become too expensive to carry on. Imagine 6 mining pools which have at least 1 block mined every hour on average, then if another pool gets lucky to mine 1 block in an hour and adds the spam to their block, they would need to wait 1 hour on average, but if they'd like faster confirms, then they would have to pay the required high fee by those 6 friendly miners, this way everyone wins.But for now everyone is busy scamming people one way or another.😉",

You are 2 blocks from the tip at the moment. So it should clear in a bit so long as a ton of TXs don't get hit the mempool.-DaveThey should, if you are able to insert your transaction hash before the number runs out they will mine it, I tried using viabtc accelerator some days ago and it worked, I noticed they have add a specific number countdown, they have a threshold of transactions they accept every 24 hours per day unlike before. What OP don't understand is that once there is a congestion on the network transactions can easily get stuck for hours, even if you use the highest amount you will still have to wait, but it's good that free services like ViaBTC is around. Everyone I know that are into Bitcoin investment are in worries about Bitcoin transaction, I just tell them that it always happen when the value of Bitcoin start rising, the same is going on with Ethereum, I used $8 to make transaction some hours ago and we aren't even in a bull market yet, the real crazy time is still yet to come.",
