  "content": "Hello everyone,My question is as follows.I manage a news and opinion website focused on a Western European country. I briefly had Google Ads on this site, but I want nothing to do with Google. I'm looking for BTC-related companies, such as casinos, crypto trading platforms, or anything that fits our website.It's a website targeting a more traditional audience. By traditional, I mean people, especially those aged 30 and above, who despise globalization and value their privacy. Particularly now, as money seems to be centralized and cash is at risk of disappearing, all these people are seeking alternatives but don't know where to start.In my view, this presents opportunities for crypto companies. However, the \"official\" platforms like CoinTraffic and CoinZilla require you to have a website related to cryptos. My goal is to guide these people a little bit into the world of cryptocurrencies.This could also be interesting for crypto casinos. People already know how to use a VPN (we have advertised SurfShark and provided explanations on our website).Perhaps companies would be interested in writing a blog post with backlinks.Occasionally, I have been approached by strangers who wanted to post on my website and were willing to pay for it. I have done it once. For them, it was only important that the article was published. I didn't even have to put it at the top (although I wouldn't have a problem with that if it's a good advertisement/blog post).There needs to be SOMETHING for me to start earning some (small) money this way, so I can continue with my plans for the near future.But I can't figure out how. Where do I find those kinds of people? When you directly contact the casinos, for example, they never respond.Does anyone understand my situation and can someone help me further? As you sow, so shall you reap!There are so many other things I can do, but currently I can only focus on one thing to start with. Someone once said in response to my comment in one of my posts that I've been out of this world for 5 years, but I've been actively doing business for even longer.For them, those may not be many years, but as a middle-aged person now, I am no longer capable of multitasking with 7 tabs open simultaneously. That time has passed. But my mind is filled with ideas with potential. First, build up.Feel free to respond, here or via PM. Thank you in advance!Am I looking too far and is there something thatÂ´s much easier in my situation. Tips appreciated.",

Or by communicating directly with the official representatives of the casinos.It would be better if you prepare a Portfolio to display all kinds of services that you intend to provide. This will help you communicate more smoothly with your potential customers.",
