      "body": "The best form of bitcoin storage is using a cold storage and none of those wallets or exchanges you listed up there are not cold storage. A cold wallet are those wallet that are completely off the internet and potential risks like your wallet getting hacked is not there. Example is the hardware wallets or a wallet set up on an airgapped devices, this device must have not touched the internet before and would not touch the internet ever. To use it online to either check for new incoming transactions or broadcast your transactions you will need to set up a separate watch only wallet on an online device, this doesn’t exposes you to danger as watch only do no store your keys. Here is how to set up one on electrum  https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlThe other important things to check out in storing your bitcoin is 1. Do not store your coins on exchanges because you don’t have full ownership of the wallet, KuCoin and binance are exchanges2. Use an open source wallet, trustwallet is a close source wallet and if any changes is done you wouldn’t be aware about it.",

Custodial wallets are wallets where you deposit your bitcoins with another organization. For example, bank custodial wallet. Custodial wallet for Bitcoin is - Coinbase. Additionally, any exchange you use as a wallet is also a custodial wallet. Such as - Binance, Cuckooin, Okex etc. Here if you want to send bitcoin to someone, they have to request a withdrawal, then they send after some time. Sometimes if they feel any problem then they ask you to provide other details like your National ID and verify the account. On the other hand non custodial wallet wallet means you are keeping the money or bitcoins with you. Here you can withdraw whenever you want. There are many such non-custodial wallets for Bitcoin. Eg - Bitcoin Core, Electrum Wallet, Hardware Wallet (Ledger, Treasure, SafePal) etc. I think keeping your bitcoins in these wallets will be the safest.",

If you have any reasonable coin in your binance or any other exchange make sure you create a non-custodial wallet and transfer your coin there.",

      "body": "I'm agreeing with the last posters: Don't keep your funds on an exchange or online wallet! Really! We've seen tons of them going bankrupt, running with user's money, locking accounts, getting hacked, phishing attacks,... Letting somebody else manage your keys is a bad, bad, idea... No matter how big or trusted the exchange or online wallet is!If you want the most secure setup, learn how to properly generate a paper wallet or do an airgapped setup using a trusted wallet implementation (like electrum or bitcoin core).If you want a really secure setup that has a smaller learning curve and is easier to work with than a paper wallet or an airgapped setup, opt for a trusted hardware wallet with an extended seed.If you want a reasonably secure setup, make sure you have a clean pc with up to date os + firewall + AV and use a proper desktop wallet (like electrum or core).If you want to give somebody else complete control over your funds so they can rob you, lock you out, KYC you, have your credentials bruteforced, or fall victim to phishers: go for exchanges or online wallets.Do note that there is no 100% secure solution... Even if you opt for a paper wallet or an airgapped setup, there is always a chance for a buggy RNG or an evil maid attack, or your seed phrase (or paper wallet, or airgapped machine) might get stolen,... I guess it's just life, there are no 100% guarantees, and this extends to crypto currency as well.",

That's because someone with experience about Bitcoin would know very well that binance and kucoin are exchanges and you are not supposed to store your coins in any exchange (not your keys not your coins) the worse part of it all is trust wallet. It shouldn't even be on your list if your will like to hodl Bitcoin for a long term. The best advice, is to use a hardware wallet or cold storage, such as Trezor or Safepal, if you can afford them. Many people use hot wallets (like mobile wallets), but it's important to use the most secure ones, such as Electrum, Mycelium, Bitcoin Core, or Blue Wallet. Whichever wallet you select, make sure to research and choose the one that fits you best.",

Punch Plate and then put it in an important looking envelope and place it somewhere safe.That is the safest way to generate your own seed phrase with your own entropy, write it down on something that will last a lifetime (and beyond), and then keep it somewhere safe.For actually sending bitcoin, I would recommend using Sparrow Wallet with your ColdCard to sign and broadcast transactions.I think that is about as simple as it can be with as much security as you can possibly have for a normal user.

Of course it's only an option - but the fact that the seed can be extracted from your HW is more than enough warning in itself.@hypothetical, centralized crypto exchanges are not a place for safe storage, but only a place where you buy/sell Bitcoin, and if you want the best possible protection, I recommend that you consider this HW -> Foundation Passport Official Thread",

Use Electrum and any open source code hardware wallet if you plan to hold your Bitcoin long term without any problem. You can access your Bitcoin whenever you want as long as you have your seed phrase safe. Invest on hardware wallet if you want a worry free holding in long term. It will be a painful lesson if you already hold for many years until your wallet got compromised since you use custodial wallet.",

One is custodial and non custodial. In custodial you don't have the key or seed phrase to your wallet like when you keep funds in some centralized exchange like Binance, or the Kucoin, you don't have any keep to the wallet where you keep your funds and in Non-custodial you will be asked to backed up your wallet with some seed phrase like when you make account on Trust wallet you have to keep a recovery key safe in order to access that account again.I would say go for non custodial wallets only, because if you have the key you are the real owner and if you don't then you are not the real owner even if you own the money. Because that money is now under CEX's control.Then there comes hold and cold wallet, like hot wallets are like Electrum or TW and Cold wallets are know as hardware wallets like a small USB type, which have some way to give input and to show output too, some are touch or buttoned either way you can make direct Transactions from them and they are best way to store money for longer time.",

There is chaotic difference, where do I begin.- If a centralized exchange gets hacked, they go bankrupt, no funds for you. If a bank is hacked, transactions can be reversed.- Even in a scenario where the bank goes bankrupt, there is legislation which grants you access to your money through deposit insurances; in the worst, the government intervenes. - When deposing coins to a centralized exchange, you're agreeing this is practically not yours and that the company can use it however they like; many are caught implementing fractional reserve. (I know, the largest banks can do that too, but there is clearly lack of regulation here)- Centralized exchanges are more frequently shut down, as they are targeted by hackers etc.- There is no alternative to banking when it comes to electronic fiat. There is apparent alternative to using a centralized exchange; in fact, the very purpose of bitcoin is that alternative in the first place.",
