      "body": "You make a fair point...  Knowledge is important, but this crypto landscape shifts quicker than a jackrabbit on caffeine and  trying to know it all can have your head spinning in circles.  Rather than aspiring to be a walking textbook, I think you should prioritize cultivating core critical thinking skills. They will serve as your foundation.  Think of it like constructing a house: logical reasoning provides the resilient framework while factoids are the bricks slotted in later.  Sure, scammers are crafty, but sound logic helps sniff out fishiness.  Steer clear of questionable links, vet info thoroughly before acting and be wary of too-good-to-be-true opportunities.  Getting rich quick often leads to losing money quicker. With sharp critical thinking guiding you, the intricate details of crypto become less urgent.  Absorb knowledge steadily, but dont overwhelm yourself.  Having an inquisitive yet reasonable mindset helps cut through the clutter in this breakneck digital world.",

Long time ago I read about the habits of the rich and I found out that reading is also part of their biggest activities. Another I saw too was the saying that the level of information you have determines the level of your success although it might be wrong from other perspectives but it's all connecting. we got to stay informed in the crypto space and that's why this forum was created to keep the crypto enthusiast informed always.

Knowledge is constantly being refined, new research will reveal that some knowledge we have are becoming obsolete, and there is a need to stay informed. Failure to stay informed puts you at risk of making decisions based on old knowledge and information, and that makes you more prone to making wrong decisions. This forum helps a bit with providing up to date information, it is now your responsibility to make sure you are a reader.  Then as a forum member, do not only depend on the forum for information, be actively engaged in other channels, podcast, etc that always have new and current information on cryptocurrency and bitcoin, so you are always fresh with knowledge.",

But it shouldn't be mandatory for something people need to use in their daily life. And above all it shouldn't be dangerous for yourself to not knowing it. Or regulators should restrict its use to protect people, sadly. For example, for driving a car you need a licence, because it's dangerous to use a car without knowing how to use it.",

For example, in crypto currency, there is a lot of information, blogs, and videos on the internet discussing crypo or bitcoin, but people notice that the information they are giving is lacking, and if newbies read or watch it, they might follow it, but the thing is, what they have learned on the internet is not enough. Yes, the internet could help us if we are resourceful, but for content creators or information providers about bitcoin or any cryptocurrency, you should be responsible about what you state in your content because that's what the listeners, watchers, and readers follow. So if you give wrong or lacking information, it may affect them in a bad way, and if those wannabe influencers stop it, you are ruining people's lives.",
