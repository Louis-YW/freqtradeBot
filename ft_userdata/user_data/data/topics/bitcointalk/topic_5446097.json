  "content": "I plan to auction a 2013 Titan 1 BTC, Private Key version, that is fully funded. This coin is 312 of 10,000 producedhttps://imgur.com/8S4nQCH Coin Fronthttps://imgur.com/9UyIpor Coin Backhttps://imgur.com/bQkI39J Certificatehttps://imgur.com/rVfmuRx Titain verification page with bitcoin addressThere is redemption drama with Titan's 2FA coins, but no issues have been reported for Private Key versions. However, if you might be interested in this coin and are not familiar with what I'm talking about, check out this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5369583.0 Before moving forward with the auction, I have a few questions I want some clarity on since this will be a first for me.1.  Does anyone actually ship these? I've had too many packages lost to feel comfortable with that. Is getting insurance sufficient? Has anyone had to file a lost package claim for something of this value? How did that go? 2. Related to 1, is there a reputable Escrow service in Washington state where I can personally deliver this?3. Many auctions state that a PGP-signed message will be sent to the winner with the payment address. What does this protect from / why is it good practice? Thanks! 1N2iTvqupttDDUHtfnRLFwtrWM7p4mfUb*Edit to add bitcoin address",

So, undoubtedly you can use him as an escrow. You may check from this list too if you want to use others as escrow for you.",

I'm not clear on the mechanics of how it would work though. Is there a thread that covers the transaction mechanics? Would this be it?1. The auction is run and a winner is determined2. The winner sends Minerjones the bitcoin payment3. I deliver the Titain PV coin to minerjones 4. He forwards me the payment less his feeDoes this look about right?",

Pretty sure he's not in WA, but that's no issue usually -- As for the rest, yes sounds reasonable. He's your safest bet regardless, as there is no known escrow I know of in WA for something like this. Be careful and safe and don't fall for scammers. PGP signed messages can be easily verified to prove ownership of the email , and / or included BTC-signed messages. Again, dont fall for any scammers who pm you, it happens all the time - check the UID of the user in the PM, the real MJ is UID=346731!
