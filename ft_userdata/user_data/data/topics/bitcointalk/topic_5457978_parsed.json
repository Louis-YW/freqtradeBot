If we don't share our referral link we won't be able to receive any tokens, isn't we?And I noticed that the swap of the DYOR will be held in next year's first quarter 2024. It's still quite a while before the token can really be used, about 9 or 10 months from now and then it's not sure if its value will increase. There is still a risk, anyway, it's just giveaways, who knows the value will suddenly increase, like what happened to XLM before when it started.",

Furthermore, it is possible to move up the waiting list through referrals, automatically unlocking more rewards as your move up the ranks. Regarding token launch, we will be launching in Q1 2024 - enabling conversion of the earned points into Dyor tokens.In this particular giveaway that is hosted on Twitter, we will be selecting random 3 users, who have qualified for an entry, to distribute the prize. Please let me know if you have any additional questions.Cheers,Martins",
