What did you do when btc rallied from $16000 to over $300,000, I see during that time many people including me made profits with bitcoin and the market. Recent issues have caused prices to drop and many people have panic and fear of harm, which is understandable because this market is always so volatile, depending on the level of research as well as investment strategy of each person that we will be able to achieve or fail next.Quote from: Greggry on June 16, 2023, 06:05:55 AMAm thinking weather is reducing in figures, or other market products have reduced its value, or have America caught Satoshi and warn him to stop this bitcoin from gaining value?

Talk please, but my advise is to reduce your buying strategies and watch.There is no connection in the absence of a bitcoin price increase this year and a bitcoin price dump. Crypto market always works like this - some people buy and others sell. Now there are more people willing to sell, which is why the price has fallen. The reasons for such actions can be completely different in people. Recently, this was related to SEC's allegations against the binance. In the same way, events and news in crypto industries can push people to buy and subsequently increase the rate. Markets always fluctuate up and down.But my strategy is different. Despite all the emerging negative information background, it is more productive to accumulate btc, which will be rewarded in the long run. It is best to ignore the current short-term fluctuations and focus on the future.You are exaggerating the bitcoin's dump this year. It's not as significant as it used to be.",

Talk please, but my advise is to reduce your buying strategies and watch.There are two sides to a trade. One who sells and the other one who buys. Bitcoin always goes through such bull and bear cycle. I would rather say that bitcoin is more stable than many other cryptos in this market. Also when the price is low, that's the best time to buy bitcoin. So when you see the market in red, enter there and buy in small quantities. That's how you average out your buying price. If you are re-thinking your buying strategy, think on these lines.",

Both are good options depending on how the downtrend is affecting your mindset, because the latter is something you need to keep sane to continue normally in life. If you are hopeful and wish to buy then by all means do so as the price drops. If you are feeling bad about it and want to wait it out, no problem in that as well. For long term traders this is an advantage, they are never in a pressure to trade rapidly.QuoteAm thinking weather is reducing in figures, or other market products have reduced its value, or have America caught Satoshi and warn him to stop this bitcoin from gaining value?

Yes, it's true that Bitcoin has had some rough time the last few days, but this is something very normal. You would know if you were in the market for a long term. Zoom out the charts and you will see that it has actually been a good year for bitcoin despite seeing lots of unfortunate events! Remember, Bitcoin is volatile and it will go up and down, and react to different events in different ways. It's not always a smooth ride upwards. And no, not even \"Satoshi\" can stop the price of bitcoin from growing.",
