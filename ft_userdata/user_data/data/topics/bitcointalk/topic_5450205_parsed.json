Seems reasonable, but if really so, I wonder how such a thing would slip through their security though. I mean apple seems to be quite strict about almost anything that relates to their products. - Maybe we can also assume that apple wants to play it safe and not get into any biases that may affect the popularity of their products or maybe they have another plan in mind or something. Whichever the case, it didn't really serve much purpose for the majority of apple users anyway so maybe apple just found it useless to keep and just decided to get rid of it.",

However, I don't think Apple's removal of the Bitcoin White Paper will have much of a negative impact on the Bitcoin market. Bitcoin Whitepaper has been there for a couple of years now. The funny thing is nobody noticed that Bitcoin Whitepaper was there. Or maybe Apple users saw a document but didn't know what document it was. I don't know how much confidence it gave to Bitcoin investors. But, Whitepaper removal news won't create many effects in the market. Investors like MicroStrategy will continue investing in Bitcoin until infinite time. They have been accumulating Bitcoin for a long time now. Currently, MicroStrategy holds 140,000 Bitcoins, which will continue accumulating. Here is why I think It won't affect the market. China has Banned Bitcoin a couple of times so far. They banned Bitcoin transactions, and They Banned Bitcoin Mining. What happened? We have seen some fear in the market, which recovered over time. It was big news. Apple never adopted Bitcoin as a payment method. So, just removing the whitepaper doesn't make any changes.",

We all knew how many is their customers. Imagine if those people see and read the bitcoin whitepaper then they defintely add to some bullish reason for being involve on blockchain and bitcoin. For sure not so many apple users are familiar with it yet. So putting it up there is good choice but removing it maybe Apply isnt just as fan of bitcoin.",

Quite a logical assumption. That's what I thought when I saw the title of this thread.Probably, it was a joke of one of the developers (or it was a bitcoin fan) with the placement of whitepaper in MacOS. If this story had not received wide publicity, then Apple probably would not even have paid attention to all this. But after the media found out about the whitepaper in MacOS, the company's management had no choice but to decide to remove it so as not to be associated with bitcoin.If Apple were interested in btc, they would have announced this long ago and added it to their Apple Store as a payment method. Perhaps they are stopped by the issue of regulation. You should ask them yourself. Nobody in the media has done this yet?Quote from: Edwardard on April 26, 2023, 07:27:43 AMJust in: As the title says, apple has now hidden the bitcoin whitepaper from its latest macOS ventura 13.4 beta 3.

It might have invited some curious enthusiasts or onboard some hardcore crypto fans but that's it. Also, this could even bring them into some trouble as this could be seen as Apple posing to be a contributor or 'enabler' of cryptocurrencies in a way or two. Whatever the reason of it being there, I have no idea. The Whitepaper being removed on their OS isn't really that of a news to the actual market at all. It's a nice little interesting tidbit, but doesn't equate to much in the grand scheme of things.",

At least not everyone even know it was there before this news was published. And this is not such a big news that will draw the attention to or away from the use of bitcoin. We can’t say the reason for this, but I’m sure there’s definitely a reason behind this. One can assume that they’re trying to stay away from promoting or advertising bitcoin through their products, which may feel as though they’re helping the adoption of it, that may cause harm to their brand in the future because of government strict regulations on its use.",

So they used Bitcoin's PDF to do all sorts of operations on this internal tool and indeed it's funny. It was added to the MacOS in 2018 and got removed in the latest update however this was just a cool joke from the engineers. Most of them are surely invested in Crypto and they just wanted to link Apple x Bitcoin to increase the price of Bitcoin which they were HODLing haha. ** just speculating **It was actually renamed to simpledoc.pdf and I didn't see any non-engineer ever find this stuff out and it's crazy how they pulled this out overall. Great stuff by people at Apple.Once again I would say, them removing it from MacOS isn't something bad for Bitcoin. Instead it should make you wonder why it was there at first place.",

For some years,it was unnoticed but only few apple users and the engineers who put it in there knew about it. This hasn't added to bitcoin adoption from my understanding, and removing it won't also affect bitcoin adoption. It is clear to people that bitcoin is the new currency that can resist inflation and it cannot be controlled by a third party. Maybe Apple got rid of bitcoin white paper base on they are selling the product all over the world,including the countries that banned bitcoin and the ones that adopted bitcoin. Let it not be a barrier to them in sales. Since the VirtualScanner.app has been removed, bitcoin white paper is gone too, no worries they are into business.",
