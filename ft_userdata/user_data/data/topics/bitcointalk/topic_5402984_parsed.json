A next generation conbat suit that is resistant to nuclear blasts and has features like the power exoskeleton which is said to give soldiers greater strength and stamina. A pictorial view of how the ratnik-3 looks like .With all this advantages, I think it could be of use to them hence its creation, right? But then, why is not in use?? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratnik_(program)",

      "body": "The problem of the RF is not having advanced weapons, the problem is that is unable to produce them in the quantities needed and at what would be an affordable price and that happens with tanks (where is the Armata?), planes, missiles (limited number of Kalibr), etc... The armour is probably the last of their problems as of now.Have you not seen that RF is sending T-62, a tank from the 60's to fight? The should be in a museum.RF is a country with a GDP similar to Italy and a huge and corrupt army that cannot be fed.",

And of course, it was created to give European companies the opportunity to earn some money, because no matter what sanctions are imposed, European companies love russian money and will never refuse to cooperate.",

A next generation conbat suit that is resistant to nuclear blasts and has features like the power exoskeleton which is said to give soldiers greater strength and stamina.~A combat suit resistant to nuclear blasts, right? What else? Do they also have portable time machines in their helmets? And, of course, portal guns for quickly moving to another universe are also included, right?All joking aside, in today's war body armour doesn't matter much. If hit by a Javelin or something, you are going to burn to death, that's all.",
