After getting XRP, hacker sent it to OKX and few other crypto exchanges.Does anyone from Phllipines local has more info about this?Quote from: https://www.theblock.co/post/258701/philippines-based-exchange-coins-ph-appears-to-have-lost-12-2-million-xrp-in-possible-exploitThe Philippines-based crypto exchange Coins.ph appears to have experienced an exploit on Tuesday that resulted in the loss of more than 12 million XRP tokens ($6 million). Within about 30 minutes, a supposed hacker exchanged 999,999.999 XRP lots 13 times, in addition to another lot of 200,000 XRP, according to the blockchain explorer XRP scan.After gaining nearly 12.2 million XRP tokens, the hacker then sent the coins through the crypto exchange OKX, the European crypto-to-fiat exchange WhiteBIT, the cross-blockchain exchange OrbitBridge, the crypto exchange SimpleSwap, two non-custodial exchange ChangeNOW and Fixed Float, as well as other destinations.",

So much hype about XRP and he thought, it was the future. $6M is big though.",
