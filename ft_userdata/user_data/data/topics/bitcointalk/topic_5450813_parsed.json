      "body": "Welcome to bitcointalk platform mate. Seems this is a new casino and is yet to gain recognition as supposed. Anyways, I really can not tell but I tried accessing your website but to no avail mate do you have restrictions on regions from accessing your platform? If yes what countries are on your restriction list let us know. The issue of kyc is of utmost importance here as we really look into it before considering engaging with a casino so my question is this, do your casino conduct KYC for members getting registered on your platform? If yes at what point is the KYC necessary let us know so we would not be deceived into rushing to register and making deposit.Do your casino have the license to operate legally. If yes, under which jurisdiction is your license gotten from? Let us know.Lastly, as a new casino if I am not mistaken here, getting onboard this platform is a plus for you as there are lots of members here willing to give new casinos a try but you should know you are not the first here and you will have big names here to contend with. So therefore, I will advise you to seek the expertise of a good and reputable signature campaign manager to help promote your casino here through signature campaign. He has a huge traffic and and audience to go with. Feel free to pm @Royse777 for your signature campaign management. He will guide you through the process of making your casino known here.",

How about a crystal-clear Terms of Service, Privacy Policy? Gamblers need those to size up a casino. Your slick interface? Not everyone's cup of tea. Transparency? Builds trust.

No desktop version at all? I'm not totally convinced that's a smart move. Sure, lots of people are using smartphones and tablets these days, but there are still plenty of folks who prefer to game on their big ol' desktop or laptop screens. Seems like you might be cutting out a pretty big chunk of potential players by not having a desktop option. What do you think?",

Thanks for your advice.^But TOS is very important because that is a term that most gamblers need to follow.Without clear terms or TOS, customers may be unsure about the rules and regulations of the casino. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings, and disputes. Now how can you gain trust if no clear rules and regulations, casinos may be able to treat customers unfairly or arbitrarily and this can lead to complaints, bad reviews, and a damaged reputation. Because for me, having clear and transparent terms and TOS is very important for any gambling casino to operate responsibly and ethically. It helps to establish trust with customers, protect the casino from legal issues, and ensure fair and consistent treatment for all.",

These are questions that all people will do you and that you should be able to answer this question, but I confess that I do not see the answer in your casino, your casino to be a chinese casino, but in China and forbidden gambling, and something illegal that The government does not tolerate, so how did you deal with it?I also see that your casino has no curacao license, and this is another great crime and governments can grasp your casino, the problem and that when the governments apprehend your casino they will give where you will confiscate all the money that Find in your casino, soon all people who put money in your casino the day that it is seized by the government will lose that money, I do not see how it would be something good for people. That is why I think people should avoid using any casino that has no curacao license, governments will also accuse you of money laundering, this crime can make you stay in jail for a lot of years. honestly I don't see a good future if you follow this path",
