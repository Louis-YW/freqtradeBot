The scratches on the slab aren't the prettiest and this coin is too beautiful to leave it in a slab like that. I know the yellow ANACS slabs aren't available anymore, but if someone were to resubmit it to ANACS, ICG or PCGS would they be able to take it out of the slab to regrade? or would the individual who purchased this have to take it out themselves?",

Ah, that would explain how I got burned the other way, breaking out ANACS slabs to regrade with PCGS, finding ANACS 68 and 69s coming out at 66 and 67s - and that was before PCGS recently tightened up their Casascius (brass) grading such that 67s are now very difficult to attain.",
