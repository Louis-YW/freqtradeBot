When it comes to a currency, I'm always looking for the cheapest way, so if it's not the cheapest, I will not use it.Paying using cash cost zero fee, that's what I use in real life.If I'm looking for privacy, I will go for Monero, but for now I don't need.If I want to send money across country, I will looking for altcoins instead.",

I use cryptocurrency most of the time on my online services or while trading. Cryptocurrency makes it easier to carry out transactions to sites where I use to pay using fiat and wait for hours to get funded. Now I just deposit my coins(USDT to be precise) on my platforms and it it funded ASAP. I don't use Bitcoins but USDT rather. Bitcoin is much more valuable to me so I prefer the other coins for my transactions.",

I mean any crypto on Layer 1, doesn't matter which one but it needs to be used as it's meant to be - without third-parties, trustless - otherwise we may as well use PayPal or other system.Quote from: Hatchy on August 23, 2024, 07:06:01 PM I don't use Bitcoins but USDT rather.

Seems like USDT is a trojan horse for CBDC, maybe that's why they made Bitcoin so unusable when they could scale it a lot better on L1 Central Bank / Private company - doesn't matter, in the end they are the same bankster gangster material",
