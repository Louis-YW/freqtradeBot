  "content": "What Happened:In this Forum Someone shared a Fake Public Ripple Airdrop which is purely a trap of being scammed. They are asking you to connect your wallet through WalletConnect or Metamask. To be noted there is no airdrop ongoing for ripple project and there is no possibility too as it has already launched many years before. So never fall into this kind of trap anyone. Always keep your accounts secured and never connect to a suspicious website. Their most target is airdrop hunters and they can easily fall into it if they aren't conscious or a beginner with a little knowledge.

He will create another account and post the fake links again. The only solution is to report the post to the moderator and get it deleted.",

Ripple airdrop will not require anyone to connect to wallet, it would just be claimed by your ripple's wallet private key and nothing more.This web3 of a thing are another means to scam people.",

      "body": "All the OP's posts have been brought down. I Believe moderators took action real quick after a few members reported the post, and the account has also been . banned The scammer will probably be preparing another account right now to come back and make another post with another strategy. Since Ripple won their case, there have been numerous fake airdrops all over, with scammers trying to use that trending news to their advantage. I'm just worried for those newbies who will fall victim to such scams because they are eager to make free money from the internet.",

      "body": "I left negative trust immediately after reading the OP and missed the part where the scammer has been banned. Can you imagine what it would feel like to have your crypto siphoned by scammers? I am glad the OP posted about this fake XRP airdrop because far too many people are falling for these types of scams. If new ones appear they cannot be from Ripple therefore stay away.",

To be honest, Namecheap is a domain registrar company that deals strictly with abuses done by scammers who register domains to deceive and steal beginners.The Legal & Abuse Department team has previously reviewed the complaints and reports that I submitted, and they have already taken down many phishing domains, so we must not stop submitting complaints and reports even if the scammer comes with a new account on the forum or a new domain.",
