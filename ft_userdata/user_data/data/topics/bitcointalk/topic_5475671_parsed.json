We can earn good profit but due to the higher risks involved. I would suggest people to away away if they cannot be on their toes and play with stop loss or OCO post investing.",

It's a cryptocurrency like any other. And it doesn't matter that at one time this coin was bankrupt. It still remains on the market and continues to be traded. And if the coin is traded, it means that there is demand and there is supply. And therefore there can be upward and downward movements.",

I know that Binance is still supporting this coin and remains listed on their exchange. But that doesn't make sense when this has been part of the Do Kwon issue. There can still be trading volume and such on this coin but if you just want to be safe with your money, don't get on this rally for this coin.",

Because coins that have been launched for years are still struggling to hit a dollar. I was thinking that this Classic Terra has been crashed again because I have not been hearing from it for a while. Even these days that I am visiting here very well, I have not seen Terra threads and this is the first one with this good news.I am suspecting that after the announcement of Binance a whale visited the coins and invested in it and that made the rallied to that percentage.",

Don't expect LUNC to be taken seriously, especially when investors lost all of their money with it. At this point, I'd say Terra Classic is a gamble. Just like \"meme coins\". LUNC's only hope is the community. The community needs to burn the token's supply, and change the name of the project (rebrand) to help restore investors' confidence. Only then, we will see LUNC going all the way to the moon. Even Terra 2.0 has been struggling to become a widespread success. I'd suggest you consider other options that put development/innovation above all else. Who knows how long will this cryptocurrency last?",

The price rally we are seeing can be done by the team.No one can resist free money, right? Any coin with an announced airdrop would surely bring the attention of whales and airdrop hunters alike. I'm pretty sure the LUNC hype will be over soon. With Terra/LUNA's shady history, I'd stay as much away from it as possible. Not even Terra 2.0 is worth the investment. There are far better options on the market which put users' needs first above all else. By investing into projects with real utility, you can help secure your financial future. Coins like LUNC, LUNA, and even DOGE are driven by speculation/hype and could disappear in an instant. I wouldn't be surprised if LUNC goes to $0 in the future as people move on to the next big thing in crypto. The market often behaves in strange and bizarre ways, so expect the unexpected.

It's pure gambling, if you want to invest just throw some money you don't need in it.It's risky but not as risky as it was when the project was having problems. Now, it's cleaner than before, and the community is always optimistic for LUNA Classic to make a comeback in the future, they have got the burning thing going on and many other things and people are still trading the coin pretty much every day, I often see it has more than $30M in trading volume which isn't a small amount for a coin that has had a very dark past in the market.When we talk about profits and risks associated, the coin is highly volatile which creates great windows for profits sometimes, but at the same time, it drops very quickly again as well which means that if someone FOMOs in search of profits, they might end up losing value in case it doesn't go back up to the place where they bought.",

Apparently, Do kwon the confounder of Tera Luna and USTC stable coin has been hiding and found in Podgorica's airport, he was arrested and the court rule for him to extradited to US where will go and pay for his crime and meet his fellow crime members like Sam Bankman. So, speculators saw the news as bullish recovery for investors and pumped the dead coins and Binance upon see the progress and volume, they thought it's a good idea to list the futures for traders to gamble.If not for greed and too much looking for ways to make money, why will any sane person will want to buy a stablecoin that has lost billions of investment, where will that recovery comes from because the damage Luna did was way more than FTX but it's just that FTX was like stealing because they are exchange that used users fund for personal gains while Luna was a complete protocol manipulation that kills dreams of many but still have to pay for his crimes.",
