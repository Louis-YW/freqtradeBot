  "content": "Hello everyone,I often send and receive BTC to my wallet, so I became interested in the possibility of setting up a unified change address, so that any excess BTC, if there is any, would be sent to this address. I understand that this will reduce privacy, but it's not important.Is such a possibility available? For example, through a console command.Thank you in advance.P.S. I'm not proficient in English; the text was created using a translator.",

      "body": "If am not mistaken you want all your change to be sent to a single address, then the solution is to import the individual private key of that address into electrum this will make electrum to send the change to where the bitcoin is coming from. But should you import the seed phrase then I think it will definitely generate new change address for every new transaction having a change as that is the protocol of an HD wallet format. I think I have found the a way for to specify the change address should you import the seed phrase. Follow This guide below, the two address there means you are sending to two output address plus the the specified changed address of your sending to just one then it should be one address and then the specified change address which Must end with Exclamation markQuote from: DireWolfM14 on February 11, 2021, 03:02:05 AMTo use a specific address as a your change wallet you can use the \"send to many\" feature.  In the \"send to\" field you can list multiple addresses, followed by a comma, then the amount you want to send.  Use a exclamation point for the last address, which will be your change address.  The exclamation point will select the remaining amount, minus fees to send to that address.Example:1xFirstPaymentAddressxxxxxxxx,0.00351xSecondPaymentAddressxxxxx,0.0041xSpecificChangeAddressxxxxxx,!Electrum will show you the outputs before you confirm them, and you can double check the addresses there.  If the change address is in your wallet it'll be highlighted in green.  The change addresses created by Electrum will be highlighted in yellow.",

For example, through a console command.Yes, use \"pay to many\" and \"coin control\".Coin control isn't mandatory but useful in this case if you have lots of UTXO.Learn how to do it here: bitcoinelectrum.com/how-to-spend-specific-utxos-in-electrum/Then, for using specific change address:After selecting the coin with enough bitcoins that you want to spend,Go to 'Send' tab, click the small setting icon on the top-right and tick \"Pay to many\".In 'Pay to', paste your preferred change address as one of the recipient with amount of \"!\", for example: tb1q39wfap3srjnpjtap6lhfj06mwymdz4e42u0e47,!Press enter to add a new line and paste the recipient's address with the amount that you want to send, for example: tb1qcku7kepqvj88lz9gd7ac3uhzszfsve3uwypts4,0.00012345Then, proceed to the usual sending procedure.For reference: Based from the example, 'Pay to' field should look like this:Code:tb1q39wfap3srjnpjtap6lhfj06mwymdz4e42u0e47,!tb1qcku7kepqvj88lz9gd7ac3uhzszfsve3uwypts4,0.00012345",
