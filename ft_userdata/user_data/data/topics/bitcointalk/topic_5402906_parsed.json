  "content": "QuoteWhile many economists agree a recession is likely coming in 2023, Wall Street veteran and Bitcoin bull Mike Novogratz has just given one of the most dire outlooks yet.“The economy is going to collapse,” Novogratz told MarketWatch on Wednesday, adding, “We are going to go into a really fast recession, and you can see that in lots of ways.”Novogratz, chief executive of crypto merchant bank Galaxy Digital, gave the interview just before the Federal Reserve raised rates by 0.75 percentage points—the largest rate hike seen since 1994. The rate hike came five days after U.S. consumer price increase unexpectedly surged in May to a 40-year high of 8.6%.Novogratz pointed to the housing market, which is finally cooling down after a two-year hot streak, and inventories piling up as signs of a recession looming on the horizon.“There are layoffs in multiple industries, and the Fed is stuck,” he said, adding that the central bank is in a position where it has to “hike [interest rates] until inflation rolls over.”Novogratz accurately predicted in the interview that the central bank would lift rates by 75 points and that the market would rally on the news. After Fed chair Jerome Powell announced the rate hike, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 1%, while the S&P 500 advanced 1.5% and the Nasdaq rose 2.5%.Novogratz also predicted there would be a stock selloff in the next coming days, which happened right on cue. At 8 a.m. ET, S&P 500 futures were trading 2.2% lower, wiping out yesterday's gains and plunging the benchmark further into a bear market.“They are hiking into the popping of a bubble,” Novogratz said.Recession loomsThe U.S will officially be in a recession when the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) finds a significant decline in economic activity that lasts over an extended period of time—usually two fiscal quarters.According to a new survey of 49 U.S. macroeconomics experts conducted at the start of June by the Financial Times and the University of Chicago’s policy research center Initiative on Global Markets, this is likely to happen in 2023.Nearly 70% of the economists surveyed believe the NBER will make the call at some point in 2023, with 38% predicting a recession will start in the first two quarters of 2023, and another 30% forecasting an official start in the second half.The Fed appears largely powerless to stop runaway inflation, which is being driven up further by the soaring prices of food and fuel brought on by Russia's war on Ukraine.In his announcement of Wednesday's rate hike, Powell signaled another large rate hike coming at the July FOMC meeting—in the 50- or even 75-basis-point range—with the Fed expecting weaker economic growth and higher unemployment.Crypto crashNovogratz didn’t give an indication of timing of when a recession will happen, but drew parallels to the 1998 collapse of Long-Term Capital Management fund and the current bloodbath that is happening in the crypto market.Long Term Capital Management was a highly leveraged fund that lost $4.6 billion in less than four months from its exposure to the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis. The fall of the investing giant sent shock waves through global markets and led to a $3.6 billion bailout.https://twitter.com/novogratz/status/1537036311613382656On Wednesday, Bitcoin came very close to falling below $20,000. The crypto king has fallen more than 30% this month, and its decline on Wednesday marked the ninth straight day of losses. While it also rallied on the back of Powell’s announcement to $22,900, it has since fallen back to $21,015.https://www.yahoo.com/video/wall-street-vet-bitcoin-bull-122037650.html....They've been saying this for so many years. Its hard to believe it is possible.If a recession did occur in our lifetimes. What would be the best approach to rebound and recover from it. The typical approach for many, will be to do nothing and expect God or the government to save them. But what if God and the government aren't saving people this decade. They're taking this decade off to go on vacation. What do we do then. Rampant consumerism has been encouraged for so many years. I think we would need a shift from consumption in consumerism to a greater emphasis on production and manufacturing. Providing credit and funding for these initiatives would be difficult under negative economic conditions. The shift from city living to off grid self sustainability could be advantageous and a model to pursue. Unfortunately is not affordable for all. Jobs are the traditional means of earning wealth and security, perhaps a shift could occur towards entrepreneurial pursuits and freelance work. If recession sets in, how can we best dig ourselves out from under it.",

They should have prioritize teaching financial freedom if they really cared, this should have been taught not only at homes but at schools. Truthfully, not all grown up's knows how to make money work for them ands been a major disturbance in this turbulent times. Also, job's are traps, I hope alot of people get to realize that, people fear for not having money makes them jump into all of these jobs, they might build you wealths but I think they're traps and illusional.In depressed time's like this, I think it's the best time to make investment, when others are simply scared to do. ( I'm no expert at this though ) We should try to look out for the bigger picture ( opportunities ) and not focus only on recession. Frightening for me to think about food scarcity coming  .    Investors, Big Business owners and self employed will be greatly backed in these times. I hope GOD does hears our plight, cause crazier things will happen.",

      "body": "I agree with some of his points. Inflation at 8.6% is crazy high. So is record low unemployment rates along with high commodity prices. All this points to stagflation and a recession.The rate hikes in the past did nothing, we still got a huge 1% CPI print from the month prior. Inflation should be 2-3 % for entire year not month. Something needs to break and it will. Lay offs and hiring freezes are already starting. And consumer confidence is shot.",

Any fool can tell there is going to be a recession. But how are we going to keep ourselves safe from it is really an intriguing question, i think best way is to create multiple sources of income and also make sure you create such a position for yourself at the workplace that you become really irreplaceable. I think these are the only two things you can do on income front.",

Now that COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine war took the world by storm, the economy has been deteriorating at a fast pace. Constant government spending and higher inflation rates will lead us to a recession very soon. Crypto was once thought to be a safe haven against Fiat (especially Bitcoin), but it proved us wrong as now all cryptocurrencies are in the \"red zone\". What will happen during the remainder of the year is a mystery to all of us.Unless COVID-19 disappears and Russia stops the invasion, we won't be seeing any economic recovery anytime soon. Maybe a global reset will happen, paving the way for CBDCs to take over existing Fiat (paper money)? Just my thoughts",

USD is at it's highest inflation rate in 4 decades, and the federal reserve hiked interest rates to slow down inflation. Inflation was already high for USD prior to the Ukrainian war -- problem is that supply chain shortages and post-COVID lockdown economic strain has caused the EUR to increase too. Nearly every market is down and major companies are hiring fewer people or laying off staff.You don't need to be a top economist to predict an economic collapse.
