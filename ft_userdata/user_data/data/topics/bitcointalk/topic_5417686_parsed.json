  "content": "We've all heard of cases when a user pays too much gas fee, sometimes tens or even hundreds of ETH. Most of the times, at least in POW times, the miner would return the huge fee.It seems that the trend did not die with the Merge.https://cryptobriefing.com/suspected-ethereum-exploit-drains-wallet-of-121-eth-in-gas-fees/Analysts seem to suggest an exploit of some sort. The transaction in question is this one https://etherscan.io/tx/0x4a84d0872887f91546cd5400cf99763b654975efb3376ee55e4463bcfbca4e97 and they say there are more where this came from.https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1582756435955359744?t=Q-KyMcSnmAAFTnQl67WJLw&s=19Hope it was some sort of user error, but pretty suspicios that this sort of error happened 25 times already.",

In this case, the validator made a profit.The most reliable way to interact with mart contracts is to use separate wallets that do not have a lot of money.",

I do not expect a beginner person to complete transfers of thousands of dollars without having sufficient knowledge of how the blockchain network works with Ethereum.The most plausible hypothesis is that one of the miners perform these operations, if we assume that they can choose the transactions on the network, and therefore they can confirm the transactions that they make themselves. I don't have enough technical experience to confirm this but I know that this is possible with Bitcoin and I don't know how compatible it is with Ethereum.",
