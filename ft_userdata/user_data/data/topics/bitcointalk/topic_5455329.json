  "content": "After suing Binance and CZ yesterday, SEC focused on Coinbase today claiming that they acted as an unregistered broker. SEC claims that SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH, and NEXO that are all listed on Coinbase are securities. Interesting days ahead and I can see bitcoin price going even more down.Quote from: https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908/gov.uscourts.nysd.599908.1.0.pdfCoinbase operates a trading platform (the “Coinbase Platform”) through which U.S. customers can buy, sell, and trade crypto assets. The assets that Coinbase makes available include crypto asset securities. Coinbase is the largest crypto asset trading platform in the United States and has serviced over 108 million customers, accounting for billions of dollars in daily trading volume in hundreds of crypto assets. The Coinbase Platform merges three functions that are typically separated in traditional securities markets—those of brokers, exchanges, and clearing agencies. Yet, Coinbase has never registered with the SEC as a broker, national securities exchange, or clearing agency, thus evading the disclosure regime that Congress has established for our securities markets.All the while, Coinbase has earned billions of dollars in revenues by, among other things, collecting transaction fees from investors whom Coinbase has deprived of the disclosures and protections that registration entails and thus exposed to significant risk.Throughout the Relevant Period, Coinbase has made available for trading crypto assets that are being offered and sold as investment contracts, and thus as securities. This includes, but is not limited to, the units of each of the crypto asset securities further described below—with trading symbols SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, SAND, AXS, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH,and NEXO—(the “Crypto Asset Securities”)",

I don't think a lawsuit would stand if the exchanges had their own definitions when listing the coins, unless the SEC sued some other stuff.",

This is an instant reaction of the market to the news. After that, the market slowly recovers or start to accumulate in the low range.Yesterday, the market dumped on the Binance news, and today also when the \"Sec sues Coinbase\" news was published, the market shows an instant reaction. However, today's volatility was less as compared to the previous day volatility and price dump.",

According to what I have read before, he admitted that bitcoin is not a security but a commodity. Ether and others is what he is calling securities. I think he is right about is stance because cryptocurrencies are securities but bitcoin among them is very different and remain to be a commodity.",

I don't know why everyone is angry at Gary, from a maximalist point of view he is the best we can get- the tokens above shouldn't be labeled securities, they should be called shiteries, just dumped them- he has numerous times stated that Bitcoin alone is not a security- he has called out the centralization in what we want to perceive as a decentralized ecosystem, including in the Defi- he doesn't like CBDC, and I don;t think any Bitcoin user doesSo, what is really to hate about him?The thank that he told the biggest two manipulators in crypto to stop issuing shiteries and pump and dump schemes?That he told exchanges to stop messing with user funds and separate deposits from investments?Quote“We don’t know who Satoshi Nakamoto is yet, who she, or he, or they, were. It’s a field built off of sort of a concept to not use centralization even though finance since antiquity tended toward centralization. To be decentralized, lack of authorities, anti-commercial bank, anti-central bank, a worldwide off-the-grid approach. And yet it very much relies on the law when they go bankrupt and they’re in bankruptcy court. And you know what we’ve seen.”Everyone who is against his views, do you have a problem with the above? Like what, I'm curious!",
