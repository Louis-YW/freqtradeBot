      "body": "I mean, you want to discuss why FTT currency is still listed on Binance or why your currency was removed from the platform? In either case, the idea that the administrators of the two platforms were involved in the spam that occurred cannot be confirmed, although it is possible that each of them was a partial contributor to the collapse of FTX.Regarding your currency, why is it difficult for you to understand that not everyone recognized it and many consider it to be a confirmed scam, at the same time that it is accepted in many services and payment gateways.Note: It is not a good idea to create a self-moderated topic because it will not be comfortable for members to write their thoughts freely while they expect that you may delete it if you don't like it. This board does not contain much spam, with the exception of drama lovers from new accounts or tagged ones.",

Remember when Terra has been delisted by other platform during the early issues? Then thats the same cause its literally extend the trading on luna instead of preventing further losses on that token. Now its happening again on FTT wherein Binance still keeping the token for open trading which could broke others when this one go out of nuts.",

Token emission is impossible now due to FTX bankrupcy. That's why all the volumes are drawnBy the way, Binance is not the only one that still lists FTT coin for trading. There are other large platforms where users can still trade FTT against major currencies. The reason for this may be because the platform has a huge balance of that currency and is trying to get rid of as much as possible. And if you notice, you will find that there are actually sales taking place even after the collapse of FTX. At least we are sure that Binance has a large amount that it acquired when the price of 1 FTT was equal to or more than $22.According to the TOS of those platforms, there is nothing to prevent them from keeping dead currencies or to force them to stop trading tokens belong to scam project.Anyways, you can write to them yourself and ask for an explanation. I doubt you will receive an answer.",
