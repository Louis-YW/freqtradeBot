They're just want to control the money circulation to stabilize their fiat value, if they're keep print and add to the circulation, they will suffer high inflation rate. However the government has no choice when there's a crisis they need to print new money even though inflation will occur, because the gap distribution of money between the rich and poor is really far.",

It might suck to live in a country that has a poor economy, low natural resources to sell and poor living conditions. But it is upon the individual to move on from that, earn a living and strive to reach a better living condition.More money in circulation does not solve the problem, that increases the inflation. But how much a person is able to work and earn, that differs.",

Currently, we are in a period of crisis and recession, if people can survive and take advantage of the downturn, we will have a good life when the time of prosperity comes. Historically, the economy has experienced similar difficulties many times, and it always overcomes them all, you don't need to worry about everyone, what you need to worry about is yourself.",

It would have also been nice if you could name the countries in Africa, Europe and others that are facing the cash crunch, I doubt if you would be able to name up to 5 of them.Zimbabwe was the African country that was battered by it but is getting over it before the case of Nigeria in which the main target of the government is to counter Money laundering, Vote buying, Kidnapping and many other menaces in the society.",

You won't find any countries that don't suffer like that dude. All countries also experience inflation and even when it has not gone away from the problems of the governments.And it cannot be denied that the whole world is now facing a crisis, which is why the decrease in the inflation rate depends on the government's decision. That's why there is often a moderate situation, only equal balance always.",

We also can't complain to the government and can only try ourselves by saving our income to prepare ourselves if inflation really comes. Everything has changed now and we can't do anything but just follow what's happening around us and keep trying to survive. I'm sure we can still survive even if the government fails us, the banks don't work because we are strong survivors in every bad situation. We can survive.",

Do you mean that because of inflation, those funds lost their value, or is there no cash, or is it difficult to access loans and new funds?Many countries in the world face the problem of inflation, which is that you have a lot of money, but its purchasing value is very low, and therefore money has no value and value is rare.Some, due to the Federal Reserve's increase in interest, are draining liquidity from the market, and it is difficult to access fresh money.If the non-use of cash is common in your country, there should be no liquidity problems.",

And this they have seen as problematic should there be more printing and pumping of fiat money. For this reasons many countries have gone digital where electronic money transaction is the order of the day reducing much physical cash in hands of citizens and having it more electronically under the control of the central banks of the country so to reduce inflation effect and crisis. This thereby is believed to lead to increase value of the currency, products and services and reduce/control fraudulent activities",

This is rather a complex topic, but the point is that so few have so much while the rest of the huge majority can only do with what's little left. Globally, the richest 1% has almost twice as much money as the rest of the 99%.[1] If this is to be observed locally, it means a small family of 3 owns a number of mansions, ranches, and farms while a family of 10 only lives in a dilapidated shack on a very small piece of land that isn't theirs.From where I am, a government consultant who barely reports to office could receive a salary 1,775% more than a staff who needs to work everyday.

In some cases, the policies may not be effective in ensuring a stable economy, which can lead to a shortage of money.The issues you mentioned, such as unemployment, insecurity, and corruption, are all interconnected and can contribute to a scarcity of money in circulation. For example, corruption can lead to mismanagement of funds, which can result in a shortage of money available for investment and economic growth.",

People hardly meet up this days, the government has failed us, the banks are not working, companies and industries has reduced quality of products.I know there is scarcity of fiat in Nigeria because the government is redesigning the country's currency to improve it's security, reduce counterfeiting and ransome payments to kidnapers. I have not heard about the same problem in any other country.Regarding poor quality of goods in most countries, this is the result of poor regulation and control. Most countries don't have effective mechanism to control the importation and local production of goods. Most countries have become a dumping ground for most developed nations. They dump outdated and sometime environmentally unfriendly good without considering it's negative impact. Locally produced good are not evaluated to check it they meet global standards.QuoteIs affecting so many countries in Africa, America and Europe, the rate of unemployment, insecurities and corruption is becoming alarming by day.

The global economic crisis caused by COVID-19 and the Russian invasion of Russia is not also helping matters. Many firms have closed dou to high cost of raw materials and inflation.
