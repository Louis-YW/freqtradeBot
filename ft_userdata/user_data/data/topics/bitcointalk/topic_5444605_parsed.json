      "body": "An Asian Total with a whole or half number (e.g. over/under 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, etc) works like a standard Total over/under bet. So if you bet over or under 2.0, and there are exactly 2 goals, the bet is pushed, meaning you get back your stake but win nothing.It is only when you bet on an Asian Total with a quarter number (e.g. 0.75, 1.25, etc) that you start getting in to the realms of half wins or half losses. If you bet on over 1.75 and there were 2 goals, half your stake on 1.5 would win, and half your stake on 2.0 would be pushed.",
