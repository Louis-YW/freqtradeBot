Is it a good idea to rob a bank? Steal from grannies? How about kidnapping to make a living?By asking this obviously nefarious question, you show you lack morals.Mods please don't delete this topic for reference.Full quote:Quote from: cafter on September 12, 2023, 02:25:38 PMI know a place their some people live on stolen electricity, is it a good idea to mine bitcoin stealing electricity?

      "body": "I will not go into the obvious moral implications of such an action, but we can discuss some practical concerns.First things first, stealing electricity is illegal. If you get caught, you're looking at some serious trouble, hefty fines or even worse. Now, from a practical standpoint, Bitcoin mining can be a real power hog. If you're stealing electricity, you might not have enough juice to run a mining rig properly. It's not like just powering a few light bulbs or your TV. These mining setups can chomp down a bunch of kilowatt-hours. So, it's not just a matter of whether it's a good idea; it's also about whether it's even possible without tripping alarms or frying your circuits. Not to mention fire and electric shock hazards. It's a risky business all around.",
