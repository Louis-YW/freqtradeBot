  "content": "Beginner here, Getting started with Bitcoin, just wondering if anyone else uses Coinbase Wallet (i'm on Android).Just a few questions.1. Given the website has the option to sell on it, the app does not, it looks like I need to transfer my Wallet contents back over to the Coinbase website (which looks like it has a different address) if I want to sell. Given I paid a fee to buy through Coinbase into the wallet, is it normal to pay yet another fee to send it back to Coinbase account in order to sell? 2. Is the process of selling just as simple as buying through most exchanges, eg exchanges don't try to stop you. The fact that the Coinbase app doesn't have the option to sell, only to send to another address, seems concerning. You're paying a fee to buy Crypto, and you're paying a fee just to send it back to the Coinbase exchange, only then to sell it (and presumably then to be faced with yet another fee?)I am yet to try other exchanges, my eyes are on SwissBorg and Ledger based on recommendations. Any beginner tips would be useful as well. I am simply testing out Crypto at the moment as I believe Bitcoin should drop a bit some time next year after the current climb?, thereafter would be a better time to purchase.",

You should not use it to store your coins in long term since you don’t own your private key / seed phrase which will give you a serious problem once Coinbase encounter a problem that will result to freeze of your account.Use non-custodial wallet like Electrum or Bluewallet to store your Bitcoin and just send your coins on exchange when you are ready to sell. I don’t have any experience on using Coinbase wallet but they are centralized exchange which means their wallet is centralized too.",

      "body": "Coinbase has a wallet, and they also have an exchange. The exchange is different from the wallet, and any transaction that happens on the blockchain requires you to pay a fee in order for the transaction to be completed. Unless you are using a Coinbase exchange account, where you can transfer from that account to another one, which could just be an internal transfer, that's the only place you don't need to pay a fee to send out. If you don't want to be paying a fee for sending out crypto, if you are a day trader, then you should have the coins that you are trading on a place order in an exchange if you are so concerned about the fee, but still, leaving coins in an exchange is not really a good option, nor is holding coins in a close source wallet a good choice either. I don't know how Coinbase works fully, but I think it's not entirely a self-custodial wallet, so if you plan to hold coins for a long time, you should choose yet another open source wallet that you can use for holding. The transaction fee for sending coins from one wallet to another is inevitable; you will also have to pay one. The fees are just different depending on the blockchain and the wallet that you are using.",

In as much as I am not sure if this Coinbase wallet you are talking about is independent from the Coinbase exchange I still feel there would be some connections that won't give you complete authority over your wallet.Rather than finding out the hard way I suggest you get a personal wallet preferably one that has no affiliation to any exchange and when you want to buy it sell you can transfer from your wallet to the exchange and vice versa.",

Given I paid a fee to buy through Coinbase into the wallet, is it normal to pay yet another fee to send it back to Coinbase account in order to sell? Yes, the fee depends on the type of wallet you send the Bitcoin to; some wallet will allow customize your fee for transactions in case the default fee is high, while some have fix fees, but all depending on Bitcoin network congestion in the mempool.Quote2.

I am simply testing out Crypto at the moment as I believe Bitcoin should drop a bit some time next year after the current climb?, thereafter would be a better time to purchase.There are other exchanges that support buy and sell of Bitcoin, and in case you want to even sell your Bitcoin back to fiat currency, some exchanges support peer-to-peer transactions that allow you to exchange your coins to your local currency.For a better experience with crypto exchanges, you can try Binance or Kucoin exchanges because they are a bit easier to operate. If you care about your privacy, which is very important, you can try any exchanges from here, they do not require KYC verification.",

Coinbase has a wallet and you can use it to store Bitcoin, but since you are on Android, you have various options that provide you with higher privacy, security, and the ability to customize fees to pay the lowest transaction fees according to the time you want to spend before your transaction is included in the next block.Use Samourai Wallet [1]-electrum[2] and blue wallet[3]Quote from: RodneyUK on November 13, 2023, 03:04:57 PMI am yet to try other exchanges, my eyes are on SwissBorg and Ledger based on recommendations.

TXs within the exchange are off-chain/virtual. The non-custodial solution does seem to provide you your keys to control your assets (again read *). Moving to/from this solution will incur in performing on-chain TXs, with the associated fees. In addition, if you want to buy/sell some through your Coinbase account, you’ll have to perform an onchain TX to move from one wallet (the non-custodial one) to another (the Exchange’s custodial one).(*) It is highly interesting to read this thread on the non-custodial wallet solution to get an inkling on why it’s not something that really recommendable, having a wide range of better solutions that are open source.",

Still a lot to learn for me but it seems the community here is very helpful.It doesn't necessarily need to be a hardware wallet for it to be non-custodial, like hosseinimr93 pointed out.  If a wallet lets you fully control your funds instead of the company behind it then it's a non-custodial wallet. As for the Ledger Nano, they are not so popular no more.  Folks are ticked off about some of their recent controversial decisions and  if you're in the market for a hardware wallet, I'd say go with an open source one from a trusted company instead of Ledger.",
