  "content": "NoteNo one can stop its adoptionToday i came across a really interesting Post on twitter and its shows in a video how the mayor of lugano (switzerland) was paying for the goods and services rendered to him with bitcoin all over the city  and i came to the conclusion that its only a matter of time before the adoption of bitcoin is going to be seen like this in every city of the world.   Like the video in this tweet bitcoin is already spreading and many people have started accepting bitcoin as a means of payment in their small business Enterprises and firms in my own country (Nigeria) although its still not allowed to transact bitcoin with the local fiat bank in my place but the use of bitcoin is still spreading and its doesn't stop people from trading through peer to peer transaction and i hope the government of the world starts seeing the value and force that bitcoin is coming with in the world today and start legalizing it in their own country. bitcoinmagazinePlease image was gotten from twitter post",

As we can see, only a few percent that is already using this, but there are still a lot of people we need to encourage. Even 10 years from now we're still far from happening. However, it was really good to see that crypto gives interest to the community, and therefore, I can say that Bitcoin is not a failed project.",

Bitcoin has actually came a long way that it can’t be stopped again. Let me say it’s a viral disease without an antidote to cure it in the minds of many people already. Quote from: DoublerHunter on February 02, 2023, 10:43:13 PM^The most common scenario that will happen, is every time when the market has a bull trend, the adoption becomes widely spread.This is exactly the way it works, after the next bull run, more people will show interest in cryptocurrency and will want to benefit what others have gained after passing through series of market survey. The good use of the media to disseminate such news makes it more easier to spread the positive news about it.

We do have seen different approach when it comes for government to take stance on whatever they are currently seeing specially on decentralized things like crypto.We do know that there are places who had already accepted Bitcoin and there are ones who are still neutral and there are ones who had prohibited or totally ban it out.This is why each government would really be having differentstance when it comes to Bitcoin adoption.Its good if on the place you were living it does have  that positive stance on which as a citizen and at the same time a crypto enthusiastwould really be able to benefit out from that which is always an advantace.If not, then we could always have the viable option for us to make out transactions.",

Bitcoin is a multifunctional product that has all the outstanding features of gold and fiat money. I don't expect bitcoin to become legal tender globally because of its decentralization, but it is only a matter of time before it is legally accepted globally. As people's needs increase, governments will have no choice but to accept it as a commodity or currency of their choice.",

Both are benefiting from the rising use of contactless payments.

However, the adoption level for Bitcoin globally are still below 10%. But, on a positive note, Bitcoin price have already reached what most people did not expect what Bitcoin is capable of. Establishing a cashless system can be done using electronic networks that are currently used by almost all financial institutions. There are countries where all operations are done using bank cards, and anyone can live in them without using cash. This method enables the continuation of tracking the balances and transfers of citizens. Do not forget that countries adoption of Bitcoin does not serve their central policies. Bitcoin can serve them in international exchanges, since it is a global currency that is not owned by any party. And most importantly, it provides an opportunity to get rid of the dollar.",

I am doubting that, except in countries that bitcoin is totally banned, there are many bitcoin friendly countries in the world. Only what the government will not allow is to make bitcoin a legal tender, but if you want to use it, they do not stop you from using it. If you like you can send it to someone or not. The government do not care about citizens to that extent, they care more about their pockets and their selfish reasons, that is the reason why they will not accept bitcoin to a greater extent because they do not want decentralization that can reduce their control.",
