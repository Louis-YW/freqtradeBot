      "body": "NFT hysteria is gone. When marketplaces were flooded with a pile of unnecessary NFT tokens, and famous collections were sold for fabulous money, it was all on a wave of hype, which ended along with the bull trend. Now NFT as a speculative asset, no one is interested because the industry is saturated with projects and their tokens, which were overpriced.I think, in the future there will be only known and interesting projects, and all the junk that is more than 86% of the market will die out finally.Â  There will be punks, ape boards, cryptokittys, etc., as well as famous collections of public people, but they will no longer be worth millions of dollars that they were originally asked for, because it's all a trivial crypto bubble that had to burst sooner or later.",

But there are still who keeps holding thinking they would still have a chance to make profit from it but in reality it won't be happening again unless if it's a bull run. Plus it's not really that they were a thing, people just buy it because of the trend and now the trends end how can they skip the holding part when almost everyone is selling and not to mention some of it are useless.",

They are watching market everyday and im sure they are also feeling bad with the market with bitcoin that was going so deep again and again. We have seen so many people forgot the existence of NFT. I see that so many NFT projects have been loosing a lot of price during the bearish season. So people will try to go in the NFT project once market will better than this time.",

I am guessing that the worst thing that could happen is also the best thing for the investors/users. Which is, do not spend that much money on NFT unless it provides you with a reason for it. There are a million NFT's coming out everyday, and they are just saying \"look how great it is\" and making it work somehow, not anymore, from now on investors will ask serious questions before they invest into anything and that will be great for us, but terrible for the NFT market cap overall.",

Though I see a critical level for the P2E, if they are no longer profitable most probably investors wont come back to them again.",

If you see those good NFTs at a cheaper price, better to grab some since NFT is not done yet and they still have a lot of things to offer.
