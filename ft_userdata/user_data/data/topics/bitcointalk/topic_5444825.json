Sometimes it seems like people are going out of their way to find stuff to report. Posts that have been edited shouldn't be removed anyway as someone can just edit their post and then report it to try make sure it's fully deleted and people can try cover their tracks this way. There probably should be some sort of statue of limitations on certain stuff because posts in dead threads from years ago really isn't an issue. If you want to report stuff there's thousands of posts made a day by shitposters so it's not like you'll ever run out of stuff to do.",

But I understand.With that came another question:How does the forum deal with a person's right to be \"forgotten\"? Imagine that a user wants to delete all his activity from the forum, is it possible?",

A user can delete all posts and topics created by him/herself and block himself/herself with a secret question. But. Deleting everything a user has written on the forum won't do any work, because we have tracking services that save everything that is written on the forum.",

Simply put, don't make enemies and don't scam people, you will be fine. And leave the antics to remain in the past, lol why do you guys care about old topics anyways.",
