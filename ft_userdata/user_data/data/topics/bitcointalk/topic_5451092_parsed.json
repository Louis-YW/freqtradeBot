You cannot leave your mining farm unattended for a long time, and in the summer you will need to monitor your video cards more closely.600W PCIe 5.0 12VHPWR Type-4 PSU Power Cable - https://www.corsair.com/us/en/p/pc-components-accessories/cp-8920284/600W-PCIe-5-0-12VHPWR-Type-4-PSU-Power-Cable-cp-8920284RTX 4090 - Replacing 3x 8-pin Adapter with 600W PCIe 5.0  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOTo9_xekzgThank you. But of course it is very expensive. 3 cables for 6 GPU headers on the power supply will cost about half the cost of the power supply  Nvidia assholes.Therefore, I will choose other models with 8 pin power connector or AMD video cards that do not change the power connector.I paid 25 euros for one cable, the PSU costed 300 euro, so I think it's a reasonable price.In Russia, a corsair power supply (gold or platinum) of 1000 watts costs 100 euros. But you can buy for 10-20 euros cheaper in bulk.Ii is 3-4 years old, but the warranty for such power supplies is 10 years. For 300 euros you probably bought a more powerful unit, but I can use 2 used power supplies total power 2000 watt for 200 euros.Yes, it is HX1500i. I have RM1000x on my other rigs.We always have an inadequate price for such power supplies, and in the season they could cost $ 600, and this is the price of a used power supply. 850 or 1000 watts are the most popular power supplies in this series. For more power, it is better to choose a server PSU.There are chinese atx PSU with ratings of 3000w, 2000w, they are big and lots of wires. They are cheap, might worth a try--only for old ROI'd cards LOLI think running them at 50-60% of rated power would be ideal.Each of these Chinese power supplies has its drawbacks, because manufacturers save on buying quality components. Moreover, if you need more than 2000 watts and 2 corsair power supplies of 1000 watts each do not suit you, then it is better to buy server power supplies. I wouldn't buy cheap power supplies because I don't want to risk a stack of graphics cards.even low quality components gets a good life span if you use them at half the rated spec and in cooler environment.an example is LED bulbs i own Philips, that have average lifespan of 1 year (heavy use), i had a chinese (forgot the brand), but due to aluminum heat sink to the electronic component, lasted for 4+ years (heavy use).hehe that's why you don't throw old cards, you stress test first with a bunch of 290x and then run it light and cool.even branded quality PSUs breaks down due to heat and high load. huge ATX PSU will save you the trouble of dealing with break out boards.also if it is cheap, it will ROI faster.",

But since service centers in my country do not repair them, the sellers returned the money to me for the purchase. Sometimes it turned out to buy a similar power supply cheaper.There may not be a problem with Chinese power supplies, but now it is better to buy a proven branded PSU, because they are cheap.",

For the cheap psu, you don't need to wait for 10 years for ROI.I would only use the cheap psu on old gpus, when upgrading use the branded on new cards, move the old cards to the chinese psu.",
