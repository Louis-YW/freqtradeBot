  "content": "I'm glad to congratulate myself for ranking up with two Bitcoin gold as symbols having possessing the rank of member, When I started this journey I thought that I will not get to this certain rank because I was discouraged with some comments of criticism in my thread but I was determined to continue the race because I have desire to learn and understand bitcoin through bitcointalk, my determination motivated me to read other people comment's and I told myself that i will reach to the position of member rank one day, and today I became a member. What I noticed in this forum is that, it's all about determination and desires but not all about desperation, and secondly I think that consistent research is one of the keys that keeps users moving forward and not to be backslide in anything concerning Bitcoin.When I registered in bitcointalk I don't know too well concerning forum and bitcoin, but with the help of forum I'm able to know some of the wallets that's good for bitcoin storage and some valuable altcoin that's good for investment, so without forum I won't have known altcoin as sub bitcoin and electrum wallet as a good wallet, assuming I have not found myself in bitcointalk forum i won't have known all these today. I want to openly say that I'm grateful for been a member of bitcointalk and also founding myself in the mixed of people who embrace bitcoin and also discuss the positivity of bitcoin. I have noticed that many other people obtain the knowledge of Bitcoin through bitcointalk forum, I use this opportunity to thank everyone for a link shared for me to update me with the goodies of forum.Should Incase I'm wrong for posting how excited I'm for reach member position, you can direct me where to celebrate my rank.",

Although I will regard it as low quality posting. This is even not about copying and pasting. Assuming you make a topic. You wanted to make it self moderated but you did not. You lock the thread and make another same topic which is self moderated. That is understandable that it is not copy and paste. That is what that happens in this regard.",

Congratulations OP. I am glad you didn't give up because you wouldn't have achieved this feat. In the journey to success, you will face many problems that will try to deter you from pursuing your goals and aspiration. My early days in this forum were not also easy. Bitcointalk made me understand and believe in this cryptocurrency and I cannot thank this forum enough. I also encountered some challenges like criticism and others but I saw the forum as a where you have to be humble to learn. As a student, the teachers have the right to correct and sometimes criticize, but you must take them in good fate. I never also thought that I will make it to the level I am now, but if you are teachable, consistent, and persistent, there is nothing you can not achieve. If you continue with this effort OP, achieving the next rank will also become possible.",
