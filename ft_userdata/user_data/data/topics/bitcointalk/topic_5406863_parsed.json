You can provide some more information, such as the current rank of your casino. not the same if he is just started or already has a history. Also, there are certainly some targets that you expect and you already have a defined budget for all that. (Not only for salary)I hope you don't expect to get some free ideas through the applications here.Quote from: rhomelmabini on July 19, 2022, 03:14:16 PMI bet you can find the best and right people here on the Services board of this forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0.

If you read a little better, OP is looking for marketers, not bounty campaign managers. those are two different jobs.",

First is preferable Bitcointalk signature campaign which has preferred by other users as well. Another is to use banner ads on crypto-oriented sites. You may use Coinzila for that, they established a great advertising network. I have seen a couple of reputed casinos running ads through Coinzila. Both of them would use by you or you may hire a signature campaign manager from the forum.",
