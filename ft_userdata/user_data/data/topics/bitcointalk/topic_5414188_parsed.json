Congratulations to them.But nobody is aware of what can happen when it's already launched. Since it's just the presale, everyone who invested has to wait except the developers who has a full access to the market of it at any time.I've just seen some project lately that has been introduced well in the market a few months ago and within 10 minutes after the launching just this day, it went to -95%.",

      "body": "Memecoin is a 'meme' coin, no matter how you look at it. If I'm not mistaken, there's still no utility for this one likewise with other cryptos of the same category. Most of the time, coins of such are only good for a short period of time, and once the hype cools down, it will have a hard time to be back on its feet unlike with utility tokens and the others which has specific functions. But to be clear, I am not ignoring the fact that it could really be profitable to invest, what I am trying to say is to take extra caution with betting your money to tokens or investments. Goal is to lessen the risk of losing in an investment.",
