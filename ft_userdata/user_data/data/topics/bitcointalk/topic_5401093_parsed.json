      "body": "NFT is simply a trend that has already started fading away. The video game makers don't need NFT to prove the ownership of in-game digital asset. The game makers can simply create an online marketplace if they are willing to provide their users the privilege to trade in-game items. But most of the game makers will surely want to keep these trading power to themselves as it generates recurring revenue for them. So they would definitely want to keep 100% of that amount instead of wanting to earn royalty from each sale. NFT and thousands of unused tokens are actually complicating the crypto market which can be avoided without creating any chaos. It's purely a hype where early adopters have made millions just like it happened in ICO boom. But it's now all set to die. We can have this conversation in the next year at the same time and we will see.",

We have old system called \"Account\", as long the item is in your account then is yours not them. Take an example of CSGO.Not everything needed to be NFTs, even Gaben from Valve don't want their system have NFTs.",

Currently, NFT no longer has any appeal, as all is based on the hype that is about to die out. The video games you'd expect don't require digital ownership at NFT, as they already have a permanent license meaning copying a work won't last long. Claiming that it's yours? I can too, as long as I can take ownership in NFT first.",

I tnink the future is in NFT-based games. At present I am following the project \"reptile chronicles\". I'm interested in this project because it has its own deep lore and the game will be like HS. Therefore I'm really looking forward for the release of this game.",

      "body": "NFTs or ‘Non-fungible Tokens’ are digital fields encoded on a blockchain using the same cryptocurrency. Unlike standard formats like mp3, mp4, png, etc., NFTs can not be replicated, meaning each NFT is wholely unique unto itself.For example, if an artist sells a piece of art as an NFT, and you buy it, you will be able to verify, using blockchain technology that you are the sole owner of that singular product.",

      "body": "NFT's are a scam and will disappear just like how ICO's came and went in the past. It is not revolutionary tech, it is not digital property rights, it is basically nothing. People already lost their interest in the NFT's because they quickly realized that if they can't sell them for a higher price to somebody else then practically they own nothing but worthless metadata. Digital property means pretty much nothing on the internet where you can copy/paste everything (not possible or way harder to do in the real physical world)",

With NFT, the hype is over already and those who will manage to survive will be the ones who will thrive as well.I have invested into NFT Games only but in NFT arts? I will not try to buy any art because I just don't know the main reason why people are spending hundreds of Ethereum or hundreds of thousands of dollars just to buy a mere art that doesn't have any use case at all. I can just make a picture in a avatar creation app and sell it on Opensea if I wanted to.

So what? Bragging rights? I just don't know what is the main reason why people are buying those arts TBH. Maybe enlighten me . Thanks",

No dude!NFT is more than what you think and I have seen many persons criticizing it as a bizzare digital art. This is wrong and very even though it has always being hyped, it doesn't mean that NFT does not worth the price. NFT create an authentic ownership which makes it unique. I don't want to write much here because I know everyone has there own opinion.",

They're just going to limit their market and customers if it's going to be an NFT.Not every gamer is into NFT and would like to be a big part of it or do some ownership through it.While for the game developers, they want it to be as attractive as it can be because they're for the sales and next to it the enjoyment that their customers will feel. I think more of NFT gaming than ownership is still what's going to get everyone's attention just as what happened this past year.",

It won’t be long now before we find out.I'm not sure what you meant by how the software is being owned by the distributor because they are the real owners. But we all know that they are a lot of pirated games, so maybe that's one way to somewhat prevent it. As for if NFT are fad? Well history tells us this, ICO-IEO-Defi and then others. What I'm trying to drive at is that crypto is based on that. It's evolving new hype is created and then the old one just died down. So this might be the case in the future if we will have some craze in the next 2 years and NFT might be forgotten.",
