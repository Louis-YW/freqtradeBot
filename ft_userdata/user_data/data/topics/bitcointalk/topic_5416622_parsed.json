During my time of research, I found out that a lot of project, both past and present are scamming people one way or the other, they rip those investors off their hard earned money. This got me thinking what are the categories, features and observation to put into consideration before investing in a crypto project. I really want to learn and enlighten my self about this.",

Just my takeThere may be some like that, but how do you find them, it is like a task of searching for a needle in a haystack or trying to recover bitcoin you lost all backups to, in both cases your search will end up with no good results. The call is yours in the end, all the bitcointalk community can do is give you our individual opinion. Do not forget that initial hype, which is what most new projects have, isn't potential in itself, a coin with potential will last for a long time and most new altcoins do not. Some altcoins may not be scam in terms of rug pulling and running away with people's money, but when one creates a useless coin like do kwon did with luna and the entire system collapses, causing investors to lose billions of dollars, that is surely a scam too.",

I am sure when hype is away, you will have better entries.If you love one project, you can wait to invest in it. A few months or one year is not a big issue. If you invest in new projects and in early days, it is likely you will invest together with fomo that is not good. Higher entries and you also have to wait for correcrion, accumulation.",

Just my takeThen don't ask someone to dissuade you from what you consider to be a good business opportunity, because the responsibility of any investment should be solely yours. Most people who are not inclined to altcoins will advise you to invest only in Bitcoin, but if you go to altcoins boards, you will certainly hear the opposite opinion.In order to investigate the risk that comes with such projects, you need to have a lot of experience, because although there are those who literally scream \"scam\" everywhere, there are also those who are very mean and invest a lot of money and time to create the impression of legality.",

Since altcoins don't have any real utilities, they don't have any long term potential.This is why the \"trading\" market is very active and prices are too volatile in a scheme called pump and dump. Basically people make bets on altcoins in short term during their pumps and make a quick profit by dumping them before others.Meanwhile those who baghold altcoins miss all that action while watching their \"investment\" melt away.This is true about all the altcoins too. For example ETH used to be worth twice as much as its current price in 2017 and any bitcoins you'd invested in it is now cut in half since it got dumped and could never recover. But in short term it has good pumps and you could have ridden to increase the amount of bitcoins you own which actually has a lot of utilities hence long term potential.",

I really want to learn and enlighten my self about this.Actually most project never had the intention of developing themselves into becoming a proper company in the spacesl even with all the money they have raised and it's always a shame seeing this. I have worked with some numbers of project and majority are just after the hype, the moment the hype dies down the project dies as well. Altcoins are just selling beliefs and never a product. They claim they can solved a particular problem then investor get excited and hand  over their money then the project vanish as they never had any intention of solving that problem in the first place while others go around claiming to solve a problem which doesn't even exist or already have a working project solving that same problem. Altcoins lack utility and they're just useful for trading purpose (which you should be very educated before you engage in such) and immediately that's lost they die. There's no blueprint for investing in an altcoin and get it right. Those doing so and profiting most times are just lucky or following the trend which if you're not smart enough would end up getting you rekted.",

The belief these days with those new altcoins are they're likely going to be dumped as soon as possible and the hype will gone too soon.Yeah, some my not end up being a scam.But if you're too slow, you'll be left behind by those traders that knows how to play the game of the quick pump and dump from those altcoins.",

Some of the new altcoins may have good potential to grow in the future, but to expect the projects grow quickly during this bearish market looks very difficult. Especially for the new altcoins with weak fundamentals, they will be hard to struggle with the current market situation. If you want to invest safely, I suggest you to invest in established coins or top coins that already have big market caps.",
