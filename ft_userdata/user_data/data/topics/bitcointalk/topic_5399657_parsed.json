      "body": "Thank you for posting this topic,Since what happened to the Luna coin, scammers have become their main goal to exploit this hype to inflict victims who lost their money in investing in the Luna coin under the pretext of compensating their losses after investing in the new (fake) Luna coin. Therefore, everyone should beware before investing and reviewing the contract address for any coin, especially on Pancakeswap.",

      "body": "With the LUNA crash we are going to see more of such events happening in social media, shady telegram channels and more. It is another example of the nature of scammers in this ecosystem to use running trends to name their own scams and attempt to confuse users who are caught in the chaos.Moreover, tokens on pancakeswap being unregulated this becomes the prime site for scammers to grow their wings.Newbies should stay away from any project naming itself with such. Remember that in crypto money once sent, is gone forever unless the person on the receiving end sends it back. Of course a scammer would not be one if they would do that.Flag supported from my side.",

      "body": "Scammers will consider anything, just so that they can take advantage of the situation. LUNA hype will undoubtedly bring about lots of interest, so it is important that everyone is aware of what is really happening. This scam token has nothing to do with Terra Luna and is in fact nothing but a scam from start to finish. Do not fall for the deceitful actions of these scammers.Quote from: decodx on May 21, 2022, 09:05:55 PMI have tagged and flagged the LunaTerra account, DT please support.Flag: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=2964Good finding, decodx.
