  "content": "Hello. I am offering an expression of interest for hiring one third of my signature for $50 per week. An example of these advertisements can be seen in my signature (which are currently non-sponsored and are free ads for example purposes only, free advertising for some campaigns running right now).I have made an average of 30 posts per week for the last 6 months, without a week missed. I have been a valuable member of two signature campaigns and am currently looking to try something a little different. I have also considered breaking this down into logo-sized spaces (5-10 spaces) for a much lower price ($10-20 per week) however I will have to see what advertisers prefer, if they accept this solution to begin with. For now I've decided to stick with 3 decently sized adverts.Right now the BBCode in the ad spaces could be improved, it works fine for example purposes for the time being though. If there is interest to hire a portion of my signature space, I will work harder to improve the BBCode to work for multiple ads. Terms:- Payments are prepaid either directly upfront or held with an escrow/campaign manager[/b]- A minimum of 20 high quality posts will be made per week from my part ($2.5 per post) - I usually make much more than this per week (30 average for the last 6 months) because I am genuinely interested in discussion on the forum, however I can guarantee 20. At 30 posts, the pay rate is less than $2 per post. On some weeks, I have made over 50 posts, so in these weeks you get good value  Proof of high quality posts, 247 merit in past 120 days. - All ad spaces must be taken and prepaid before the campaign can begin. - You can take more than one ad space/width of 2 or more spaces for 2x-3x the pay rate (e.g 2 spaces/space width = $5 per post, 3 spaces/space width = $7.5 per post)- Price can of course be negotiated for 2+ spaces, depending on terms. - Avatar is also available for a separate price (up for offer).I will update terms when I have some more time/if there is interest. For now this is somewhat of an experiment, as I have never seen anyone come up with a solution like this before Expression of interest only as I am still considering whether to pursue this or to just join a campaign normallyI hope to at least inspire a new idea with this post!Preview:List of things to refine with current bbcode:- View on mobile or low-width windows (sometimes looks fine, sometimes now)- A BBcode version of 3 strip-ads (horizontal) rather than 3 rectangular ads, it might look cleaner- Getting sizes/width equal on the current layout- Probably a lot more. This is a rough idea, and just an expression of interest for the time being.",

      "body": "I have never thought of something new like this, hence I have to commend your creativity. The space of the signature advert is even too small to advertise one service. Most time we see the signatures not revealing the full names, logos, and mottos of these companies. Having two or more firms advertising in that small space will make it ambiguous and complicated. I also think that you should have started a thread on your idea before launching the service. Launching the service with terms of payment might be a distraction from getting genuine responses from the community.Quote from: bullrun2020bro on May 12, 2023, 04:35:16 PMI don't quite understand what this is about.

It will be a big mistake to advertise substitute services. It should be maybe gambling and mixing or exchange and gambling. All the best mate.",

However, projects trying to rent OP's logo space will know how best to go about setting it up. There are always rules and regulations governing every campaign and I don't see how what OP is proposing won't have its own rules too. While I see this as a paradigm shift and believe some campaigns should give it a try, I'm worried that it's likely going to be very hard for OP to get patronage seeing that they aren't a household name here. There are users here projects will be willing to experiment that sort of thing with but I ain't sure OP has such weight and visibility to pull.",

If there’s a company willing to pay for a slot in your signature, do you think it’s fair to make that company wait till heaven knows when/if all your slots would be taken? Supposing all 3 slots are finally taken, what then would happen if one or two companies decides to do away with you after a week, the campaign would then be paused leaving the third company hanging.",

You are right. This can create some problems for the OP. Even I don't think companies will be agreed to buy one space only. Because sometimes companies can not fully highlight them due to limited characters in BBcode design. That means 1/3 space you can not highlight everything about your companies. Another problem could happen with Mobile devices. Of course, if the design is too long in width, this will not show well on mobile devices. Again if OP doesn't have a good idea about BBCode design he can face some issues.",

This advertisement would go in three partition for them if they want it so.  For instance,  I was doing a check on boards when I came across a particular organization promoting s second phase of their product here and it was entirely a different thing from their initial altogether. Not only that I saw another too promoting another phase of their product. The first I saw on gambling board while the second I saw on Service board but I would not mention their various names here.I think these are the types of promotinal campaign and advertisement needed for your services OP. If you mean different organizations entirely coming together to rent the signature space on thread with different partition, i think it would not go down well as each organization is an entity on their own and would love to promote their product on a single platform without anybody sharing the same space with them.I think you have a good point to reckon with OP.",

He isn't promoting any projects yet. His signature space was used for a sample of what it will look like accepting his services.Besides, if his idea will be effective at the backend based on results. It will be a nice idea promoting only two non related projects. (Maybe Casino and mixer).Where the problem may lie is that a gambling project would want him to make majority of his posts in the gambling boards which might not favour a mixer.",

From what i see, no one of them would like to share same space with the other because there seems to be rivalry amongst them which is a big challenge for anyone thinking of going further in such package. Just as you have said, the space would be limited and possibly not contain the signature as a whole and that would cause a little much discrepancies in the signature outlook which would not go down well with the organisations and no body would be willing to pay for such when they have a free space cheaper or at the same price and free for them to own a space.",
