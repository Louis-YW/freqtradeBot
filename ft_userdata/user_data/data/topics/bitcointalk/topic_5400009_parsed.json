  "content": "There is an airdrop going on right now and a beta testers program where you can earn $CNDL coins. It's a new L1 blockchain designed for metaverses, including their own. Visit CandleLabs.org to claim your free coins. For the devs out there, there is also a generous developer bounty/grant program available. The first round of bounties have been paid out but there will be consecutive rounds. The next phase of testing is for their AMM swap DApp.",

There is only one other public blockchain with 0 fees besides Candle and that's IOTA, which is highly centralized and uses a coordinator. Initial Candle Chain POS rewards should launch around 800%.",
