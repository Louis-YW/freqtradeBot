  "content": "Hi,My question is about tapping, sliding and holding down non-existent buttons.Was it hard to learn how to do it properly so that your Bitbox understood what you wanted?Did this feature ever cause you any problems?For example if your Bitbox doesn't understand you.Or if it understands you wrong.Or if it does something you don't want it to do.Thank you.",

      "body": "When I tried it on a BitBox02, it was pretty intuitive, quick and even fun to use!Keep in mind this doesn't wear out such as cheap buttons do, as well. Unfortunately, this 'longevity feature' doesn't align well with the super soft plastic screen cover, which scratches quickly - but I don't want to digress into a full review of the BitBox02.",

      "body": "Thank you very much for your replies! Now as I am owner of BitBox02 I have also some little experience with subject. Here is my report: 1. Yes, I was able to learn and train how to use the non-existing buttons. 2. But it happened for a while (at the very beginning of set up) that those non-existent buttons didn't work properly themselves and it didn't depend on how good or bad I was in tapping. They sometimes didn't feel tapping and they sometimes  reacted wrong way. Then I calibrated the device according to manufacturer's troubleshooting.The calibration didn't help.I continued using device anyway, though it was very inconvenient and tapping took a lot of time to get desired result.After a while buttons started working properly.",

      "body": "Out of curiosity, did you not try to get a replacement device if it's buggy and did not work as expected even after calibration? Then I guess if it started working really well after that maybe you just need to get more accustomed to it.",
