To make it simple, I’m still holding because I’m positive that Bitcoin price will at least x2 the previous ATH because that’s what always happen.",

What is your one primary reason to keep investing in BTC even at these levels.I am doing this because I am positive with the ETF news. It is resulting in major adoption to users who were earlier reluctant to invest in bitcoins. I maybe have a different perspective, I'm not overly invested in what the price is. I have a target BTC amount I want to accumulate by a certain date. I  This is helpful when you get to that point where you think \"is it too expensive to buy now\", I just see have I met my accumulation target and if not buy what I can. If do get hung up on the price(is it expensive or is it cheap) then would recommend you follow a strict DCA, where buy at regular intervals this helps ensure never buy to much at \"expensive price\".My only word of caution with DCA, and this is something I learned the hard way, is that its very easy to get caught up in your avg BTC price. Dont start using this as indicator whether to modify your DCA too much. Its nice to look at it for sure but its actually not that important in the long run. Its preferable to have more BTC at a higher avg price vs less BTC at a lower BTC price. e.g lets just say the next ATH(not the one today) will be 140k$ and there are two holder examplesHolder#1 - Has 0.21 BTC with avg price of 22k (4.6k fiat invested). (Wont accumulate more because BTC is too expensive now and will impact their avg BTC price)Holder#2 - Has 0.31 BTC with avg price of 32k (9.9k fiat invested)(Ignores avg BTC price and continues to accumulate)Holder#1 - 0.21 BTC & BTC price @140k = 29.4k fiat value, Value Return is 29.4k - 4.6k = 24.8kHolder#2 - 0.31 BTC & BTC price @140k = 43.4k fiat value, Value Return is 43.4k - 9.9k = 33.5k",

What is your one primary reason to keep investing in BTC even at these levels.I am doing this because I am positive with the ETF news. It is resulting in major adoption to users who were earlier reluctant to invest in bitcoins. You guys should just stop the hype of the ETF of a thing, it has helped during the rumour time of last year till now, but where is it helping again in terms of implementation? Bitcoin has always been accessible by everyone, so the demand and supply of the cryptocurrency happening without the much involvement of the ETF. It is all about everybody and every means of injecting and removing money now (demand/supply and market sentiment which is strongly bullish). The ETF is never the one causing all this but the mood of Bitcoin's halving tradition that brought about the FOMO in its pre-halving season.To me, it is happening this way and early enough because people have read enough about Bitcoin and do not want to miss out, so what they could have waited for during the post-halving period is being done before the halving. The psychology of people towards the market can be so funny, and the psychology of the market toward the behaviour of people can be funnier which is what is causing what we see now. More would happen, but at this level, I can't invest directly in Bitcoin but continue to trade in on the futures market as usual. I can't possibly make much when committing my money to it in my wallet account.The ATH has been hit already and I appreciate those who had the good foresight that it would sell on hitting that level. That was what the coin did and had moved over $4,000 after reaching the level, and it dumped so fast as well. All I can say is that a lot of pending orders were at that level because we all know that it would sell a bit to retrace, before going higher again to even hit it again and break it.",

I don't think anyone would have a different reason other than the fact that investments can still produce profits because the price is around the previous all-time high but we expect it to create a new and higher all-time price, preferably near $100k or maybe above it. Now that the market has already touched the previous all-time high, we surely expect the price to cross $100k during the bull run because we have yet to have the halving event and the bull run generally starts after it.So if you ask for a reason why I or anyone is investing in Bitcoin even at such price points, the answer is simple, it's still profitable.",

I don't know exactly what made bitcoin ATH but when the ETF was approved, the price of bitcoin actually dropped sharply. I think what affects the price of bitcoin more is because of the halving moment that will soon occurWhen bitcoin has a high price, we become confused about whether to buy or not, because it is more risky when the price is so high. However, it is very likely that the price of bitcoin will continue to rise. If you are in doubt, maybe you can wait until the price corrects a little and use the DCA method.",
