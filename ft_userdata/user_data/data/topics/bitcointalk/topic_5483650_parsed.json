Losses in holding are unrealized unlike trading as traders accept their losses very early or facing trading asset liquidation. I have been trading for over four years and also holding. What I realized is that holding is better than trading. See trading as gambling although it is not gambling.",

Hence, it's not advisable if you don't know when to invest in Bitcoin to hold long term. However, since block halving is coming for me the current price is still a good price to invest in Bitcoin and hold until the end of block halving this April we might see a new ATH this coming June or July.",

Trading is like gambling, although it is not gambling, because when we lose in gambling we lose all our money, just like in trading if we lose our entire money is lost. So I would say you should hold Bitcoin for long term, it will give you a lot of returns.",

But in many places I see that I have people and some they are making a lot of money.Trading is stressful. There is a high chance that you will lose money. And when I say trading, it means all kind of trading which includes cryptocurrency, stocks or binary. So if you are okay to deal with such kind of stress go ahead with binary trading. But if you do not want such stress in your life, go for holding. This is true for stock market as well. Trading can generate a good amount of income for you but the risk is also very high. And in finance the reward is higher when the risk is high. If you do not want to deal with such kind of risk, simply hold for longer term. That should do the magic.",

You never know what is going to happen. I always doubt that the movement that happens on the binary chart isn't real. These are fake charts that move according to how the website owner wants. You won't notice those movements on the real market for obvious reasons. Binary trade's are just like you place a bet and you don't know what will happen. Sometimes, it's worse than gambling. Because you could predict the gambling market but binary does not work that way. So, you should go with the 2nd option. Holding Bitcoin is less stress as another member has pointed out already. Do DCA and wait for the bullrun.",

      "body": "Trading & Holding are both 180-degree concepts where the trading requires proper management skills such as emotion, TA, FA, and price action with some decent experience it's a full-time job, and at the same time investment/holding is a strategy of one-time effort where you only need the basic information and an overview of FA. Now the deciding ball is the user's court, trading can be highly rewarding.On my end I play in between with different coins, for Bitcoin I will always suggest the holding strategy as you know its the most safe play haha.",

But I did a lot of messing with Bitcoin.Please if you do not understand trading, DO NOT ENGAE IN IT. 99.9% of traders lose money woefully but they will never tell you this. In fact, those who are successful traders took many years to achieve that. In contrast, becoming a successful holder of assets like Bitcoin requires no prior experience. When you hold bitcoin, you do not lose your money instead it grows. When you hold bitcoin in the long term you make money. Additionally, the advantage of holding lies in the ability to weather bear markets, with the assurance of recovery during subsequent bull markets if one refrains from panicking and selling. Hey, just do two things - DCA and HODL. It is going to change your life.",

A good profit cannot be expected if the analysis is not done properly. There is a lot of risk involved. You invest bitcoins instead of trading this binary. You may know and understand about crypto currency so I say you buy bitcoin and hold it for long time you will be very safe.",

Since you sound very newbie, it's holding BTC and keep learning first. You learn how to trade first before trying out binary trading, it's not for new traders. I think that's the reason why there are fewer platforms for binary trading anymore since more people learned it is not for them.I have tried binary trading myself.

You could lose a fortune engaging in binary trade in a short period because it has some key similarities with gambling. Some persons who have experience or skills in the trade are making money from however i will not recommend it to anyone. But I will suggest to anybody to consider hodling Bitcoin because it is somehow certain that it will be profitable if held for a long time. My advice is for you to patiently buy and hold Bitcoin and discard your urge to engage in binary trade. Even if you don't have bulk money to invest in Bitcoin, you could consider using the DCA strategy. However, it is up to you to decide your best option. QuoteBut in many places I see that I have people and some they are making a lot of money.You could ask them how they are making money, maybe they can give you a hint of how you could make money. But you have to be careful of scams and Ponzi schemes.",

In fact, this is the first time I even heard of binary options.One of the first google search results that pops up when I google binary options is a blog warning me about binary trading scams. After a bit more research, I understand that binary trading is basically guessing that BTC reaches a certain price by a certain time or you lose all your money? Sounds exactly like gambling to me.Basically it is trading with derivatives but with an even riskier category of liquidation.   Hodling is 100% the better option.",

      "body": "I don't know what \"Binary\" trading is, but if you're just trying to decide between trading and long term investing, you should mostly first be doing long term investing.For my first few years in this space I would buy bitcoin then try to trade it to make more bitcoin. The guy who told me about bitcoin told me to buy on coinbase and then go to another (now shutdown) exchange and told me about altcoins and told me to trade. While I am grateful he introduced me to Bitcoin all the way back in 2013, I wish he had never mentioned trading to me hahaha. Trading with my bitcoin to make more bitcoin never worked out long term. I'd have a lot more bitcoin right now if I just bought and held.It was only these past six years that I have separated my bitcoin holdings from my trading stash. I buy bitcoin as a long term investment, and then in addition to that I have cash that I trade with, trading against USD. Goal of my trading is to make more USD. So when I do well with trading I make a bunch of cash which is great! When I do poorly in trading I don't lose any of my all-important long term bitcoin!If I could go back to 2013 I would have told myself to put a little bit of money onto an exchange to practice trading with, but with the majority of my money just buy and hold bitcoin long term and leave it alone, and never mix the two things.So, if you don't already have a sizable amount of bitcoin that you are holding long term, start accumulating bitcoin first so you can build your long term wealth. Then later you can get a decent sized trading stash going to try to make income from. Or you can set aside a little bit of money now for trading to practice trading and get more skilled in it, while using most of your investable money to simply buy bitcoin and hold it long term.",

It happens sometimes, but it's just a little that will be added to what you have invested. A bitcoin investment is also less risky if you can hold it for a long time and don't sell out of panic. For binary trading, you need to learn about it, and the risk alone is very high. If you are not careful enough, you can lose everything that you put in there, so you need to study the market the same way it can give you a fast profit and also the same way it can take it all out of you in a blink of an eye in just one wrong trade.",
