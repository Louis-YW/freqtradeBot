(2015) ‘Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C. 20th Anniversary Edition.’ Indianapolis, Indiana: Wiley. in Chapter 1…”A message is plaintext (sometimes called cleartext). The process of disguising a message in such a way as to hide its substance is encryption. An encrypted message is ciphertext. The process of turning ciphertext back into plaintext is decryption. This is all shown in Figure 1.1.(If you want to follow the ISO 7498-2 standard, use the terms “encipher” and “decipher.” It seems that some cultures find the terms “encrypt” and “decrypt” offensive, as they refer to dead bodies.)The art and science of keeping messages secure is cryptography, and it is practiced by cryptographers. Cryptanalysts are practitioners of cryptanalysis, the art and science of breaking ciphertext; that is, seeing through the disguise. The branch of mathematics encompassing both cryptography and cryptanalysis is cryptology and its practitioners are cryptologists. Modern cryptologists are generally trained in theoretical mathematics—they have to be.That’s why my mantra is “Bitcoin NOT Crypto”..BTC>",

No, we cannot do a thing about it and I have started using terms like Bitcoin and altcoins or sometimes crypto/Bitcoin. I guess now it inevitable as everyone addresses it as crypto and some of my friends use crypto as the first time even when they are referring to Bitcoin. There are certain other terms like NFT which I don't like for strange reason but we gotta live with it as it doesn't matter what we think Lol.",

Even when we talk about the issue of adoption, it sucks to even make use of the word crypto adoption,  in place of Bitcoin adoption and I doubt if there is anything as that. What's real big deal is Bitcoin and any other shit out there is just deriving her relivance from the crumbs that falls off the table of Bitcoin.",

Calling Bitcoin a crypto is not correct in many ways because there is only one Bitcoin which is abbreviated as BTC, not WBTC, BCH and others that I don't know about.If Bitcoin is referred to as crypto, it is not surprising that some people equate all types of crypto in the crypto space as the same. If one of the cryptos is invested and the person is deceived, then Bitcoin will be included in that section. Obviously that is not true because Bitcoin (BTC) is not a scam coin.",

Crypto for the uninformed, uneducated is synonymous with scams. Plenty people in my community have fallen prey to different forms of crypto scams and it is the reason why bitcoin education and awareness was met with a hostile attitude and mindset when it was introduced to them. It took a lot of effort to make them see that bitcoin is not crypto and it is not a scam.Even the government didn't help in no small way, with their outright ban on \"crypto\" transactions because for them, it facilitated lots of scams. However, the situation has improved and people know better to differentiated the two. And yes, I am with you on not liking the term \"crypto\".",

Anyway, the things are described in the figures haha and where is figure 1.1, it seems like you've copied some of the stuff it's just my blind attack, you should explain it a little bit bro.

      "body": "It's pretty interesting, OP! As an ordinary member of the forum, I am of the opinion that there is no problem with using the term crypto. Because of this forum I think every member here is well aware of the difference between crypto and Bitcoin. That is, by comparing the two, one can recognize that Bitcoin is Bitcoin and Altcoin is Altcoin. So if someone uses the word crypto here, it does not mean scam, because the people of this forum know that all crypto is not a scam scheme, but the foundation of cryptocurrency is Bitcion, so Bitcion is also included in this cryptocurrency. If a person calls all cryptocurrency a scam, his claims will definitely be implied on Bitcoin, which is also a scam. but in fact it doesn't make sense to me. So it is true that when people hear the name crypto, scams, shitcoin, or pump dump, they come to mind, but in fact it is not a cryptocurrency scam scheme, some things have been defamed by shitcoin and scam coins. And now this crypto word has become popular among people. Now it is difficult to understand these people.",

The term on its own has no negative meaning. People will always make whatever meaning in whatever way they want. There are people whose brains just ring scam when they hear \"bitcoin\". Bitcoin is not at fault here but for those who have refused to understand what it is, the same applies to crypto.
