So Nigerians should stay alert about this update so on that we can easily find out the pollin unit you will be casting your and please don't accept bribe for your vote oo.  This time we must get it rightsources QuoteFrom the feedback we received from our officials and accredited observers following the recent nationwide mock accredited using the biomodal voter registration system (BVAS) it is clear that some voters could not easily identify their pollin units,?

      "body": "don't know how possible this will help those registered voters who lost their phone number without retrieving,to know their appropriate polling unit. Is changing the polling unit necessary for those who did not relocate to a new area. From my own view all these new changes are good but it might affect citizens participation in next week Saturday's election,in the sense that the elderly ones in various community might not be able to know about this new development, will still go to their previous Polling unit to cast their votes unknowingly to them that their polling unit have been changed by INEC. This will not only affect the elderly ones but also to the ignorant ones. I see that INEC is trying their possible best to conduct a free,fair and credible election. This is not the way forward for that,instead only voters that relocated that their polling units should be changed, or did they change Buhari polling unit.",

      "body": "Sending text message to registered voters will help everyone know their various polling units. I am saying this because I actually did registered for my permanent voters card back then in campus and I casted my vote right infamous then but the last time I went there, I could not see anyone there when I inquired to know, the post office there told me that since the last election almost resulted to violence inside the school premises, the school authority advised inec to move the polling units incampus to another place as it is no more safe to retain them in the school so they had to move out of the school. I had to start locating m polling unit. I said this because I have had such experience and I commend inec for this step in updating registered voters about their eligibility to vote.",

      "body": "Some group of persons will always be affected by any new policy and this is not an exception, but the most important thing we are all glamouring is for INEC to conduct a free and fair election come February 25th, because in as much as those 240 polling units wasn't canceled only from one region, but from the 6 geopolitical zones of the country, I totally have no problem about it, and it would have been more better had it been INEC listed the names of the 240 canceled polling units so that people living in those area can be fully inform that election won't be conducted and start hoping to get notify on the newly assigned polling unit for election, rather than just making an oral/audio announcement",

      "body": "The SMS will only work to some extent; just as @Merit has said, lots of registered voters don't have access to the used line. I am a victim of that. I think the best way to make things easier for all is to make provision for a polling unit search option on the officials' website so that those who have access to the internet can use the voter number and search to know their new voting unit. They can also provide written material that will be posted on the previous polling unit stating that all those who were supposed to use it are now expected to use it, and then they state the new one with directions.  Just my opinion",
