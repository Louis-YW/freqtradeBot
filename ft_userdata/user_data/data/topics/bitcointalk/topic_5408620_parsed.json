      "body": "I thought bitcoin started dropping in October and Russia started invading Ukraine at the end of February? How have you made that conclusion?If the US stock market and bitcoin continue to correlate then what happens to both with depend on whether the US gets involved or not, if the US does (as may be likely if they think it's possible to stymy an invasion) then both might drop due to the added turmoil. If other asian countries or Taiwan are able to deter an invasion on their own (they are an island and it is their land, they may have complex plans to prevent being invaded) then we might see more positive effects on both bitcoins and stocks valuations.",

With regards to OP's inquiry I think it could drag down btc price like what happened on Russia and Ukraine were series of fuds has escalated and panic selling due to needs of funds for the war.But we all knew China (Chinese community loves bitcoin) cant totally dump their asset for the war which likely wanted by US since its their business afterall. A war could trigger a lot of movement here and no one could anticipate a factor whether its bullish or bearish. Remember covid is an international problem too but crypto market were able to do a Bull run season. Its depend on a major factor actually even its a war.",

My question is that how many others coin will affected if above said thing goes straight. If China attacks Taiwan, I think bitcoin's price will be positively impacted. China can take same measures they took with Hongkong residents and w3 have seen people converting their wealth into bitcoin to safeguard from bank account freeze. The demand for bitcoin should increase as well as the price if another war happens!",

It is true that bitcoin declined slightly prior to the Russo-Ukrainian conflict, but this decline continued and fell sharply as the Russo-Ukrainian conflict escalated, and traders have identified that a new source of dispute between China and Taiwan will affect the bitcoin price.and currently the bitcoin price is very difficult to rise even if it goes up a little it won't take long to go back down, and I think the China-Taiwan conflict will make it even more difficult for bitcoin to go up. And Crypto, like most financial markets, is very vulnerable to geopolitical tensions and I don't care about Shiba.",

Let's say that the people of Taiwan have a lot of btc in their hands and they can bring down the price of it due to selling. But why would they do it?

If China attack Taiwan, a lot of new money will flood cryptocurrency market, as people would try to save their money from being frozen. Which means Bitcoin price grows up, because holders will try to sell Bitcoin as expensive as possible imo.",

Should the Chinese attack Taiwan, the latter's allies would surely be backing them up, though not to the point of directly intervening what's going on in the said country as that would surely result to a global war. The Chinese are just showing their muscles against 'their territory' because they know Taiwan can't fight back, and that the US and its allies will not do anything rash even.",

With what i know and how i got to understand the scenario of the ongoing war in Russia and Ukraine with its consequences i think it has much effect on the Fiat economy causing inflation but i don't think it has anything to do with bitcoin price determination, bitcoin works in volatility with demand and supply while the ongoing war with respect to btc should only reflect on the affected countries which is Russia and Ukraine.",

My question is that how many others coin will affected if above said thing goes straight. If it's anything like the initial shock we faced at the start of Covid, then it's quite possible that there will be a massive sell off as the world enters some rather dangerous and unstable times. China is already facing various economic problems right now, so a distracting war would be rather useful in galvanizing support for the CCP but there is a strong possibility it would spiral out of control into unknown territory. Beyond the effects on Bitcoin, it would likely be devastating for the world because Taiwan produces a heck of a lot of microchips which go into all sorts of electronics (including vast mining rigs) and any damage to those factories could set the world back decades in development.",

And global economy also affects Bitcoin, especially in the short term. From the recent history we can see that Bitcoin is not a hedge against inflation or economic instability. It tends to follow the stock market and economy in general. So a war in Taiwan would likely crash Bitcoin's price and it would take a lot of time to recover.",

The timing though of the attack by Russia against Ukraine is something to think about, we are in a bear market already.And for hypothetical question, in any case China attacks Taiwan in a full blown bull run will it have a drastic impact on the price?",

It's really not that easy to deal with, because with the big global issues like China and Taiwan the economy will be affected by different complexities, and with the crypto market. I think it won't be too different and it will also be impacted. Might as well suffer a sharp drop and vice versa, I think about how volatile the price of gold has been as global economic upheavals played out.",

If there is a war in China-Taiwan, then I'm more concerned with the bitcoin price which will drop for a while but then there will be more mass adoption from Chinese and Taiwanese citizens. because saving money in the BANK when a country is at war is the most risky thing and I think it's stupid. because the only way to secure our assets in times of war is to exchange them for bitcoins and store bitcoins safely. so that transactions with bitcoin even make it easier for us to move assets abroad in large quantities. without worrying about being hit by a limit like in a BANK.",
