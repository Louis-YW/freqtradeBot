This is very sad to see and I reckon some people should not make fun of this similar to those imbeciles who are replying in this thread in Twitter. PSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how.

I think it's better to rely on a good and old notebook than on any digital devices...I hope he can track the hacker's addresses and reach authorities faster as possible to get them before the coins are mixed and disappear forever. As I see, he has already tagged FBI on Twitter. Hopefully he will recover his coins!",

I'm looking forward to hearing the two cents of experts here. There will be many lessons to learn from this unfortunate incident involving no less than a Bitcoin developer himself who is fully aware of all the necessary security measures.",

(My time) But no posts for months.And unless he was doing something odd, his PGP keys have nothing to do with his BTC.I'm also guessing that he could at least pick up the phone and call someone to make a post / comment here if he could not log in for some reason.-Dave",

Hackers having technology at their disposal to break the security of blockchain. The consequences of this would be much more impactful and harmful than a single person losing 200 BTC. It could be the end of bitcoin in this case, as no one would be safe anymore. It is said by 2030 quantum computers would be able to break encryption protocols, including of bitcoin.",

Getting what he had in his hot wallet on his workstation is probably a bonus. As he posted his implementation of Knots may have been compromised. That could have been a much bigger target. -Dave",
