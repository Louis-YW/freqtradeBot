I see it a positive experiment. Honestly speaking signature campaigns work best to create brand value than conversion. You will see big brands always advertise and stay in front of you even it seems everyone knows about them. It's the brand awareness that matters always. For example, if today Chipmixer stops their signature campaign - after a few months you will see people are starting to forget about them. How many of us think of Bitsler when we want to play dice? We always look for the name that is in front of us right at the time we are thinking of the product.",

A lot of webmasters are actually going to take this opportunity to advertise their own referral link to a network. But this is also going to make them spend with the possibility of loss. Finding and making gamblers going to balckjack.fun would be challenging.Will blackjack.fun allow participants to go to other casino forums with thier links? This could be a good opportunity for those with accounts on casino forums",

After all, the risk of earning nothing at all is very high. No income without clicks. And even if you get a referral, they have to wager $300 and that's certainly not a little. After all, there's no minimum number of posts you have to make, and that's good. But I'm convinced that if you paid weekly like other campaigns, you would have better participants. At least that's my opinion on it.",

So unless the user has special (both advertising and gambling) skills, only few lucky ones will get anything, I'm afraid.And Royse does have a point: there is brand and there is conversion. I feel though that this model unfairly favors too much the casino, by paying only for the conversion.",

I think they were in a hurry to apply thinking that it was like the rest, and also with pay per referral, without realising that there was no pay per post.Indirectly, this scenario will benefit the casino without having to pay for every post from its participants. The problem is that it would be difficult to expect someone to spend $300 as a valid referral only for you to get paid $50, and I am worried people are much more likely to sign up without an affiliation than sign up through your affiliate link if they don't want you to earn $40 out of their losing $100.I'm afraid a campaign like this won't be successful in the end to get a lot of participants, but on the part of the casino it's clear they will benefit because whoever will promote the brand in the signature doesn't need paid, as long as it doesn't fulfill the following conditions: QuoteYou will be credited $50 in BTC per valid referral who will register under your affiliate link, make a deposit, and wager $300",

This just takes it and instead of just putting http://youwillnever.win/?ref=Dave someplace it makes it a nice pretty signature. There are no posting requirements or anything else so I don't see this as a real signature campaign just a nice looking referral campaign that happens to be in your signature.Not that big a deal IMO. With that.However, I can see this being open to a bit of abuse unless sujonali1819 keeps a tight control over posts. No min characters no max posts. Can spiral out of control quickly.

Why? they already made a name on this forum, their previous campaigns requires website registration too, well, a lot did applied and created an account (because of higher pay rate). So as a participant/affiliate, the chance for someone to register using your signature/affiliate link is very low. Besides invites still needs to deposit xxx amount before an affiliate get their reward. Although it's really unfair to the participants, it's not that bad to do such campaign, but don't expect more people will join.",

People really have a problem with reading and understanding some basic pieces of information.This campaign won't benefit the majority of its participants, but to the casino, it means free advertising. Some of those who do get accepted might try to abuse the referrals and refer themselves. After that, there will be KYC requests with the potential of scam accusations popping up where those who cheated didn't succeed in tricking the casino.The casino and the campaign manager aren't lying. Everything is clear. Those who join the campaign expecting regular weekly payments can only blame themselves.

Can't be faked, and can't be taken advantage of unless you play with stolen cards, which is really not worth it as the chargeback will show up before you get paid.I don't get the Quote40% lifetime revenue from your referrals means if your referral lost 100 USD you will get 40 USDThis is tricky, it's a commission on how much a referral has lost and not the entire deposited sum, then if your referral hits a jackpot and goes on a positive balance with a few hundred thosuands you're done for as the other must lose the same thousands just to ket your balance positive.Anyhow, not new:[Primedice] Affiliate Program: Passively earn 10% of house edgehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=745779.0",
