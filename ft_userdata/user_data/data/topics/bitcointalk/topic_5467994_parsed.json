The hacker defiantly got the data of all these users.With how mixin safe operates, it is possible to mistake them for a multisig wallet, but they are not. When making a tx on mixin safe you'll need both the owner key and member's key, and they can also help you recover your wallet, but mixin safe is a custodial service with a centralized database and you lose control of your funds once you deposit it in a safe.Quote from: BABY SHOES on September 25, 2023, 06:21:16 AMSome blame it on the fact that they rely on a cloud that is vulnerable to hacking, so all their customers' assets are stored as a third party?Blame it on the fact that they have a single point of failure, and it has been exploited here, take note that mixin safe is a custodial service, so they control customers' funds.",

It is always possible that centralized wallet get hacked and if it happens, the project's team will have to take all legal actions to repay their users if they can. However, the point is in kind of a \"Fake it till you make it\" attitude towards their marketing where the team makes a headline claiming their project is safe as fuck highlighting the highest level of security and getting hacked.In case with Binance, funds are safu not because they say it, but because it is not possible to steal all funds (they are not so centralized) and all losses would be repaid by Binance simply because they are fucking rich and can afford doing so.

There is no accent on hacking impossibility. Binance is a totally centralized exchange which can and has even been hacked previously, you are right that Binance hasn't had any 'major hacking' incident on its platform, but take note that no centralized exchange is too big to fail, not even Binance, and if a severe bank run happens in Binance for whatever reason or if Binance suffers a major hack, they would find it very hard to refund their customers.You can only be sure of the security of your funds if you have adequately secured it in your self custody wallet, you should not trust a centralized exchange that operates through fractional reserve scam. If you store your funds in Binance, you better move it into your own self custody wallet.",

If I were to predict that any platform would be hacked any moment I would never includ mixin. Mixin came to the forum with the promise of security our bitcoin and possibly make it hereditary.  They also said that their system does not store people's private keys, rather they hold one of the keys, the customer hold one while the network friends hold one and in order to authorize transaction, atleast two of the three keys holders will have to approve. This means that for there to be a successful hack, the hackers got access to the mixin data base and also the customers data base which is bad.I know mixin has been in existence for so many years, but they recently found their way to the crypto industry and are willing to dominate. But this hack will be a major set back to their reputation while many will lose confidence even after being refunded. I wish this never happened to them.",
