  "content": "I've accumulated a significant amount of $OCI over the last two years, but now I'm facing financial challenges (leverage is not in my favor.  )I want to sell it, but if I were to put it on the market, the price would likely plummet. Therefore, I'm seeking an OTC deal.The price is negotiable, and I'm open to various payment methods, including BTC, USDT, XRD, ETH, and XMR.telegram: jhonnyyfSOLD",

      "body": "Please give us more details about the token/coin you are talking about?Is it Ociswap?I have tried searching on CoinMarketCap and coingecko and I don't even see any market it's trading on. It looks like you are looking to sell off tokens that are not even being traded? How does this work for the buyer if he can't sell them off anywhere?",

      "body": "It's not traded on any CEXs yet because the L1 it's built on, $XRD (https://www.radixdlt.com/), is set to launch in a few days.However, you can trade $OCI on their own exchange at https://ociswap.com/ociswap/ for $XRD and then exchange it for your preferred cryptocurrency.The TVL $3.1 million, MCAP of $3 million. Ociswap holds the top position as the number one DEX on Radix.Since I initially posted this, the price has risen by 12% to $0.155. Nevertheless, as I'm actively seeking an OTC deal, I'm still willing to sell it at a lower price.",
