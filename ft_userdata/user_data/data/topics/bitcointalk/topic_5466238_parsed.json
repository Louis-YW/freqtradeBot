  "content": "As some of you may know, part of the trials that are held in relation to Trumps alleged crimes are public, which will provide some publicity to the guy but will also be hopefully revealing of the facts.Trump is indicted under the RICO law in Georgia and this one will be publicly available, which allow to judge people who take part in a \"conspiracy\" or plan to carry out a criminal activity. This means that there are 19 defendants. For now, there are quite a few that are trying to jump the ship and have their cases severed (separated from the main one), however the RICO plays against them as if you commit one act on the \"plan\" you are in for all - although degrees of punishment may vary.Here is the first issue: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZblUe4cLvQIt is a very long discussion between two parties about severing one of the cases, so do not expect thrill and chill at this point.",

      "body": "QuoteFormer President Trump said Wednesday that he would be willing to testify in his own defense at a potential trial.Conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump if he would testify if he has to go to trial, as the former president faces criminal charges in New York, Florida, Georgia and Washington, D.C.“Oh, yes, absolutely,” Trump responded.“You’ll take the stand?” Hewitt asked.“That, I would do. That, I look forward to, because that’s just like Russia, Russia, Russia,” Trump said, referring to allegations that his campaign coordinated with the Russians during the 2016 campaign, which a special counsel investigation did not find evidence of.https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4189912-trump-says-he-would-testify-at-his-own-trial/If only this were the one time he wasn't full of shit...although he accidentally told the truth when he said it will be just like the Russia investigation, where he said he would go under oath and talk to Mueller and congress and then refused.Whether he does or not, this will be the trial of the century considering his other big cases are in federal court which means no cameras.  And there are so many insane possibilities with the timing.  Right now it's scheduled to begin right before super tuesday.  The trial could be ongoing on election day.  We could have a hung jury before the election.He could be convicted after winning the election and be awaiting sentencing when sworn in.We could have a hung jury right before the election, which would be a nightmare for democrats. (it only takes one juror to hang a jury)He could lose the election and shortly after be found guilty.And there are 3 other criminal trials going on at the same time as this one.Insanity.",

Yes, it is quite wild and disturbing to have the political speech of one of the biggest parties in USA switched to supporting actions which (not long ago) would have been the end of the political career to anyone, the sexual assault lawsuit/defamation would have been enough, but not nowadays. Since I am just some normal guy living abroad, there is nothing I can do but sit back and try to enjoy the unprecedented happenings coming one after other. In the end, it is whether the people of the USA still want to have a Republic or they will allow even bigger ans darkest unprecedented things to happen. Good luck.",

All 19 defendants are going to be trialled together which means that all evidence will be evidence against all of them, thus making some of them to turn against Trump to avoid serving long times for very little participation.",

The polls and the mid term elections showed that there is a chance Trump could be defeated in the next presidential election and he will certainly be his last chance to continue to be politically relevant. If he does not, I can also guarantee that he will be indeed sacrificed by the party, for the sake of power. Though, I would not completely trust polls, the last polls suggested that the red wave was going to happen and did not.",

      "body": "History does not say that people of such a level have been convicted and punished in almost 300 years of America. We know that many steps have been taken before and some have gone to the last stage of the trial Cases are dropped or closed for cause, history says so, so we don't expect to see that in Trump's case, because history happens in phases, and this will happen this time.In American politics, some people from the opposition party have been harassed before without any reason. These are a part of the election and a strategy to get publicity May is for the party or from the opposition party I think Trump will get the party's nomination regardless of the conviction or the conspiracy.After all this if Trump wins the election and if he can't be defeated then he will get a lot from the party and if he fails here then he has to make a big sacrifice for the party.Accused are currently under protection in various ways, but all will be convicted if proven and one thing is that if proven there is no appeal.I don't think it will end up being a public trial either wayI think in 2016 it's a ploy to get a nomination that America has become a culture of politics, maybe this time it's nothing more than a ploy to get a nomination in the same way, and history doesn't say that. There has been no trial in America, so it assumes that it is nothing more than a strategy, so I think.Whatever the law, even if the case is ultimately convicted, the criminal justice system will be seen as too logos and too few trials will be done, which will appear to be artificially created.",

People all over the place do the same. Antifa and BLM riot in criminal ways because they don't really believe they are acting criminally. Rather, they believe that the system and average people have acted criminally against them, and all they are doing is bringing about justice.The point is that the people who are indicting Trump are doing similar or worse crimes than what they are indicting Trump for. So, what does it mean? It means that there is an agenda against Trump, and one that is criminal in its whole operation. If it weren't criminal, they would have indicted themselves and Biden for all the worse-than-Trump things that they and Biden are doing.",

Also, he even mentioned he would likely take the witness stand and declare under oath, which of course his lawyers wont allow to happen, became he is likely to commit perjury. Let us just admit that Trump is a better businessman and he is a president, The United States deserved to have a person better than both Trump and Biden in the White House.",

Though, finding him guilty would require prosecutors to convince a jury that he was aware of the implications of his actions when comes to American Democracy.In an imaginary case where Trump is found not guilty of being a traitor or insurgent, then the 14th amendment should be crossed out.",

We know that many steps have been taken before and some have gone to the last stage of the trial Cases are dropped or closed for cause, history says so, so we don't expect to see that in Trump's case, because history happens in phases, and this will happen this time.No sitting, future or former president has ever been charged with a single crime in the history of the country except for Donald Trump, who has been charged with 91 felonies across four State and Federal jurisdictions.  Does this mean that Trump is worse than any of the other politicians.Yes.  100%.Obviously   , I mean... not even Nixon or Reagan blaming Oliver North. All of them gifts of the Republicans to the world, but not half of Trumps level.Now, an update, some of the defendants including Trump's Attorney of choice will exercise their right to an speedy trial. They feel it is better to have their case quickly as opposed to Trump and others that would rather have it slow and painful.This probably gives and advantage to the ones going after as part of the evidence will be known.https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/trump-attorney-fake-electors-subpoena-00053765The background for this is that an Attorney is a public officer and cannot engage in political support or campaign activities publicly - the trial will likely show he did.QuoteTrump-tied attorney who helped craft fake electors strategy resists grand jury subpoenaKenneth Chesebro said he had been instructed to maintain privileges with the Trump campaign, which employed him. It’s not entirely clear if that’s true.Edited: At NY, on the Tax fraud case against Trump, a judge has ruled that Trump committed several frauds, misrepresenting the value of assets by more than 5 even 10 fold to get credits against them. He is to loose his \"business licence\" and pay a considerable fine.Now, is anyone not familiar with Trump \"inflationism\" of all and everything?",
