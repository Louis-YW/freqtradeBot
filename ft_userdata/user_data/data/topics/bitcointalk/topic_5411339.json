They don't need to, because their reputation will speak for them. The ones who make claims of being \"the most reliable\", are the ones I don't trust.Mixers are in the trust business. Mixers should never lie. I know for a fact that a site on a one month old domain can't be the most reliable Bitcoin mixer out there. That means this claim is a lie, and if a mixer lies about one thing, they can lie about other things.Quote from: mix-bitcoin.net on August 26, 2022, 11:35:01 PMor do not work reliably.Funny, your Get started doesn't work QuoteAnd yes, we had other mixing services on other chains before that looked the same.Which ones?

I believe OP indeed had an Ethereum mixer site before. The domain was registered in 2017, and posted on Bitcointalk in 2018. Based on the few posts in the topic on Bitcointalk, I can't really say how reliable the service was.",

Do you provide coins for test?Based on the previous comments, it seems that you cannot try the mixer without using your own money. It was Direwolf who pointed out some privacy issues before the OP posted the latest update that Mixer is finally available on Tor Mirror.The best thing that the latest updates suggest is that during the month of January, the mixer can be tried without fees, but this will not be possible, of course, given the fees on the Ethereum network. I am surprised that these updates are so late since late August.I do not advise anyone to send large amounts of money to this mixer, and it can be tried using small amounts only as a matter of verification.",
