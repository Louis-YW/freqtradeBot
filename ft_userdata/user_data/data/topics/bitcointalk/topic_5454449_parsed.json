That's a very large number. In the mind I only hand a few such as Binance, Coinbase, Kucoin, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitfinex and some few others but 632 was unexpected. I wonder how many of them are legit?If bkex disabled withdrawal and kept the deposit enabled also telling they were involved in money laundering then it's a huge red flag.https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000562051The above link is a good start to report the exchange.",

If they were legit, they could have closed the exchange but allowed the users to withdraw of the funds. They can't even give a valid reason to close their exchange.There are too many exchanges that exist and we should be careful in selecting any exchange to deposit our funds. Just stick to the top 4 or 5 exchanges and even on those top exchanges never put your extra funds other than the ones we use for trading.",

      "body": "Reminds me of the hotbit case where some key people were investigated which apparently led to freezing of funds. Regardless of whether this case is true or not/how much is the truth, similar scheme is likely to be used by other CEx as an excuse to withhold user funds. Worst bit is information will probably only come from the exchange itself hence I can see why people would be on the fence. On another note, Coingeko has also issued a warning: https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/bkex",

The last thing they posted on Twitter were the winners of some kind of giveaway https://twitter.com/BKEXGlobal/status/1663445964747595776?s=20People should be careful here, it seems that a fake BKEX support account has appeared, where they offer a withdrawal solution.example:QuoteHello user, our customers is what matters to us the most, We have no rights on you assetsAll we can do is to help transfer it to your active DeFiwallet, definitely not a CeFi again.

The list seems to be long and won't end anytime soon.It's really shameful that they stop withdrawals for all users without exception while the deposit remains open!!! This is brazen scam.Is it possible that all users are involved in money laundering? So the police should stop the exchange once and for all, seize BKEX and then the police should return the money to users who are not involved in money laundering.",

It seems rather unlikely a priori that all users of an exchange would be involved in this, but as they say it seems to be the case. I guess it's bad wording if it's not a scam.Recently, the platform users' funds were involved in 'money laundering' and BKEX is currently cooperating with the police to collect evidence, for which we will suspend withdrawals to cooperate with the work.Quote from: yhiaali3 on May 31, 2023, 03:12:55 AMReally bad news, another famous exchange joins the list of scam exchanges!!! The list seems to be long and won't end anytime soon.Either way, this is bad news. If it's a scam, because of the damage to those affected and adding another to the list of scam exchanges, while if it's real money laudering and more continue to be added to the list over time, I think we will eventually have regulations banning mixers and being very strict with exchanges.",
