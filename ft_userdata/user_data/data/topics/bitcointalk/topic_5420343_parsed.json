      "body": "Don't you wanna add alameda research as a new VC that will be doing the same like 3AC? this venture capital was under FTX and since FTX may probably bankrupt very soon and it would be having the same fate as 3AC but a bit surprised to see that 3AC co founder was tweeting yesterday. that makes so many people feel curious about him. At least bitcoin has not yet dumped to the zero value. Im an OG now caused by i have survived even more than what you have listed above. Â MTgox, Liquid, Cryptopia and so many disasters happened with cryptocurrency in the past. It's just the matter of time until crypto will be waking up again and move on. Just let SBF to deal with the USD regulators about the collapse of FTX. That's pretty sad to see that all of SBF's effort to the republicans and democrats meant nothing. Somehow, SBF must responsible with the accident that happened with his company. He might be jailed.",
