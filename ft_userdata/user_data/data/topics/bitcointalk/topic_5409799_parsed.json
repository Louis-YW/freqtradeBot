Right now it doesn't really matter because in exactly 1 month the merge is happening with Ethereum. Which means no more mining. You will need to switch to other coins which have a very small miner reward compared to ETH.Most likely the profits will tank severely and many will quit mining altogether due to this. Before upgrading your gear you should wait a month or two and see how things turn out. However it might be the end of GPU mining as we know it.",

      "body": "Yes but what is scary is that many new miners don’t know what will happen. They don’t know that the daily supply of a coin is capped. So if more people mine it, it needs to be split eventually according to hashrate.Right now many coins which are GPU mineable are still profitable however that will quickly change right after the merge. We will see tons of people liquidating GPUs that nobody will want to buy pretty much, unless they are gamers.",

The single RTX 3070 Ti in the rigs make the power consumption higher doing 81MH with Bminer, what do you think. My rigs 5x1070 or 5x488 consume about 800 watts from the wall and give a hashrate of about 140 megahash. This is beneficial if you have cheap electricity. And rigs with 1080 video cards consume even more. For about 7 days, mining farms pay for electricity if they sell coins, and the rest of the time is a profit.",

Anyways, if you still have rig full of GTX 1070 then your electricity must be very cheap, I cant afford to run those cards even in a bear market unless I get the cards at a very cheap price. GTX 1070 in today's world of mining isn't good enough.",
