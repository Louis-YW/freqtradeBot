  "content": "This is my first post but this is not my first visit to this bitcoin forum. I was given the address to this bitcoin forum by a friend and I registered after covid-19 in my country because the effect was still keeping us indoors. I was successfully registered after I proved that I wasn't a robot by solving captcha. But I was only allowed to read and not to post.I was told that I have 186 units of evil that I have to atone. I was asked to pay very small amount of bitcoin but I refused to pay, not because I can't pay but due to the elementry knowledge I got from jury.  If I pay for an evil I did not commit, it means I have agreed that I committed the evil or I am an accomplice. I abandoned the account but could still read things from here especially when the bitcoin is moving upward trends.During this month bitcoin uptrend movement, I logged into my account and this time I saw an alternative to get into the forum without paying the evil fee. I emailed one of the protocolmail guys and I was whitelisted. *If I could actually be whitelisted for free, why make me wait for months or why make here difficult for people to access?*I was sent this message  \"You have been manually whitelisted by a moderator. If you couldn't before, you can now post normally. Various limits have also been reduced (but not eliminated).\"It is said that various limits have been reduce but not eliminated. Please is there a chance that I can be blacklisted again and made to face another evil?Why was the evil not forgive even after abandoning my account months?My last question is what other limits will I face again in this bitcoin forum?",

Please is there a chance that I can be blacklisted again and made to face another evil?No, you can only be banned if you break forum rules. Forget about the evil IP problem, it was never your fault to begin with, it was because of the IP with which you registered with, some users who share the same IP or are neighbors to it have been banned in the past, so that is why your IP was marked as evil and you have to pay a small fee to post, or get whitelisted.Quote from: Zoomic on March 21, 2023, 03:11:40 PMMy last question is what other limits will I face again in this bitcoin forum?Just limits on posting and in sending PM's, but they clear out as your activities increase.

You also cannot post image as long as you are still a newbie, the time limit between posts, the time limit between reports post to mod, and PM limit. But good, being whitelisted means you've relieved some of the restrictions but not all of them.Also you are in luck because one of our global mods answered your question.OP now start your fun journey, forget the things that were less fun before because I hope there are many valuable lessons that you have learned during your reading even if you don't post.",

You said \"evil\" fee is to avoid people abusing some proxies. But why is the name \"evil\" used. It should have been an euphemism or to use a word synonymous to evil. I mean the \"evil\" on its own looks damaging and scary. Imagine coming to a forum and is immediately faced with an evil.- _BlackStar, you said that as I am whitelisted I have been waved some restrictions but there are other restrictions. But since I can be able to make posts and interact with people I think I am OK and I may not be affected by the other unknown restrictions for now.

The \"evil\" message has reduced the creation of spam accounts in the forum; spammers wouldn't like to spend money per every account they make. In my view, multiple spammers must have left the forum if they see the requirement to make a post. Other than relaying an email to the admins for manual verification, in the past the fee wasn't that much, the recent amount got affected by the  market surge. Because at some point, when the price of bitcoin was lesser, new members would gladly pay the money; bitcoin at 4k, many visitors would pay the fund compared to today that the price has changed upto 20k and above, when calculated it gets bigger. I also see the money as a means of supporting the forum. The important aspect is that you can now contribute to the forum. Not every member researched for an alternative; to see the whitelist thread. it'll be easier this time, as you've been reading through the contents for better understanding of the forum.",

Just keep in mind those rules and you're good to go. Also don't forget check the other threads recommended on how to earn merits so you'll rank up.This is why I don't really trust proxies when it comes to registering personal accounts coz usually those who sell share there IPs(specially those you don't know personally) has something on their mind other than sharing the IP. There is also a huge risk that you'd get affected if something will happen to them for example IP ban so best be careful.",
