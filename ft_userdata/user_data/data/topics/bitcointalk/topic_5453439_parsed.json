This NFT contains all the necessary information about your army, including the number of soldiers, tanks, drones, and their localization on the map.Army ManagementManage your army by buying soldiers, tanks, and drones. You can also move your army on the map. Keep in mind that each action, whether it's buying or moving, requires a fee.Combat MechanicsEngage in combat by attacking another army located in the same spot as yours. The winner of the combat is determined based on the power of the armies involved. The power of an army is calculated using the following formula:Power = soldiers + tanks * 10 + drones * 50Life PointsYour army's life points are essential for playing the game. After each combat, the winner gains 10 life points, while the loser loses 10 life points. As a starting point, your first minting grants you 100 life points. You can only play and attack other armies if you have more than 10 life points.Localization ChangesAfter a combat, the localization of the losing army changes or \"runs\" to a different spot on the map. The new localization is obtained by adding 200 to both the longitude and latitude coordinates of the loser's army.Community RewardsWinners of battles are eligible for community rewards.
