      "body": "I don't know if i completely understood you, but if you meant your pending transaction got confirmed, then it could be because the mempool has cooled off, and your fee rate is now worth it for miners to comfirm it and add it to a block, but if you mean your funds dropped back into your wallet, then it means it was rejected, there is a default time of two weeks in which unconfirmed transactions will be rejected and the coin will be dropped back into the senders wallet. It had nothing to do with you updating or refreshing your wallet file, except your wallet file hasn't synced with the blockchain since you made the transaction, and that's why you had not seen that it was already confirmed.",

      "body": "Your transaction in Pending by a low transaction fee will be either confirmed after a while of waiting or will be dropped of mempools after a while.Depends on mempool setting of mining pools, it can be dropped after anytime but the most common time is 72 hours or 3 dyas but it is customizable and some mempools with big memory capacity can set it to 2016 blocks or 14 days.QuoteWhen you send a transactions with too low fees, it stays in the mempool of most full nodes (1) until it either expires…Surprise, even the word “expires” needs an explanation.Since Bitcoin Core 0.12 there is an expiration time of 72 hours. This is what I meant by, when I said “your coins reappear in your wallet after 3 days“.But this is not the whole story. This expiration time can vary between node implementation, or even completely missing. In fact, even in Core you can set the -mempoolexpiry setting.But, and it’s still not all: anyone can rebroadcast that transaction, and so bypass this expiration.I wonder if an attack would work when you setup a node and keep rebroadcasting all low-fee transactions until the end of times.In the bigger context, it is unlikely your transaction won’t expire after 72 hours, so you don’t have to deal with it, but it’s something nice to keep in mind.https://learn.bybit.com/blockchain/bitcoin-mempool-what-happens-to-the-unconfirmed-transactions/https://hackernoon.com/holy-cow-i-sent-a-bitcoin-transaction-with-too-low-fees-are-my-coins-lost-forever-7a865e2e45ba",

This is my surprise   Who else has got this experience?stuck for 2 weeks? if i may know, how many sats do you use, yesterday i did a transaction with 50 sats/vb and the results were pretty good, it didn't take up to 1 hour to be confirmed right away, here's the proof.for subsequent transactions, it's a good idea to increase your sat/vb to just above 50+, but still don't expect your transaction to be processed quickly, just be patient.",

But even though most of these wallets set the transaction fee to high priority or at least medium which is enough to get it confirmed.

I did a transaction today with 16sat/vbyte and it got confirmed although it took almost 10 hours. Most of these low fees are experienced in the night. So if OP transactions has been in the mempool for over two weeks now then the transaction might have be way lower than 10sat/vbyte",
