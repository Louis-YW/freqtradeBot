  "content": "I have an important question about importing wallets from either trust wallets to blue wallets or trust wallets to Electrum.Reading through posts about the best Bitcoin wallet to use here in this forum, I happened to understand that TrustWallet is not in any way recommended as it is not open source, so now I decided to use my old wallet created using the TrustWallet multiwallet option, which accepts both bitcoin and other altcoins (that apart). I used the generated phrase to import it into my blue wallet and that of electrum on my mobile device. Upon doing this, the blue wallet gave me a new bitcoin address, which I can start using for receiving new incoming transactions. My old balance on my old wallet is still visible with the blue wallet, but when I click on the receive option, I see a total different address, and on the address icon inside the blue wallet, I notice that I still have about 20 unused addresses, and my imported address has been marked as used.Here comes the question:1. If I happen to use any of the generated addresses from BlueWallet that are attached to my phrase, can I spend them using my trust wallet? Since I can still spend anything from my old address using a blue wallet or even my electrum, trust wallet allows me to do the same thing, as I can't fine any of such options on trust wallet.2. Among the new addresses that were generated, if I happen to receive new coins into them and I want to spend just the coin I received with the new address, leaving the old one that came with it when I imported the address, will it be possible for me to specify which address I want to be debited from? And if yes, will my transactions also be linked to my old bitcoin address, which I have been using in the past? These are just questions running through my head out of curiosity.",

You will have to try that with a small amount and see for yourself.2.

Since I can still spend anything from my old address using a blue wallet or even my electrum, trust wallet allows me to do the same thing, as I can't fine any of such options on trust wallet.Yes they will still be visible to your wallet on trust wallet because the bitcoins are actually associated to that key or seed phrase. So any thing going out from that key will be visible in trustwallet. Quote2. Among the new addresses that were generated, if I happen to receive new coins into them and I want to spend just the coin I received with the new address, leaving the old one that came with it when I imported the address, will it be possible for me to specify which address I want to be debited from? And if yes, will my transactions also be linked to my old bitcoin address, which I have been using in the past? These are just questions running through my head out of curiosity.Yes you do this by using coin control to freeze the other address but make sure the amount to spend is will be covered by that address including the transaction fees. The transaction will not be related to old address because only the new address will be visible on the public blockchain and that’s why it is advised to use different addresses to receive bitcoin for every transaction, most especially the transaction you don’t trust is coming from a good place or exchanges. My advice is the issue why trustwallet is not advice on the forum is because it is closed source and as such importing the seed or key into a BlueWallet hasn’t eliminated that risk associated to closed source wallets. So what you should do is to transfer your bitcoin from this trustwallet wallet generated keys to another wallet you generate from either BlueWallet or electrum wallet. This way you will have eliminated the risk.",

It means that if you fund another address belonging to the same seed phrase, you will not be able to spend it on Trustwallet.Quote from: Orpichukwu on September 29, 2023, 01:29:39 PM2.

And if yes, will my transactions also be linked to my old bitcoin address, which I have been using in the past?All you have to do is to use coin control. Wallets like Electrum, Bluewallet and Sparrow have coin control. On Bluewallet. Click on send -> the three dots (...) at the upper right corner -> select coin control and you will see your UTXOs and manually select the ones that you want to spend from.On Electrum. Click on view and check ✔️ coins to enable coin control. Click on the coins on the GUI and you will see the UTXOs which you can decide to freeze or spend. You can also decide to freeze the addresses of your choice. If it is mobile Electrum, click on your wallet name -> addresses. Click on the address that you want to freeze and you will see freeze address below, click on it to freeze the address.Quote from: Zaguru12 on September 29, 2023, 01:40:57 PMFirstly those address were generated because BlueWallet is an HD wallet and HD wallets always have 20 extra free addresses to use for a new transactions.HD wallets will generate many addresses. More than millions of addresses which no one can finish using in real life.As Zaguru12 advised, create new seed phrase on an open source wallet and transfer all your coins from Trustwallet into that new created wallet on an open source wallet, like Electrum.",

      "body": "I just read through all of the responses, and I must say my question and my curiosity have been cleared. I have also tried out the customs spending option, which also worked perfectly. I never knew there was such an easy option to use without the technical knowledge required to set it up. When I tried to set up the coin control at first, there was no option available. Maybe this was as a result of me emptying the wallet into a new one; I just used the blue wallet. To practicalize and try everything here, I went back to the old imported wallet, funded one of the addresses and also that of my old address using a trust wallet, waited for it to get confirmed, and sent from two different addresses to the two designated addresses too, one from the exchange account and the other from my other wallet. They both arrived, and I can see and trace the transaction using my blue wallet. The transaction was not visible from the trust wallet side, and the balance did not also appear, as already explained here on this thread by Charles-Tim and many others. I have also sent out a few BTC from one of the newly funded addresses. After freezing my old one to see how the transaction went, it came to my new address, which I also created specifically for this; there was just one recipient recorded and one sender recorded, with no trace of my old wallet associated with it.  Quote from: bitmover on September 29, 2023, 04:57:46 PMAs you decided to move to another wallet because you feel trust wallet is not safe, you shouldn't evert use addresses generated from them again.Just create a brand new wallet using electrum (or blue wallet for altcoins) , generate a new seed phrase and TRANSFER all your funds from trust wallet to your new wallets.If you keep the same seed , you will still be in the same situation,  as the seed was generated in an unsecure environment  (closed source)Oh yeah, I have done that already. I created an entire new wallet, which has nothing to do with my trust wallet, and I also don't have a plan on importing the newly created wallet into my trust wallet either, as I don't know how secure that is or what exposure I might be exposing my new wallet to.Quote from: Findingnemo on September 29, 2023, 03:12:22 PM Unstoppable Wallet Which is open source multi-crypto available on both Android and IOS.URL: https://unstoppable.money/Github: https://github.com/horizontalsystemsAlso, their supported coins and tokens can be found here: https://www.cryptowisser.com/wallet/unstoppable-wallet/coins?page=1Note: Unstoppable wallet doesn't provide coin control and sign-a-message features, so it is only suitable for the rest of your altcoins.Never also taught about this, but thanks for bringing it up; we have to try that out too. My previous trust wallet was multi, but I don't have any altcoin balance on it that I can remember. I use Metamask for altcoins, but I will have to try this out some day, and for the part of it not having a sign-in message option, unless there is any need for it in the future, if not, I don't think I will need it for now, and if need be, I will look for a way to cross that bridge.Quote from: dkbit98 on September 29, 2023, 07:15:27 PMWhy would you complicate so much, and why would you even use junk wallets like trust wallet in the first place?Because I was never aware it was a junk from the onset, just have to realize that recently after I have been using that for more than 2 years now if I’m not mistaken in my counting. And I’m glad I have been able to take security measures into consideration without running any form of loss on getting stocked on the line why using TrustWallet.",
