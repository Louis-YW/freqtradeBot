I can't seem to find a pdu that has an L6-20p with built in surge protection.Where did you search? a simple google search takes me to this link QuoteMetered-Breaker-Surge Protection PDU, 240V, L6-30P, 30A, 7200watts, (4) C13 & (2) C19 Outlets, Crypto Mining PDU, Data Centre PDU, ASIC/RIGS PDUThis PDU is 7.2kw which is more than enough for yourÂ  E9 Pros, it has 4*C13s which is enough for the two gears (each miner will need 2 sockets).",

I had come across those but was unsure if that was safe to use not being familiar enough with electric. I guess since I won't be going past the full (or 80%) 20a capacity since I'll only be using that one miner. it should be fine. I will probably go that route. Thank you.",

Thank you.With only 1 E9 pro, you are not going to go above 10 amps, the E9 pro only needs 2200w which translates to 9.2 amps on 240v, which is less than 50% of the rated capacity of that converter, should be pretty safe to run without any issues.",
