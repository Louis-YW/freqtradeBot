It does have internal graphic display and i have plugged in HDMI from Motherboard to my Smart TV to see intial mining display.While booting up with NiceHash OS USB driver. i am getting a warning message.Warning: Onboard GPU card detected. Please disable onboard GPU card in bios settings.When i go to bios and disable internal display. I notice that it does not show the display and even mining not starting in \"Rig manager\" of nicehash dashboard. When i go ahead and start mining with \"internal display: Enabled\" in bios setting. After few hours of mining i am getting an error.Cuda Error: out of memory (err_no=2)Device 1 exception, exit.....This error effect the mining profits directly.

This error occurs when the video card does not have enough internal memory for operations, but it's hard for me to say about the reasons for this error.Look at what devices the miner uses, manual disable may be possible.",
