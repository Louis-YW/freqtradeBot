Good luck!Its nice you have an offer on article writing because i see no difference from what you are requesting from article writing  but how about making your offer  look this way ; be ready to show a sample of your previous work or send link to your past work this would show some level of seriousness on your end rather than wanting a writer to be hired to start writing for you a sample of your work or how ever the case maybe, it does not augurs well. So i will suggest you  review your offer and criteria for hiring so it can be flexible between you and your prospective employee.If you can as well state or give a brief scope of the nature of the job here, also pay rate would make it more interesting to attend to.",

Let me get this right: So to work with this person, they ask you to write them a sample article of 500 words. That's supposed to be a test to determine your quality as a writer, right? But in reality, that sample article given on a specific topic can be exactly what OP wants, and they don't need your article writing services at all after that.   To make it more believable, OP could trick you with big promises that they will throw a lot of work your way etc., etc. Be careful who you work with, especially on platforms where evidence could be easily deleted such as Telegram. I am not saying it's a scam, but it could play out exactly as I explained above. Take some time to check out OP's trust feedback as well. Although it's not from DT members, it should still be taken into consideration. Btw, what does OP want their clients to write about?",

You can now use AI for that kind of thing and right now you can do it for free.Use chatGPT for your stupid blog posts, it is chatGPT which you can find on https://chat.openai.com/You just tell the dude what kind of article you want, give him the specifics like the length or/and the topic etc of the article and he will create you an article that’s probably going to be better than what you will get with money.",
