      "body": "Well at first since XRP is the main blockchain, I’m sure that all projects working specifically for XRP ecosystem will surely suffer XRP fate but they ca always migrate and rebuild on different blockchain to offer same service to different people. Dapps can survive a blockchain fall because they can migrate on different blockchain to continue the project while the blockchain project itself has no capacity to do it.Airdrop, Usually only rewards those token holders that holds there token on native blockchain. You should bridge it to XRP if there’s any feature like that available.",

You can the detailed info about the Coreum airdrop here https://sologenic.medium.com/guidelines-for-solo-holders-to-establish-a-trustline-to-receive-coreum-core-airdrop-9a705336f4c6You can only received an airdrop if you have $SOLO tokens stored on XRP Ledger or any decentralized wallets that support $SOLO tokens which already mention on the article that I share here. The snapshot of your balance is done at random time so make sure to convert your BSC tokens to XRP tokens since it’s the only way to snapshot your rewards. The easy way is to deposit your tokens on CEX that supports the snapshot of this airdrop for a less hassle transition for you.",

If XRP fails in the future will all XRP ledger projects face the same demise? Is Sologenic future dependant on XRP performance?Thanks for taking your time to read I will just answer the first question to the best of my knowledge.Obviously, if XRP fails then future projects dependent of XRP will also die, it's a very simple logic. But the question is, what factors will cause XRP to fail? I mean it is one of the earliest crypto and that's why it has survived the test of time. Have been in the bear and bull market, seen the worst already. Not unless the people behind suddenly decided to quit and not maintain it which is unlikely to happen, in my opinion.",
