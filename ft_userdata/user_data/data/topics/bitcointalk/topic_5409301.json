Not to mention their CDN coverage is pretty wide.If you're a website owner, it offers analytics and security, decent enough on their Free plan.",

I was almost sure that they moved from Cloudflare and I even thought that Bitcointalk developped their own anti DDOS protection.I remember that when theymos enabled Cloudflare, he was very sceptical about for privacy issues and that it may be potentially owned US intelligence agencies, but he had no other choice. But after all, Cloudflare is doing their job well.",
