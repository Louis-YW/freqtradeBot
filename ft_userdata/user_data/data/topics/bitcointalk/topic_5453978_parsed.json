It's an unknown place, if they never come back then have no option to chase them. For a newbie, not just newbie an old member but does not have much earning (reputation and contribution) from the community has no lose if they never log back to the account after taking your money. As a lender ultimately you lose your money.I have been in lending business and I can assure you that this is not a profitable business at all. One or two bad borrower will take everything from you that you were able to make (profit) from the entire year. Even you will lose money from your principal too.Without a collateral never think of a lending business.",

Â Just don't be a creep, and you'll be able to conduct business without issue. Â Look at the other \"newbies\" offering loans recently; many of them are suspected of pretend to give loans to themselves to feign activity and trust. Â It's obvious and untrustworthy.Non-secured loans (without collateral) are all up to you, make sure to only give those out to trusted individuals that are unlikely to abscond with your money. Â If you want to offer secured loans, make sure to contract with a trusted escrow provider. Â Obviously you need to trust the escrow agent, and so does the borrower. Â If you expect people to send their collateral directly to you, that makes you look like a scammer waiting for an opportunity. Â This will change as you gain rank and activity, and the community starts to trust you. Â But you must be patient, it's not going to happen over-night, or even within a few months. Â It may take years.",

Why would they choose to borrow from you and risk their collateral when they have more established lenders to choose from? And if you offer a service without collateral, how will you protect yourself from potential scammers? It's important to consider these factors before starting a lending service.",

Â Many lenders have started to offer stablecoin loans, so that may prompt someone to ask for a loan secured by bitcoin as collateral. Â Conversely, if you own and are bullish on an alt-coin, but need some bitcoin you could do the same with ETH (for example) as collateral, and borrow BTC.As you've likely noticed, most of the borrowers who are granted loans are well established members who are granted relatively small loans without collateral.",
