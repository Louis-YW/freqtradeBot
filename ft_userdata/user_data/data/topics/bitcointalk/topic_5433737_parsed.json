Anyone who was holding FTT would at least agree with me on thisWhat makes you think that CRO will even be there by 2030... lol",

So you expect more than x10 in just 1 year?Circulating Supply = 25.26 B CRO. At a price of 27$ we can calculate marketcap at 680B - thats a half of alphabet marketcap (google). And CRO is just a small crypto exchange with liquidity issue while google is used by billions.I don't think its a good strategy to hold a bag of small crypto exchange tokens for 7 years and expect it to go x450. I don't think its a good strategy to hold small crypto exchange tokens at all. At least for now, when we are in atime of trial for exchanges (after FTT collapse).",

      "body": "I highly doubt CRO would go up that much, not that it sucks all alone and it is terrible and all that, but because the bull market needs to first bring the high names up first, and then start working on the lower end ones like CRO. Which means, I am not saying it won't go up, all I am saying that it is not its turn yet and that's going to be a tough situation to be in.I know it is not going to be a big trouble for it to go up, but it needs to wait a bit longer than 2023 before it could reach those levels. Maybe in 2024? That's a possibility, if it is still a relevant one that people invest into, then maybe in 2024, but not in 2023 just yet because we need more time for it at this current stage.",

You just have to accept the fact that this coin does not have such utility that it will increase in price by 450 times and surpass bitcoin by 2 times in capitalization.",
