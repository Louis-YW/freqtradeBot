They are different teams, with different logos. I just publish a scam way they use, they do mistakes in names, kinda Barcelona - Real Madrid, then they just say ah that was Barcelona II in a friendly game, do this make sense?",

But, There was a match between CS Mioveni - CS Universitatea.I searched on other websites as well and nowhere it says CS Universitatea 1948.So, How would you know which team it is? Simple, You have to check the team schedule and team players.I am wondering why a team will choose the same name. Are they the same club?",

They're different it ain't the same name I don't why those mistakes, the match that CS Mioveni had was with CS Universitatea 1948 not CS Universitatea Craiova, as I've contacted and asked. But yeah I just show that they can make u believe and giving good ods mistaking the names & logos and not assuming any responsability for that.EX: https://www.sofascore.com/fc-universitatea-craiova-1948-universitatea-craiova/yzWsIPzcThe one in left, is the one that they present that was playing with CS Mioveni, but the real fact is that they played with 1948. Another team, another name, another logo.",
