The guys who I supposed know his seed phrase from the closed source now steal his bitcoin while it is in the new open source wallet.Is it possible and what will be the role of  the closed source non custodial wallet to ensure the security of seeds imported into it.When migrating from a closed-source wallet to an open-source one, a user should assume that the information he entered into a wallet got compromised and may be used in the future to get access to funds. What one needs to do to protect their holdings from unauthorized access is set up a new wallet (preferably a well-reviewed non-custodial open-source wallet such as Electrum or Sparrow) or buy a hardware wallet (again, an open-source one such as Foundation Passport) and create a completely new seed phrase with different addresses unknown to a potential attacker. Once you transferred funds to new addresses, the developers of a closed-source wallet or hackers silently exploiting bugs in the said wallet won't be able to extract your seed or move your funds. In other words, opting out of closed-source wallets implies severing all ties with the company developing it by changing sensitive financial information that may be used to steal your money.",

The worst risk assumption is that the wallet is actually leaked and has been stalked by the hacker to wait for a large tx of input to be transferred immediately.",

Most of the closed source wallets are weakly programming and very poor privacy, the only reason to use them is that they support a lot of currency pairs and attractive interfaces.by swapping your coins from closed source to widely reviewed open source wallet will reduce your risks (Electrum or Sparrow.)for multi-coins wallet i think the open source option as unstoppable wallet is not ideal so hardware wallets are the best.",

These two steps are the most basic things that we need to pay attention to regarding the security we need in protecting assets.In that first step, I myself admit that I often ask myself questions regarding the process I did in installing the wallet software even though until now it still looks safe.Apart from securing it by using it offline to a certain degree, I also pay attention to the seeds that I save.Regarding wallet security, from the beginning until now I have always paid attention to several important steps in protecting assets.Hopefully the assets are safe and hopefully nothing will happen to what I have done.",

If a wallet is closed source it is hard to believe that it is truly a self custody wallet, because you can't be sure how the keys are generated or if they are sent somewhere else across the internet, in a self custody wallet only the owner is supposed to control the keys to their wallet. But if we are to go with the obvious meaning of self custody as the owner of the wallet having their keys and seed phrase, then yes a wallet can be closed source and still be a self custody wallet, for example Trust wallet and Atomic wallet, but it can be argued that a true self custody wallet should be open source.",

So, this shouldn't determine if a wallet is non custodial or not.It can be open source and still compromised.When we talk about security, it is sometimes like defensive measures you take to increase your protection against different types of attack hence increasing your security. For example when you use a non-custodial wallet you eliminate certain ways you could lose your money and bring yourself one step to being safe. When you use an open source wallet you eliminate other ways of losing your money,... when you use a popular open source wallet you eliminate another set of ways you could lose money, and so on.You may never be able to eliminate every single way you could lose money but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try to eliminate what you can. This is why when it comes to choosing between a closed source wallet and open source wallet the later is always the choice whether or not there is any way that the later could also be compromised.",

I think this is the very reason blockchain and related resources were made open source in the first place. However soon after people saw investment opportunity and private companies started rolling in with their closed wallets. As charles stated we could never know what is behind the written code. I am always scared to download free apps which are associated with financial operations. There are many apps that could be leading to the phishing operation in the background. In the world of crypto space that’s even dangerous. This is mostly frightening for the newbie since they wouldn’t be understanding the wallets properly.

What I write now is a simple knowledge that most of us forget. it's crucial to remember the following steps to improve security, such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and keeping your devices and software up to date. Do remember that backing up your seed phrase and storing it securely offline is one of the most important steps.
