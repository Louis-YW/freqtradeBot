Check the logs if there were some missed threats that they didn't noticed. Every time there's a hack, it's not bringing good vibes honestly whether I am user/investor or not of that platform or project.",

Thanks in advance. Probably the Mixin Network was not not well secured or their database was not well secured from external forces. But wait, is it Mixin Safe we all know or another Mixin that has not come to the forum? Yes the hackers are something else in this generation. As the technology is increasing day by day, the hackers, scammers and internet fraudsters are also advancing daily so if you create a financial and economics websites, you have to secure it with all the security measures. Well I have not seen and heard of such story before. And for this year, it is true. I agree with you.",

Mate, you should not be surprised by the hack. I have always said that no matter how secured we think any platform is, provided that it is on the internet, it is hackable. When mixin did their review campaign, I saw that participants were trying to go forth and back trying to scan codes, sign signatures from one device to another in order to make withdrawals. Also, I learnt that it uses multi sig wallet technology to hold funds which makes it more secured and yet it is hacked. This has made me believe that most of these hacks are from indoors.QuoteLet’s hope something good comes out of it as the team behind it are planing on addressing affected customers, made a means for refunding will be possible or they can sort things out.They have realised an official statement towards this and I think they hinted how to handle the victims but it wasn't elaborate. They promised to make another and well detailed publication on 25th September. Has anyone read the publication?",

Thanks in advance.I have not accessed your link to verify if its real or not, but I know that it's possible for hackers to penetrate directly to Mixin website if they have a lesser anti-hacker, but what I know is that hackers can study one particular website for period of time like years in order to get their loopholes of that particular website, so for them to examine it, they will continue giving it a trial until they decode their security and penetrate but the only thing can stop hackers is when the website have a very strong anti-hackers that stop penetration of hackers its when the will be free, because sometimes ago hackers hacked binance who is the biggest exchange in the world.",

The most likely conclusion is that Mixin was not decentralized at all and it was just a centralized exchange which pretended to be decentralized, and as soon as I read words as 'database' and 'cloud service' I knew the owners of Mixin did not did their job properly and left their clients unprotected against those threats, and unless they can recover the money from those hackers their clients will never see Mixin reimbursing them over their negligence.",

And by this i mean centraalized 3rd party services. It's basically same thing what we have warned about the experts, abou humans being the weakest link.Whole power of decentralization loses the meaning and purpose of it, when we run all nodes and services on same cheapest centralized cloud provider. It's once again the low cost, speed and convenience were chosen over security and decentralization.",
