  "content": "I've been out of the loop with miners for a few years but would love to get back into it. I always enjoyed having new hardware turn up in the post, setting it up and having it make money towards the next bit of hardware. Unfortunately I got caught up in a scam a few years back and got fleeced of all my mining income. Bad decisions, bad luck. Anyways, moving on. I have been currently looking at asicminervalue.com and I like how things are laid out, showing you ROI on different units etc. When you click on a certain model miner, a big list of retailers comes up underneath. What I wanted to know from you guys is how trustworthy are these retailers listed there? Is it as simple as picking the best deal and paying up or am I going to check who is and isn't trustworthy? Is there another, better way to find good deals and trustworthy suppliers? I'd love to hear from you and thanks in advance for your input.",

      "body": "Move this thread to Mining board if you want to get prompt proper advice from experience miners. There is an option to do so at the bottom left of the post.The first places to look at are the official websites of the mining gear manufacturers such as Bitmain.com, canaan.io, iceriver.io. There are links to official shops on those sites and there is less chance of you getting scammedAbout asicminervalue.com In the past I have seen a couple of scam accusations made against vendors that pop up in that list like these;1. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=52401122. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5218281So you have to be very careful or ask about a reseller here if you are not sure.",

      "body": "I can't vouch for any of these retailers that all of them are legit. If you're planning to buy miner, I advice you to check everything twice before buying miner from reseller. After all, miner isn't cheap thing, so, getting scammed would be painful. If reseller is listed on that website, it doesn't make them 100% legitimate.And as always, safest place to buy things like miners is their official websites and not some resellers.",

Probably you will find a scam or two for sure in there, and when I mean scam I will say selective scamming, you have 5 customers with no problem and you have one that didn't receive a thing, making a 20% profit on 6 sales is pretty lucrative.Their requirements to list something are pretty minimal and they don't even care about bad feedback, so most of those listed there are pretty sketchy.Go for the manufacturer directly, if it's one of those MQO deals from Bitmain and you want just a machine try a seller with escrow here, there are a few sellers with reputation that won't risk their whole business for a $3k deal.",
