Am I wrong or right? I am not 100% sure but there was a professor of math who used to win the lottery once and people thought he is a genius,he couldn't win it a second time so most likely it was pure luck that coincided with his thinking and algorithms at that time.In Poker you can win if you are good at math and focusing on counting every card rather than try to find other people thinking by reading their faces and expression,you have to be good at it,have a huge amount of patience like this Chris Ferguson guy and you can win,I would not be that much surprised,unfortunately very few people own such skills.As for school when I graduated and got to my first job I found nothing from school was to be used there,so it is 100% theory the school just to give you some education.",

Is their maths strategy a flawless one? It could be as what the post above mine said and it was just luck that their analysis worked and people linked it to their maths skills.",

There are lots of good mathematicians all over the world and we only have few making it big in gambling what are the rest using their maths knowledge for? I am not disputing your claims but i still think luck plays more role in his wins than his maths knowledge or probably he is a naturally gifted gambler.

It is said that he might have created his own simulation program.But still though, not a guarantee but definitely he has some advantage on it being a computer and math wizard.

Any gambler that won big must have loss several times but nobody will notice their loss, because humans are only after success.If you only understand maths and you are playin with a skillful poker player, he will win you when luck his on his side. Lets not get deceived that gambling is not based on luck, if not a lot of people would have taken gambling as their source of income and they will not be disappointed. However, this is not so and that is why you see a lot of people are losing to gamble and only few people that are lucky win big once in a while because gambling is either you win or lose.",

      "body": "Poker is a combined skill base and luck in my opinion and that never changed as I watched more poker players play. It's true that Math can help out in that game but there's still a chance it won't go your way since you don't also see the other players cards. Players who are good at bluffing can make you think that their card is as good as what their wager or that it's just a bluff. It's a mind game too so I doubt a professor of Math could easily win this game. One of the reasons why many actors are also good at this game. Poker faces. They don't need Math but they can always just fake it like what they do in Hollywood. I think Math does help with probabilities but it does change when the flop comes out or until the river. That's why those with AA like to end the round as soon as possible before someone gets something on the flop. Again, that will rely on luck and even those who fold might have gotten a good hand if they stayed.Oh and please, school is important. You won't be writing like this if it ain't for school.",

Often times, those principles and formula not often known or seem are the foundation of successful businesses.People avoid dirty places and in reality, gold is not gotten from clean places, neither is Hydrocarbon. So the few that dare to adventure that part always sees a tremendously great reward.Liken it to the gambling space, these industries functions in the same similitude. The few that apply the formula of the first principle (according to Elon Musk) tends to unearth the very core of the business and then they make a fortune out of it. You can see what capacity the first principles delivers on when you look beyond gambling. It's a natural phenomenon.",

So gambling is still related to luck and skill, mathematics is only the umpteenth factor, not the biggest factor.Yes, gambling is luck and skill, but of course don't ignore the fact that all things have a relation to math. Many gambling games relate to what we call \"probability\", which is the measure of the expectation that an event will occur or a statement is true. In gambling, something might occur, like you being a winner. For example, in the lottery, there is a certain probability or computation where you can get the right numbers, but of course it's too low. Still,¬† math can measure that. Slots are programmed to randomly give the jackbot, but of course there is still a probability for you to get the jackpot. You need to consider how many symbols there are and the series of combinations before you can hit the jackpot.Although there's probability or math in gambling, it is still not enough for you to win. Why? Because gambling is a complex and unpredictable thing, it requires more than just skills and luck‚Äîskills to think about when to play or how to play‚Äîand a certain probability that will give you a win. It's not just about luck and skill; there are a lot of important factors to win in a gambling game.",
