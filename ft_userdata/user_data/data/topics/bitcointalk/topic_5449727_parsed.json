      "body": "Bitcoin halving is just there to aid price impact; it's not necessarily the major reason for price increase; it's just that Bitcoiners have so much faith in Bitcoin halving and the role it will play in reducing the total supply, but bit by bit. So price increases can happen anytime, even before the halving or some days after the halving; it all depends on how positive people are towards them. I guess the last halving triggered a bull run roughly just a day later by 15–18% (just an assumption).So next year, which is to make it the 4th year after the last halving, the price increase can just happen on or before it. If you really don't want to miss the bull run, I advise you to start accumulating as much as you can and not just wait to know the exact time the price will pump up.",

If so, while the price may increase in the near future, that's the reason of setting a low price that you think is totally fine to start buying.",

You don't want to wait.The bear market just ended a month ago, so very little chance it goes down from here. Especially since it is correcting a little bit right now. This week / next week may very well be the lowest it ever is from here on out.Within a few months it'll probably be in the $35k-$40k range. A year from now when the halving happens it'll likely be double the current price or maybe even higher.If you want to only buy once and try to get the lowest price the only intelligent answer is to buy right now because the bear market just ended so the price will in general be going up from here on out. Within a few weeks the price may never be below $30k again, and it is currently just under $28k. So buying today would be just about as good as you can possibly do.",

After all, if we could predict such things with 100% - we'll all be rich - and that's impossible,No one has a crystal ball to answer your question, but if you're confident that bitcoin will go up again and will at least reach its previous ath, then waiting for the potential dip makes little sense. You could buy now and still enjoy great gains if your prediction comes true. Waiting for the dip could backfire. Don't try to time the market perfectly, that's not possible.",

These are all wild speculation, and you never know what will happen next. Just as the way bitcoin is volatile, so people speculate without certainty, and some of their predictions turn out to be incorrect.Quote from: Nwada001 on April 21, 2023, 06:10:58 PMSo next year, which is to make it the 4th year after the last halving, the price increase can just happen on or before it. If you really don't want to miss the bull run, I advise you to start accumulating as much as you can and not just wait to know the exact time the price will pump up. Since the OP likes to avoid DCA and make a one-time purchase, accumulating from now will be conflict with his preference for a one-time purchase. He simply wants to know the best time to buy before the bull run. Because he's avoiding DCA, now is the moment for him to make that one-time buy. Although the price may rise or fall, there is no better time to invest than when you have the finances.",

As far as my experience goes, it usually take months after the halving that we can see the price going up parabolic and make that tremendous gain.For 2020, we start the year at $7k and then finished as around $29k give or take. So that is 300% increased on the halving year alone. Not counting the eventual all time high of $69k in 2021 November.",

Will market see anything below $20k again?Bitcoin halving only gives you one side sentiment which is a positive impact on the movement of its price and according to you is a possibility of next bull run. If you want to be precise, have more confluence such as market correlation, fundamental analysis, htf chart analysis, medium and high impact news, and seasonal tendencies.Not only that, be clear and honest of why do you want to engage in the market.As what I am seeing, you are asking where you can buy in lowest price and sell in the highest high for the most probable profit, which is absolutely foolish. That's not a plan.A plan must exist how much you allow your self to lose money, how long can you afford to be in drawdown, what RR will take profit and partials.And as always accept the risk.You are here to make money, and not to be right in your analysis. Understand the difference and act accodingly.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on April 21, 2023, 06:13:26 PMMan.

If I remember correctly, a year after the halving, real bulls will appear. There is no exact time for you to buy bitcoin, and if you didn't buy bitcoin when it hit $15k last year, I could say you missed the bottom, missed bitcoin's lowest price. Not only you, but all of us want to buy at the lowest price to enjoy the highest profit, but unfortunately, no one knows where the bottom is and which is the top until it passes.",

Will market see anything below $20k again?Afaik it happens a couple of months to a year after the halving itself? There's probably going to be some movement towards the start to at least the end of the year, but it may vary since even if we use the past as a reference point it isn't exactly a guarantee, so you can only move as you assume and see by then really. I'm thinking we won't really be going below $20k again, unless something big happens again, the drop in the price right now is kind of a correction afaik as the price jumped from 25 to 28 to 30 the past few months instead of a gradual one. Your fears of missing out can only be resolved by DCA since no one exactly knows what's going to happen, but seeing as you don't want to for some reason, can only risk an entry at some point, maybe a few months before the halving (end of the year)?",

Usually projects tends to pump towards an event date in the cryptocurrency market and Bitcoin itself is no exception. After the halving, a correction in price happens as people get disappointed as Bitcoin wouldn't pump as they expected and also the corrections happens as a result of traders taking profits for the gains they have made leading to the halving date. The real bull market starts a year after the halving which is 2025.",

For 6.25 to 3.125 halving (with $30k per bitcoin), that's $93,750.
