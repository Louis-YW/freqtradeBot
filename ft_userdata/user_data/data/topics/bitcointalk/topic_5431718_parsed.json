If you don't have any funds left inside your wallet you better create another one and forget the old one[1] : https://support.blockchain.com/hc/en-us/articles/4673391983516-How-do-I-reset-a-lost-password-#:~:text=Enter%20your%20email%20and%20click,link%20to%20reset%20your%20password.",

You can see this wallet ID on the email that you use to register.",

I thought they used some sort of ID system over there (but I haven't used them in about 6 years so they might've updated their system since then).",

I've read posts from people whose legacy wallets were also converted to an HD wallet and their legacy addresses always ends up sitting in the imported addresses which is outside of the 12-word seed from your HD wallet.It's worth mentioning that you could also login using your email address now, I did this with my 2016 account! although I think it's still worth giving logging-in using the wallet ID a try.",

It's been long since you last visited the site and its certain like myself that you tweaked the password written on the notebook to maintain security, even if someone accessed the book and your device they may not access the account. Since its saying wrong password is probably that an incorrect password is imputed. Flashback and think, if that doesn't work then try the seed recovery procedure.",

When writing the password, you must make sure that you write uppercase or lowercase on the keyboard, and you must make sure when you type the password that it is written in English letters or in other languages. If you have the 12-word recovery phrases, you will be able to access your wallet. If you have lost the password and seed phrases, unfortunately, you will not be able to recover your wallet because Blockchain does not have access to the wallets of its customers. You can try to ask the support service of the blockchain wallet so that they can verify the information you have and hope that they will help you if there is a solution.",
