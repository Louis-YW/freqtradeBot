The amount of Bitcoin that those said organisations buy and hold is the only set of Bitcoin they have total control over. The Bitcoin blockchain itself is decentralised, and it has not changed from that yet. Being decentralised means there is no central control over the network, like the developer of most alt coins can control and freeze your asset because it's in your wallet.  The only time I can argue and believe that Bitcoin has been centralised is if censorship is introduced and implemented, which actually is against the purpose of Bitcoin.",

Let us know of your thoughts and comments on this and thanks again.Bitcoin is still decentralised because no single entity can claim to control it. But I cannot deny that the massive investment of some institutional investors such as the ETF providers would not influence the sector in the future. These firms are massively acquiring Bitcoin and might be able to influence the price movement with their inflow or outflows. But Bitcoin will always decentralised because there is a silent majority that is using Bitcoin without these centralised intermediaries. Like  Nwada001 rightly said, the system will become centralised only if the government make policies that will promote censorship which might result in the blacklisting of wallets or addresses.",

Other cryptocurrencies (altcoins) would lose their decentralization at their blockchain launches by bad designs or with time like Ethereum became more centralized after its upgrades and switching from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake.If Bitcoin has a day to lose its decentralization, we will no longer have any decentralized cryptocurrency.

It is an internal property of Bitcoin. The only thing big groups can do is manipulate the price by buying/selling. Sure they can buy off the devs but once those devs go against the Bitcoin community, they will no longer be accepted as devs. In fact, anyone can be a dev. All you have to do is make a contribution to Bitcoin code which the larger part of the community agrees with.",

Imho it's echoes of the fud from the time pos plans were announced for eth and people who had invested on their mining equipment for eth were in danger of losing their living, so they freaked out. And we can see that majority of the people wanted to use new eth, so even that decision doesn't seem to be centralized. Owning 51% of eth won't allow you to do as drastic measures as owning 51% of the hashpower. And in both cases, attackers would just be shooting on their own foot.And same centralization argument could be used for bitcoin as well, as in bitcoin you can just replace those whale coin holders with giant mining farms that hold majority of the hashpower.",

Anyone can own Bitcoin, that doesn't change its decentralization.it's obvious he doesn't understand the meaning of Bitcoin being decentralized. If the numbers of holders that currently owns Bitcoin and how much Bitcoin they hold in total can determine if Bitcoin will suddenly change from being decentralized to become centralized, government would have team up together to buy majority of Bitcoin so they can have full control of it. That people are still getting involved in Bitcoin is mainly because it's still decentralized. if for any reason Bitcoin gets control by a selected few, most prospective adoptors would shy away from investing in Bitcoin and will be forced to politicize it. If more Bitcoin whales continue buying Bitcoin, the only concern is going to be that anyday they choose to sell off all thier Bitcoin, it's going to affect Bitcoin price for the moment but because we have different holders of Bitcoin ranging from individual, institutions and even exchange, it's going to be almost impossible for such thing to ever happen.",
