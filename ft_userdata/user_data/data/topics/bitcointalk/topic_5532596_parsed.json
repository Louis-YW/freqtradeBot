  "content": "Hey! I've written an article on how low incentives to miners could leave the Bitcoin network without enough budget to secure transactions. There is an opinion that transaction fees alone are insufficient to motivate miners. I’d appreciate an expert opinion and comments from the community. I'd specifically appreciate your comments on these points:-  What is the most likely outcome if the Bitcoin security budget does decrease? How do you envision Bitcoin’s long-term security holding up as mining rewards decline? What alternative incentive models could keep miners engaged? Increase in transaction fees? New use cases that drive transactions? Layer 2 solutions or sidechains? I also wonder when the final halving technically occurs. How is it programmed? Is there a hard stop, or does it stop when the reward is less than two satoshi and no more halving is possible?Here is the link to my article. Please let me know if you see any inaccuracies there: https://www.observers.com/who-will-drive-bitcoin-bus-without-miners/",

Those range from a complete rewriting of the Bitcoin concepts, such as the introduction of perpetual inflation (mining more bitcoin for rewards) and fixed nodes (centralization), to less radical ideas, such as higher transaction fees.1. Increase total Bitcoin supply would violate principle of Bitcoin. See https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Principles_of_Bitcoin.2. Bitcoin decentralized is major reason it's so successful. Otherwise, it'd be seized just like Liberty Reserve.3. Default minrelaytxfee value haven't changed in decade, despite Bitcoin price have raised a lot since then. I doubt the community would agree to increase the default value.",

How is it programmed?

Not two but if there is only less than 1 satoshi per block. After this there is no issuance of new bitcoins. New bitcoins entering the network anymore.",

      "body": "Miners rely on both transaction fees and block reward. However the problem is getting the block reward requires a lot of hash rate to increase your chances and probability of you getting the valid hash and hence the reward. But the problem is solo miners merely generate enough hash to even confirm transactions with good fees fast compared to bigger pools. So because of this in rear sense solo miners actually depend more on transaction fees than the actual block reward because of the hash rate they generate. This is the reason why many of them join mining pools instead.",

I'm rather trying to imagine what could keep miners engaged if the rewards become too small.How much is too small? That is an important unknown. I don't think anyone has figured out the minimum necessary value or how to determine it.But I guess we don't need to know the minimum value in order to think about what might happen if the block reward goes below it.There are several examples of 51% attacks on other coins. In most cases of a sustained 51% attack, the coins died. However, there were multiple successful double-spends on Ethereum Classic, and that coin is still around. There was also a sustained 51% DOS attack on Bitcoin Cash and that coin has survived.",

After all, many miners hold substantial amounts of Bitcoin, and if they all abandon mining, the entire network could collapse, rendering their assets worthless.That being said, by the time the last Bitcoin is mined—roughly 115 years from now—the cost of mining will likely have dropped significantly due to major advancements in computing and electricity generation. If Bitcoin reaches a valuation of $1 billion per coin (yes, billion), the profitability equation shifts dramatically. Lower mining costs and immense value per Bitcoin would ensure that miners remain profitable while keeping the network highly secure.",

So even if the number of bitcoin that is rewarded to the miners is cut in half, the value of each bitcoin is worth at least twice as much than before, so the miners aren't really losing anything. They are actually earning more as a result of the halving, due to this price appreciation.Also, as adoption increases which naturally occurs as the price of bitcoin goes up, so does the volume of transactions and fees. More people using the network means more fees collected by the miners.",

You have to know that Bitcoin miners' rewards have to sources: Bitcoin block subsidy, and Bitcoin transaction fee.Only thing we are sure is, Bitcoin block subsidy will become less with time, after every 210,000 blocks or about every 4 years.Bitcoin transaction fee, in average, for future Bitcoin blocks can be higher or smaller than now.It's purely about rewards of Bitcoin miners in BTC, but is mining profitable for Bitcoin miners or not, it will depend on their input cost and output revenue that depends on Bitcoin price in future too.Controlled supplyEquivalent network timeTo mine same 1 BTC, Bitcoin miners will have to spend more inputs in future because of Bitcoin block subsidy halvings, and more competitiveness among Bitcoin mining pools and Bitcoin miners.",

For now, the correlation between Bitcoin's hashing power and block reward remains negative. While the reward is going down, the hashrate is also going up. The block reward has already been halved 4 times but the hashrate keeps on registering new ATHs.I guess the price increase of Bitcoin and the increase of transactions as a result of the increase in adoption will sufficiently cover for the regular decline in mining rewards. Bitcoin's adoption is still low but it has already managed to surpass Visa and Mastercard's combined transaction volume. Notwithstanding, it still has so much room for growth. Until when this will be sustained, we can only guess. So far, however, the reward has already gone from 50BTC to 3.125BTC and yet Bitcoin's mining difficulty continued to increase.",

You can't, can you?Similarly you can't really speculate on Bitcoin's security regarding miners. When bitcoin started, miners were earning 50 bitcoins per block but that was barely worth 50 bucks. Today they are earning 3 bitcoins per block (3.125 to be exact) but it is worth $300,000.My point is that just like people back in 2009-2010 could neither foresee nor believe some day miners would be earning $300k with 3BTC reward, we can't really predict what things are going to be like 10 years from now when reward is smaller or 100 years from now when the reward is zero.This is a problem for the future to solve because it depends on a lot of things. I personally believe by that time bitcoin has either will have ceased to exist or significantly changed and will not be anything like it is today.",
