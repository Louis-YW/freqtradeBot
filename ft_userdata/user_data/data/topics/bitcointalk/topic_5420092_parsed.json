The launch of Bitcoin, and the widespread popularity of \"De-Fi\", has led governments to act fast before they're left behind the game.

The average person won't notice any difference with the new digital cash system, as everything would be the same as using a credit/debit card.I'm beginning to question whenever CBDCs will be able to replace paper money for good, or will it co-exist with the old system? After all, credit/debit cards didn't manage to replace paper money when they launched. For being in the 21st century, I'd say paper money should be phased out as soon as possible.

I think that paper and metal currencies will always be the main and legal currencies in transactions.as stated by Tommaso Mancini Griffoli (Division Chief in the Monetary and Capital Markets Department IMF) CBDC has great potential and risk, so it is not possible to completely replace fiat currency “So I don't think we will arrive where we only have CBDC. I don't think that we will do it,\" said Tommaso in the G20 Advancing Digital Economy and Finance Side Event agenda.if what you're asking is when is everyone using digital currency? maybe I will answer when everyone can and easily access the internet anywhere and anytime without much disturbance.",

And not all governments will issue CBDCs.It will take more generations until paper money gets phased out, if ever. There are still many people who don't use technology, there are still many regions not covered with internet; those just cannot go without an offline currency.",

But this question that you have asked is already given answer by you also from the post. Can it be real that paper money will go out ? You say it that credit card didn't replace paper money, so CBDC will not take out paper IMO. This is what I think that digital currency is just what the government people are trying to stand out bitcoin but this isn't possible to happen.",

Maybe after several decades this will change.What's the point of dumping paper money completely? Paper money aren't that bad. They have done their job for decades without any major issues(the only major issue is counterfeit paper money). If it works, don't dump it. I'm also a Bitcoin supporter and I don't find any problem for Bitcoin to coexist with paper money. Only 2 or 3 big central banks around the world would issue CBDCs. It's totally pointless for every country on the globe to have it's own CBDC(most of those CBDCs created by smaller and undeveloped countries would be a complete joke).",

Government officials care a lot about their privacy (they apparently have a lot to hide) and if other people can't accept their currency they'll end up legislating against themselves.",

But if paper money is completely phased out and replaced by digital currency, our privacy will completely disappear from there, I think even if we spend 1 dollar or 2 dollars if we use CBDC, we are still controlled by the government.

Many countries are still backward technologically which means that even if there are intentions to replace electronic money with fiat it would be adopted gradually based on the development level of the country. It would take a longer time for developing nations to adopt currencies like bitcoin and CBDC because of a lack of infrastructure. Poverty and illiteracy are other key impediments that would always increase the lifespan of fiat globally. To date, a greater percentage of the world's population doesn't have access to phones and internet connections.",

Even if fiat money is no longer used in the future, then probably the cards will still remain, because in some way we will need to pay for goods and services. Of course, a smartphone can help us with this, but I don’t know how convenient it can be to use.",

Yesterday I went to the cinema by taxi.  When we arrived, I gave the taxi driver a banknote.  The taxi driver refused to accept this banknote from me, explaining that now no one pays with banknotes and he has no change.  Based on this, we can conclude that paper banknotes will soon go out of circulation.  Already, people are actively using plastic bank cards for payments.  In the near future, payments will be made exclusively through CBDC (yes, it will be a kind of digital concentration camp).",

The paper money replacement is not just what can happen without a serious consequence and that the world is not ready for. Daily buying and selling is still much dependent on cash despite the cashless system that is for convenience. Credit cards, ATM and the cashless mechanism are not everyone favourite, some people still prefer their money physically. Imagine in Nigeria some older people selling their land still prefer getting their money physically in cash. There are so many instances of cash transactions but getting the proceed of land sell in cash worth of $2k and above is the height of the instances of how cash still relevant in the system.",

It is also interesting to know that the adoption of CBDC as digital monies is a step in the actualization of a cashless economy. It might take longer to actualize in most countries, but it sure gonna happen, mostly with the continuous advancement of technology and adoption of cryptocurrency ongoing worldwide.",
