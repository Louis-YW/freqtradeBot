I was looking for a particular DT member in the log and I noticed that it was somehow difficult for me to get to the DT member name because the names are not arrange in alphabetical order so I have to check one after the other but if the names were arranged in alphabetical order, I would have gone straight to the alphabet of the particular username and make a search from there and get the name. But for now the scanning or skimming process is somehow difficult because the names are not alphabetically organized. Whenever the log is updated, we the active forum users check it to know the current DT members in the forum, that is who was removed and who was added, so I am suggesting that the names should be alphabetically arrange in the next updates.Who was Removed and who was addedThis can also be identify easily if it is arranged in alphabetical way. It is just a suggestion for easy search of DT users in the DT update log. If the suggestion sound good then let the next updates should be alphabetical. But let theymos and Cyrus etc should be at the top for 1 and 2  then the rest should be orderly arranged.",

And if such board is carved out for them then it will become the state Board in the forum where specific cases will be brought to the board for proper analysis and resolution. But what I am saying here is the rearrangement of the DT Members in an alphabetical order so that names can be easily located in the list. I like some answers which says by using the search box for the name you looking for. But if you don't remember the DT member name then that can't work out again.

There are things that we shouldn't even talk about on this Forum unless you have a target, so if theymos is at the bottom it doesn't change the fact that they're doing there job and doing it perfectly well so no questions should be asked and why they're being listed at the bottom, so OP let it be.",

So the point is, making some efforts to find good results worth making efforts. But I also do agree that the ops of that thread would add them alphabetically which will not take too much time but only make some shortcut key to press depending on the app they are using to keep track of data.",
