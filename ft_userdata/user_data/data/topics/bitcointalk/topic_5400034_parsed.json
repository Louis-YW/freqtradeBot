Mining 24/7 means your gpu are in the most stable state.2. Miners cares about power consumption and they go with minimal watts to safe electricity.3. All algorithms aren't the same, some are very healthy for GPUs and very few aren't. 4. Gamers dont care about power consumption, they operate at full power.5. Games render both core clock and mem clock at once but mining use one more than the other.Still I am standing on my point that gamers know too less about graphic cards and miners understand graphic cards more.",

I know when I'm building a gaming rig, a lot of effort goes into making sure everything will work together properly and there won't be any bottlenecks for performance.  GPUs that have been used for mining have usually been beat to hell, running in hot conditions at max usage with their fans at 100% for sometimes years.  No gamer wants to deal with squeaking fans or GPUs that might have issues and damage a PSU...  So I understand completely why gamers wouldn't want a GPU that's been used for mining.  I wouldn't either.  I've experienced so many different problems with used GPUs...  It's definitely a thing.",

Thus killing gear.Any sane rational gpu miner know to under volt and clock properly.I have 1080ti's still working 24/7/365 since dec 2017 which is actually more like 24/7/1700Tired of gamers they are simply economic fools (unless they side mine while sleeping).Honestly as a miner I am about 980 and 20 with cards since 2012At least 150 were used. The used are likely  150 and 0.My evga are in the prefect range  say 200 and 0Mostly MSI  Asus Dual  Gigabyte Power colorare the failed ones.",

I lost maybe 25% of my used GPU sales due to this.When you got more than 4 GPUs for sale, it’s easy to tell you mined with them. No point in denying it. Many people didn’t care. Some just wanted to make sure it still works and that’s it.However there are those that didn’t complete the sale when I told them they were mined with. Nothing I could do.",

Because PC gaming is serous business. Have you ever played a competitive PC game before? I used to play dota/dota2 a lot. I heard the most vicious curses in those games which I haven't heard anywhere before. If you are a retarded nub your teammates will kill and fuck your mother countless times till your grandfather is dead and then blacklist your ass. PC gaming is that serious, so is buying GPU's. You can't imagine how much curse ETH miners have been getting because PC gamers couldn't find fine GPU's on the shelves.",
