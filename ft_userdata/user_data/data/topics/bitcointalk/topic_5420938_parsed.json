I don't want to believe it's because they don't know how to sign a message from a wallet. I want to believe it's negligence on their part and it's because they think it's not necessary. Again, I don't think there's anything here that's being made compulsory for any member. You can decide to do something or stay away from it. This forum is as decentralised as it can be. Members are allowed to do what they think is best for them provided their actions don't negate the rules and regulations of this forum. Making staking of wallet addresses compulsory most likely will send out a negative signal and suspicion.",
