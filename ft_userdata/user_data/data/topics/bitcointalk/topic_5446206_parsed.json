Both plagiarism and scamming are serious offenses that can harm individuals and communities. However, forums need to have clear and consistent policies and enforcement mechanisms. Plagiarism is often evident and easily verified, but preventing scammers from exploiting the forum can be challenging. That is why many forums have strict policies against plagiarism and may ban users who violate these policies. Scamming, however, is a gray area and is generally not moderated on the forum.",

But there is a difference between the two:Plagiarism: It is possible for anyone to verify and confirm what is plagiarism or not.Scan: can only be proven by people who have suffered the scam.Therefore, it becomes easier to ban a user who commits plagiarism, because it is probable by anyone in the face of evidence.As for those who comment on the scam, only those who suffer from it can present facts, facts that third parties will not be able to confirm.So, with regard to the coup, it is up to each one to evaluate based on the analysis they can and should do.",

So my question is now is the crime of plagiarism more offensive than scamming? Both offenses are frowned upon in the forum but it seems that plagiarism has a greater punishment because the crime can be easily established. A scam is not a lesser crime but it is very difficult and sometimes expensive to investigate. I also think that people can easily accuse someone of scamming them which might not be true. Businesses might not go as planned and one party might claim that he has been scammed especially if he loses money. And in this forum business dealing is mostly based on trust that no legal document is signed that can be used as evidence. Maybe in the nearest future rules covering punishment for proven scam cases might be increased because some scams are preplanned.",

So my question is now is the crime of plagiarism more offensive than scamming? Honestly, I've asked similar question too. Why is scam left unmoderated and in cases where the scam is clearly proved to have taken place, nothing is still done. For me, both should be weighed on the same scale. Forum admins should revisit that rule and activate a ban clause on scam because scam does as much scare as plagiarism to this forum. I don't subscribe to the notion that users should be wise enough to spot a scam. Not everyone will be as wise as those who already knew how. After all, commonsense isn't common.",

Maybe in the nearest future rules covering punishment for proven scam cases might be increased because some scams are preplanned.If you think someone get wrongly accused for scamming, you can give your opinion on that's thread or creating a new thread to ask any users to recheck the case. If the case is between big business vs newbie, many users tend to believe the business is right. But if the case is between small business vs high ranked user, many users tend to believe the business is a scammer. But it still depends on case by case.What do you mean about no legal document? are you asking the administrators to ask KYC for any business in this forum? it will not happen.The administrators aren't sleeping, you can be a subject for investigation if you did a huge scam.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/privacy.phpBitcointalk.org is in US jurisdiction, and is subject to US subpoenas, wiretap orders, preservation orders (which would negate the above retention rules), and similar. Furthermore, our service providers could also be subject to similar orders without our knowledge.

Generally we do this only when we perceive that the target user has probably committed a serious and non-victimless crime.At our sole discretion, we may (noncommercially) share or extend retention on any of a specific user's userdata even without law-enforcement involvement.

The both are offensive, if Plagiarism should be tolerated whereby users won't be be banned,  it will kill the forum and make members to be lazy, the forum will no longer have standard.
