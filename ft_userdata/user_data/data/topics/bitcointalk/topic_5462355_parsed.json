  "content": "Top 4 Technological Advancements for Sports BettingBitcoin and behind the scenes blockchain technologyWe should start with the most obvious and most important advancement, how we manage our betting dollars. When we wager in old school, traditional, currency like dollars we must often use a middle person.In this case, that middle person is almost always a credit card company. However, when we wager in bitcoin, we use peer-to-peer, decentralized technology, that allows us to bet in mBTC, a thousandth of a bitcoin.Bitcoin uses proof of work, which makes it ultra secure. Not only that, but advancements in blockchain technology, protocols like PraSaga have solved the trilemma – – a blockchain that’s decentralized, scalable, and maintains proof of work-like security, means advancements in bitcoin and blockchain betting will only increase.Sports betting AIWe add a question mark to number two. Eventually, AI will get so advanced that an artificial intelligence program should allow sports bettors to quickly identify bets with the highest probabilities of scoring wins.Ah, but what’s good for the sports bettor is good for the sportsbook. Sportsbooks won’t ever shut down wagers on AI driven bets one-hundred percent, but they may request a larger vig, more juice, to place bets on AI driven options.So AI driven options may present a double-edged sword. All advancements in all technology isn’t always the best thing. Sharpening your handicapping skills will always be the best option to finding winning wagers because AI will never develop sports betting intuition.Advancements in sports betting acceptanceAcceptance isn’t exactly a technological advancement. But it qualifies for this list because it’s a major advancement in online sports betting.U.S.-based organizations like DraftKings and BetMGM have opened the door for sports betting as a viable, accepted, form of entertainment. However, organizations like DraftKings and BetMGM are running traditional operations, meaning they are as centralized as a brick and mortar Vegas sportsbook.To get true decentralization, to have the power of a sports handicapper in your hands, you must use a bitcoin and blockchain sportsbook.Read more→ https://n2g.io/e622977",

Imagine it analyzing the data and picking up the best odd for a bettor. There is a possibility that an AI could outrun a human being in those spaces and they might excel in it. But, we cannot ignore the fact that a sportsbook won't work on improving their side. Eventually, they would catch up pretty quickly and would limit a bettor's profit from an AI. Do not forget they are once who are known to adopt new and innovative technology first than any other industry. So to an extent AI betting would help the bettor but it wont last in the long run.",

I get the fact that using a bot or an AI could increase the potential of your winning but not in all games because sometimes we all still lose bet I’m games that we were 99% sure that we were going to win. Take for example when an Upset happens, and just like the post above mine started I would I use bots for trading than to trust it for my gambling. Let’s talk about the casino itself, while some gamblers might be willing to use AI to gamble since they are going to realize more profit you won’t just expect the casino to sit down and watch their money being scoped away by an AI, for one some might restrict the use of AI and if an anomaly is detected they could shutdown the account without further explanation and if your think they won’t be a way to detect AI usage trust me they’ll figure it out. For now, let’s keep having our fun while still outing our brain to use.",

So to an extent AI betting would help the bettor but it wont last in the long run.I can only be speechless amazed by the advancement of technology and the convenience in it.In the past, when I wanted to do data analysis to win a bet, it took quite a long time because I had to find valid information from various sources and continue to absorb the latest information as material for analysis. What's different now is that after the advent of AI, they can infer the information we need for analysis in a short amount of time.Quote from: Oshosondy on August 07, 2023, 02:23:04 PMI can assure you that AI or other bots does not guarantee winning.Well... we can't completely rely on AI alone. Predictions can still go wrong, we also need to absorb other information, don't just stick to AI. And if we only focus on AI/artificial intelligence, if we do this in the long term it will make us stupid, because we also have thoughts that need to be honed.",

AIs are cool but they're no match for human sports savvy. They can crunch numbers, but they're not nailing that human touch. I wouldn't bet my bucks solely on an AI for sports betting, you know? AI don't have the guts that's when we trust our guts! Because in gambling it's more of like a very mental and luck game. 🤝",

And then of course the bettor thinking like he has the advantage will just click Ok and all that he manages is just how much money he'd put on for every bet. A more advanced AI will probably choose the winning method in sports such as Boxing or UFC fights. The problem with such AIs is that they will grab data from somewhere else to check the records of the athletes, if the athlete's data is not found like nowhere found in Wikipedia, the AI will malfunction.",

For example, if there was an open source AI, which all of us had access to and we decided to use it to try to get betting results, it would imply the AI would say the same to all of us. If we actually took the AI advice then the volume of money put at stake for a result would be much bigger than the contrary result. That is the unbalance I am talking about. Even if the AI would only Increase the chances of success in 35% or so, still would create an unbalance, depending of the volume of the market and the casino, Arbitrage would propagate the problem further to other markets.",

That being said I believe a human would be more formidable than an AI when we think about sports betting. An AI would only respond to a query and a human would not as a human is already knows what he/she needs to work on. Bettors would benefit initially but in the end, the house would overcome it. Considering what might be the recursion in the long run I think the house won't tolerate such theft. We would only know what would happen next when such a issue is detected by the house.",

That calls for a lot of loss in money and capital, and not really desirable if you'd ask me. There's that reasoning that not everyone who enters something, enters it as a pro, but you can't really say that especially if you are risking money in order to make more money. Also, there's not an AI currently that can do predictions, so the user will likely have to feed the AI inputs that he/she should know what it's all about.ß",

When it's about betting, it depends on luck. It's a 50-50 chance. When you are using it for trading purposes, it can work with more data and give you some sort of accurate prediction. (not 100% accurate). It will also lose as sometimes the market moves on people's sentiments. As AI lacks human emotion, it will be unable to predict what's coming next. Also, in sports betting, it's humans that are playing the games. Not machines. And past performance does not give you future predictions on sports. Anything could happen at any time. So if you really want to try out your luck, why use AI or Bots for that matter? Do it on your own. It's more fun that way. And gambling should be for fun and entertainment.",
