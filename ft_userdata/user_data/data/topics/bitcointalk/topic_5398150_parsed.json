Do you mean open-source instead of closed source? If so, here's a list of open-sourced hardware wallets[2]. Trezor is the one I'd recommend especially if your plan is to use and hold a lot of different cryptocurrencies and not just bitcoin.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5288971.0[2] https://github.com/LedgerHQ/",

      "body": "All hardware wallet manufacturers need to store data of their users. They are required to do so by law. It just depends on how long your data will be stored on their servers and when will you have the right to request that your personal data is to be deleted. Unless, of course, the database leaks before that. If you are worried about Ledger's closed-source nature, pick one that is open-sourced from the link provided to you. Their biggest competitor is Trezor. If you go for a Trezor, don't forget to use a strong passphrase as a seed extension and additional security measure.",

Heartbroken?! It's not like they cheated you about being closed source, even if their co-founder BTChip still claims they are more open than Trezor You seem to be very much confused buddy....ledger is already closed source device, and model X is not good wallet at all.Data collection is probably happening for most wallets, but problem with ledger is they could be selling your data to third party, and all that can be seen in their privacy policy page:QuoteYou use our partnersâ€™ services: information (like your name, date of birth, postal address and IP address) can be collected by our partners (or by Ledger on their behalf) to meet their anti-money laundering and customer-identification obligations.You are a validator for a proof of stake-type service: we display your name/handle, the balances delegated or any information communicated on Ledger Live.Device session identifier, IP address*, clicks, actions (e.g. launching the application, use of transactional functionalities, pages viewed), properties (e.g. type, version, language and region recorded for your operating system), currency, time stamp, amount and status of transactions, transaction identifier, identifier used by our partners to identify you (when you use their services)https://www.ledger.com/privacy-policy",
