If that would really be the case then this would be a huge news because AdSense belongs to Google and if one of the biggest companies of the planet would start to tokenize it's sub companies they would definitely make an official announcement about that and then this would be the top story in all the crypto news worldwide obviously.So the coin that you mentioned is not only just another shit-coin, it is also stealing the name of a well known companie in order to get attention. I also took a look at the logo and even if it's not the same logo they are using the same color as the official AdSense logo. I would not be surprised if Google would sue them.",

I think this is not much different from other shitcoins projects. CMC also does not verify the data from this project, even token circulation is not verified. Don't waste time on an obscure project. The name of the project takes part from the already popular, namely Adsense which is identical to Google Adsense or others.",

Or is that about the other company that uses the name AdSense to launch their own crypto? I do not think it comes from Google officially because if so, there must be an announcement from Google that they want to join in the crypto. After all, I do not suggest you invest in that project as it is not unknown. It is good if you already think that it is not legit. You have the other good projects to invest so leave that like that and never touch that project.",

Do i blind or what? I can't even see that from the chart if this scam token being pumped and otherwise if it was getting dumped to the bottom. I hope that i was only making mistake but this seems even worst than it. Do you feel if you are dreaming? I feel that if you are being very delusional with it. that's a non sense scam token. So i guess if you are blindly about that.",
