Bitcointalk scripts can be found here.This is the first time I've heard of these browsers and I've been ignoring Lemur and Mises due to the low number of downloads but Kiwi seems like a good project.I searched a little about it and found that it is not a browser that focuses on privacy. They also promote themselves as the fastest and safest, but I am not confident in these claims. In general, I will try it on my spare phone, but thank you.",

You should give it a try at least once.Thanks for the recommendation, but crypto friendly browsers are targeted by hackers more than regular browsers, and since the number of downloads is limited, it is better to be careful about trusting these browsers, even if they are good, but they are a more likely target than other browsers.I'm good with Firefox",
