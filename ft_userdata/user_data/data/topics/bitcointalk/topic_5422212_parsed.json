  "content": "I don‚Äôt really follow alts but considering the Sweatcoins project and there on going buzz I kinda started liking this project a lot. I am seeing good use case of their app which is based upon Sports activity. I also know that there are many such apps available out there and very first utility came into effect from NIKE brand way before crypto boom. They had those marathons, donations, the more you sweat the more you get back from their brand in terms of goodies, vouchers etc. Similar strategies is now built by Sweatcoins. I am trying out the app since 1 and half month. I am not sure but it seems really good. I don‚Äôt even have to do anything except run, walk, do my daily activities and I am getting paid just like that. It‚Äôs amazing to see the progress. There is also their own shop where you can change the Sweatcoins and buy the real stuff. You can shop the coupons, discounts on well known brands. Every week they have promotions for real amazon vouchers, airbnb and more!I am also amused that they have good number of user base whose actively participating in every months challenge all the time. That is definitely good sign in the long run. In addition to this they have the coin listed on various exchanges with nice volume. I think that makes it one of the worthy project out of thousands of unwanted ones. Do you see potential in such projects?",

      "body": "If I remember correctly it is almost similar to Stepn project but developed from Nike and they don't organize token sale like Stepn, this is a free project. The generation of tokens is from performing tasks such as watching ads or walking, I used to follow this project but forgot about it because there was so much to worry about during this time. In my opinion, this is a very good free project, it not only brings health to users but also brings many benefits such as converting tokens into coupons, discounts...but these projects will not generate great attention because it does not bring high returns to investors.",

      "body": "I used it to receive some products at a discounted price.For example, I took advantage of a discount on women's beauty creams (which I ended up paying $4 for 5 boxes).I have created some free accounts (example apple music 6 months at 0 cost).After a while I get boring and I stopped using it giving all the points to charity.Real rewards, like paypal bonuses or something like that really require a lot of steps besides having a premium account.It depends on the phone you use, the app consumes a lot of battery.Quote from: Majestic-milf on November 19, 2022, 03:29:21 PM It's normal to be a bit reluctant when it comes to things like this.

I have no idea of the economic value they could achieve as a token, but given the inflationary nature by design, I wouldn't be so optimistic about their future quotations.",

      "body": "Amazing, so we are standing on the same opinion that community is actually getting benefited with the project like SweatCoin. Because I am also receiving good amount of money everyday just by walking. After buying their premium membership it double or tripled actually. I mean this is literally free-free app to use and yet you get something out of it all the time. It‚Äôs similar next free lunch box thing after freebitcoin Website. :-D I never encountered any other project like this from the perspective of altcoin project. This is real Gem for the athletes and daily runner üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è for sure.",
