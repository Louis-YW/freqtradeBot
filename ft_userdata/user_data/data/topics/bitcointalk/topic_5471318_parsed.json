  "content": "What happened?The Kerala High Court issued a ruling that will safeguard individual bank account holders whose accounts got frozen due to the cybercrime investigations by the police. The high court directed the banks not to freeze the account but only to withhold the disputed amount received through UPI until the investigation is completed. My QuestionThe question that came to mind after reading the article is what happens with the money that is received through the IMPS or NEFT payment system. Understandable most P2P vendors provide UPI transfers. Some of them do not and have a good reputation in the P2P marketplace. Does this ruling cover those Bank account holders who receive the money without using UPI?  I did not find anything about it in the article.What are your thoughts?The ruling would give a boost to those individuals who still have their accounts frozen. They can now take a sigh of relief knowing that their account has a chance to get unfrozen in some time after this positive ruling.",

We are moving towards a more crypto-streamlined economic system in this country which is in need considering the rise of crypto in the dark.Possibly in future the other methods of transacting will also get included, fingers crossed.",

      "body": "If contested with proper evidence and reasoning we can get positive outcome. It is what I felt after reading the article as the judge did what many P2P users needed whose account got blocked. To an extent I feel this was expected with the amount of Bank accounts getting reported and getting frozen. As someone  has to come up and take such shit measures by the police to the court. Many more of such issues would come to end except the 30 percent tax slab.",

      "body": "It's a great and welcoming change in the ecosystem. A lot of people in the past have got their account frozen due to cyber fraud. We have seen couple of such incidents in this forum too. It makes sense to withhold only the amount received through UPI payment and let the user use the banking services. Great to see such decisions are coming in favor of crypto users. Especially when there is no legal framework available in the country.",

A lot of cryptocurrency users who were using Binance fro P2P have suffered as their bank accounts got frozen. I had read one such incident when a user used the bank account where funds were kept for his sister marriage and unfortunately it got frozen when he did a transaction using Binance P2P. It is one of the news from the thousands of news that came to notice when cyber police was placing freeze request to the banks. Thankfully after the Kerala highcourt directives such freeze would stop.",

I do not think the crypto community will appeal against this judgment. Anyway, if there is an appeal I personally do not think the Supreme Court will overrule the judgment as there is nothing wrong with it. The judgment benefits those who are suffering from the frozen account issue and does not interfere with the investigation as it allows the investigating agency to hold only the funds in question. The banks have the ability to place a hold on the amount, which is why I do not think there would be an appeal.",
