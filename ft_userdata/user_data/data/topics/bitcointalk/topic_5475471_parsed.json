Is TRC20 cheaper or BEP20?Thank you.Bep20 is cheaper now because trc20 now charging more fee and it is remain no cheaper network. 2-3 years later TRC20 was most cheapest network and sending fee was just one trx(0.02$) but I checked one year ago by sending usdt to other addresses and trc network charged 2$ per transaction which is higher than many network.BSC network fee is just 0.05$-0.1$ which is very low as compared to TRC. If you use Matic then it is cheaper than both. BTW you want to buy from Cex ?",

Is TRC20 cheaper or BEP20?Thank you.For some undisclosed reasons, I get people preferring to use trc20 than bep20If I was to critically analyse why based on on-chain analysis, one of the factors to note is that the trc20 arrives or confirms way much faster than bep20, this is not to say trc20 design is the faster or fastest but I believe its use isn't as much as that of bep20 therefore validations have fewer transactions thereby not having a congested confirmation log to validate but bep20 is in steady use and therfore the tps might be overwhelmed and thereby trigger a bit of delay.",

But the price in USD value is still the same while TRC20 is widely use in almost all website that accepts USDT.",

I'm sure each and every bsc dex supports it. TRC20 is widely used only on cexes, because they can stake several thousands tron for free resources and avail free transfers. So pocketing money from users by taking withdrawal fees and at the same time being relatively cheap for user. Both party wins. Other than that trc20 is expensive to sell on tron dexes and transfer too for normal users.",

Is TRC20 cheaper or BEP20?Thank you.TRC20 is widely accepted in centralized exchanges when many exchanges don't support the BEP20 version of USDT. I guess this 150 dollars of yours will eventually go to any centralized exchange if it is supposed to be converted into fiat. Centralized exchange is the most convenient way to do that right now as far as I know. You can buy USDT with P2P and a visa card if that is available in your country. Also be careful when selecting the address type as TRC20 is not EVM compatible so their names may look similar but their addresses will not.",

Go ahead with BEP-20 if it's available in the exchange or P2P platform where you are sending these $150, moreover regardless $0.30 or $1 doesn't make huge difference at these are flat rates instead of dynamic or percentage basis.

If you're using Binance to facilitate the transfers, then BEP20 is around 5x cheaper than transferring USDT on other chains including TRC20.But if you're making the transfers on-chain (independent of an exchange) then you should use BEP20 since it's more cheap compared to Tron blockchain when you factor in the cost of bandwidth and other tx requirements or just default to TRX for fees — BEP20 is still cheaper.",

Is TRC20 cheaper or BEP20?Thank you.Honestly, both networks are the cheapest in terms of fees, but naturally, I prefer BEP20 for its significantly lower costs, especially on centralized exchange platforms (CEX). It's good that you brought up this topic before making any transactions. You should always check the fees of each network you will use to transfer your crypto through. It's perfect that you didn't choose the ERC20 network because it's one of the most expensive networks in terms of fees during peak times and network congestion. Fortunately, many other solutions and alternatives are less costly.It would be best if you also made sure that the address you are sending to has chosen the appropriate network. If the transaction is \"on-chain\" on exchange platforms, sending to the wrong network may result in losing those funds.",

But if it's just one transaction, you wouldn't hesitate to pay $1, so the difference between BEP20 and TRC20 is not too much in terms of what you're talking about.But anyway, I still like TRC20 because I find it very fast.
