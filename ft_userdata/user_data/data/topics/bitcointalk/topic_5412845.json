And you can also run a signature campaign on the forum to also increase the visibility of your brand around the forum. A quick run-through on your site or looks like you don't offer sports booking on your site and also no mention of the promotion news players will receive as a bonus.",

I already visited your site and see the site has a simple design so I guess you will have a chance to grow your site better. I want to ask about KYC as this matter is my concern and I think other people will think the same too. When do you implement KYC for your members? Is it when we want to withdraw a big amount of money or do you apply it randomly from time to time? How about using a VPN? Is it allowed?",

      "body": "Hey there, OP!Congratulations for creating your gambling website. After checking the website, I could't help but to give you some feedback and recommendations:First, try creating a certain mascot for your gambling website. This will establish your identity and personal face that would set you apart from other gambling websites;Second, if it is possible, try also creating a live chat or a chat box for the gamblers to make it interactive and inviting. The more people you see chatting, the more inviting the gambling website would be; andLastly, if you have the funds, try creating a campaign signature in this forum. This will not only boost your advertisement, but this also creates a prima facie assumption that you are genuine about this website. This somehow creates an impression that the fact you can dish out funds for advertisement, it means that you are more dedicated and serious about it. Those are some of the recommendations that I wanted to share. Good luck on your journey, OP.",

If they answer, it will be applied randomly, we might consider trying their site anyway and never using big money to gamble. Maybe they will answer as you do but most cases happen when a user wants to withdraw big money after getting big wins. So it's a normal thing to ask.They are against multiple accounts, which also applies to many casinos and it can be people who create multiple accounts to get more bonuses. Maybe some people will use a VPN because access in their country does not allow online gambling even though there is offline gambling in their country so they need a VPN to play online gambling.",

There is answer in the website about your question related to KYC by visiting the FAQ page, but let me make it easier for you to read as maybe you have no time to visit the casino and explore it a bit. Quote from: ethereumhunter on September 08, 2022, 02:09:15 PMHow about using a VPN? Is it allowed?I tried to search about this in their FAQ and Terms page but I cant find information related to the rules about VPN. If you are not from the forbidden countries (check the FAQ page to see the list), better to use your own original IP address unless your ISP block the access. Try to avoid using VPN because it seems that KYC is mostly mandatory in this site as what you can read on the above information.",
