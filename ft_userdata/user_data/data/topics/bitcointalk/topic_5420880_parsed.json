      "body": "This is their way saying that FTT is not worth it anymore and too risky to deal with, if you still have position with that better to communicate with the support and ask for your funds so you can access it. I’m sure Bybit knows what’s the best for them and if they think it will put them on a bigger risk as well, they have to take action right away. It is more ethical to protect traders in your platform, and with this other exchanges should do the same because FTT is dying and no way for them to rise again.",

I see no issue here, it's their exchange, they have to deal with the risk of exposure to a token that's dying. I am pretty sure that Binance delists them eventually too.Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMWhat would happen to those traders who have shorted since say $25??? Their shorts are probably closed. So they are way better of if they have shorted it in Bybit then let's say FTX for example. You need a little sense of proportion here. Talking about ethical behavior when TENS of BILLIONS have been gone up in smoke and FTX dumped every coin they had. They even got hacked and you are talking about some exchange delisting something which happens all the time. Should everyone have kept Bitconnect listed on their exchanges too after they were exposed just because someone was shorting it? No. It's unethical to keep FTT as a play token now imho",

(>...)Exactly, this is very common to some exchanges when you have an open position and the pair you traded will be delisted from the exchange, I believe they did notice this delisting. It will just automatically close.So for me, they have the right to do this. If OP is worried about closing it's position, OP can use other exchange that FTT is still listed, there are still lot of exchanges that FTT is still available.",

There's no way that they've shorted and then didn't took their money out where they've shorted that coin. Or, they have probably reinvested it somewhere else where it's more secured and unlikely to close. FTT is near to being a centavo in value and that all means that's close to its death.",

Actually, I think it is, since FTT is a dead token, the exchange should protect their client from buying the token.  Letting it on the exchange will only make more investors to lose money.Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMThey ask you to come on their platform and trade, but when the odds are not in their favour they cut you off... ?! Actually they also lose on this decision.  Since the exchange won't get any trading fee from FTT since they disabled it.Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMI guess there are no market makers willing to risk their finances? It is a common sense, you are also not willing to risk your finances, are you?Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMWhat would happen to those traders who have shorted since say $25??? There are still some exchanges that allow the trading of FTT, they can always move to those exchanges.",

The question is why do you still trade the dead token like FTT, its platform already collapse and bankrupt there's no reason for bybit to let its traders wasting their money on FTT. Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMThey ask you to come on their platform and trade, but when the odds are not in their favour they cut you off... ?! No, it doens't matter a lot. You will always get what you deserve. I meant they ask you but not force you to trade. Please, don't understand it wrongly. There's nothing wrong delisting it. Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMI guess there are no market makers willing to risk their finances? That's why bybit has been deciding to delist FTT from its exchange site. i have no doubt if another exchange site may do the same with it., Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMWhat gwan here?What? Gwan? first time to see that. Quote from: thevoyager23 on November 13, 2022, 08:43:14 PMWhat would happen to those traders who have shorted since say $25??? Those who have been shorting the FTT since it was at the top price might get a compensation or their order will be closed by the exchange site itself. You shall not feel worry with it",
