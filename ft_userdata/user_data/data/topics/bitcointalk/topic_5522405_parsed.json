I am also seeing a lot of governments are already discussing about creating a Bitcoin reserve as well. While such kind of adoptions are generally a good news for Bitcoin because it bring in trust into the system. But too much of Government investment is also not great for the ecosystem itself. I think Bitcoin shines brighter in the hands of the common people. My honest opinion.",

It's also great that they are making distinctions and not just taking a umbrella approach to adopt all cryptos.Quote from: avikz on December 11, 2024, 06:11:10 PMBut too much of Government investment is also not great for the ecosystem itself. I think Bitcoin shines brighter in the hands of the common people. My honest opinion. Only thing is, when you create a free decentralized system for anyone to use you cannot regulate who uses it. Bitcoin shines in the hands of anyone who sees the value of Bitcoin.",

I'm just hoping, little by little the Government of the sub Saharan Africa countries Will key in massively in investing in cryptocurrency especially Bitcoin, instead of remaining aloof and watching other World leaders catching up on the moving train very early.",

This is a sign of growth, and what to expect from this is that other bodies and organizations from the government will also begin to consider Bitcoin as the national fire brigade has done in Kenya. This is an example of acceptance and adoption that is beginning to take place, and it will not just stop in Kenya, it has the potential to spread all through Africa like wildfire.",

Perhaps this could one day inspire the Kenyan government to add some bitcoin to their reserve.Look what happened to countries like El Salvador and Bhutan.

Not for me though, but seeing more people integrating Bitcoin is good news.As for Kenya and their government, maybe this is the first step towards them doing the same as what Bhutan did when they invested millions of Dollars into Bitcoin and now, they're reaping the profits that they got through holding it. Now that this happened already, what would be the next step for them? Will other departments do the same if they see success in the action that this department did? Will the government do the same as well? Or maybe other nearby countries will do the same if this move by the Fire Brigade will show significant results?",

Vancouver Canada just announced that they want to use Bitcoin as a reserve asset, mixing it in with other financial resources to make themselves more known as a Bitcoin friendly city. https://99bitcoins.com/news/vancouver-mayor-ken-sim-announces-plan-to-add-bitcoin-to-citys-balance-sheet/ Even though that is still just a proposal, so it actually hasn't happened yet, but it still a good initiative. I think some countries that have high inflation rates or currency instability, such as Argentina or Turkey, could leverage Bitcoin to hedge against economic instability just like Kenya. They have set a good example for other countries to innovate financially and embracing digital transformation.",

There should be others who hold Bitcoin in small quantities but are yet to make such announcements for several reasons - strict government outlook on Bitcoin. Africa will open to Bitcoin one day, we'd have more conferences about Bitcoin with even government officials in attendance.",

It shows that they are well aware of the newest developments in fintech and is at the forefront of this development. But a project like Fire Brigade? It doesn't even have anything to do with bitcoin really. Bitcoin doesn't fit in to their project however being associated with bitcoin shows that agencies and companies see the true potential and use case of bitcoin. Excited for more projects to announce that they will be investing in bitcoin for the benefit of their project.",

Yeah, but let's put it in a different perspective, let's say that this old and traditional politician might have chance of heart since it's one of the hottest topic as we have seen a lot of countries are now proposing that Bitcoin be in their balance sheet.And that's why some of them doesn't want to be left alone, I mean it doesn't take any effort on them to buy and accumulate and put it in their wallet that they have control. So it's the power of decentralization at works here, everyone, from retail investors to institutions are now government and politicians are into it.",
