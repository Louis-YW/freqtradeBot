The easiest way is to visit https://talkimg.com/ paste the image, upload it and write the link here.",

      "body": "Ok, I gave it a read. Three questions: were \"king ping\" a member of this forum? Because if he isn't here, I am not sure there's much this forum can do. Two, how sure are you that the person DMing you is really him and not an impostor using a similar username to deceive you? That scam practice is quite common. Three, was that an... attempt to bypass a casino betting limitation I just saw? He practically asked you to place a bet for him.Edit: let me save us all some time and upload the case here",

      "body": "I think you just fell for a scammer here as I finished reading through to see for myself. He probably had played you to test but his assumption on the game prediction did not work. If you had known you should have demanded for an escrow services at first to be very sure that the funds as claimed by the scammer are readily available. Only that would guarantee the genuity of the deal. I must say this is a lesson learnt the hard way. Proper verification was not done so as to ascertain the genuity of the scammer at first. If OP had taken his or her time to verify the account holder to knowing how genuine what he is saying is, I believe OP would have noted some lapses and taken proactive measures to protecting him or herself.",

      "body": "So I read the whole conversation and OP just got manipulated into staking fake matches using his own money  Firstly OP made himself a target by showing off how much he has been winning and growing his account. Why didn't he just stick to his strategy?Secondly, the culprit or @SportsKingPing did the same thing that those scammers who sell \"fixed matches\" do to their victims except that in this case OP would have to first stake his money and pay up later In Other words, @SportsKingPing used OP's account balance to bet on any match he wishes. If OP won, he would also win without risking any single cent. How easy is it to manipulate people?",
