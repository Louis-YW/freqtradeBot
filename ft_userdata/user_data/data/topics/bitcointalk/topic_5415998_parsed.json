See them as scam coins and Yobit is shady because of those coins and some other reasons.Big exchanges also list altcoins. Altcoins that are successful are listed on big exchanges. I do not buy new coins or tokens, they are risky.Uncertain price is usualWallet do not have to miss, but scam tokens would be removed from wallet. Shit coins can also become unworthy.Exchanges fees can be low for some coins but they charge extra than transaction fee.",

But the possibility of them becoming scam is very high, once the liquidity is lost, it will become a scam and the exchange will delete it immediately. You can also trade them, but should only be used in the short term, not in the long term, in addition, using unreputable retail exchanges is also quite risky. Exchanges can also scam your money just like coin scams, don't think that exchanges don't have scams.",

Well i think the issues that you have posted are not really that relevant anymore. While it is definitely true that up until 2020 the listing of their token was a huge issue and also a problem in many cases for most teams of a new crypto project, because back in the day there were no real DEXes. So they had to find a centralized exchange that was willing to list their token. In most cases those projects had to pay a listing fee in order to get their token tradeable.Now we have DEXes like Uniswap and Pancakeswap though which means every project can list their token on it's own. The only thing that they need is a little bit of liquidity to pair their token with. So you don't have to use very small and shady centralized exchanges anymore if you want to buy a new token.",

Yes and that's out of hype. Sadly, it didn't end well for me and I just have to bear with the permanent loss that it had me.2. All of the crypto except stable coins are volatile and their prices of them are uncertain especially the newly launched coins because they're most active during their first days.3. Or worst, they're in maintenance for a certain long period of time.4. Yes, if they're ERC20 or BSC tokens it's easy.5. Those that have their mainnet and smart contracts, they can be cashed out/withdrawn.",

      "body": "I think it will depend on each project's team because if they pay more attention to the project, they will try to list the token or coin on the main exchange to generate more interest from traders or investors. Maybe they have plans to register at the small exchange first while finalizing the plans one by one and will provide updates on when they will register at the north exchange. And we can only know by contacting the team, and usually, if they are willing to be open with investors, the project will have a chance to grow in the future.",

Most of the tokens fades away after some time no matter whether its listed on big or small exchange simply due to the hype over and people move to other projects so very few projects remained in the market for very long.Big exchange means hige listing fees as well which can be a reason why even good project is yet to be listed on Binance like exchange but never judge the project potential based on where it is listed, do your own research and if you feel the token can reach more heights then just take your chance.",

Instead of choosing these tokens, we have a much better choice, you should look for tokens that are low cap but already listed on binance and have not had much significant growth yet. Investing in those tokens is also risky but at least they are safer than the tokens on these junk exchanges. In the current market conditions, investing in low cap or new coins is not a wise choice, please consider carefully before investing.",

Some projects after spending all their money to list on big exchange in the beginning will end up delisted as a result of not being able to meet up will the required volume.",

However, i disagree with your statement that all or most of the coins listed on Pancakeswap are scams. In fact, since there is no fee involved in listing on dex (although you need to provide liquidity), both good and bad projects are available on pancakeswap or uniswap. We need to understand and learn about the project before investing in the new coins.",
