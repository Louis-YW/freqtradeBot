  "content": "Quote from: politie.nlMan arrested on suspicion of money laundering of cryptocurrency worth tens of millions of eurosIn the early morning of September 6th 2022, the Dutch police arrested a 39-year-old man from the village of Veenendaal on charges of money laundering of cryptocurrency worth tens of millions of euros. The police identified the man after tracing bitcoin transactions. The funds were  stolen by making use of  a malicious software update purporting to be from  the open source Electrum wallet.Investigation showed that the man converted bitcoin into the privacy coin monero [vice versa], which makes the trail of transactions more difficult to track. His service was provided via the anonymous online network Bisq. It is suspected that the man earned a lot from laundering in this way.When the man was arrested, his home was searched and several data carriers were seized. The police investigation into  the data carriers and the virtual currencies held by the man is ongoing. The expected profit that the man made from money laundering was seized in cryptocurrency by the police. The man was released on Thursday 8th of September and remains a suspect.The investigation is being carried out by the Dutch Police Cybercrimeteam of the Central Netherlands in collaboration with the Cybercrimeteam of the Eastern Netherlands.If this guy \"only\" laundered the money, I expect he earned \"only\" a few percent of the tens of millions of euros. I guess the real malware makers are still far from getting caught.It's a good Dutch police tradition to quickly let criminals go. This guy was held for 2 nights!I couldn't find back the topic about the malicious Electrum \"update popup\", so I choose Press.",

The fact that they were able to trace that guy back and to also identify the actual loophole, the malicious electrum software update, does at least show that authorities are making progress and resources are invested significantly into improving their quantitative as well as qualitative capacities. However, especially when we are talking about cryptocurrencies, I wonder if endeavors by authorities are so nationally limited, or whether it is more likely that they are building cross-border task forces as well. So given that all these incidents had to do with suspects from the Netherlands might not necessarily mean that the Netherland's authorities are better educated and equipped, but that there might have been a network actively communicating on how to exploit issues in a criminal way when it comes to crypto and that authorities succeeded in getting closer to them and are taking them out step by step. Whatever the exact context might be, one would expect someone laundering tens of millions to be extra cautious. Wouldn't it be pretty smart by authorities to offer mixing services themselves? Maybe not officially, but reasons for a house raid could probably always be found after you have the info you need to identify an individual using the service. Who knows, I would think that might already be the case. Establish a mixing service, provide services reliably, then take out one criminal after another until the crypto world gets suspicious and stops using the service. But I assume even that could be a hidden fact for quite some time if done the right way despite having to present evidence at court. https://www.justice.gov/usao-or/pr/alleged-russian-cryptocurrency-money-launderer-extradited-netherlands-united-statesThat guy was also caught in the Netherlands.

Generally, when you use a mixer you need to specify a receiving address. If somehow they uncovered his identity / detected his location, raiding his house and finding data revealing addresses that were used with a mixing service, that would be an important proof against that person. I don't know enough about the case, but the idea that authorities build infrastructure and networks to gather data is quite likely in my opinion.

TL;DR: it's a privacy coin.I do understand the basics and that the receiver doesn't know the sender's address, but the sender (that goes without saying) does of course know the receiver's address. Bottom line is pretty much that mixing Monero doesn't make sense. I don't know if that makes sense, but I thought that maybe there is some service where you send Bitcoin (which the suspect obviously stole through the software) and receives Monero to a specified address in return. That way the suspect could at least end up with Monero without getting shot in an OTC deal (Bitcoin for Monero) on the streets (given the sum is so high). The whole text is a bit weird because why would they only seize the expected profit? In such a situation, wouldn't authorities seize whatever they can at first? On the one hand they say investigation of data carriers is ongoing, on the other hand they say expected profit is seized. How can they calculate \"expected profit\" (which is weird anyway as I said above) while the investigation is still ongoing.

So finally, there is cash involved in money laundering. I'm not saying the sources I quote are more reliable than the police of course. But if it's accurate, apparently the guy is the thief and not a middleman in charge to mix the bitcoins.QuoteBTC THIEF ARRESTED IN THE NETHERLANDSHis identity has not yet been revealed, but the man was arrested last week by Dutch authorities.Released on Tuesday, but still a suspect, the 39-year-old man would have laundered stolen bitcoins in large quantities. Arrested in the province of Utrecht, in Veenendaal, the crook was seized at his home during a search.The police would have seized all the cash found (presumably related to laundering) and the cryptocurrencies they could find.The laundered bitcoins are believed to have been stolen via a fake Electrum wallet. Known for its ease of use, Electrum is very attractive to beginners who want to hold their bitcoins on a wallet that can be used on a computer. It is therefore relatively \"easy\" to create a fake wallet and have it downloaded to victims.The total amount of bitcoins stolen and laundered, has not been disclosed, but the suspect would have gone through Monero to ensure anonymization of his transactions, and then would have transformed back into Bitcoin part of his XMR.The protocol used by Monero allows for confidentiality in the exchanges and above all a rather effective anonymity.The investigators have not yet given any information on the method used to trace the suspect, we will certainly learn more in the coming days.https://journalducoin-com.translate.goog/bitcoin/bitcoin-prison-btc-voles/?_x_tr_sl=fr&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=fr&_x_tr_pto=wappQuoteAccording to police, the suspect had laundered tens of millions of euros and tried to cover his tracks with the help of the private coin Monero (XMR) and the decentralized exchange Bisq.
