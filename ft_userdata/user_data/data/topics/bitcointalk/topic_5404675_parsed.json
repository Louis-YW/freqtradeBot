  "content": "Crypto Health Plus wants to know What are the best practices for a successful Airdrop?Do you do it for a limited time with a limited amount of people that win? (Run 1 month, 1st 100, get 1000 CHP coins?)When do you pay it out at the end or as it is live? (If you ran it for the month of July do you pay it out at end of month, or as the 1-100 win?)How many tasks should you have to complete? (How many task should be completed on your social media channels to win?)I guess the best way to communicate for the winners would be email?Please share your ideas and past best practice experiences to help us build our community driven CHP Coin Drop.Thank you,",
