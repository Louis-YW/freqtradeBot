Don't know why I suddenly decided to donate money to POS foundation but I guess I do at the very least find his writing quite entertaining.Edit: decided to remove as not unique content to book.It's 387 pages, I'd share but prevents me from downloading or printing and I can't be bothered to get around it.",

      "body": "Let's hope this doesn't birth a craze of people writing books about the coins they want to produce and waiting for enough people to buy them before they make the coin or something (it's very niche but I'm not saying it won't happen, nor would a coin well designed and innovative actually do badly if a book was written on it during or before development).Quote from: buwaytress on September 28, 2022, 07:51:17 AMIt's 387 pages, I'd share but prevents me from downloading or printing and I can't be bothered to get around it.It'll be available online soon enough probably considering there are so many book sellers/international publishers, it'll probably end up in a lot of libraries soon.I can't imagine it having new content but it might be concise enough. 350 pages sounds short for a non fiction piece though.",
