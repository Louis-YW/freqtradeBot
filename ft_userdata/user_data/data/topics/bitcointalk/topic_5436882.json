Get the addresses, write them down physically, and verify they're correct. Then you can provide that address to anyone whenever you want to receive Bitcoin, completely offline. Not ideal, I know. For learning Bitcoin, you could try, and get some books first of all. Understand the fundamentals, and proceed with the above method of receiving funds.

This will keep your phone charged 100% every day. Do not let the lack of electricity be the thing stopping you from learning this great innovation called Bitcoin.

I know there's a lot of Chinese brands which have dived into the portable power storage solutions. However, can't really comment on their reliability or their safety. However, this seems a rather extreme measure just for Bitcoin. If it has a use for additional things other than Bitcoin, sure why not. Otherwise, operating offline seems to be the most cost effective solution to me, at least if you're only needing to receive, and not send often. Quote from: serjent05 on January 26, 2023, 10:06:39 PMThis is also good advice he can also buy an extra laptop battery for extended uptime hours.Most laptops can't run for longer than 12 hours so it would probably get you to 24 hours on the lowest power settings. There are laptops which can do more. There's a Panasonic toughbook which claims to reach around 40 hours, but I've personally never been able to replicate their claims. However, I do tend to run more intensive operating systems than they test on.",

Generators produces one of the most poisonous gases that is colourless and odourless but kills without warning.My people have become sick and some have lost thier lives because of generators in my locationMy advice is that since you have already gotten a generator, use it to download books and videos about Bitcoin and study them.
