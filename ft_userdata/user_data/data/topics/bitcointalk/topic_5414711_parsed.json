The domain is not for sale, and according to Whois records, the registry expiry date is in 2029. But the site is funded by the Bitcoin community and they require and ask for donations to keep it going. Are you referring to that?",

Do you really know what you are talking about?. The site is running and I strongly believe  the domain hasn't expired yet and has more time before then. Maybe you just need to do a proper research before making statement.",
