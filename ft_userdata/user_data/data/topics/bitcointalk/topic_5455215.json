      "body": "Hello, Thanks for your message.Exbita has many security features but as I understand, you are worried about us releasing a version for foul play purposes. We have not heard of that kind of source code auditor but if it exists, Exbita source code is unencrypted and you can get it audited in your favorite code auditor. We are an established brand and European company. Most importantly, Exbita has cold storage support so you do not need to hold any more funds than transfer fees in hot wallets. Or you can just use CoinPayments integration which can be enabled to manually approve all transactions from the CoinPayments website so impossible to touch the funds.However, you do not need to have your own exchange if you do not plan to run a serious business. You should consider other costs other than Exbita price especially marketing costs are very high. You need to have a marketing, social media, dev team to run an exchange and invest a good amount of money for promotion. But entrepreneurs around the world may find an opportunity to launch a local exchange for various reasons or even a global one with a different concept.But most of our clients buy it because it is just beautiful.Let me know if you have any more questions.You can also contact us live from the WhatsApp number: +90 535 062 95 81Regards",
