The welcome bonus is 20 units and you need at least 300 units to be able to convert it to real balance with an exchange rate of 1/3. This may reduce the risks of abusing the bonus but am afraid it will not stop it completely especially that there is no wagering requirements or anything like that!On all games there is a provably fair button which let you verify the results but it doesn't explain how the pf system works and the explanation on the FAQ page is also not clear.

I don't think like you are, maybe because xyz domain is still new than .com or other, they can easily use a unique name like casino. and of course is cheaper.It is not being a webmaster, or being indexed in google or any search engine. Any website can be indexed as long it follows the search engine's criteria of indexing but not all (.xyz domains) can have higher search engine results mostly .com and other known extension are prioritized.Any website can be expensive as long it is a premium domain name, like casino.xyz or any shorter domain names. Anyone that created and managed a website can be called a webmaster too.And people knows most scammers use cheaper/unknown domain extensions that's why i said its suspicious using this kind of extension. Don't get me wrong, i'm not saying that the site is scam or what any business can be scam later on.I'm talking about being a business, professionalism and it's branding. Well, anyway, as if i or we can do about it since it's already there. I'm sure you will spend more marketing funds due this kind of extension too. Good luck.",

But minimum deposit is 20 usd, so you need to do minimum one valid deposit. We told you many times before and after you try to make request for 20 usd deposit and deposit just 1 usd. This will not gonna work.Also please don't try to blackmail our agents in chat they can't proccess your withdrawal manual. You need to request it by system. At the moment you can't because you don't have valid deposit. When you make valid deposit you can make withdraw request!Regards!",

You have started to build your casino business so we wish you the best for your customers.I suggest you add other gambling games later because I see it's rare for a casino to thrive by only having the classic types of gambling you have. Maybe you can try contacting gambling providers such as Pragmatic Play, Play N Go, NoLimit and others. But if your site requires a license before it can work with those gambling providers, there may be other solutions.I see you have many different types of coins, which is a good thing to start with. Good luck and keep the spirit in building your site.",
