  "content": "This out-of-row round was made possible thanks to Minerjones's initiative, as he, out of the kindness of his soul, offered to raffle his custom cold wallet among other forum collectors. Good luck!I will announce the block number when we are full.Your forum account must be registered no later than September 1 of the current year.Please, if you already have a custom wallet, give way to others.We may, at our discretion, ignore applies (including inactive posters, etc).How this will work:Choose a number between 00 - 99 (no random)Can take two slots if you have ever traded with Minerjones.After I choose a block, the last symbol of the hash will determine the winner.00 - shasan01 - willi997402 - Crytocanuk03 - Sunny04 - Crytocanuk05 - Woodie06 - sam0007 - Thiago00708 - Thiago00709 - libert1910 - YodasRedRocket11 - Steeley12 - Steeley13 - 2stout14 - GazetaBitcoin15 - PeakDK16 - Soonandwaite17 - bitcoinbass18 - hopenotlate19 - Krogoth20 - Sunny21 - Remsjack22 - shasan23 - bitbollo24 - julerz1225 - Altryist26 - BTCOVERFIATS27 - Becassine28 - NeuroticFish29 - F2b30 - ajiz13831 - Darker4532 - nara189233 - 2stout34 - Darker4535 - Dcarter36 - montreal137 - montreal138 - HedgeFx39 - AHOYBRAUSE40 - rat03gopoh41 - tweetious42 - tweetious43 - m201744 - cygan45 - bitbollo46 - crwth47 - Asuspawer0948 - Koal-8449 - crwth50 - John Abraham51 - Ratimov52 - naira53 - coupable54 - $crypto$55 - Kryptowerk56 - Kryptowerk57 - BTCOVERFIATS58 - mv198659 - Mojo60 - bestcoin_5961 - tranthidung62 - Danydee63 - CLS6364 - HeRetiK65 - Amax1666 - holydarkness67 - darxiaomi68 - owlcatz69 - owlcatz70 - Markzellers71 - Timelord206772 - Ryu_Ar173 - Dernoste74 - willi997475 - Timelord206776 - MoparMiningLLC77 - cygan78 - Mojo79 - salad daging80 - YodasRedRocket81 - CoinageMint82 - Dernoste83 - haloxon84 - haloxon85 - Markzellers86 - summonerrk87 - Asuspawer0988 - Buchi-8889 - Mbitr90 - Mbitr91 - tranthidung92 - JanEmil93 - JanEmil94 - Bullion-n-BTC95 - PMICT96 - PMICT97 - Doblezero98 - Real-Duke99 - pawel7777Please note that this item will ship in April. ðŸ¦Š",
