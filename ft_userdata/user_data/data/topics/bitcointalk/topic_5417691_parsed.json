It will probably still take us around 12 to 18 months to get all of our ducks in a row, get everything in place. But I don't think that this has to happen in a big bang. I think we can start to have some KYC rules. We can start to license exchanges,\" Naidoo said.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/13/south-african-central-bank-reverses-course-on-crypto-regulation/",

It can be offered by financial service providers, whether they are domestic or international firms, that are licensed in South Africa. Registration can be “an onerous procedure,” according to the local press.",

Regulations of cryptocurrency, of course, involves some give and take process all because this is an act by the government to be making something legal but at the same time there are going to be processes in place as a compromise. As for me, we don't have the choice because individually we can never obliterate the power of the state to impose legal procedures and requirements...however am sure there can be some platforms that can still be serving the people without the need for KYC and AML procedures so there remains to be some choices available. In addition, though there is no specific reference for Bitcoin in the said ACT above, the term used is cryptocurrency...and is Bitcoin not cryptocurrency?",

For any government considering volatile asset like crypto as legal one to trade through their notices is always challenging. One mistake and people can start its misuse and when it comes to jurisdiction they can have way out through their misleading acts. Let us not go hard on them since they are trying to accept it with most viable way possible and putting the amendments as and when required for use of crypto currencies. If it becomes casual over the period of time then people will enjoy it and world will keep motivated.",

At least the government of South Africa has recognized the importance of Bitcoin and others which is why it has to amend its existing law to give them legal backing. Although they might have some unpleasant intentions such as taxation, disrespect for privacy, and others nevertheless the news is a good one. With this legal recognition and backing companies or individuals can now use bitcoin as securities to access loans, and mortgage funds, and enjoy other financial privileges because it is no longer a legal alien.",
