There is one legit accelerator that will actually confirm your tx and not just rebroadcast, and that it is ViaBTC!But on a simulation for your tx they ask for $130 so, looking at your $190 worth of BTC tx, I doubt it is worth it.So, the usual question,are you in control of any of those wallets, or are they custodial wallets? Once we know how that looks we can think of what other options you have, that is if you have any!",

Quote from: Kelbacho on September 17, 2023, 05:19:44 AM someone else said nothing can really be done because it is only a segwit transaction so al i can really do is wait idk how true that is either.That is not true, you cannot do anything because you’re using a wallet that doesn’t support any bitcoin bumping feature, it is not because you’re using segwit address or receiving on legacy address that is the problem. But the sending and receiving wallet are the problem. In the future try to use a wallet that supports bitcoin bumping to avoid cases like this.",

One is if the wallet or sender doesn’t continually rebroadcast the transaction, but if they do then it will certainly take more time. Secondly is since node’s mempools receives transaction in different Time it will also take different Time to drop it and also the size of the pools are different and as such some will keep it beyond that time",

The transaction is 3 weeks old.If the sender is not using the wallet that keeps on rebroadcasting transaction, he ought to have been able to rebroadcast the coin. Secondly, the purging fee rate is more than the fee rate used to broadcast the transaction, which also means that the sender would have been able to rebroadcast the coin. If the sender import his seed phrase or private on wallet like Electrum, he would have been able to rebroadcast the coin.The transaction also has change (UTXO sent to the change address), he can use coin control to spend the change using high fee that is enough to confirm two transactions. (he fee for the new transaction and the one that will be added to the old transaction in a way that two transactions can be confirmed at once).Quote from: Kelbacho on September 17, 2023, 05:19:44 AMUnfortunately im not and someone else said nothing can really be done because it is only a segwit transaction so al i can really do is wait idk how true that is either. Im the receiver but it is on my cashapp walletThis has nothing to do with the address type used. It is worth knowing that segwit is better in making low fee transaction. Supposing you used legacy address, you will not be able to save fee. Segwit is also cheaper than nested segwit.",

Im the receiver but it is on my cashapp walletI believe the transaction can be rebroadcast indefinitely, and it may never get confirmed. Contact the sender and asking if they can bump-up the fee. If that's not an option, there's not much else you can do, especially if you don't have control over the recipient's wallet. There are services that can include the transaction in their mining pool, regardless of the fee, but it usually comes at a significant cost.",

Secondly is since node’s mempools receives transaction in different Time it will also take different Time to drop it and also the size of the pools are different and as such some will keep it beyond that timeEvery node which is connected to the network will receive the transaction within, at most, a minute or two of each other, so this will make no difference to OP.As Charles-Tim has pointed out, the transaction is already older than the default expiry time, and pays a fee lower than the default purge limit. All default nodes will have dropped it already. And yet, we can still see it on almost any block explorer that you check. There are more and more nodes running with much larger limits than the default, so you can no longer rely on transactions being dropped at all.Instead, given that full RBF is now commonplace, the sender of this transaction could easily replace it with a higher fee paying transaction, even though it is not opted in to RBF.The legacy output address belongs to the exchange CoinSpot, so I assume they are the ones who sent the transaction. The only thing OP can do is contact them and request they replace the transaction.",

This is why they will likely show you transactions as unconfirmed even if they've been dropped from the majority of the nodes.I imported OP's address into Electrum (watch-only) and tryed different servers (about 10 servers). Only one of them has the transaction in its mempool and showed the transaction as unconfirmed. The status changed to local when connecting to other servers.",

Binance offers transaction acceleration service to VIP users and regular users via Telegram.

By the way, maybe ask if there are some Binance VIP users who can check your transaction on this page https://pool.binance.com/en/acceleration because I think there is a chance, they may do it with discount for high VIP users. Or if $80 is okay for you and don't mind, then contact them via telegram @BinancePoolAccelerator",
