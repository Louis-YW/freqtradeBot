You may separate it from coins you received from centralized no KYC exchanges but be expecting KYC at anytime. Also have a separate wallet for coins you received from people that send you coins through decentralized exchanges. But making sure you enable Tor or using the one with in-built Tor.",

      "body": "Generally good (actually with point 1, great) practice:- Run your own Bitcoin node on another (privacy-focused) server configured with Tor, which you can then connect with other non-custodial clients like Electrum.- Avoid centralized services where possible and if you do use them, be mindful that your identity may be exposed to other inputs (if this is a concern)- Use a new address for each transaction to avoid unnecessarily relinquishing your privacy.A new address for each transaction should be enough if you use your own node and follow these practices, among other privacy practices outside of blockchain privacy. However, you can take it a step further and make new wallets for different purposes if you find it easier to manage this way. Whether it will increase your privacy or not is arguable if you are already taking the steps to following good/great practice.If you can't follow step 1, I would say that new wallets may potentially have a privacy benefit. I'm not too sure a it would have quite a few variables that are again, outside of just blockchain privacy...though it would serve well for the purpose you stated (ensuring the inputs are kept separate by using different wallets for kyc/no-kyc).",

If you are using multiple KYC exchanges,  you can use an address because it doesn't make any difference.

However, this is only worth doing if you have a fairly large amount of Bitcoin. If the amount of Bitcoin you have does not exceed your weekly income, then it is probably not worth bothering with a large number of wallets. It's just extra work. If the amount is at least equal to or greater than monthly income, and even more so equal to or greater than 1 year’s income, then of course it makes sense to have many wallets. For exchanges with CUS, it is enough to have one wallet, for all others you can have at least 10 or 20. This way you reduce your chances of loss or compromise.",

Unless you have a purpose for differentiating them, for example wanting to differentiate transactions or increase your privacy, then it is a good idea to differentiate your wallets.

QuoteIn order not to mix the coins?You must use Coin control feature to spend specific UTXOs but the best option is use different wallets for different purposes. Because it is not harmful to do this but it's useful. You don't have to spend any more things to create new wallets to use so if this simple and free practice can help to more easily control your coins from different sources like different exchanges (KYC, no KYC, mixers, salary from different jobs), you should do this.With Bitcoin, you only need to have bitcoin in your wallet for transaction fee. It's different than tokens because you have tokens in a wallet but will need native currency of that blockchain pay transaction fee, like ERC20 token will need ETH to pay transaction fee and if you have many wallets, you will need to have ETH in those wallets for transaction fee.",

They'll have no idear address_3...address_10 also belong to this wallet.Things do get a bit more complicated if you look at change addresses, those have to be labelled to... Otherwise you'll spend change from a transaction with inputs to a different address, and they'll know those addresses belong together to.Walletexplorer also searches publicly available owner info, that's how they know wallets from big exchangesCase in point: this is an address of mine that's publicly known: bc1q50udcgfdyqanp56m9dkcqkxy5fayjc74vw9px7Walletexplorer was able to deduct this wallet contains at least 5 addresses: https://www.walletexplorer.com/wallet/60911730d7ab735d/addressesIn reality, this is a wallet i've been using since 2019, currently i'm at address 125, and change address 72. So my wallet contains 197 addresses that were, at least at one point in time, funded. Walletexplorer has been able to group those addresses together whenever i created transactions using inputs funding more than one address. So they created groups of ~1-~5  addresses, whilst having no clue my wallet actually derived ~200 addresses (so far)",
