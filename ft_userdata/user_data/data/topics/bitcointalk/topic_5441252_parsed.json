Some persons smoke cigarettes indiscriminately without considering the environmental consequences or the harm it cause to the next person. I was in a meeting and the chairman of the council smoked up to three sticks of cigarettes and I was almost suffocating but I couldn't complain because others kept silent. The next meeting he wanted to do the same thing and I told him to step outside and smoke his cigarettes which he gladly did.My country is a dumping ground for outdated cars and electronic devices that pollutes the environment. Most fumes produced by these old model and unserviced vehicles is having negative effect on the environment. Instable power supply has also led to an increase in the use of generators, thereby harming the environment.These environmental pollutants have contributed to increase in health issues like cancer, respiratory problems, heart infection and child mortality rate. I wish to relocate to a more environmentally friendly country.",

What kind of positive effect does an unkept environment or we are just being sarcastic: But then if we can give it a scientific analysis of the danger of an unkept environment we will discover that the need to establish a political institution to deal with environmental pollution at the national and global level can not be over-emphasized at the moment. There is a need to develop a scientific mechanism that will allow for the easy conversion of this waste into other profitable products. The above-mentioned and bolded reason is the only positive use of waste materials and other human pollution activities that affect the environment, but then there is other pollution that is totally waste, take oil exploration and it resultant environmental polluting in some palaces around the world where crude oil is drilled.",
