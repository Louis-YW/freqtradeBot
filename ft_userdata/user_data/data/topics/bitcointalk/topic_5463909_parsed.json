  "content": "Sorry to bring this over here, I have a little challenge with my transaction for that past 6 days now and has never confirmed to the next wallet.Actually I made the transfer using my trustwallet and the payment seems not to be confirmed since them till now and I want to know what is possible to do to confirm my payment.From a post I was replied days ago, I was told to import my trustwallet to the Electrum wallet and I did that currently transaction still showing pending. I was thinking if I import my wallet to electrum wallet there is an option to boost my transaction and now I am stock on the way and I don't know what to do currently. Here the screenshot of what I mean.. But what gets me worried is that my balance still remains zero (0) while the transaction is pending, Is there anything to do currently to speeding up the transaction?https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/d5f80b303486f616dc02df5413520b43543b725246161c520816e51aa1f4ebf3I will be glad any help gotten you all.",

My question is do you still see the balance on your trustwallet since the the electrum doesn’t have it. If yes go and double spend the transaction again that is send out the transaction again but this time the fee should be something like 10sats/vbyteQuote from: SmartGold01 on August 20, 2023, 12:14:30 PMHow do I enable RBF? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449436.msg62140176#msg62140176",

An hour ago, your transaction was purged from nodes with default mempool size configuration.That's the best timing when you can replace it with a higher fee rate transaction.If you're lucky, time it when the purging fee rate is higher than your txn's fee rate when your transaction was dropped from majority of the mempools including some Electrum servers.You can check the default \"Purging\" fee rate in mempool.space.When that time comes:Restart Electrum and check if the transaction's status changed from \"unconfirmed\" into \"Local\"; if not, select another server.Then after turning into \"local\", Right-click on it and select \"Remove\", then your coins should be available to spend on a new transaction.",

Trustwallet is close-source and it lacks RBF and many other features. I recommend you to avoid it and use a better wallet like electrum, so that you don't have a similar problem in the future. Quote from: SmartGold01 on August 20, 2023, 12:51:43 PMExactly.. The option has been removed I can't find it since the other user posted the image..That option has been removed, because electrum no longer allows you to make non-RBF transactions and it flags all transactions as RBF automatically.

It's also possible that a transaction is dropped from the mempool earlier due to the node reaching its mempool maximum size.As you made your transaction 6 days ago, most nodes should drop it from their mempool 8 days later. This is assuming no one will rebroadcast your transaction.",
