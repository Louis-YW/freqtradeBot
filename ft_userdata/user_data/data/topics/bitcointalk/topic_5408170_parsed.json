Topics can also be archived by mods for similar reasons (so the op doesn't get a notification their post has been deleted and gets discouraged from making posts) - this is VERY selective and changes from mod to mod quite dramatically though.Sometimes threads are deleted if there are duplicate topics, if the topics encourage spam/low quality posts or any other rules are broken.",

For example, in my local board we’d also include Meta based topics and Politics & Society, type discussions, due to the lack of a mirrored structure to fit them in (meaning that off-topic is boarder in content there than on the English language main board).",

Topics are deleted when they are of low quality and do not contribute to the discussion on the forum (for instance, the question has already been asked many times), while they are moved from another topic to an off-topic if there is no appropriate board to which they belong. I think it is the discretion of the moderators which measure to apply.",

Off topic, for me, is for discussions that are far off from Bitcoin or crypto discussions but can be of benefit to those who are also interested in cryptos. I like to call it the, \"Relaxation\" board. It's for cruise. Sometimes, marital issues, sex, parenting, religion, siblings rivalry, schooling, cooking, kitchen and bedroom incidents, just name them, come up here. Can we truly say issues on those items listed are useless? Of course, not. Off-topic is even a place to start for genuine newbies who are lost here because it helps them pick interest posting here as they can easily identify with one or two topics to write on while perusing other sections of the forum.",

I was so much curious why it was off topic. So, I decided to visit the off topic board to see what off topic looks like. There I understood that people even willingly go to off topic board and create topics and people also go there to reply them.If you want to discuss your country's cultural heritage;You want to discuss relationship;You want to discuss folk tales and some related topics, off topic is a place you can find it.In other words off topic means that you created a topic which doesn't have a board yet.",
