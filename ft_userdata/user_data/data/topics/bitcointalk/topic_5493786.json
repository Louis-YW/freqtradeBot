They went as high as 1500 sats/byte and now they are sitting at 200 sats.

When the fees come down to what they were before, we will check back then if the difficulty gets reduced. But right now nothing is happening.",

Sure, why care unless you're actually using bitcoin, right?  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, nor does all of this celebration of the last halving (or any of the previous ones) in hopes of a price increase leading bitcoin to the next ATH.  Nobody seems to have bothered to mention any of the potential negative effects, which I assume could be higher transaction fees and the resulting longer confirmation times for those who don't want to pay $100 to send $5.  Or am I way off the mark on that?And yes, if some miners dropped out of the game because it's become less profitable the difficulty will drop, but in order to reach an equilibrium (so to speak), wouldn't there necessarily have to be some kind of lag time involved while more hashing power comes on board, i.e., other miners/more rigs step into the breach to take advantage of that lower difficulty?Man, I never really questioned the effects of a halving until this recent one and didn't realize how in the dark I am about mining dynamics.  I've been interested in bitcoin for years, and it's as though I still haven't looked at what's under the hood.  Quote from: Poker Player on April 23, 2024, 04:19:03 AMFunny that the OP should ask this now when the miners have been making a killing since halving, with people paying whole bitcoins to sent a few satoshis with images into the blockchain. Ha ha.  Miners got lucky because of those idiots whales with more money than brains, but obviously that won't/didn't go on for long.  Now I'm just curious to see what the effect of the halving is going to be in the longer term on fees and such.  Maybe there won't be any change--but what would happen if bitcoin shot straight up to $100k or more as a lot of people were hoping?  What would a typical network fee (in USD terms) be in that case?",

It was forgotten or ignored by many people who shill Bitcoin.If they believe Bitcoin will make new all time high after halving, no matter how many days or months after the halving, they must note a fact that, with higher price of Bitcoin, Bitcoin users will have to pay higher transaction fees.Even with same fee rate used for transactions, transaction fees will become higher and more expensive. Bitcoin users pay transaction fee in bitcoins, not in $ but it can not deny a fact that $ value of transaction fee paid in bitcoin will be bigger and more expensive than before the halving, if price increases more.",

Mining may have become less profitable so not just anyone can mine bitcoin today because it requires serious cash in order for it to be successful which we all know. After the halving this congestion issues started which means the network has not been fully decentralized these days and it is as a result of many miners shutting down in the business.",

I think this is not a good time to shut down Bitcoin miners, the ATH is not very far away anymore and this reason is good enough for my Bitcoin miners to keep mining, they should know better. Unless the miners can't even keep up with the electricity bill, I guess they are the ones that need to shut down their machines, such Bitcoin miners will need to change their location or stop being miners for good. Let's not forget that new Bitcoin miners will come too, to keep the balance between power consumption and mining reward, right now I believe that Antminer S21 pro is the top one, soon we can start seeing S22 and others with higher hashrate and less power consumption.",
