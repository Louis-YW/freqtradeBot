  "content": "This does exist via several plugins but it is all centralized meaning the provider of the plugin would setup a service where they collect the USDT charge a % lowest I found was 0.28% per transaction and then keep it on their wallet till you request a withdrawal. Which kind of beats the purpose of decentralization. Only thing I found out which allows own wallet connection is BTCPayserver using their free host provider sites to propogate transaction and auto deposit the amount to your electrum wallet. The problem being electrum does not have USDT acceptance, while besides this BTCPayserver accepts connection of Cobo valult, Coldcard, Wasabi, Specter desktop, Passport not sure if any of these wallets are similiar to electrum which runs on your laptop but can accept USDT deposits??I also saw another thread about omniwallet & coinomi but not sure if they support automated checkout with verification if coins recieved and mark order as completed once it verifies on wordpress website? Also not sure if they have any intermidiary charges and centralization as the other services I described earlier?",

You can only connect your bitcoin wallet.Quote from: NwWork on January 15, 2023, 08:49:10 AMI also saw another thread about omniwallet & coinomi but not sure if they support automated checkout with verification if coins recieved and mark order as completed once it verifies on wordpress website? Also not sure if they have any intermidiary charges and centralization as the other services I described earlier?They don't. Omniwallet and Coinomi are wallets and not payment processors.I suggest you check Coinbase Commerce. It has a WooCommerce plugin[1], they have a self-managed solution, and accept BTC as well as stablecoins but the fee is a bit high compared to what you found (1%).[1] https://www.coinbase.com/commerce/integrations/woocommerce",

Why not simply accept Bitcoin payments and later convert them to stablecoin if that is your preference?",

      "body": "This is what is currently being done accepting BTC and making it to USDT, problem is high network fee around 0.0002BTC and high withdrawal limit on exchanges such as 0.001BTC which makes microtransactions hard for customers to do and BTC fluctuates way too much thus hard for customers since they would need to pay more in fiat to reach the withdrawal limit also. Plus price volitility is there when holding BTC for services we provide thus we also prefer keeping in USDT and not after capital gain",

I haven't tried them so far I have no interest. DYOR  coinremitter seems to be using a wallet generation api to generate wallets under their backend in website and then handing them out to customers to recieve payments and then enabling them to login in to their website and withdraw to outside wallets so not exactly non-custodial and not even automated settlement to your own wallet. Also need a pro membership to get USDT as follows;Tether USD ERC20 PRO   USDTERC20   WithGas Station10 WithoutGas Station200.23%Nowpayments seems more legit but no exact usdt clauses or if it is actually available on collection and settlement but it seems they also doing same thing on backend(centralized) and then finally can withdraw out to your wallet Transaction fee: 0.5 percentFiat withdrawal fee: 2.3-1.5%**depends on your transaction volume sending to SEPA banks as EU which is a good feature",

      "body": "I think using BTCPayserver could be a good option for you since it allows you to connect your own wallet and has free hosting providers. It's unfortunate that Electrum doesn't accept USDT, but perhaps there's another wallet option that could work for you.As for the other options you mentioned, like Omniwallet and Coinomi, I'm not entirely sure if they support automated checkout with verification or if they have any intermediary charges. It may be worth looking into further or reaching out to their support teams to ask for more information.So, I suggest doing some more research and reaching out to the support teams of the different options you're considering to see which one best fits your needs. I hope you're able to find a solution that works for you and allows you to accept USDT payments in a decentralized and cost-effective way.",

BTCPay Server is designed for Bitcoin payments, and if you're looking for a solution to accept USDT, you may need to explore other options. As suggested, could accept Bitcoin payments and later convert them to a stablecoin if necessary. Alternatively, you could research and find a solution specifically designed for accepting USDT payments while still maintaining decentralization and avoiding intermediary charges.",
