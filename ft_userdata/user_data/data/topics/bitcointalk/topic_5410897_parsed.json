I'll pick ethereum, bnb, ada, and a few other coins for the rest of the coins and hold them until the altcoin season returns.By investing in bitcoin, say as much as $15k, I will have the opportunity to make a big profit because with $15k, I can earn around 0.4 btc or more. And when the bitcoin price starts to rally again, I will make a profit of over $15k.",

Plus, the parameters like their community, purpose, and the tech behind the project is what sets these coins to survive in the long haul, which is in retrospect fits long tern investing.That's just me though.

If you have other resources, you can invest the $30k in long term. If it is a long term investment, I would pick Bitcoin and Ethereum. If you want to diversify more, BNB.It should be 2 years or longer because investment in bear market will bring short term loss.",

No need for meme coins, the risk is too high for now. Maybe BNB could be a good investment as well.

If I pick one more, I choose KCS. They are tokens of Binance, FTX and Kucoin exchanges. I don't trust other top altcoin projects.Polkadot, Solana, Near, I don't trust them. Cryptocurrency, blockchain and crypto market will be here so crypto exchanges will be here. It is safe and have less risk than other altcoins.",

You should DYOR on the best token/coin to invest rather than ask random guy opinion for your money. Just focus on huge caps token and avoid meme coin/hype project without any real use case. I suggest that you should pursue your research on blockchain project because that’s the best token to put your money in long term because they are the only project that has a potential to go long term no matter what will be the trend in crypto. All trend in crypto always happened inside the blockchain. You will not be left out if there’s new trend arise because that will surely available on all blockchain.",

Blockchain protocol2. Defi3. NFT (P2E)I think that focusing with blockchain protocol and defi was also very good choice as well. It's caused by blockchain protocol will always be used no matter what happened with the market and people will never leave it. You can spread your money in all of those categories. Im sure that would be very benefit for you as long as you can pick the right project",

So if you are capable of taking high risks and also want high profits, then you can go for altcoins. Else if you want slow yet steady profits, then BTC and ETH are the perfect choice.If you want to gamble with your money in trading, then I would suggest you try your luck with Shiba Inu, I know this is not the best suggestion you have got so far, but yes if you take risks, then only you will get profit.Don’t forget to have a look on BNB and Ripple. At last wishing you all the best for your trading journey.",

Wouldn't that be too risky? I have the courage to interact with stablecoins only to quickly and quickly convert crypto to stablecoins and back to crypto. The latest events related to stablecoins are still fresh in my memory and, moreover, I don't trust any of the currently existing stablecoins. $30k portfolio I would distribute between btc and eth, rather in a ratio of 3 to 1, and 10-20% may be used to buy very risky assets. But this is not investment advice, but only my hypothetical reasoning.",

And you should not try investing in new projects first, because the risk is too big, you can lose your entire capital. Because investing in new projects requires good research and analysis skills, so you know when to buy and sell coins. But I suggest you don't use your entire $30k capital at once, because crypto market movements are very volatile and difficult to predict. So the maximum profit will be generated if you buy crypto gradually, meaning that every time the crypto price drops you can buy it. Then don't stop to learn about the crypto world, because it is very important that you know how the crypto world works. So you understand what you are buying with the money you have, let alone your capital is very large for a newbie, so you have to invest in the right coins.",
