I will also like to know the use case for this token, I just finished looking through the website, I can't find any information on this, to me, it seems this project can run itself if they are able to attracts users to the platform without need for tokens",

It's just an article talking about Flash Technologies, but it says nothing about a partnership with BinanceAnyone can read it here - cSo again, how are you Binance partners?I guess by choosing BSC to build on. But BCS isn't Binance so they are not partners. It would be similar to saying that i am building an eth wallet so i am partnering with Vitalik. It would make as much sense. Or that i am building a wallet especially for reddit nfts so i am partnering with reddit.Getting into binance feed doesn't really mean anything either.

Binance once announced that they claim priority to announce anything related to them and anyone who breaks this law is automatically banned and all conversations with them are terminated.",

      "body": "I am not sure if this will get any better, I have seen plenty of projects partnering with binance before and they didn't do all that well. Just because there is a stamp of approval from binance doesn't mean that it will do well, there is going to be something that will make sense.I get it, it's not really that weird and I understand that there will be something that makes it look like it's going to be something to care about but that doesn't change anything, it literally means that they are just liked by some guy at binance that's it. This is why it's smarter to end up with being careful with these. Sure it's not that terrible because it at least passes some tests, but it doesn't guarantee any type of profit at all neither.",
