      "body": "Is trading on Binance different from trading on other exchanges? Or is the derivative trading on Binance different from those on other exchanges? Then why only Binance? Or a means to know someone's account by knowing the person's UID on Binance.If no good reason given, I will not recommend this, irrespective of the the exchange you use, if the market favoured your position opened, you will gain, but if not, loss occur.I do not also like this kind of setup that what is called a free signal will turn to a means newbies would be attracted to join the paid one if they join discord or whatever you want then to join.Paid signals are scam.There is nothing better than learning how to trade.",

      "body": "The signals only come on coins listed on Binance so I mentioned it simply because I don't want to ruin someones expectations after they get in and they realise that they cant enter some of them. You're free to use any exchange as long as u don't mind that there are odds u won't be able to enter every signal.Saying paid signals are scam is arguable, I disagree, depends what trading group you're in, I have some experiences with many of them and I was lucky to be in really good ones.The fact that I offer you combination of what these two groups used before, as I said I am giving you everything and I'm willing to help you start, this is not the ''4x your investment in first month for free'' type of service, I agree with your logic that you don't recommend this, I wouldn't either if I couldn't know more, etc. , but only because it would cost me money, groups like this cost 400$ per months, I'm offering it for free, that's why you have nothing to lose.",

      "body": "You said nothing to lose, but how is it true? We will be lost our funds if the signal fails. But still, you will be the gainer by referral commission. I used paid signal once time, what is noticed, they give a signal to paid group first, and after a few minutes, they share it, with the public group. So usually few more people buy and the price go small up. But dumped again instantly that's how I lost funds. The paid group creates a syndicate where they share signals. They take profits from every trade, but all traders can't. My question is who is responsible in case of a failed signal? Who will carry the loss if traders lose funds due to a fail signal?",

      "body": "This was meant that you have nothing to lose by just trying, once again, those signals are free, I am not responsible if you either don't follow risk management or the strategy, etc.And just like any smart person, if you ever start doing this and you enter a trading group, you start with small capital, I always started with 10 dollars, if it did well, I tried more.If you would rather pay 400 dollars for 6 months or less then do so, if trying my signals and using 10 dollars is too risky for you or you're scared of losing that then simply don't, think it's pretty obvious that money is at risk everytime no matter what form of investment you do.This is also simply me giving signals, I am not sending signals to public groups etc.And yes some groups are super a** and they might do nothing, but with my luck and experience so far I always managed to get into profit after paying.If it makes u feel better then the first rule of all this is to start with small capital and test for urself how it all works with the risk management and strategy, then decide if you want to continue or not, I could charge hundreds of dollars for this yet I don't so saying that there is nothing to lose was clearly meant to try it with small money I didn't expect that u will want me to say stuff like ''this is not a financial advice,70% of the investors over the globe end up in loss at some point, please use money that ure willing to lose''.If you don't know that already then you shouldn't be investing in the first place.",

      "body": "From what I could understand, we don't need to pay for any kind of service, the signals are free, just use your reference code in Futures.I believe those with good risk management will not invest more than they can eventually lose. I say this because I read some questions about guarantees, in this case, I don't believe it is necessary. Anyone who wants to try should try, but be aware of the risks involved in any financial market.",
