Suffering nations are under the demerit of economy power, many nations have no structures on the frontier pictures of what the country should expect or experience. Picture this:- Countries like El Salvador adopt Bitcoin and start using its natural resources to assist securing Bitcoin with Proof of Work - More countries follow suit as they see El Salvador escaping the economic control of developed nations by using Bitcoin- Unwise developed nations ban Bitcoin and try everything in their power to protect their precious fiat monetary system with things such as CBDCs- The monetary system floods with supply more than ever as printing money is now as simple as \"minting\" new supply digitally.- All fiat money devalues at a disastrous (for them) speed due to hyper-inflation, while Bitcoin benefits from its demise (as originally intended).- The world then very quickly starts to turn upside down...- Undeveloped countries now have resources unlike ever before paired with the ability to grow without the previous economic shackles- Developed countries fall into an abysmal state, separating the wise from the unwise, and leaving the people to figure out how to solve its mess....if the state does attempt to establish tyrant-like/totalitarian-level control first....Just a theoretical thought based on your very vague post",

Every country really needs economic strength and supporting infrastructure, the economy is needed as a country improvement and has important elements to maintain its continuity, if a country has a level of economic weakness, then it will not look strong in the eyes of the world. For example, the US, China, Germany and the UK are countries that have strong economic power, so they are respected by many countries, although there are other supporting factors that also influence it, economic resources are the main strength for the country.Several programs have begun to be improved by several countries, infrastructure, the industrial and technology sectors are the most interested at the moment, the country will look strong when the source of income is stable and is not influenced by debt from outsiders in making purchases and any cooperation.",

      "body": "Every nation has its pros and cons depending on what they have as resources and what they produce but in this context some countries are well poised than others. The former have become rich bases on that trade. Raw materials and final products have been the staples for years and I don't see it change in future.Even though governments attempt to move this a positive reaction there have been little improvement over the years and some countries remain poor.Don't let this dishearten you. We cannot change this overnight. I also don't see much use of crypto here.",
