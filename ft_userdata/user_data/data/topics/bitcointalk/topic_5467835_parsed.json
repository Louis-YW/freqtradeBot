Still trying to bear the pains I would love to know the reason for my banned. No one is above mistake so perhaps I have gone contrary to the rules and regulations of the forum and ill love to what that is.",

I don't know if this was done on purpose or if it was a forgetful mistake.This part of the forum rules is almost always what reminds newbies, and if you are the type who appears to be a quick learner, how come you are not aware of this? Copying others work without giving credit to the original author is stealing, and the forum is highly against that.I hope this was just a one time mistake or do you have other threads which was also created base on copied information and you forget to drop a source link.",

They have to write posts for the subscription campaign, so they will write you the same thing about how bad it is to plagiarize and blablabla.",

I have been trying to find out what i did wrong that got my account banned from the forum. This is serious cant believe I had made such a horrible mistake here, i should have shared the link to the source i got the information. You can check my post history again I have never copied someone's post before i am very sorry for not paying attention to the post i made. Sincerely i taught i added the source link not knowing i did not. I have no idea what transpired that day, but I never intended to pass off someone else's content as my own. I am pleading that the moderators should look into my account and see that i have been organic and have made good contributions to the forum.",

      "body": "As shared by Cantasy, the reason for your ban is plagiarism. To be honest, I’m surprised you got banned after one plagiarism report. Moderators are more lenient with newbies and sometimes they just delete the reported post instead of banning the account after one report. Unfortunately for you, your account wasn’t given that grace. Plagiarism is a serious issue here, even newbies make threads about plagiarism so it’s hard to use ignorance as a defense. In your case, you do not deny having copied the post, you claim to have forgotten to include the reference in your post. While that can happen, I doubt if you can gather enough support from the community to plead your case.",

I am pleading that the moderators should look into my account and see that i have been organic and have made good contributions to the forum.Now we all know that you were banned because of plagiarized content which isn't accepted at all in this forum, but you're saying that you forget to include the reference link which lead to the ban. I don't know why someone forgets to put the reference link when they can copy and post the content of others. OP, I think you may get a second chance if you can prove that you forgot to put the reference link of the text that you shared via a post. Since your account got banned due to a single plagiarized content sharing you may get another chance if admins, moderates, and other staff forgive you because you said that you forgot to put the reference link. Still the plagiarism is strictly not allowed in this forum and even a single plagiarized post can ruin someone's profile. I think others can learn a great lesson from you, and they won't post someone else's content without putting proper reference links.",

I have no idea what transpired that day, but I never intended to pass off someone else's content as my own. Sorry OP, but I do not think it was an honest mistake. After you created a topic with plagiarized content, you applied that same post to be merit assessed by fillippone (merit source). You even declared the post as an \"opinion\", despite the fact that there is not a single word that originated from your own thoughts; it was entirely copy-pasted. This indicates a clear intention to present someone else's work as your own and earn merits to boost your forum ranking.Quote from: Kodec5 on September 21, 2023, 11:53:21 PM~ Bitcoin Decline Due to debt ceiling concernCategory: Opinion Board: Local board Nigeria",

You know it's not that hard, the problem is the quality of the post that comes out this way.OP would have not cared about plagiarizing if it wasn't for merits, that's why he did it, some think that copy-pasting text or using text spinners on an essay that was written by a more experienced author would look like he has poured tons of effort into it so ...merit!!!!Not going to point fingers but I've seen enough users around here getting extremely lazy once pass a certain rank, from opening topic after topic to 4 generic lines in mega threads, or the funnier ones that start a business accepting BTC, make a topic about that and then miraculously they don't post an update for months in it like it would have never existed !It's all about merit > ranking >signature!",

If only I can send a voice message here, I will do it, so he can feel the anger that I'm feeling right now!!!  In order for you to get merits, you need to plagiarize? Try posting a religious quote OP, or maybe say things related to religion. That might help you.. help you not to get unbanned. Just kidding, but I hope OP is still ok. Find another forum OP, or maybe go to altcointalk.

Please enlighten me. Thanks.",
