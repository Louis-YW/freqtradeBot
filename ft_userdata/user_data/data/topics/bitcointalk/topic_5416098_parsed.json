Is there a certain site you plan on staking on? Will there be a contract signed for players who you are staking? Make up? % split? Paid daily? Weekly? Monthly? Stakes? Just some standard questions that some might want answered.All questions will be answered on telegramI get that you might want to keep some aspects private, but I don't think answering some of the questions is going to hurt your privacy. For example, what site? If you're planning on something like americascardroom where there is a decent amount of traffic vs some shitty pokerrr app on a phone where you plan on being shady and cheating. Stakes? I'm just curious if you have 50$ to toss at this or are serious and have 50000+? I have had horses get 1-2k deep on me in makeup and finally get a bink that breaks them outta debt and into profit.",

      "body": "I avoid debt like the plage, so I'm not interested in the offer, because staking is a type of debt. Although it is quite common in high stakes and very high buy-in tournaments. But I don't play at those levels anyway. What I do want to say is that the questions raised by yahoo62278 are relevant and if the OP thinks that with this obscurantist offer and not wanting to answer anything he is going to do a lot of business here he is simply wrong.The offers of this type, not just poker, that we see in the forum, that do not want to discuss details publicly, we must flee from them as I flee from debts, as if they were a plague.",
