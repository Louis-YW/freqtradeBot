  "content": "The revised syllabus will be implemented for the current academic session, which is 2023-24. I was hoping for an update from CBSE, but as usual, they are late in implementing new curriculum. Currently, they are busy reshaping the history books for the same classes.Instead of focusing on new technology-based education, they are working on a different aspect of education. I don't want to criticize them, but they need to prioritize technology above history. After all, India wants to become a 5 trillion dollar economy. If anyone has access to those UP Board books, please share them with us.",

      "body": "A great news and an excellent initiative by the UP government. I am sure other states where the ruling party has government would emulate in their local boards for education. What I am concerned is that whether the crypto part has been researched and prepared thoroughly. In general local boards tend to mess up with the information provided in their books. What I happy is that one state govt took the initiative and implemented it.",

I don't know if such incidents are still happening.I don't know how effective the new curriculum will be, but they are certainly getting good media coverage.",
