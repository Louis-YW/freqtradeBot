  "content": "Binance Smart Chain was put on hold. Following the discovery of a \"possible exploit\" on Thursday evening. Initial token movements suggested that an attacker targeted up to two million BSC tokens late on Thursday, although actual losses may be substantially lower. BNB Chain stated in a tweet that $7 million had already been frozen despite estimating that $100 to $110 million in assets had been removed off the chain.Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao later confirmed the issue on Twitter, saying  “An exploit on a cross-chain bridge, BSC Token Hub, resulted in extra BNB. We have asked all validators to temporarily suspend BSC. The issue is contained now. Your funds are safe. We apologize for the inconvenience and will provide further updates accordingly.”https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1578171072067031042?s=46&t=BbwgnV5FhWvrK6AUVeuCrghttps://twitter.com/watcherguru/status/1578153617403805696?s=46&t=BbwgnV5FhWvrK6AUVeuCrghttps://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/10/06/binance-linked-bnb-price-falls-close-to-4-on-hack-rumors/%3FoutputType%3Damphttps://www.cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-chain-confirms-bsc-halt-due-to-potential-exploit/amp",

In this case there's no way CZ can recover clients coins and we will see Binance will bankrupt just like Mt.Gox.CZ controls the network, changes the protocol (as recently), has many connections to several services in the ecosystem, just imagine if it is possible to blacklist hacker addresses by all services, hackers can do nothing. However, paranoia must be placed on the mind of the holder anyhow for the future.Quote from: hugeblack on October 07, 2022, 09:40:37 AM-snip-So far, I am surprised that the price has not reacted to the news.CZ quickly \"safeguards\" followers' negative assumptions even though they actually have a lot to lose, it was done in the early hours of the morning before the news media messed up.Quote from: https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1578190677241778177Full transparency, I was asleep (yes, I sleep). By the time I was woken up at 3AM, the community of validators had already paused. I just did the tweeting. The community & team did all the work.",

As a matter of fact, I think that people even prefer to have someone over their head who can halt the blockchain and sort similar exploits, which is confirmed by people applauding BSC people how they handled the situation.

As a matter of fact, in the last 24 hours BTC went down more than BNB (2% vs 0.8%) and that says a lot.",
