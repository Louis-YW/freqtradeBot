As such, many services and features are not available at this time. For general information, please visit this website.Are you for real that you've keep your 20 ETH there and not with a hardware which is good for keeps with such amount you hold in ETH? I'm having that feeling bad for you OP, I haven't read the whole details of that petition they've made but visit that website ~ https://cases.stretto.com/celsius",

Celcius is actively giving update about the progress to the its creditors or investors. You need to see this announcement too https://twitter.com/CelsiusNetwork/status/1570235278488633344That may help you to know or even predicting ETA for the withdrawal to be reopened again. You shall learn never store your money in centralized defi like that",

I think you need to learn from the basic and know any risk before put your coins on centralized entity including Binance aka the so called SAFU. Because you don't have full control over your coins and you wouldn't know what they do with your coins.",

Its CEO has stepped down on his position, so that's already a big red flag and sign that Celcius itself is going nowhere but to its pitfall.I guess this is his way of trying to save himself from the bankruptcy of the platform instead of facing it. I have no idea but that's really a suspicious act although there's really nowhere to go for him and for Celcius.News: Celsius CEO resigns in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings",

Avoid centralized custodial service all in the name of looking for APYs and staking rewards,For a person having about 20 ETH, a secure hardware wallet should be top priority.",

Lol. He can just say that he abandon the project already. I don't know if what is that celsius you guys are talking about but based on the comments above it seems like it's a defi platform? We all know defi's are very risky and yet you confidently invest huge money on them.It's always important to secure most of our profits in a wallet where have a full control and left only some funds to see if it will grow again if not and it turned into a scam later on, our regrets won't be that much. Checking the updates more often about the platform that we are using is also a must and if you feel something shady, you shouldn't hesitate to pull out most of your funds immediately.",

We all know defi's are very risky and yet you confidently invest huge money on them.Maybe he is just the ceo that have certain amount of shares aside from the other investors or board members. If he resigned means he might also sold his shares, of the company. Most likely he doesnt want to get involved now that the company is at worse situation.Its not a defi as far as I remember but a cefi who also works like a defi in a decentralized space. Cause I remember I wanted to put some funds there and I needed to do a kyc so obviously its not a defi.",

This defi was scamming billions of money. Even if they resign am sure if there is any strong evidence against them in connection whit what happened the authorities can easily take action. Resigning does not completely erase them from the situation, i believe investigation is ongoing so they can keep up with the act and hope there is no foul play that will raise suspicious.This is why not your keys not your money is strongly emphasize on, when something unexpected will happen to these exchanges you will be stuck, unable to withdraw.",
