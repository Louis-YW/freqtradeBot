  "content": "ETH was great when I bought it in the PRESALE from the PREMINE at $0.25 back in 2015. I even kept buying a few 100s of Ethereum at $10 in 2017 since it was a good deal back then when everything was still cheap. So do I tell it to boast? Nope. I tell you this because it gives you the secret on how to be successful in Crypto like Brock Pierce (who bought way more than I of ETH and became a billionaire)   but we are not too late. You can use this same simple trick still today. Sold the most at around $4000 which feels like a good deal since now ETH is only $2000. Could have waited a bit and got lucky selling at $4800 but you never can get the top or bottom exactly right so it feels like a great deal to me either way. I put all my ETH winnings (besides some Cash for living and my small beach home) into Bitcoin since Bitcoin is the future with so many paths like global reserve currency some day, protection from USD Inflation and possibly new currencies issued by governments, as countries as germany issued several times in the last 100 years because the old currencies became worthless (and I think that its likely happening to the USD sooner or later too) and ETH is just a centralized project by 1 guy to get rich and make everyone rich who bought it at $0.25 or $10. Of course thats an achievement. Vitalik did a great job but now he is finished and at his peak and its time to make room for the new and the projects that will still go x10000.   Unless you love financial struggle, then please stop reading and go buy top50 crypto projects!What can we learn from crypto that 99% of people in crypto still have not understood who go in Luna, expensive ETH and other top100 shitcoins with scam fees and ICO scams and premine and wall street in them already? Trust a project BEFORE the masses go in. BEFORE Wall Street goes in. When its not SAFE. Have faith and trust a GOOD project. So if you did buy ETH at $0.25 that was a great deal. If you bought Bitcoin at $1 that was a great deal. But ETH will not go x10000 again right? So even if you put only $5000 into ETH now what do you think it will be worth some day? Maybe if you are lucky $10k or $15k? With the risk it falling back to under $100 as in 2017/2018 and then eventually going bankrupt like Luna.  So what you must learn from history of Crypto and Bitcoin is you only get financial independance in Crypto by buying good projects early when they are still cheap. Before McAffee and all the others are in them. Before Youtube influencers shill them. Before Kevin oLeary and Anthony Scaramucci buy them. When its uncertain and insecure like those who put $50k into Bitcoin when it was $100. It was extremely risky back then to do that. But it was the right and the best decision you could ever make. So what to do now?  Now I watch the \"new tokens\" on CMC and Coingecko daily since 8 years for good projects but frankly 99,99% is just memetokens and other garbage scams especially in the last 1-2 years. I did find some really good projects that I went in early and made x50, x100 and even more a few times but only recently I found the currently best project in whole of crypto....  So today I want to introduce a great project that is still only $0.40 but will be $100, maybe even $500 some day, its got one of the best Blockchain Dev Teams in the world who have been working together as a team since 6 years which is rare in crypto. Their first project was Steem/Steemit which was bought by Justin of Tron in a hostile way. Since then they thought about what they can give back to Crypto. How they can make crypto better. More decentralized. So a villain as Justin cannot do something as this again. How they can bring more decentralization to Crypto with their PROOF OF BURN Blockchain.Proof of Burn is like Proof of Stake but its better since it includes the decentralization from Proof of Work without the insane energy costs. So its ESG ready and ready for the future while having the highest decentralization possible since everyone can mine it. The project is still only valued at $40m market cap even tho its one of the best blockchain teams in Crypto.. Their blockchain can do more than all other top100 blockchains and there is zero fees. Even if we continue to have a bear market this will go from currently $40m market cap to $400m within the next 12 months.  Their developers have Videos on Youtube explaining their project and introducing themselves, so you can verify they are a real team and know what they are talking about, and you can see they are not scammers like Luna and so many other projects. Their devs have not sold off huge amounts of coins and there was no premine or presale so its fully decentralized and fair.  As you can see on their Github they have been working daily on their project.  Their PR guy - who also has been with them since 6 years used to be a lawyer but now he only works on this project and tweets and writes pretty good articles on their project and the future and he has been featured on Hackernoon and other Crypto publications. They also have visited crypto conferences.   A community is building and they recently developed first open source wallets and a first open source DEX with their proof of burn blockchain that essentially is in competition with Bitcoin itself and with ETH since its more decentralized, zero fees and the best platforms for devs to develop on. This will go x10, x100, x1000 within the next 5 years. Why would anyone rather buy ETH that cant even go x5 most likely?https://www.youtube.com/c/KoinosBlockchain/videoshttps://twitter.com/koinosnetworkhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/koinos/https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/koinoshttps://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x66d28cb58487a7609877550e1a34691810a6b9fc&outputCurrency=ETH&chain=mainnet",

And then another attack then it just can't be handled anymore by Luna and it continues like that.So you're basically saying find something cheap then buy it even if the coins are 99% diluted with garbage projects?",

I remember it hit a low price of $1 and was deemed dead pretty much.At that time many from the ICO presale sold because they assumed it was a failed project and it reversed and hasn’t been any lower than that.Either way I wonder how many people besides the ETH devs still hold those presale coins? Probably not many.Most sold when it launched on the main net back in 2015.",
