      "body": "Possibly never. Stratum was never implemented into Bitcoin Core in the first place. Stratum is something built independently apart from Bitcoin Core because most of the users using Bitcoin Core has no use for it.Stratum V2 is just another protocol except with the security improvements and the ability for the miners to select their own transactions to mine. In reality, this shouldn't really affect too much with regards to centralization. Pools are free to decide whether to implement it or not and there isn't any perceived pressure for miners to adopt it either.",
