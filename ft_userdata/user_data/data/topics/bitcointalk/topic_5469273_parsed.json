What is the necessary conditions that will be given someone who delay to comply? I think you people suppose to outline conditions before joining the contribution or does you people have a place where you discuss the rotation of the contribution and the conditions",

For the low ranks, I think they are not supposed to be part of this contribution as you said, I like such idea. You made mentioned of DT members to tag someone who who did not meet up the deadline for he or her contribution, did you in any way reference your conditions being discussed outside this thread in forum to justify or prosecute anyone who fails, or the payment will be used as evidence. Secondly, if someone paid to two or three persons out of six contributors, and the person have yet payment from anyone from the platform and it decided to quit from the contribution, will you guys seized the one he or she contributed..how are you guys going to do the person base on the one the person contributed..because this contribution, the moving forward of this contribution lies on campaign, and any campaign can be pause on the process.",
