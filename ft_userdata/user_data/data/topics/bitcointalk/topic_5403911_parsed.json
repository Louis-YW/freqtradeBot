  "content": "MoneyPox is the ultimate memecoin developed with the sole purpose of taking advantage of scamdemic 2.0, instead of being victimized by it. The MoneyPox team predicts that fear, uncertainty, and doubt will be enforced upon the masses once again, which will eventually escalate into full-fledged global lockdowns, filled with tyranny-style mandates, for your ''safety.'' This time, we want to make a profit out of this; what good is predicting something if you're not going to monetize it? Check out the project at: https://www.moneypox.io/  ​",
