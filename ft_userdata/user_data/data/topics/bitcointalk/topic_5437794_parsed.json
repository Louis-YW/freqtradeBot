Again also on how to do transaction with cryptocurrency and with this knowledge I have gotten from this forum I am proud to say things has been going well with me.I also feel the same way, although i haven't gotten to the trading side yet. But the people here are really very helpful for a newbie like me. Response below as an example:Quote from: Lucius on February 01, 2023, 04:45:20 PMThere are faucets and various PTCs that give a small reward for completing a task, but these rewards are very low considering their fiat value. Those who earn from such jobs are usually people who are owners or those users who have a lot of referrals (active of course). I recommend that you visit Micro Earnings board, and there, among other things, you can see my thread with a link that might help you in your search You talked about candlesticks and market structure. Where do you read general topics about this in this forum? i also want to read it.",

I understand that it's really hard to cope with the standards in here since you're just getting started, but I'm certain that you've gone - a lil - far from being REAL.I was also wondering where you got a whole discussion thread about how candle sticks are being analyzed,etc..?? I would agree with you that you've learnt alot as you said, over the little time you've spent here, and if those informations have worked things out clearly for you, then it's a great deal that you got the forum as a reservoir of knowledge. We still have alot of people out there that trade Bitcoin but cannot do the least, technical stuff like signing a PGP.Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
