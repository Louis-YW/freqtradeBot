What I know is that there are many gambling sites on this forum that may not make money in bear market time unlike the bullish time if both are compared. Bullrun or bear market does not affect any game. But if it affects any game, the gambling site will be the one that will know better, not the gamblers.The market is volatile, and expecting in any area would almost certainly result in substantial unrecoverable losses. The bull and bear seasons favor certain projects and dump a few others, roughly 50/50. We conduct a thorough investigation before commencing on a project, because I am reluctant to take any unnecessary risks that could result in the liquidation of my account. The availability of cryptocurrency games promotes increased development in the cryptocurrency sector. Crypto games existence is definitely not my pointing view because I lost a couple of bucks last year and I'm totally staying off from them this year.",

Maybe he is referring to, linked to this, the idea that if you gamble you gamble and that's it, but if you gamble with crypto your are gambling twice (the play itself, plus the volatility which can make a loss recoverable thanks to other gains or a victory worthless because of a dump).",

They will still play the same amount in fiat even in bullrun and just save some profit when their crypto bags grow.",

Another words they perform fine in bull market.What are your views or perceptions about such games.I don't know why you asked about that game but it is related to the bullrun and the thread on the gambling board. What do you mean by bitcoin trading? or gambling games?But since your thread is in the gambling section, I assume your question is about gambling games. In my opinion, there is no difference between gambling games using fiat and crypto currency, only the mechanism. However, there are several advantages to using crypto, such as: Global nature, no KYC required, anonymity and transaction speed. What I like most about gambling sites that use crypto is anonymity, I feel safer if my identity remains anonymous in using services on the internet, especially in gambling",

Another words they perform fine in bull market.What are your views or perceptions about such games.Like others, I'm also not able to grasp your content fully but if you're saying that there are some crypto games that are good during bull run and if you're considering the NFT based games then I agree that yes there are those games that mostly wait for the bull market because during bull market the whole crypto market gains many new investors and when those new investors enter the market the NFT based games are introduced to take advantage of those investors. Those crypto games or we can say NFT based games are mostly useless and they are only introduced to grab some money from the greedy investors. Once the bull run is over the whole scenario change for such games and most of them will rug-pull and run  away with the money.",

Is it about gambling or something else like trading, since you posted and asked in the gambling trhead. And if you are asking something about how it affects when the market is bullish or vice versa on crypto gambling games, it has no effect at all in my opinion.And if I may, can you be more detailed in asking questions? because what you said I see also many people who do not understand what you want to say.Gambling and the markets that occur do not make us able to easily win, especially in some games that are based on luck.",

However, these games may suffer when the value of their products diminishes and players' interest wanes.and People should approach such games cautiously, do extensive study, and think about their risk tolerance.

A lot of these games have nailed the earn aspect of the P2E equation, but none of them so far has successfully stuck with people during hard times because they never focused on the \"play\" aspect which is arguably more important than anything else. I have yet to see a crypto game that successfully enticed me more than the conventional \"I'm gonna earn from playing this boring game so might as well\" feeling that I get from them.",
