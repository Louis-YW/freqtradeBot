So the main feature of our site and what really sets it apart are the deposits and withdrawals. We are running on the BTC lightning network only (so there will be no on-chain transactions or altcoin options). We have spent a lot of development resources on making the experience extremely smooth and easy. We would love for you to try and let us know your feedback. There are no requirements for the satoshi giveaway! Just join the discord and we will credit your account. You can withdraw straight away, you don't even need to play a game. We really want to promote our payments functionality, and this is the best way of getting the message out there. It is indeed open to abuse, but we will try our best to monitor it, and hopefully the word will spread of our payment features. Many of us are players ourselves and the thing we hate the most is when gambling companies put hurdles in the way that stops players from withdrawing, or when a withdrawal takes hours, days or weeks. Our payouts are instant. We really believe have the smoothest and easiest payments in the industry, but please give it a try (for free!) and let us know what you think.

Yes we will indeed be increasing the max limits later on. We are only keeping things low for now while we have the giveaway on launch. Having said that, we will be a casino that will focus more on microtransactions than other casinos. Regarding the giveaway, as described in previous posts we are really trying to highlight the withdrawal feature we have, as we think that is what sets us apart more than anything else. With the giveaway you can take the money out straight away, without even playing a game. [moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

The leaderboard shows our biggest winners. How much in total they have won, the net win, games played etc. Regarding currency, everything is we do is in satoshis.
