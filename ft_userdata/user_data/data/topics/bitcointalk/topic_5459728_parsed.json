I don't know everything about their relationship so I'm asking questions about info they're storing or sharing.Wasabi does not store or share any data with blockchain analysis companies. Your client never shares your xpub address with any third parties, including the coordinator, since it uses BIP158 compact block filters.  Your client never shares your IP address with any third parties, including the coordinator, since it uses Tor.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on July 13, 2023, 11:10:07 PMWhich data gets transmitted to zkSNACKs when Wasabi wallet opens in Win 11? When you open the wallet, you begin downloading block filters from the coordinator over Tor.  No identifiable data is transmitted since your IP address is protected.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on July 13, 2023, 11:10:07 PMIf wallet1 has 10 transactions, wallet2 has 10 transactions, wallet3 has 2 transactions are they linked to the same user by zkSNACKs or it's 22 anonymous transactions which zkSNACKs can't link to the same user?That would appear to zkSNACKs as 22 anonymous transactions that can't be linked to any user.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on July 13, 2023, 11:10:07 PMDo zkSNACKs store any data to link users from received<>sent addresses after mixing?No, the Wasabi client prevents data from being leaked to the coordinator.  Users never link their addresses together because every input and output in the coinjoin is registered with a single use Tor identity.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on July 13, 2023, 11:10:07 PMWhich info does zkSNACKs share with blockchain companies is it limited to scanning incoming mixes for analysis?None, zkSNACKs purchases info from blockchain companies, zkSNACKs cannot sell any info to them because Wasabi is purposely designed not to reveal any data about its users.Quote from: Z-tight on July 14, 2023, 12:20:03 AMNobody knows this information, because Wasabi won't tell.The blockchain analysis company they are funding was even kept a secret, before they were exposed that it was Coinfirm, and yet Wasabi still claims to be the ultimate privacy solution, when they are clearly working with a pro-censorship service to spy on people's UTXO.Even if Wasabi and zkSNACKs publish the criteria for blacklisting certain UTXO, it will not change the fact that they can blacklist any UTXO for any reason they decide at all, and surely they are storing and sharing data with a blockchain analysis firm, if not how then will they spy on their customers.This is completely wrong, everyone can verify for themselves that Wasabi does not leak any of their data because all of the code is open source, just like Bitcoin itself: https://github.com/zkSnacks/WalletWasabiQuote from: ETFbitcoin on July 14, 2023, 10:14:27 AMAnd as reminder, Windows OS have poor privacy.You can use Wasabi with Linux or Mac if you would like - https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi.Documentation/WasabiCompatibility.mdQuote from: Yamane_Keto on July 14, 2023, 01:24:23 PMIf it is from Wasabi wallet aka zkSNACKs, according to the some open data, they can know all the addresses associated with the CoinJoin process, down to your IP addresses, and all the details of your addresses or addresses that you may generate in the future.But with this data they cannot identify you as you can enhance your privacy by running a full node using TOR and using an additional mixing layers.This sort of data collection happens by default in wallets like Samourai which expose your IP address and xpub address, but Wasabi is specifically designed so zkSNACKs (or any coordinator you choose) never learns your wallet addresses or IP address since Tor is on by default and your addresses are never linked even when you don't run a node thanks to BIP158 compact block filters - https://bips.xyz/158Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 14, 2023, 01:41:57 PMQuote from: arabspaceship123 on July 13, 2023, 11:10:07 PMDo zkSNACKs store any data to link users from received<>sent addresses after mixing?We don't know and they won't tell us.Quote from: arabspaceship123 on July 13, 2023, 11:10:07 PMWhich info does zkSNACKs share with blockchain companies is it limited to scanning incoming mixes for analysis?We don't know and they won't tell us.You do know, the answer is \"none\" because Wasabi does not reveal any data to them.  zkSNACKs is very proud of their zero data collection policy and talks about it all the time, how could you miss it?https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1678694963712802816https://blog.wasabiwallet.io/zksnacks-means-zero-knowledge/",

You try to register an input for coinjoin, Wasabi hand that input over to Coinfirm and ask them for all the dirt they have on your input, and then decide whether or not you are allowed to spend your coins in the way that you want. If you are not allowed, they won't tell you why, of course.Just like Satoshi envisioned! No third parties, except for ones who will censor you and charge you a fee for doing so!",

Mass surveillance is designed to stop crime. Phone tapping is designed to stop crime. Banning encryption is designed to stop crime. Putting a government back door in all your devices is designed to stop crime. Reading all your emails and IMs is designed to stop crime. It is complete bullshit.

That mindset creates the incentive to be as compliant and inconspicuous as possible: those who think that way decide it’s in their best interests to provide authorities with as little reason as possible to care about them. That’s accomplished by never stepping out of line. Those willing to live their lives that way will be indifferent to the loss of privacy because they feel that they lose nothing from it.

So Coinfirm will absolutely be looking at the history of that output and seeing where it came from. If any of the previous addresses have ever been linked to an identity (such as via KYC, via addresses being shared publicly, via connecting to third party servers, via other transaction heuristics, etc.) then that will be identified and Coinfirm will be storing, sharing, and selling, that information on to other third parties.",

That’s accomplished by never stepping out of line. Those willing to live their lives that way will be indifferent to the loss of privacy because they feel that they lose nothing from it. Above all else, that’s what a Surveillance State does: it breeds fear of doing anything out of the ordinary by creating a class of meek citizens who know they are being constantly watched.In your opinion what's right to do if your wallet with 1 btc gets hacked. On blockchain you trace funds were sent to wallet bc1xx so you report it to police. A month later the coins moved to Binance. Soon your coins will be returned because they've been seized after blockchain analysis. That's happening now with exchanges so it can't be a bad process reuniting owners with stolen coins.Scanning incoming UTXOs in Wasabi wallet it's the same as Binance or other exchanges doing it. What they're doing with data isn't clear. If it's being misused for unfair data collecting after it's completed its purpose it shouldn't be used. I don't trust any companies to voluntarily delete data after if they're able to profit from it.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 19, 2023, 06:04:32 AMQuote from: arabspaceship123 on July 18, 2023, 11:15:28 PMWhich data's being stored by zkSNACKs in this transaction if I'm using Wasabi wallet.Wasabi pay Coinfirm to investigate the output you are registering for coinjoin. So Coinfirm will absolutely be looking at the history of that output and seeing where it came from. If any of the previous addresses have ever been linked to an identity (such as via KYC, via addresses being shared publicly, via connecting to third party servers, via other transaction heuristics, etc.) then that will be identified and Coinfirm will be storing, sharing, and selling, that information on to other third parties.I believe if they've got it they'll sell it so asking data questions about what they're doing by separating wrong info from facts is crucial.I've a new example for transactionstx1 Satoshi uses Binance sends 0.1 btc to arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 1tx2 arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 1 sends 0.1 btc to Wasabi wallet for mixtx3 Wasabi wallet use Coinfirm for analysistx4 Wasabi wallet allows coinjoins sends mixed 0.1 btc to arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 2tx5 arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 2 sends 0.05 btc to Satoshi Exodus Wallet tx6 arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 2 sends 0.04 btc to Satoshi Bitcoin Core wallettx7 arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 2 sends 0.01 btc to arabspaceship123 Electrum wallet 3Is this belief accurate?It's been mentioned zkSNACKs can't link incoming UTXO's to outgoing UTXO's so that's good for privacy if true. They aren't storing ip address or device id when using Wasabi wallet. They're storing the address used by Satoshi in tx1 before coinjoins but aren't storing tx details after mixing so they can't link anything between tx2-7.",

I didn't reject it I wanted to know what they're storing when using Wasabi wallet.

A dedicated machine's going to be perfect solution. I'd like to understand more about coinjoins for widening my learning.
