But in some cases you can still get lower or higher than the amount that majority of people get.Just because I experienced it in one casino does not mean that I should use that same mindset for every other casino out there, some might be rigged (most especially if they’re new to the industry) so as to avoid them losing a lot of money from free spins, while others are genuine but don’t classify them as demo since you can’t withdraw from demo no matter your wins but you can from free spins are completing all the requirements.",

      "body": "No, free spins aren't demo because in demo whatever you earns is totally virtual while with free spins if your luck favors you then you can earn real money and withdraw that without any issues. But, I believe that most of the free spins and bonuses come with wagering requirements and it's really hard to complete those wagering requirements, and most people end up loosing everything instead of gaining anything. But, we can't say that casinos that offer those free spins have control over the winnings or losses because a legit casino won't do anything fishy and if they does then they get tagged by the users. So if someone can successfully complete the wagering requirements and KYC verification then that person can withdraw the winnings of those free spins.",

That's what I want to know, what is your own experiences like with free spins. Free spins and demos are totally different things but I have never seen anyone win anything big from free spins but I have heard of many winning anywhere from $1-20 from here.  Free spins are mainly given to attract gamblers to casino sites. Although gamblers don't usually win over $20 from here, gambling sites advertise that they are giving away 1 Bitcoin or more in free spins. This is entirely their marketing policy. But if free spins are available then it is not bad to use them because even small amount is good from here.  Because it is completely free",

Some casino offer an insane amount of free spin on a certain slot games mostly from Bgaming provider that doesn’t give much huge profit and somehow has a max profit limit for the free spin. I do get your point especially these massive free spin that result to small win and mostly lose bets.Free spin is intended to attract customers to deposit and try the casino by luring them to deposit more to get more free spin. I usually avoid freespin that can be use only on specific game unless it’s just really free like the Bitcasino free spin drop.",

It is not rigged and you get random results on every account. Maybe some will match but that's just a coincidence. Reputable platforms will never do such a thing. Maybe this is a new platform that offers $15 as a joining bonus. Now this is a whole different story. Because existing ones will never roll out offers like this. Or maybe they would but I don't know that well. This seems like it is using the same strategy as some exchanges do. You will receive a free bonus but you will have to do some tasks. So it's better to be happy with what you have and if you want to keep using it, do your own research to see if it's here to stay or some platform that will die after some time. It seems like a strategy to gather more people to join their platform. So keeping an exact amount will not disappoint anyone.",

I kind of understand where you are coming from, but they are ultimately different, I mean, both of them allow you to try the game on the casino but you have to realize that on free spins you have the chance of winning money while on demo games, you have no chance of winning any thing. also, as Jawhead999 has said, you and your friends getting the same result could just be a coincidence.

I have not seen anyone earn a large amount from free spins, because there are many requirements behind it to withdraw the winnings from those free spins. As a result many gamblers lose more money to that casino to fulfill that requirement. And the demo account is different things, you put the demo and free spins in one place. Those who earn from free spins are very lucky in my opinion, and you too can be said that at least you managed to earn $15.0.",

I remember winning same amount on Winz.io free spin and Bitcasino. 100$ and above is possible to win free spin depending on the max multiplier and the bet amount of the free spin.There’s a wagering requirements on free spin rewards so I doubt that casino will provide capped on winning possibilities since most of the free spin offer by other casino requires deposit for wagering since the free spin reward is lock. Just saying that free spin is not different on normal in terms of max profit potential.",

Haha.Well like most have mentioned, demos and free spins are entirely different from one another but they may intertwined with each other.The problem with \"free spins\" is that their rates are absurdly low for one to receive any kind of reward. Sure, they are considered as \"free\" but the odds of a person really profiting from such is so low that many had doubts as to whether people can actually win on it. Maybe this is the reason on why you thought that these free spins are demo versions due to the fact that the chances of winning is low.Though this may be the case, the greatest example that overthrows your theory is the experience of your friend. The fact that he won $15 from it is a testament that these free spins are not demos.",

Could be coincident or there is a manipulation, they cannot do a demo once they officially announce the launching of their casino if there are bugs they will lose their reputation, just look at what happened to Richy casino when they officially announced their launch but it appears the casino should be in a demo mode first to trace all the bugs on the casino.Free spin is to test the site and the winning is real whereas on demo mode all winnings are considered of no value because it's on a testing period.I seldom avail of free spins unless I see that the early people who test it prove that the platform is good and fair.",

I think the only reason why most of the free spin always ended up with minimal profit is due to the limited spin available for you to try unlike you are betting real money which you don’t look on spin count because you are focus on spin result and your bankroll balance.I have a good experience on free spin since this is just free money.
