  "content": "I know there are a lot of tech-savvy people here.I'd like to install something for my 92-year-old neighbor who can't see very well, so she can listen to books.The builders around her have cut the telephone cable and broken everything so badly that at the moment we can't install fiber or ADSL. She can receive 4G.The idea is that I could take out a sim card with lots of GOs and make her autonomous so that she can listen to books. Do you have any equipment suggestions?I've already tried tablets, but she can't scroll and can't see the screen well anyway.So I thought maybe I'd install a tablet with a Bluetooth speaker and come to her house to play it. But do you have any other ideas? Thanks",

If she is then let the person play her the audio books whenever she needs to listen to them.Or you could just remote control it, probably via the internet... or set it up to play automatically at a particular time daily.I would have recommended some old people-friendly devices for playing digital files but I'm not sure you can find them in your country.",

Perhaps an MP3 player? But which one?",
