I don't know how I'd expect a fund like this to do, with so much rebalancing (every quarter) would there really be a chance at strong growth when a coin's profit gets realised. I can also imagine this under performing bitcoin in bull times and catching up to it in bear periods.",

And now I am trying to understand how it will work? Like when you buy this index Binance will buy all those top 10 crypto assets in equal amount and keep it? I mean is there a real crypto assets behind the index? Trying to understand the Binance CMC index, I just learned that users can use it to track the values of digital assets and currencies. And the crypto assets in the index will be weighted and rebalanced every month.In other words, for individuals that are going to use the Binance CMC index, the system will select the cryptoassets in the index and distribute your funds across the index using dollar-cost averaging as well as auto-invest.If you love to read, this article was more comprehensive.: https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/0ece0aaab0b442d293e1be2eae60a19d?ref=AZTKZ9XS&utm_source=BinanceTwitter&utm_medium=GlobalSocial&utm_campaign=GlobalSocialIf you love to watch videos, this one has a simple explanation.: https://twitter.com/binance/status/1514710161482465281?t=E4T_1-kw1VUQWrRAWCFj1g&s=19",

Maybe they have some criteria to filter such coins out.",

I think you should see the quote below.Quote from: Rikafip on October 20, 2022, 07:10:18 AMEach asset is rebalanced on the monthly basis while index itself on the quarterly basis so I am not sure what's the problem here.",
