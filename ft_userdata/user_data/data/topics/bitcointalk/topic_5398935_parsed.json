  "content": "Hello,I could not wrap my head around how weird this is.I have an immersion setup sized for 6,000Watts. I got an S9 to test things out and was able to hash at 16T drawing 1.4kW with chip temperature 65-68C. Never exceeding 70C.I felt confident enough with my setup to get a T17 42t, with Braiins installed, it's currently sitting at 1.9kw with chip temperature in late 80C.I don't understand how a 1.4kw S9 is 65C and a 500W increase in a T17 shoots chip temperature to almost 90C!Ambient temp is 30C, fluid inlet temp is 45C.Here is an image showing both settings for S9 and T17:https://imgur.com/a/P7MKyfEHere's my setup https://imgur.com/a/LFZIk8ECould it be something about T17 sensors? My setup is oversized for this kind of power consumption!",

I invested alot in this setup. The radiator is a 24x24\" wood stove heat exchanger that many miners use to operate two S19s (rated for 6,000W), hooked up to a 3,000 CFM ventilation fan.I installed the radiator and the fan to an A/C hole to push hot air out and keep the room cool. The pump is also a March MDX that I've got after miners have recommended it. The tank is designed for S1X/T1X models with two chambers and a flowplate.This T17 is the upgraded version (reinforced), I got it from China for $1,000. They have sent me a confirmation video showing the machine running and it was giving 42T with max temp 80C on air. That's what's triggering me. It worked fine on Air but not on immersion ( I couldn't even get it to 35T by immersion)I don't know what's wrong with my setup, I've put serious money into this setup and spent 6 months building simple setups before I got to this stage, and unfortunately, the result is not exciting. Here's my setup https://imgur.com/a/LFZIk8E, if you're interested to give your two cents.",

I don't know for sure what the cause is, but I believe it has to do with the calibration of the external sense input of the TMP451 used on these boards. The external sense input is used to read the temperature of a sensor integrated into the ASIC, and needs correct calibration settings to get accurate results. The internal sensor on the TMP451 that is used to get the  \"board\" temperature is calibrated at the factory so it doesn't need any additional setup by the firmware.What mikeywith mentioned is also true though. You may need different flow rates because of the different power density. A s9 running at 1400W is using only ~7.5W per chip. A T17 at 1900W is using ~21W/chip.",

What Mikey said is also concerning to me. Before I even get a T17, S9 running with temp 65C is alot and is not what an immersion system gives. You said 80C is right on the target considering Braiins exaggeration, but the gear is immersed, I should not be on target but much lower. I'll look through my system and see what I can improve, I know for sure that everything I use is high-material, could be flow-related",

I did some testing and was able to determine that Braiins reads chip temperature 5-6C higher than other fws. (It read 59 in asic.io and 65 in braiins)I'll try out different firmware and see what happens.",

It turns out it was true, Braiins exaggerates chip temperatures very much. From 78-80C with 1.5kw on Braiins to 60-66C with 1.4kw on ASIC.to. It is currently autotuning and things look promising. My conclusion is that immersed T17 does not do well on Braiins as it reaches 92C and autoshuts down when in fact it is within cool range.I would have tried Awesomefirmware as it does sound awesome, but I'm already half a day into tunning with ASIC.to.Thanks again.",

Thanks for the time spent debugging my log. Yes, I did exactly that and sat the freq to 690 and volt to 16.3. It has been running smoothly for a day hashing away at 38T and drawing 2kw. More details here:https://imgur.com/a/gynUI5j. I have two red chips on chain 0. The moment I play around with them to get them to at least an orange, I keep getting the same error as the tuning. I decided to let them be. Are you happy with these numbers? Thanks again.",

Gave you merits for reporting back, most folks don't bother after getting their issues fixed. 38TH and even 42TH is easily doable with air cooling alone even in relatively warm places, or at least that was my own \"short-lived\" experience with these piece of junk hardware, I am sure you can push a lot higher given your immersion cooling, but that will also increase the likely hood of gear damage, so I'd say just focus on temps, I personally think 80c is good 85c is where it start thinking about reducing my hashrate or otherwise increase the cooling if possible.You can also attempt to lower the voltage, lowering the voltage while keeping the same frequency might result in lower temps with the same hashrate, the only issue with this model is that you can't have different voltages on different boards, so chain 1 might do ok with a lower voltage, but then chain 2 or 0 will start acting weird, it will take a lot of trial and error to get your gear's optimal settings.But if you are a lazy old man like me, then be happy with the readings and get some rest.",
