Let me know what you so we go all the way up. Not interested and don't know if it will have any value in taking the top spot. We are flocking to secure Bitcoin price positions and take more, more, and more. In times of decline like this, no one can guarantee anything from the altcoins back past the highs that have been reached.",

I bought this project at one time on Coinlist for 0.25$, I still keep it in my portfolio. There is hope that this project in the next bull run will grow, and will exceed its current ATH of $9.The mina protocol has the lightest blockchain and is really decentralized, the project also solves scalability issues and will allow for truly secure applications on the blockchain. Hopefully these features will expand the use of this protocol and as a consequence increase its price.",

Predicting alts future price is not easy because despite how good the project may be, market demand will determine the price. I would say since some people think web3 is the next big thing, it won't be a bas idea to scoup some mina for the next bull season.",

People are beliving if this coin will become another major coin. I remember when each of this coin worth more than 4 and this time it's less than a dollar. The market is still in a bad condition. I don't think this coin can wake up from the its bearish trend. it's impossible to be reversed from the market. Bitcoin and bearish trend are still dominating everything for now.",

Although I am not a person who often cares about it, I do know about it, with the current Mina ecosystem still very new, not many applications, and still in the early stages of development. Perhaps in the future, what this ecosystem needs to pay attention to is developing infrastructure pieces to help the ecosystem develop, because a high-rise building is only stable when it has a good enough foundation. In addition, to the vision of 2025, I will stay out of it because the main thing I care about is how BTC will change, rather than the solutions in this space.",
