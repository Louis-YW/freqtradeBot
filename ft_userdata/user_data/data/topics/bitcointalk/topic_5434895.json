But the cost of accepting bitcoin *can* be 0, so it's defenately worth a try. The more stores accepting BTC, the more \"mainstream\" we become.Good luck",

And the advantage you get if you accept bitcoin as payment is, when the bitcoin price goes up, your previous profit will double according to the bitcoin price.and I suggest you keep it for the long term, and if there is something to buy for your business, put it on fiat and let your bitcoin work and grow.and ignore those who think bitcoin is a fraud because there are still many people who believe in it.",

You should definitely try that out but, keep your expectations low when it comes to sales via crypto. Online stores works the best for that(maybe set one up for delivery?) and is safer for you as well. You could wait for the confirmations first on blockchain and then start delivering the goods. Regarding those questions, you could set up a FAQ board along with a \"Bitcoin accepted here and the QR code\" sign.",

Try to implement your plan and see where it leads. In my opinion, you have nothing to lose.You can write down a discount for paying with a bitcoin as a benefit for buyers. Make a discount of at least a symbolic 5% and then it will be an attractive offer for them. To be honest, it seems to me that the discount should be higher, because people will lose on the commissions of exchangers, which will also push them away from paying in bitcoin. Calculate the approximate costs for the exchange rate + your discount and you will get the figure that will be of interest to buyers.",
