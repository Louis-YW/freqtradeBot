  "content": "Nothing to explain more. The bounty manager Jr BM started a bounty to increase his/her telegram/Twitter followers. It's okay. But the manager is also asking for a positive comment in his/her service thread.. And first 300 valid participants will be paid. That means let's wait for at least 300 spam/shilling comments in his/her service thread. It's already started. How you are looking at this?archive: https://archive.ph/Da30Q",

It looks like paid bumping which may cause a lot of spamming. As a bounty manager, you should be smart enough. You could ask them to comment here, but it should not be compulsory or even should not be paid. I hope you can understand and change the bounty rules asap. Thanks for your advise. Let us make the rules compulsory to optional.He says will make it as optional will this be okay or still some kind of positive farming involved in this?",

Let's see if they'll remove it or not later today. If they didn't, I might consider leaving a neutral to negative tag under the reason that their action --asking for fake review-- is questionable, dishonest, and borderline untrustworth.",
