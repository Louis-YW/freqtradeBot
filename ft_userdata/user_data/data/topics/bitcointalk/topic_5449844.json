But this fades in comparison to the first hyperinflationary crisis experienced by the nation from 1989-1991 where it surpassed 3000% annually. To make matters worse, Argentina is expected to experience a drought and coupled with inflation, I think the economy is going to suffer a lot as this will affect their key commodity exports: corn, soy and wheat.  From the outlook of things, the government seem to be at their wits end, and coupled with the fact that they need to remit a lot of money back to the IMF, I think a solution for their predicament need to be thought up and fast. Is this the point where Bitcoin comes in handy??https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/04/06/why-70-inflation-is-just-one-of-argentina-s-problems-quicktake/0d56242a-d499-11ed-ac8b-cd7da05168e9_story.html",

Then Covid happened and they cut rates slightly and then the inflation returned and got much much worse. And this time it got worse because it took them longer to hike.With many countries suffering from inflation this might also become the norm. They hike too slow or they cut rate too early and there is a second wave of inflation worse than the first.",

Truly, inflation has been bitting hard since late 2021 but many countries are using measures to tame it, but not Argentina with the recent uprising figures. While the 100% that your topic captioned was not just hit, their inflation figure has been moving above that level at least since February according to Focus Economics.Their annual average as of Match was 84.8%, but this might continue to rise if a decisive measure is not applied.",

How much bitcoin usage is widespread amongst the population as an anti inflationary tool?As far as I know, and I recently saw a programme about this, people spend the money as soon as they get paid because inflation is so high that it is better to spend today than to wait until tomorrow because in general things will be worth more, and people who can save, what they do with what is left over after spending they immediately convert into dollars, normally on the black market. I have no data on the use of bitcoin but I think my local forum partner darxiaomi is Argentinian, I will tell him to stop by and let us know.",

We urgently need to join the BRICS, where everyone will be \"helped\" by China with the yuan, and in a couple of years the country will simply dream of such inflation and such problems!This is a joke, no offense please Depends on a situation. There is a claim that one of the reasons for the SYSTEMIC defaults and problems in Argentina is a law passed in the late 80s that pegged the value of the Argentinean currency, the peso, to the expensive dollar. And they say that due to the fact that Argentinean goods have become uncompetitive (expensive), this has led to the decline of the industry.Sounds good, but far from reality.Firstly - if you see that such a decision negatively affects the economy - cancel it! And do not use 30+ years! Moreover, everyone is well aware (or is the Argentine government stupid?!) that an expensive currency for the country's economy is bad. Then why pass such laws?Secondly, it is always easier to \"shift the blame on someone / something\" than to admit your mistakes and correct them.Thirdly - the complete absence of \"work on the mistakes.\"As a result, there are growing fears of a local / global recession and a rapid rise in inflation in the country, which causes investors' fears about possible defaults, and, of course, the unfulfilled tasks of the International Monetary Fund, the political unrest that follows, which leads to problems in the economy, inflation and investment unattractiveness ... This is a classic vicious circle that must be broken, harshly and abruptly, otherwise it will turn into an endless \"series\"",

So if you wanna know something drop your question below and i will try to answer.Quote from: fillippone on April 23, 2023, 07:11:56 AMHow much bitcoin usage is widespread amongst the population as an anti inflationary tool?Lets talk about this, i think its WIDELY spread the BTC in that mix.Like in the whole world the old people still full USD or gold/ stock markets assets.But the youngers are having some BTC in that, in the 2017 bullrun for example a lot of people buy BTC for save, and after that it was a option for ever.We have here some big national companies who are dedicated to this for example, SatoshiTango, and Rippio. The only porblem with them its they are full KYC and they share all the information with the AFIP (IRS of Argentina, tax authorities).Binance here in the P2P markets its really really strong now, they make publicity in the streets and also you can check they sponsorship the Argentina League of Football.We also have a lot of others crypto-companies like buenbit, Lemoncash, etc who also they give debit cards.After saying that i have to say the more common crypto save in argentina its DAI and USDT, yes some virtual USD. The cultural background still important.All this its more common in the mid-mid high and high class. WE also have a lot of youngs who develops platforms and some ending being really big.But in the low class, forget about it, they also still save in pesos (if they have the opportunity), its really sad to see how this people month to month lose his money for the inflation.So in resume.Between the young people of the mid and mid high class, YES they have some crypto it can be USDT DAI USDC BTC or ETH.Quote from: fillippone on April 23, 2023, 07:11:56 AMAre people relying only on dollars? (I have seen the blue dollar rate going vertical after the news). Full yes, Argentina its the country with the most ammount of USD dollars in money paper, more than USA you can check this fact.And yes the blue dollar went up, among a internal crisis in the goverment and a big external problem in the macroeconomical side. But the USD blue still behind the inflation rate, so you can expect more up, but lets see tomorrow how the markets open here, its gonna be another amazing day in the never boring Argentina.I cant explain so much about this because its really a new world itself the Argentina economy.",

But everything is going wrong ... Maybe you really need to change approaches, policies, \"grab your head\" and do the right things , and not engage in populism and fantasies?",

Well, I don't know if you'd be in a position to know this, but let me just ask;  The Argentine pesos is greatly dropping against the dollar and it would be foolish to have your investment in them hence the reason why investors are looking to Bitcoin trading. - Do you think Bitcoin can be more than just a trading safe haven and instead act as a buffer to the high inflation they are experiencing?  - Do you think it can ever be considered for adoption to reduce the strong reliance of the US dollars as El Salvador did?",

I'm also not sure yet whether In a situation like this, some individuals might consider switching to alternative forms of currency, such as Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as each country in tackling these issues will likely sit down together and seek economic policies and structural reforms that are wider.",

I was in Brazil about 10 years ago, but as a tourist, I traveled and watched and rested more than I watched the economy.You spoke interestingly about cryptocurrencies. And now, from you, as from a real resident of the country, about the causes of the problems that exist in the economy? We can imagine anything about the problems of the Argentine economy, and many media love to distort information. It is interesting to hear a real citizen of the country who deeply knows the real causes of the problems? Can you talk about economic problems?Yes, but i have to say a thing here, we are not similar to any other latinamerican country or sudamerican country.Argentina was always like a paradise or like a oasis.For example what its the most know thing about Brazil? (asides of football) yes \"Favelas\", and that its because Brasil always be a country with 30% rich people and 70% poor people, Argentina was always pure middle class, like a 10% of poor, 70% middle class and 20% rich , we had so little \"villas\" (poors people sttelments) 30 years ago, now they were big filled with ton of poor people from Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, etc who comes for better conditions free healthcare education etc, and plus the argentinians who cant maintain his cost of living.This happen because in our constitution say \" for all the men of the world who want to live on Argentine soil: invoking the protection of God, source of all reason and justice: we order, decree and establish this Constitution, for the Argentine Nation\". So everybody who comes its and can start and it will be given the Argentinian citinzeship.For this last you can also see a rain of ukranian and russian people here in Argentina now making his citinzenship, to acces to our passport who its very strong (you can enter without visa to most of the european countries), so they make the passport and they fly to never come.Another thing, WE NEVER had criminality like now, for us all the drug trafficking violence, like in Colombia and Mexico were things from poor countries, countries who are shit compared to us, we see the images and cant believe how something like that can happen. But now we are starting to experiencing some of this troubles, in a very little way but its starting.... and dont seems good.So after 50 years of crumbling they finally make it we finally are falling, its really sad i hope we can like ever comeback but for the first time in my life i started to see the social fabric break down.We are going to be another Brazil another shit third world country (i know you always see us like that but we werent).This have multiples explanations but its really long to explain and its also really difficult to exaplain.For the first time in my life i have a lot of friends in Europe, right now i have 4 friends making his Italian citinzeship in Italy, because we have also that benefit to migrate, we can acces \"easily\" to any european citinzeship, i also have Italian citinzenship, and can opt for others for my ancestors.But this for the country its also a setback, because we are exporting the best people, all with degrees to other countries.

Adopting bitcoin as a legal tender in Argentina, is not a solution to their hyper inflation issue. It might help a little bit largely it won't have any impact on their economy to be honest. They will have to eradicate their entire currency supply if they want to come out of this and then the government needs to start sharing bitcoin as per the net worth of their citizens.

We also have the same condition in my country where the young are attracted to Bitcoin while the elderly see it as something strange or sometimes a fraud. Our currency is also losing value every day and people are desperately changing their money to other currencies like Bitcoin.
