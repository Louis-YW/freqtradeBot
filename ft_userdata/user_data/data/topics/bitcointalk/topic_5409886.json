  "content": "So here is a fun topic I think that we can all throw our two cents in (or two sats hehe ) Bitcoin has really opened up my eyes to a lot of things, and first off I'd like to start by saying that this community is a very special group of people. Bitcoin for me has opened up an incredible amount of business opportunities since I service many of the Bitcoin ATM operators though a telecom company and provide internet services (recently there has not been a complete halt, but there is less demand since the drop for new installations) . It has given me a peace of mind that I have control of my coin in a world where the government is after your money and wants to cut down your commissions & gains every single place that they can. Bitcoin has generated new life lasting friendships that I cherish, and something we can all come together with in our affinity we share for this digital coin. Even with completely opposing views we can all agree on one thing, that Bitcoin is the best form of money. It has allowed me to relish in my success, and has churned my stomach at the same time. I think the best thing that Bitcoin has done for me is to be able to HODL and weather the storm, because I have held since 2018 I've seen a few bears and bulls, and honestly that experience has made me more resilient. That experience has transcended beyond Bitcoin to the point that I am confident that I can endure through any financial burden or hardship, Lord willing. Bitcoin has made me do my research, has made me more passionate in doing so, & has also helped me to stay ahead of the curve. I can go on and on, but I realized that I haven't really posted in a little while, and so I wanted to see what all of your thoughts are towards this. Have a great rest of your Sunday everyone   Cheers, TREAD",

I even had a lot of bitcoin in the past and I sold it for a very cheap price, but I don't feel sorry for doing that, because that is my bitcoin journey. Knowing bitcoin made me understand how to make good money and for future investment. Many of my friends have started following in my footsteps to start investing in bitcoin and making some trades. a lot of positive values ​​are obtained and bitcoin is the source of everything I do.",

Have a great rest of your Sunday everyone   Cheers, TREAD  firstly, out of interestQuote from: tread93 on August 14, 2022, 11:41:53 PMBitcoin for me has opened up an incredible amount of business opportunities since I service many of the Bitcoin ATM operators though a telecom company and provide internet services (at least up until recently & its not to a complete halt but there is less demand since the drop) . as a boots-on-the-ground bitcoin operator. you have experience of seeing the whims of sentiment of many people.is your ATM just a bitcoin exit (btc->fiat only) or is it a two way ATM (fiat->btc->fiat)i understand when price goes down everyone goes into hard mode instead of sell mode. but if your ATMS are two way, have you seen any increase in fiat->btc \"buys\"dont worry about answering if its just a btc exiter atm system..anywaysive been into bitcoin over 10 years. in the good old days bitcoin was fun open and free. those days were before it was mainstream deemed as currency so was free from regulations of money laws. thus it allowed alot more freedom and openness to try new things.in recent years the money elitists have snared their grubby paws on the edges of crypto and changed it, although made it more popular, they also brought with that the regulations that caged bitcoin at the edges(money service businesses)i personally enjoy having my wealth secured in a sort of 'off shore' system but without the need of middle men bank mangers or lawyers needing to organise my wealth. i can just set up an address and hey, presto. its secure. i can spend it, i can pass it on to relatives without needing to concern self with taxes, inheritance laws. because while still in crypto no one needs to know anything about who owns what, bitcoin transactions never asks for identity info(ill worry about taxes whe its time to retire in a few decades)over the years i have seen, helped, and aided many people do many things. and also seen the shady more malicious greedy side of certain people. but in any community there is good and bad. and bitcoin is better fiatthere are indeed many business opportunities where people can set up a business without the headaches of fiat pains.. EG in fiat you need a business plan just to qualify to open a business account, which also requires a tax office registration, and a business headquarter address just to register a business before you can even get started running.(headache)where as you can buy and sell products/services in btc and keep value in btc. and then if and when you want to go go through the fiat pains, your already one step ahead and getting the fiat stuff registered then becomes easier and affordable as you have value coming in to cover those costs. thus bitcoin is great for startups to actually start up",

Service? Did you mean to say that you own a bitcoin ATM?From the perspective of a bitcoin hobbyist, this looks impossible and too risky for an individual person to setup unless you have a LOT of money on hand. Complying with your country's regulation is another thing that needs to be considered which would then required a lawyer to do the legwork. There is also the day-to-day management and finding a suitable venue which would require again a lot of your time and resources for a single ATM machine.Would love to see some clarification about this",
