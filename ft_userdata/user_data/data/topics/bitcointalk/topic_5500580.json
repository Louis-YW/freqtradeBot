This checkmating is not done by a central entity, but rather everyone who is on board. Due to that open room for regular checkmating, a single person can't just wake up oneday and implement something of personal interest without others not opposing. Which means the power to implement/decide doesn't lie in the hands of any single man(as there is no boss here).There is this general ideology that suggests that every business, groups, gathering, etc must have a higher authority (head) inorder to maintain stability, growth and prevent crisis. But guess what, Bitcoin has proven the opposite of this. Bitcoin has taught us that a collective effort of genuine people (people who fight for good) can bring sustainability and growth to any innovation.There is power in collective effort!There is power in decentralization!",

Bitcoin in itself can't stand to defend itself when it image gets tarnished and when a wrong signal is sent to the public regarding the wrong use of it. If we remain quiet and expect that Bitcoin is just too big to fail and refuse speaking up in times when it's necessary to do so, it wouldn't take time before so many people accept a wrong narrative which will go on to affect people's perception about Bitcoin.A simple analogy that's already playing out is the mixing of Bitcoin, memcoin, Altcoin and coin in general to almost mean the same thing. Alot of individuals that have invested into meme coin and lost Thier funds in the process have tagged the whole decentralized sector to be of the same nature and if we're quiet about this kind of development and refuse educate or speak out to point these salient but serious misunderstanding out, it's going to do more harm above our imagination .We are actually the main market and the moment we loose focuse and faith in bitcoin, that's the moment Bitcoin strength goes down to nothing.",

I believe Bitcoin wouldn't be where it is today if it wasn't for the people buying and using it for profit. We shouldn't focus on why people are buying or using Bitcoin because out of maybe a thousand people, at least some would end up understanding the real meaning and use cases of Bitcoin in the long run and if that continues, by the time everyone knows about Bitcoin, there will be enough people to support the actual cause and keep supporting it even if those who were in it for the profits abandon it.This should be the least of our worries. What's more worrisome is the fact that the likes of ordinals and stuff choking the network every now and then and that makes Bitcoin look extremely negative because other networks and blockchains tend to have lower transaction fees and confirmation times than it.",
