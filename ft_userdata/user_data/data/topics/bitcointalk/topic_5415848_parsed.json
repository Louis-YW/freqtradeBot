  "content": "Directly inspired by DaveF, the other day, I decided to create a new thread to collect specifically 'FUD Papers' - scientific papers written to create fear, uncertainty and doubt in Bitcoin or related topics, and have one or more links to rebuttals of the core arguments in such papers. As they are used in arguments (e.g. in Bitcoin Discussion) from time to time, this will allow to easily and quickly find the 'rebuttal link' (or quote) instead of having to type it all out over and over again.Quote from: DaveF on September 30, 2022, 11:54:01 AMSomeone should probably put together a website with a list of links to papers like the OP posted, a one or 2 line summary of what it says, and then a link to an article / post / document as to why it is wrong.So, when someone comes and does post about it again, all someone else has to do is say no, that's wrong here is why and here is the link.Just saves time, and discussion and so on.-DaveI had no time so far to dig out more instances of such papers, but here's one to start it off. Will update once I come across such occurrences or anyone posts one below!|Paper|URL|Debunked||'Bitcoin over Tor isn’t a good idea'|https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1054.9020&rep=rep1&type=pdf|https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5415377.msg61035748#msg61035748||'Bitcoin emissions alone could push global warming above 2°C'|https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328581842_Bitcoin_emissions_alone_could_push_global_warming_above_2C|https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335517778_2019-Dittmar_Praktiknjo-nclimate-supplementpdf|",
