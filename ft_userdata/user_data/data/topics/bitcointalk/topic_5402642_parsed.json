  "content": "Usa might lose status as reserve currency its nothing new that one empire will fall and will be replaced by others.China and russia is now very dominant but world bilionaires such us elon musk and a lot wall street guys dont stay under the china or russia or europe umbrella of protection by goverment to support their money making activity and its not by no means that usa will lose economical dominance.Usa stock market down amd all others....of usa but if the usa will start war then its like new beginning for the usa currency and ecinomy war means other countries will surrounder and usa fed can print again dollars as much they want and it will take up the markets.Conclusion is this if usa dont start war with russia or china then it will lose economical power a lot the other question will be will the usa will be strong enough to fight ? Well yes becouse the NATO allies will do the big part the usa top rich elite are under usa powerful umbrella and wall street most likely they will push biden to declare the war or push the nato allies and finland into war so the fed can print money again and nato allies will buy weapons from the usa with usd currency.The sign that usa stock market is down means that very soon biden must choose but china and russia not gona protect or provide financial support to usa top elite so if the usa falls the usa top elite wealth are in danger also.The usa most richest people such us wall street will likely to push usa in to war if not so directly then at least trhough nato countries so to keep usa dominance all over the world and keeping the usd as resrve currency without nato allies it might be not possible but with NATO they can do it for sure.War is only solution left to keep economical dominance of usd and wall street and bankers dont want to lose that power most likely usa will invade russia with NATO allies and its even better for usa economy and usa dollar strenght becouse then all the russian natural resources will be owned by usa.For that reason im bullish for usd However the war is bullish for the markets",
