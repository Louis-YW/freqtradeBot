  "content": "I mined a few ETC back in the day and have always thought it could be a simple alternative to Ethereum's high fees, but there doesn't seem to be much development on it. And I hear some of the devs who were involved in the Segwit2x scheme use it as a sandbox. When I add it to MetaMask, the price doesn't show up. I don't know much about it, except it's the original chain after some hack. It seems like a low price and low development. But with the merger, the ETH miners are going to move to ETC. This will give it more hashpower and protect it from double spend 51% attacks that have happened in the past. It's an interesting token for me and could be a fertile playground for the next bull market or a dumpster fire like BCH. I am curious what others think of Ethereum Classic. I don't hear it talked about much, anymore.",

ETC is far better to be an alternative coin to be mined by miners. New fork coin will be only giving very bad image to the crypto which always issuing the scam coin. I think that so many miners have been starting migrate to the ETC. ETC will be secure blockchain if there would be so many miners are coming to this blockchain.",

So it's just that ETC is for POW miners who are really die-hard mining it. So why would they choose to migrate now instead of starting it first? They probably want to stay with ETH mainchain because it's the main one. So presumably, they would get the ETHpow or something.",

We have thousands of projects build on ETH. Bilions in TVL on liquidity platforms. Great solutions like AMM. DEFI, NFT. ETC did nothing last years when whole market moved forward. ETC is not an alternative for ETH. BNB, SOL, AVAX, DOT are. ETC is dead.About ETH miners (GPU miners). They will move to mine other coins but 99% will have to quit. ETH is $200B network. ETC is $4B. So if 2% of ETH miners will move to ETC mining difficulty will double making it unprofitable to mine. And price will not fallow. Its the opposite.

ETC is different, it already has a large enough community and long enough support. As for the miners, when ETHpos is completed, they will have no choice but to follow the crowd if they do not want to be eliminated. I think ETC is still the most profitable.",

They probably want to stay with ETH mainchain because it's the main one.   Many with 5GB memory chips will stay with ETH until the end because it is the most profitable coin to mine.

Quote from: tvplus006 on August 21, 2022, 10:05:27 AMOwners of GPU miners will still have to make a choice and connect their machines to another network.  It ain't just GPU miners on Ethereum. They have purpose built ASICs going from $1000 to $30000. This one is $27k: https://ipollo.com/products/ipollo-v/But can't feel too bad as they make the choice to buy it. Mining is full of overpriced equipment and unexperienced people do not know to take into account difficulty increase. But people with this equipment will seek ROI and really only have ETC as an alternative. This will move up hash rate by force instead of it following price. It will be tricky for miners and could end up being another Dash situation (where you need to pay $0.01 per kW/h to make $0.10 per day with the best equipment). Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on August 21, 2022, 10:53:01 AMWith Ethereum Classic, it is similar to Dogecoin. It is truly to say there are more developments for Ethereum Classic than Dogecoin that nearly has no development. That makes me think that both are driven by community and actually decent because  they are not a scam. Many of the ERC series tokens are designed to make a dev team or individual wealthy. DOGE had massive returns and became a meme coin after being \"dead\" for 8 years or more. I wonder if the same could happen with ETC. My biggest issue with ETC was when the 51% attack occurred. But that seems less likely now. And looking at the ECIP (Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals) list, there seems to actually be a lot of devs working on the core software: https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/core. But there aren't the front end developments like DeFi and such.------------                     -------------------------                     -------------------------                     -------------------------                     -------------------------                     -----It seems to have some strong fundamental potential for attention and price rise. Instead of buying and ERC20 token, paying $70 to \"bridge\" to a new network via an unknown and unregulated third party website, like zapper.fi, it seems like a path of lower resistance to use the same programming language on the other Virtual Ethereum Machine. It'd certainly be easier for those less technically inclined. And it has the scarcity component of only 210,700,000 to exist, instead of ETH with a max supply of ∞",
