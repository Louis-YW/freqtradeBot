Kids should be advice to save and this savings should be use by parents to buy important things for there so they no the worth of every penny2. Teaching them how to live within there financial means: one mistake parents make his giving almost everything to kids sometimes you have to deprive them of little things just to have them to be contented with what they have.3. Them little amount to manage: if there is a particular thing I could remember during our early days was when parents will give us our monthly/weekly upkeep, this will help plan for the entire time span. With this one had financial discipline.You should also speak to them about the family financial problem at a older age.Advice them to take jobs or perform some task themselves either for you and you pay them",

And I believe strongly that most rich have been able to bring up the topic at home and they expose it while they are on a round Table..I think financial education has always been and is still part of the curriculum of the educational system. Each financial topic is introduced to pupils gradually based on their age and class. As they advance to junior and senior high school subjects like business studies, financial accounting, entrepreneurship education, and economics are introduced to the students. I am speaking based on the educational system of my country.  QuoteWe are in a fast paced Global world now that everything is  changing rapidly,regardless financial education should be introduced as a topic or a knowledge to be empowered to the children while growing up.Like me.now,as a woman while bringing up kids..I'll make sure I give them the basic highlights of the knowledge on Financial education to my kids in order to groom their mindsets and everything so they will get the knowledge on how to tackle issues relating to that.Most parents assume now that we are in a fast-moving world hence their children should be introduced to diverse fields at a very tender age to enable them to succeed in life. This assumption might not be very correct. Children should be allowed to enjoy their childhood stage because they need to build other important aspects of their lives at this stage. They should not be forced to learn something that is above their level. Although we have some exceptional cases where children a naturally interested in finance at a very tender age, they should be allowed to mature before they are introduced to finance. Children at a tender age should be allowed to build their interpersonal relationships so that they can be able to build attributes like patience, compassion, love, selflessness, etc.    QuoteWith this it will inculcate a nurtured desire and also financial stability and build them to be financially inclined from tender age.and I advice it should be utilised  and implemented.It is very important to expose children to financial education when they become teenagers and can understand these lessons. For now, I just give a few bucks to my children and tell them to save them in piggy banks and after a few months, we use the money to buy some local fowls. I ensure they help in raising the birds until they reproduce and in a few months we see the hens laying and hatching their eggs and we celebrate our profits from our investment.",

      "body": "Certainly, this is a vital subject that should be taught in schools. Personally, I remember saving money from a very young age. I'm not sure how or by whom I was taught, but I'm pretty sure it had something to do with my parents' lack of wealth and their early adoption of the concept of not wasting money. Saving has definitely helped me a lot in life; even as a teenager, I always had money on hand. Later on, I could afford luxuries my peers at university couldn't, such as purchasing a car or a decent laptop. I don't identify as stingy by any means, but I'll try to avoid buying the most expensive stuff. For instance, I've bought a cheap refurbished laptop instead of a new one. It cost me more than half of what a new one would have while getting the job done.Meanwhile, other coworkers my age struggled to get through the month because they were wasting all their money on random stuff, also involving heavy drinking, partying, and zero budgeting. It's surprising that a large number of similarly aged acquaintances and friends haven't fathomed the importance of saving and budgeting. I understand that times are difficult, but not being able to save a single euro by the end of the month is unacceptable. To this day, I have a decent sum of money saved, and at the same time, I have investments in cryptocurrencies, securing my financial freedom for the time being.",

      "body": "You have said well but lemme throw little thing inside.When i was very tender 26 years ago in my Primary school they have never taught us about financial advised or how to make money instead they were teaching other things. Even our parents at home never did because they were afraid if they do we won't focus on our academic pursuit so it was hidden from us to know about life before letting us aware of that. During then i have a friend who don't like coming to school rather talks about business all time in class and he opened clearly that he can't make it through school, even instigating that if we can make it through school why are does who graduated with best grade or distinction have not become a billionaire. He went ahead asking me why are out teachers walking on barefoot to school without driving an expensive car while coming.And i replied is because they are not following the principle of money. To cut it short, we met 2 years ago and guess what?He is an exporter/importer but not academically sound, he said if he knew he would have just developed little time study while planning for his business moves., today he has enrolled himself back to school learning things he never paid attention to study.In SummarySchool is the gateway to prosperity if you study very well and have a business mindset.So whatever may be the cases there is time to expose about money to you kids otherwise they will be carried away by money without having the core educational background, it's better for kids to finished nursery/primary school or even Secondary before inducing monetary language in them, maybe as parents it could be reveal to them at their University level by then they are matured in mind and in thinking to combine school and to become successful in life.",

Guess what, 25+ years later and I’ve never come close to needing to know how to do calculus (this is just one example). I agree with you about what schools should teach. I've heard it said that teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic would only take 3 hours a day. But it is basic finance knowledge that is most needed after the 3.I think that part of the reason it isn't taught much, is that teachers and schools don't really understand the basics themselves. As a financial advisor, could you please tell us where money comes from in the first place. I mean, Biden is turning over $billions to Ukraine. Where does it come from? And how and where does he get the authority?The direct control of 'printing' the money comes from somewhere. Where does it come from and who controls it and what do they use as a base for their controls, so they can say, we should print more now?But not all the laws and policies. Rather, a simple understanding of where money comes from and who controls when and why to 'print' it. The schools need to know this so that they can teach it.",

How is this going to be checked if I may ask you, who would be doing the checking and what makes you think there won't be corners to it?Anything born out of force won't work and people could actually pretend for a time being until what is in view is archived and afterwards, they are right back to there ways of lavish lifestyle.It's really up to an individual to see reasons why rather than being forced to. Also, subjecting it to marriage won't be enough as we've got gay parents now and single parents. They just get a Foster kind and the parenting is on. Relations to it just invites them to cut corners.",

I've seen adults pay just the minimum of their credit card bills and then act all surprised when they get slapped with massive amounts of interest. Or who run out of money a week before the next paycheck and have to take loans, again with large interests. I even know people who pawn their paycheck ATMs. I don't believe those sort of people would be teaching their children good financial knowledge. So it seems adding it to curriculum is the way. At least financial education is less controversial than sex education (another topic parents tend to fail at).",
