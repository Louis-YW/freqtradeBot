  "content": "NEVER CONNECT/LINK YOUR WALLET WITH A WEBSITE YOU DON'T TRUST TO 100% AND EVEN IF YOU TRUST IT DON'T CONNECT/LINK IT!I want to make you aware of this advanced scam attempt! I been trading a lot lately with coins in the Solana network and I also noticed some scams and I think it's better to expose it here and hopefully it can save at least one soul from not getting scammed in this way. Everyone can't know everything and I surely don't blame the victim for being scammed at any point, If we can avoid a scam we should always do it, so to the scam. If you have a Solana wallet you will find it in Solscan and when you search for your address if your address example is https://solscan.io/account/4SAYiD5ZL4meDW61cnb9U5s1xvQtCbYZjmvB6aCbVT25You will see the address have some staked sol and some meme coins in Bonk. When you open to see all the tokens list you see two more that looks like a air-drop and a air-drop can be tempting right? Be careful!!It's a scam and yes it's quite obvious but not for an untrained eye. So basically they say they will give you free coins but instead stealing your coins!What you not should do is fall for this \"air-drop scam\". You won't get any air-drop what you will receive is an empty wallet crypto wallet, it's as you sure understand by now a pure scam.  This is one address that funds are send to: https://solscan.io/account/Compu3aDeye2pAkN9BC5EzsLDS4hFSBDsEBHzNX7Ynqj and the token value is much higher since the value of the tokens is not updated there.Be aware out there guys. -           It should say \"want you to connect your Solana wallet\" not \"collect your Solana wallet\"",

But I agree wit you best to ignore them completely! I would never click or fish for airdrop if I need crypto I buy it. But maybe some will try to get free coins and this can help them from being scammed and losing their fundsQuote from: rat03gopoh on December 13, 2023, 03:17:49 PMThis annoying trick has actually been used a lot on the EVM chains too, I also got spam unknown nft tokens some time after claiming the domain on UD.

I wish they could meet all the faces they scammed true the years so they could get some regret and stop this shit. We should not scam each other we should help each other against higher powers.",
