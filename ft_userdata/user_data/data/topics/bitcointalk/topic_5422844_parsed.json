  "content": "#CATENA_Network#CMCX_Coin CMCX, the native #crypto token of the #COREMultiChain #blockchain framework, can soon be used as payment in 15 countries worldwide through CORE’s latest partnership with IvendPay. The integration with IvendPay means that CMCX holders from the supported 15 countries will be able to make payments with #CMCX at selected point of sales (POS) devices and vending machines. CMCX will soon join IvendPay’s list of supported cryptos which include the two crypto market leaders - #Bitcoin and #Ethereum. The list also includes #Binance Coin, #Litecoin, #Shiba Inu, and a handful of other cryptos. We look forward to seeing our global community transact with CMCX in multiple countries, and together we will grow! ➖➖➖➖➖☑️ More information: https://coremultichain.comhttps://ivendpay.come TOGETHER WE GROW ➖➖➖➖➖#CATENA_Network#CMCX_Coin#CMCX #COREMultiChain #ivendpay #POS #vending",
