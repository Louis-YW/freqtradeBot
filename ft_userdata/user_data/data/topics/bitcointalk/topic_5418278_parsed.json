In fact, such people only need to understand that losing at the casino or betting is a completely natural phenomenon. And if you look at the statistics gamblers lose much more often than they win. So it's better to play for fun and not to keep track of their statistics.",

There are days of losses and days of making profits and I will advice you not to do so As for me, I do not think about gambling this way, I just gamble little and I do not have to let people know about my profits or losses. If you lose and play more for you to let people see that you will, what if the losses continur? It increyase the chance of you losing more.",

It will be frustrating if there were days that he canâ€™t win and will tend to play more just to win and to have something to post to the point that he will not notice that he have more losses than winning. Many now post everything they do online for fame, it either people admire him or hope he will win or not, any of the two we will need to be responsible in our action and know when to stop when losses and winning happens.",

The tendency to chase losses depends on the drive of the gambler and his resources as well. There are times a gambler who's suffering from loss will continue playing to get back with his losses which sometimes being referred as greed. There are also times wherein no matter how the gambler wants to recover from his loss, he willbe forced to stop because of his capital. In terms of posting social media which I believe can be or relevant with 'clout chasing', i think it is not a strong basis because users could just post their winning bets or recycle past winnings if they are just into clout. There are ofcourse times these variables would correlate but most of the time with weak relationship.",

But if you're posting that in social medias, you'll just going to extract all of those negative energies that might be from your friends that don't want to see you winning. You may get some secret desire that you should incur losses instead of winning from your friends on social media. Although, I don't see anything wrong if you do that at most times but, try also to practice to post your losses if you're sharing your wins but it's fine if you want to just keep them.",
