      "body": "Yes that's a strategy to beat casino but with extreme low probability that is not paid with high enough reward (poor risk/reward ratio) so its not the strategy that can be used for anyone because on average 60 out of 100 will not even double before loosing everything. So its not like every person who starts wins and only those who stays long enough in casino are losing. Some lose everything without being in a profit even a penny. It's a myth that new gamblers (first time in a casino) are luckier than others.Casino is a place to have fun and feel extreme emotions. Not a place to easily win first million.",

As long as there are people playing in the casino, they will always operate, and they will surely make money off of people that way. If a lot of gamblers that win have this kind of self-control that, in the event that they win big they never played into any casino again, then the house may be beaten and they might close their doors for good. But again, most of these are theoretical, but a good one at that.",

In other words, the house is not that easy to beat and I don't think someone can beat the house when it comes to gambling and most gamblers always lose.",

If you win a large sum in a casino on your first visit and never return, the first scenario you stated, may be seen as a win. You were fortunate to have time to withdraw your winnings before the odds caught up with you.In the second case, it would be wise to use the money you received to launch your own company. If you're able to utilize your gains to improve yourself and your future, then I'd say you've \"fought\" the house in that sense. Gambling may be addicting, I'd suggest to learn how to stop",

But if you are going to ask my side if I were in that situation, of course, I will return and gamble but only those limited amount so that I know how to control my limit and probably the house cannot get back what I have won or it could be a long term but at least I am enjoyed. That is why gamblers act, they never mind what they lose but if they will win they are very happy considering that they lose a lot more than they won. So if you are running away form that gambling casino, can you promise yourself to never gamble again? I don't know if there is a gambler like that.",

But if you are a player who knows when to stop, you can go home as winner also.And what the OP presented is for me, one way to beat the house. You stop once you got your winnings.And use your winnings to improve your living. But remember, more gamblers will continue to play up until they lose it all, hence, why house always wins.",

Smart people would stop once they get a big win and invest that money in something profitable since we all know that if you continue playing the casino will take all that money back if not more.I can give you a small example of Don Johnson with a quick search on google you can get many similar gamblers with insane profits which we can say they beaten the casino, But in the other hand itâs the casino is earning much more than they lose from the small amount of people who could gain from gambling so it doesnât really matter for the casino but the opposite way that may bring more gamblers when they hear someone could earn much money with that casino and would like to try their chances there. 1 person beat the house but 100 or more people lose against the house.",
