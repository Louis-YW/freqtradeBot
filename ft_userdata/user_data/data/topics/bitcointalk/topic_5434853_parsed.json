The funded usually went for higher ofc...The real difference is the laser-mark, let's face it.As a result of these BF coins, many people sold them on ebay and such, WITHOUT providing any sort of provenance or lists of addresses, leading to de-valuing of many of those coins over the years compared to the Non-BF lasermarked coins. The premiums have always been higher for non BF coins, but that has already changed as the lust for \"Smoothie\" coins continues... Both new and aftermarket/Auction sales, obviously.Get stacking fellas, as smoothie is not going to do this forever, let's face it!",
