Investment and saving is so important for all of us, it is good to be disciplined with your financial life so as not to create problems for yourself in the future, but you have to reward yourself with some of the money you make, you cannot save it all, as long as you are not being extravagant, there is nothing wrong with gratification.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on August 19, 2022, 09:39:22 PMDoes it therefore mean that the outcome of an investment can be determined in advance when we delay enjoyment/gratification? The outcome of an investment can be determined in advance by looking as what you invested in, when, the amount of capital invested, is it long or short term, etc, for gratification, it has nothing to do with it.",

The fact is delayed gratification is amazing but it also needs \" no disaster in between the maturation time for either the investment or something else as well \" But it's certainly rewarding to have that much patience..",

It cannot be determined exactly but you can make approximate calculations to get an idea, bearing in mind that the outcome may vary. For example, on this site:https://dcabtc.com/You can calculate the return from doing DCA with bitcoin, but that is based on past performance, which in the future need not be the same.",

Sadness could make people search for things that can make them happy and such things typically cost money or don't come free of charge.Look for your cheap and good source of happiness and time will run fast to help you delay the gratification.",

I think there is no need to starve or delay gratification just because you want to invest in something or a certain product. Because life is to be enjoyed and investment can be done freely and as much as you can so there is no need to be hungry just because you want to invest and think it is your consistency. Because holding back and delaying enjoying gratification until you get sick or die from starvation, it's far more ridiculous than investing in what you have now.",

I guess this what separates from success and failure. I mean if you have that kind of mindset, to delay everything and think of a long term plan or goal then it could be gratifying down the line 5-10 years.For example in bitcoin, right now we are in a bear market, so it's a period of accumulation. But there will be times that you might be tempted to sell off for nothing. So it will take a lot of mental toughness to have that delayed gratification in the next bull run as you might get a huge profit by investing right now.",

We can only make a best guess at future outcomes based on all previous scenarios and the amount of data that is available to analyse. Looking at the stock market for instance, we see that over the last hundred years it has returned on average between 6-10% per year but it is slowly trending downwards. There is a lot of data available, it also shows that there is a recession roughly every 8 years and a correction roughly every 2-3 years. If you're talking about Bitcoin, we only have roughly 13 years of information to work with and that is very little in the grand scheme of things. So if you stick with the stock market and buy the right investment products, you have a good idea of what will happen but the same certainty is not available for cryptocurrency.",

      "body": "Risk and reward are strongly correlated in finance, business and investment. Strong potential, short term, profits trend with elevated risk. These generalizations are usually accurate within the profile of investments and opportunities. Its uncommon to find an investment opportunity with high potential, short term, gains that is a low risk venture. The role of an investor and buisnessman concerned with profits could be one of mitigating risk. Balancing potential gains versus risk assessments. There's a common saying in markets that the best time to buy is when there's blood in the streets. Pro, high volatility, trading. High risk, high potential reward. Those who play that game usually have advantages over other traders in order to profit consistently.For the average person. It can be beneficial to prioritize long term stability and gains with a lower risk curve. Don't get caught up in the gold fever and swell of emotions which correlates with a flatlining of account balances.Its well worth it to search for good opportunities and develop perception in separating the good from the bad. Rather than try to take off on every new wave that rolls in.",

I don't think delaying the gratification of our investments is the best method to determine the success of our investment. Your are right that keeping our money invested longer usually means we get a higher return. Both consumption or saving in a bank account gives no return at the moment. Together with the inflation the only alternative we have is to invest, but there can be bad investment. In case we pick a mediocre or bad investment it will not lead to good returns, even if we delay our gratification. That's why we need to keep monitoring our portfolio and reevaluate oir positions. Sometimes it's better to cut losses and move on, instead of waiting for something to turn around. Long term investing is still the most important tool to build wealth.",

Not exactly. You can be disciplined and not spend your funds frivolously -- that does not guarantee the outcome in investing. Investing is still a risk.

If you delay something like purchasing a new car then you have the money right now so you can use it as capital which gives returns to you so later you can buy the same thing you wanted along with the money which you have earned from the capital alone so it means delaying will give the opportunity to buy something with no spending of money.",

But for those who can wait, they can reap the rewards and enjoy the fruit of their patience of holding off. But this is only true if  your investment is worth waiting for.

Honestly, it depends on the occasion, but the general rule does apply into building your future. However, there are others who claim that it's best to cherish today, because you don't know what the future holds for us. The majority of people neglects the importance of investing and either simply save their money to a bank or is unable to save at all. In the first scenario, your money is susceptible to inflation and just sits there losing value, while in the latter, you live from paycheck to paycheck.Bitcoin has enabled myself to look forward to a better future, which is essential, especially now, that everything is going downhill. Personally, I'm holding as much as I can accumulate, while investing another sum of money into DeFi, achieving an average of 10% APY, at least till I can come up with a better plan.",
