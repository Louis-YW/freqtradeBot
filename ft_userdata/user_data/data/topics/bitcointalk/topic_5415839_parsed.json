  "content": "I want to read information very often on this forum but the problem is that light theme puts a huge strain on my eyes when I don't use a device with retina display.I was just thinking, what's stopping us from using the dark mode on this forum without 3rd party extensions? And answer is, yes, nothing! ¬†Here are the steps that we need from forum owners to have a dark mode right now 1. We need to put current colors and dark mode colors in CSS Variables.2. CSS gradient generator for keeping the gradients on dark mode.3. Just one Icon4. A very small JS code, just some lines.As some of you might know, I challenged myself to build responsive version of current theme. So, I decided to follow that steps and added dark mode on bitcointalk's website that I built and deployed on GitHub static page.How to test dark mode?1. Visit: https://jaybates19.github.io/bitcointalk/2. Click on  icon that's located on the right side, under the search button.If you can't see it or have some problems, either clean your cache or open the incognito tab and load website from there.3. Cheers, have a nice day! Hope, we will really see dark mode on this forum.",

      "body": "Honestly, I find these brain-work very fascinating and helpful. But don't you think someone came up with this, few years ago and maybe, the fact was annulled based on some unanimous insubordination or, maybe, a repelling side-effect - like emojis are gonna be lost or theme colours can't have effect at the same time? I'm just guessing anyways,why? Because it's a common development that anyone would think of -- the likes of THEYMOS himself -- but, on the contrary, nothing was done.Dark mode is cool. Needless of enumerating its function to you. Synchronize, you shouldn't stress yourself mentioning codes to Theymos, or how it can be made to function, They know alot more than we do. Maybe you are just tryna prove yourself - that you know what you're insinuating - good.Let's talk about this guys.Cheers ,Sandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

Several online sites which aren't even as old as BTT have the dark mode option (though I don't like using it) and it won't be a bad idea to have such implemented in this noble forum too. I've been given to understand from what I've read in this thread that there was a time a few years ago this same issue was debated. Whatever that happened that made it not see the light of the day shouldn't resurface now. Theymos should let us have that option. We should be upgrading.Synchronice, thank you for revisiting that issue.",

Because if I don't have skills to test them, I don't feel safely to use them.I might be too skeptical but having a dark mode does not change my life. If I can have it officially from a website, I will use it. If I have to install something else to have a dark mode, I skip it.The more times you try with unknown things, the more risks you are readily to take.",
