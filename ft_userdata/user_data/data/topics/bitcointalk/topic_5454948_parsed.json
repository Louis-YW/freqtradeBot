It is sad to see this.Some people do not think about the consequences of using high amount of money on gambling, but when they lose the huge amount of money, they will be depressed and some people will feel like killing themselves.

Supposing he knows about this forum, maybe he would have learned some lessons from what we are posting.",

Most of tehm prbably read somewhere online or saw it in the news about how someone was lucky enough to have won a huge amount of money just by betting his cents and then they decide to try their luck but instead of them to win or atleast enjoy their section at the casino they start chasing losses and when they run out of their personal money they might start using money meant for other things ( like in the case of Op).Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on June 03, 2023, 08:30:31 AMI hope we all as gamblers learn a thing or two from this, and go back and look at our gambling life and see if there is a thing or two that needs to be adjusted..I think this is a great idea, once in a while we need to sit back and look at how we have being handling our gambling life if the are things that we are currently doing that will affect our lives and sometimes we do somethings thinking it's what everyne does not knowing that it might cause an effect that's different entirely from what it did to others, after not everyone can handle things the same way. don't forget to always \"play safe\"All I can say at this point is: May His Soul Rest In Peace.",

I know that this is very painful, but there is nothing we can do other than advise ourselves and those closest to us so that we can always avoid gambling addiction in any way and at least be able to educate them more about how dangerous the effects of addiction are. People whose thoughts are deadlocked with hope and feel that everything is finished, that is where our role is, if indeed there is someone closest to experiencing a problem like this, we must be able to become advisors. So in gambling, everyone returns to themselves, they must be able to emphasize the mentality that gambling is just a game, nothing more than that.",

It's sad that some individuals who find themselves in such a desperate situation often struggle to reach out for support or confide in their loved ones. They may isolate themselves, feeling trapped and hopeless.How can we as a society create a more supportive environment for individuals struggling with gambling addiction? How can we encourage a more responsible gambling culture that emphasizes moderation and healthy boundaries? These are the questions we really need to answer if we want to avoid or at least lower the chances of these sad stories happening again in the future.",

This is one of the saddest stories I have ever read. How much was his school bills? A few ten K's? A hundred k? He could have made x10 more than that even without a college degree. All he had to do was to work hard. I have friends started with nothing in the US and become multi millionaires in less than 10 years. They all had good professions though some of them didn't have any college degrees. Since this student was 22 y.o., he could have learned another profession without the help of the college and still make big bucks... Shame.",

If he had had good conversation with some moralists, he would have come out of this shame. By now, I believe his friend would not even be happy seeing him die. He would rather choose to drop out of school than to lose a friend because of a lost school fees. Children need close mentoring and counseling in order not to deviate from normal.",

Thank you, OP for sharing. Bad news to the parents because they are going through great pain. Losing an undergraduate son in his harsh economic condition is extremely sad. All the investment in their son is a waste because of his gambling addiction. The student is 22 years old so we should write off underage gambling because the adult age in Nigeria is 18+. I would have suggested that all dependents especially students should be restricted from gambling but some students gamble responsibly so the best idea will be public enlightenment and awareness about the dangers of gambling addiction. People suffering from gambling disorder should be given free counsel and medical help because many people cannot afford to pay for these services. Let people know that there is a need to have a gambling plan that should guide their gambling life and let people suffering from gambling addiction receive help.",

This is included to those negative impacts people has to go through because they can't take the consequences of gambling anymore. We lose valuable life just because of lack of discipline. It might sound insensitive, but we have to keep reminding people to always think a hundred times before gambling. It might not be for you especially if you know it to yourself that you lack self-control. It might do more harm than good, hence, try to assess yourself first if you can handle the pressure and the temptation. If not, better find another recreational activity wherein you can release your stress and have fun, and try finding another source of income that has lesser risk if you want to gamble just for profit. Because frankly speaking, there's no guaranteed winning in gambling. Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win. It all depends whether you are lucky enough or skilled enough. So always bet what you can only afford to lose.",
