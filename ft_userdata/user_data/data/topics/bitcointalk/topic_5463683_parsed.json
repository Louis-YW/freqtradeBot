This not only implies that the project may be a scam but ultimately deceives people into thinking about the genuineness of your project. Failure to reply or to explain your side would warrant a scam accusation against the project.

They are planning to do an exit scam which is the reason that they are faking their team members, a legit project is more than proud to own its project by posting their credentials so people can check their background what they can give, and what they can accomplish, projects that's faking their credentials and plagiarize their whitepaper are considered scam.So it's easy to tell that this has the potential to scam their investors so people should take heed and let this be a warning.Let's see if the representative and the owner will show up to defend their project.",
