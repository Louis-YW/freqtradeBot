A lot of exchange do use the same address for all EVM compatible chains (Polygon, BSC, fantom, arbitrum, zkSync, optimism etc.) Now that you've made the withdrawal, i would assume you tried to check the deposit address again and it's still the one you used? If so, then this could be an issue with the exchange not detecting your transaction, and not with you sending funds to the wrong address.I would reach out to the support of the second exchange. This is assuming you're using two reputables platforms.",

It shouldn't take that long if the withdrawal was successful like you said, and you were given a tx hash so just to be sure, check the transaction in arbitrum's explorer and see how many confirmations it has and then compare that to the confirmations required by the exchange. If you could share the name of the exchange, that would probably help.",

If you send it to another exchange, it may take longer confirmation before the coin will appear as deposit. You can check the minimum confirmation for Arbitrum deposit on the exchange you transferred it to. But if it is a noncustodial wallet that you sent it to, contact the customer support of the exchange that you sent it to as soon as possible if you see the coin confirm on the blockchain.",

The only solution to this is to sent out some ticket or get some support on that platform if you are really thatsure with the address and explain the situation because they are the only ones who could do such thing.",

You'll need to contact the exchange, probably pay a small administration fee to fix the discrepancy. It definitely is not lost though and if they tell you that, be firm, as it's not true that it's irrecoverable. If they charge you more than 10 USD in administration as well, don't accept that and write a negative review. It takes less than 3 minutes to fix the issue no matter the size of the exchange.",

If the exchange where you deposited the USDT supports the Bep20 network, you will definitely receive your USDT. In this case, there may be some other problem or the network may be crowded. If your block confirmation is delayed then it may take time to deposit your USD. You can talk to your exchange's support team as it might be delayed for some exchange maintenance.However, if you have selected a suspended network for USDT deposits, it may take longer for your dollars to be deposited. But before you deposit anything, you must be careful which network you choose.",

If you check the USDT BEP 20 and Arbitrum One deposit address in Binance, both are the same, but if you go to your Kucoin exchange. And check USDT Arbitrum one and BEP 20 address in deposit address, you will see that both are different.Not every network address is necessarily different, some networks give the same address. When both your networks have the same address, you can of course deposit to either BEP20 or Arbitrum One, in both cases you will receive USDT.There is no room for even the slightest mistake in digital currency transfer, you may have made a mistake during the transfer of money due to which your money went to the wrong address.According to you, the address of both BEP 20 and Arbitram One is same. Your collection method also seems fine. It is better to contact the customer service of that exchange.",

But since its an arbitrum and bsc network it should be identical deposit address format like started with \"0x\" its just that youve mistakenly choose a wrong network hence it resulted to an error.

However, generally, exchanges use an average recommendation fee for sending which will be confirmed more quickly.The withdrawal time has stepped 1 day, it should have got more than the minimum confirmation amount to be credited on any exchange. If not:- Make sure that you don't give a different deposit address (in case you get confused).- Submit a ticket to support.",

I think 90 minutes were actually long for USDT transactions, most especially for Arbitrum when the network is new and seems fast enough than the majority. Your explanation about the same address for a lot of Blockchain seems right because the OP also said that the address are the same to the BSC network.I already encountered this even in some Ethereum coins/tokens, and Tron. So, maybe you are also right that there is only a delay or it's only a co-incidence that the exchange had some issues but it's scary on the part of the OP. To be more sure, he can also follow your advice of contacting the customer support. Rest assured that everything is fine in his side.",
