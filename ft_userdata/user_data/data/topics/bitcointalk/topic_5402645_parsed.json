He spent it so much on gambling which is another reason to blame him. All I think is that he may want to play smart, knowing authority will still come for the money, but just use it to fastly take a chance and use part of it to gamble continuously and losing it. That money is very huge for the man not to be blamed, he should be blamed.",

      "body": "Yes, the man is entirely at fault, if you receive many that are not yours in your bank account the legal thing to do is to call the attention of the banks so that the mistake can be corrected not to withdraw the money that is not legally yours and gamble it away. The man did not act responsibly and has gotten himself indebted by his action I think the man also should be observed as he seems to have a gambling disorder from the way he acted. In my country, such an act attracts jail terms because that is a criminal act.",

He should have reported it to his bank manager or authority.In my country, if he had reported it to the bank manager or authority, he would have been rewarded with some amount of money, some organizations would have even rewarded him for his honesty and he would have been offered jobs in higher organizations. The reward may not be up to 10 fold of the money, but his reputation would have been 10 times more.",

I think we've just seen the entire effect of being addicte to gambling. The man who mistakenly sent him money was at fault but even it was mistakenly sent to him, he should haven't touched the funds and do whatever he wants from it. He's aware of the consequences of the actions he has made and also, maybe he's itching to gamble and after seeing that money on his bank account, it has ticked him to gamble no matter what happens and soon if he wins, he'll just return the money. But, the unexpected has happened and he lost all of it, now, with the consequences that he understood before doing that action, he has to pay it.",

How come he can be mistaken about it where in the first place, he knows it was supposed to be shared among 436. If we are to elaborate on the story, the man has an access to relief funds that are worth 46.3M Yen. Instead of sharing it with 4365 people, it's impossible that he didn't know that his account was the one to receive the funds. And what's worst? He knows that it was a mistake but still used it to gamble. It's a form of corruption already and this man should be sued.",

However for clean conscience, he is at fault because obviously it isn't his money he knows that for sure but still spend it. The bank also didn't ask where the funds are from.

I mean if it was a few bucks then maybe, yeah I guess I'd take it (don't call me on that), but if it was THAT big of an amount? Heck, I'd think something was wrong and try to contact the bank to ask who sent it or what the actual hell happened. I have to say whoever sent the funds should also be accountable though.",
