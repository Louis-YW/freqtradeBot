  "content": "There was a recent Meta thread about the auto-linker sometimes failing to properly recognize URLs, and my name came up, so I decided to poke around and see if I could make sense of this bug.As a recap, the auto-linker can sometimes be confused by leading spaces (particularly after a post has been edited, or quoted). For example, if you post the following (a sequence of URLs with an increasing amount of leading space, meant to showcase the problem):Code:www.thefarside.com www.thefarside.com  www.thefarside.com   www.thefarside.com    www.thefarside.com     www.thefarside.com      www.thefarside.com       www.thefarside.comThen it'll (initially) render correctly, like this:But after an edit (even one that doesn't change anything), it'll render incorrectly, like this (i.e. links with 2/4/6 leading spaces no longer recognized):If the original post is quoted, then it'll render like this (i.e. links with 3/5/7 leading spaces no longer recognized):(And if the quoted post were edited, it would revert to links with 2/4/6 leading spaces no longer being recognized.)Pretty weird, huh?Now, I know there are a few places in SMF where whitespace conversions happen (that's part of the reason I did the [nbsp] patch, so that non-breaking spaces could be used in a way that wouldn't be undone by those conversions). So, I don't find this bug that perplexing (though, I was surprised that the bug persisted even after bypassing preparsecode() and un_preparsecode(); I had figured that something in one of those two functions was behind spacing not \"round-tripping\" correctly on SMF).Anyway, regardless of the ultimate source(s) of spacing getting silently messed with when you edit (or quote) a post, this particular bug is caused by the URL regexes in the auto-linker not properly taking this state of affairs into account (which is odd, because the e-mail regexes do). Specifically, the positive lookbehind assertions aren't aware of non-breaking spaces (and the second regex, the one for schemeless URLs, needs an additional tweak in order to prevent this bug from sometimes presenting during post preview).Here's the diff for @theymos:Code:--- baseline/Sources/Subs.php 2011-09-17 21:59:55.000000000 +0000+++ modified/Sources/Subs.php 2023-09-07 15:04:45.000000000 +0000@@ -1820,36 +1820,39 @@      // Don't go backwards.     //!!!
