A Wells notice is the way that SEC staff tells a company that they are recommending that the SEC take enforcement action for possible violations of securities laws. It is not a formal charge or lawsuit, but it can lead to one. Rest assured, Coinbase products and services continue to operate as usual - today’s news does not require any changes to our current products or services. \"Justin Sunhttps://www.reuters.com/legal/sec-sues-justin-sun-others-over-illegal-crypto-sales-2023-03-22/https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/22/sec-sues-tron-founder-and-celebrities-including-lindsay-lohan-jake-paul-and-soulja-boy-for-crypto-securities-violations/\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, on allegations of orchestrating “unregistered offer and sale, manipulative trading and unlawful touting of crypto asset securities,” the agency stated Wednesday.The SEC said it was suing Sun, his Tron foundation, the BitTorrent Foundation and BitTorrent (now referred to as Rainberry) over the sale of two tokens: TRON, or TRX, and bitTorrent, or BTT. Both TRX and BTT were referred to as unregistered crypto asset securities by the SEC, stoking the debate on whether cryptocurrencies are in fact securities.Both tokens’ prices fell following the SEC charge.\"____How many fines will Coinbase and Justin Sun pay?Reply from Justin Sunhttps://twitter.com/justinsuntron/status/1638742625003130881https://twitter.com/gurgavin/status/1638656154250412033\"JUST YESTERDAY COINBASE CEO REPORTED SELLING MILLIONS IN COINBASE $COIN SHARES ( PART OF HIS 10B5-1)\"",

Ryoshi is the only name I know about the Shit coin token Shiba Inu but the coin token have a huge number of in trading volume about $200M+ daily trading volume. I think Shiba Inu is an outlier, to be honest. They have the hype around them when they release it, around when Doge is pumping if I'm not wrong, and people are more than happy to spend their cash to pump low market cap animal tokens. The rest of the anonymous projects that I know of do have low market cap. However, I do believe the key reason is that the things that they build are not really interesting for the masses.As far as I can tell, SEC is going around with any project who do an ICO or similar thing in the past, especially those that don't limit US participants. They also go for staking services and their derivatives. If there is a new anonymous project that doesn't center around them and is interesting for customers, I believe they might be successful. Whether there will be such projects is another question though, considering how the demand for ICOs is low at the moment.",
