I believe betting company will surely market this match than spence vs crawford upcoming match because everybody wants to watch Billionaire beating ach other physically.",

Base on your question from the writers point of view,it is obvious that Musk is in a better fitness to win Zuckerberg and I believe he will. In whatever way or style that the challenge cones from, El on will win him. I think this is another way for these billionaires to draw people's attention to themselves and their projects.",

Zuck's clearly fed up with Elon and his antics, Elon being the belligerent internet idiot that he is, is still throwing shots against Zuck much to the latter's dismay. Since both parties showed interest in fighting each other in a cage match, I think we can consider this a done deal and we might see the lizard king and the twitter idiot tough it out in the Octagon. (Yes I want them to fight on a UFC sponsored match). In any case, I hope none of them chickens out of this and they really fight. We rarely see people of their caliber punch each other let alone be in a full-fledged cage match. If you told me back in 2019 that these two will be fighting each other I would've called you a dumbass for even believing this thing would happen.",

      "body": "it's a somewhat disadvantageous fight for one side, Elon Musk is 51 years old, although he appears to be a person with a good physique, that doesn't change the fact that he is 51 years old, even the great fighters that they have already retired from professional fights but those who are doing these exhibition fights are not fighting when they are over 50 years old, fighting at that age would not be good for their health, I am not a doctor but I have seen a report on tv in which they talk about the danger to be fighting when the person is already at a very advanced ageon the other side we have the owner of the meta who is 39 years old and young, I don't know if he keeps practicing some fighting style but even if he didn't practice he would still have the advantage of being very young in relation to his opponent, I don't know if they intend to boxing or mma, but knowing that they are rich, I can only assume that they intend to fight boxing, it is the least dangerous for both of them, but it is something very exhausting, my bet would go to Elon Musk. despite his age if it was a boxing match he would win by decision of the judges, the owner of the meta would get tired early and be an easy target for punches from Elon Musk",

I'm voting for Elon. Though he may be actually disadvantageous I guess? Just the age gap is enough of a factor to see that imo. Still while it may just be empty entertainment, hey, it's still entertainment. I just hope this is actually legit, I'd definitely watch it.As for price effects, no. Maybe if one of them gets badly (like really badly) injured? or maybe even die. Highly unlikely though. It's just a fight, you can actually compare it to a gangster fight in the neighborhood, it doesn't really affect the big picture of well, anything else. I doubt a physical fight would make them lose the trust of their investors after all. There's a reason why a lot of people say it's a lot easier to just punch it out face to face than fight it out while being hidden from each other (idk if I got that right tbh).",

I think ts quite important to remember that Elon is a fat person with absolutely no way to go to distance and absolutely no chance to make any change at this point as well. Dude has no condition to keep fighting and none of the things he learns will become natural to him, its going to be just learned stuff he will try to remember, but Mark has made all that information into natural part of his mind at the same time. This is a very very easy W for Mark without a doubt, but better outcome would be both of them beating each other bloody of course.",

Haha, ðŸ˜‚ brother, how can you possibly be asking who know both of them, Elon and zuck are not just any social media influencer, they are the social media themselves.Elon is a Billionaire and owns Twitter, spacex, tesla and a host of others multi billion dollars companies.Zuch is a Billionaire and owns Facebook, instagram, whatsapp and a host of other multi billion dollar companies.Both are well known all over the world, I bet even a kid of 5 knows who Elon and Zuck is, so both coming out to have a fight is some thing the entire world would definitely want to see who the winner would, but then, I personally hope the fight be like a sports for them, and not born out of personal grudges or hatred or anything negative.",

Elon may not have much muscle but he has weight, which would serve in his favor to subdue Mark.Beyond the betting, I am sure it would be hilarious to see Mark getting his butt kicked and the stock of Meta going down which each punch on his face.Â  Honestly, If I was Mark I would rather to stay in the office working so the company won't go bankrupt after the Metaverse fiasco.",

That already puts him in an edge given that he has the know-how to fight and he knows a few techniques or so, and he can use that should this really happen (which I doubt). The only edge Elon has is his weight, his reach, and his height. The dude is awkward as hell, and idk if he can still carry his own weight to move around in a ring or wherever in a fight. Then again, we'll never know, not until this materializes and they get to fight it out.",

The reason, one person down to other in some means will surely have some controversies as well as leads to big debates. Sometimes this even can disturb the market of the companies owned. For this reason there is more chances that the odds will be in favour of the match ending in a draw. Lets see what's the hard reality.",

Zuckerberg on the other hand might be an agile human who could avoid all the thrown punches of Elon. But I doubt these dudes have training in boxing or anything so UFC will be their best spot. They can use anything there, just not a low blow and eye poking. They could slap each other or just bear hug all the way until the time is gone. Why am I remembering Barry Kripke versus Sheldon Cooper's (Big Bang Theory) sport fight over a spot?  I think that's how it will end up.Can such a fight influence the Crypto market? I doubt that too. This is all just made for fun and I won't expect anything out of the craziness of the idea. Those guys are the ones betting for the fighters and not hurting themselves. They could just hire someone to fight for them and whoever wins gets the bragging rights.",

I don't know who the promotor is which I think will get a lot of profit if they organize this on MGM Grand, Las Vegas. So, back to the fight, when I look at the data, Elon is seem lost if I look at how old him when comparing it with Mark. I know Elon's weight is heavier but, his old make slow for movement and hard to dodge Jiu Jitsu from Mark. But again, If Elon's stamina is still good, and he always Taekwondo exercise in every day, It's not impossible Elon won in 2 rounds. I will bet on Elon, Let me know the gambling site I can bet on it.",

Musk teased the billionaire on Twitter: \"I spoke to Mark about this. His understanding of the subject is quite limited\" and it became a very heated discussion.Elon Musk may be physically bigger than Zuckerberg, but Mark Zuckerberg practices jiu-jitsu and even won a gold medal in that category in May of this year. So if I'm very wrong and this fight does happen, all my bets will be on the owner of Facebook.But be frank.... that won't happen",
