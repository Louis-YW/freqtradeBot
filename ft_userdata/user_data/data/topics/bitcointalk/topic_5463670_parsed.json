The only business that is likely to have that are those Ponzi scheme businesses that prey on unknowing people and will only benefit the head of that scheme.",

Most businesses that make such promises are scams and fraudulent schemes. Starting and growing a business requires financial, human, and time resources. Stock or crypto traders might make fast money, but it takes a lot of time to learn and gain knowledge about the market for you to succeed. You have to also note that every business must face several challenges that it must overcome to succeed. Don't just look at the glory of profits of some businesses you see, many of them went through many hard times. Read the stories of most of these successful business executives and learn from them. Anybody that informs you that the business will be smooth and easy is not telling the truth. If you are always driven by quick profit, you will constantly be a cheap victim of scams and Ponzi schemes.",

In general, the risk is commensurate with the profits, and the least is what you get from banks. Even these bank deposits may involve risks, although they are very low.In mind your own business (MYOB), I care about customer satisfaction, continuous return even if it is low, the possibility of converting the commercial activity to another activity without large costs, you have a job or it is easy to get a job if this project fails.Beware, guaranteed profit is often associated with a Ponzi scheme which is a scam.Quote from: Latviand on August 18, 2023, 08:40:07 AMWhat kind of La La Land are you living in where any business that's started today is guaranteed to make money the next day, it might be true to some level but I don't think that it's a real thing,I think it is the salt trade, where you bring sea water, suddenly it becomes salt and you sell it.",

Not a single bad ending. I don't know what you are thinking, but you are kind of living in a game where you'll start having an income stream and having some sort of unlimited time on the business. There are no businesses that you'll start earning profit from by tomorrow, because imagine you'll put thousands or millions into that business, and it doesn't mean that you'll then earn thousands or millions the next day; you'll need to get back your capital first before you'll be getting profit.",

Don't just look at the glory of profit...What type of challenge a central banker must overcome? I think all they would do is making more headlines, or making more inflation. They would have problems when people are quiting, and stop to work for their business empire. In my opinion, many business make a lot of money without putting in a lot of efforts at all. It is highly contradict to the popular belief btw, hardwork do not equal more profit.

All this will not just take you a week or so; some times it takes up to a whole month. Then you set the place up and start running some advertisements in order to create awareness and attract some customers, which don't happen immediately.And if you also decide to go through some kind of online market, getting goods and making your service available and known to all will also cost you time and money, which I presume won't be a problem considering that you are ready for the business.So unless you want to take some kind of risk by investing in some blind business that might promise you a huge profit, there are just a few businesses out there that can give you an instant profit. Oh, I forgot, if you have a huge amount of money, you can go into the oil business. That will require some experience, connections, and money. Aside from that, there should always be buyers for such a product, and it's profitable to some point.",

There are literally hundreds of questions you need to ask yourself before one can reach out to the conclusion. Now every type of business has its own Bench Mark. It has to set it to call it a success and long term profitable business. If you are entering then start with the notebook and a pen. You need to write down entire roadmap, the timeline, what will happen when, resource management and much more. For sure, your friend has come up with some sort of MLM scheme and nothing else.
