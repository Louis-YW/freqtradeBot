  "content": "Hello guys, I have been working on this set up lately. This setup profits in uptrending market conditions, and It seems like it fails to filter out the ranging markets. I am thinking of adding ADX indicator to filter out the ranging markets may be?I briefly checked it in TradingView and it seems to have merit. Examples of results on several assets and several timeframes. I looked at the ETHUSDT and BTCUSDT on 1 hour, 4 hour, and 1-day timeframes.It opens a long position when the price is above EMA(21), Parabolic SAR, and when the MACD line is above the Signal line. Parabolic SAR and MACD indicators both have default settings.I would like to improve this further. Here is the settings:",

I forgot to mention I have the charts right below of that page in the picture and It is actually automated. So I enter the conditions, stop losses and take profits, and position size and it opens and closes automatically when the market conditions are fulfilled.",

It's not familiar tho, and tbh i never seen such setup in trading views and you can setup a settings and etc. For me it seems like a bot that will automatically buy and sell depends on the settings or programs.  Anyways, better to learn more about what indicators your using because sometimes they are not good in a current trends of the market even you are convinced that in different time frames they're showing a good sign. And IMO as well much better to provide bots than using that kind of technique because surely you can make profits than that way, wherein, you are the one who customized the settings that despite you don't even know if it will work good .",

It's not familiar tho, and tbh i never seen such setup in trading views and you can setup a settings and etc. For me it seems like a bot that will automatically buy and sell depends on the settings or programs.  It is a trading platform called cleo.finance. It has manual trade and smart trade. The one I am using is the one in the picture is smart trading. So basically you can create pretty much any conditions you want for your entry and exit conditions via typing and change the parameters of the conditions like time frame, period, inherited asset, etc. You define your position size, leverage, and set your stop losses, and take profits and you can also manage your trading set up on the chart. Once you place, it enters and exits automatically when your conditions are fulfilled.

Yea I agree with you. Currently, I am backtesting and trying different combinations, checking the results on which indicator combination will be better for filtering out the ranging market for which pairs.",
