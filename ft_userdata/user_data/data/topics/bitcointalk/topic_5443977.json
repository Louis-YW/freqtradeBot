You can check the definition below of a multisig address and it’s parts. It’s not unknown sender but rather a part of the wallet.A multisignature address is an address that is associated with more than one private key. The simplest type is an m-of-n address - it is associated with n private keys, and sending bitcoins from this address requires signatures from at least m keys. A multisignature transaction is one that sends funds from a multisignature address.Source: https://trezor.io/learn/a/what-is-multisig",

If you see unknown, that means your wallet or block explorer missing few feature since you should see address such as \"m-67202395617dc6a0a7e4eccba624f331\".[1] https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/p2ms",

You can check the definition below of a multisig address and it’s parts. It’s not unknown sender but rather a part of the wallet.It's a very limited form of multisig that only allows you to use up to 3 cosigners because the data is not hashed before it is broadcasted, unlike P2SH.Anyway, I find it very strange that P2MS's BIP was made just 2 months before the P2SH BIP. That's a very short interval where it could've been though out whether the former type was needed.",
