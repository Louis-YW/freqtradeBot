  "content": "So Teo Lopez is back, after the humiliating lost against George Kambosos, he is making his comeback, but this time he has move up in weight. He will be fighting a dangerous and experience boxer in Campa next month.Quote“I’m thankful to be back August 13. I’ve been looking forward to this since my last fight,” Lopez said. “I’ve had a lot of complications, but we’re looking towards the future and are on to bigger and better things. I’m here to take over the 140-pound division just like I did at 135. Like always, I’m going to bring excitement to the sport of boxing. The Takeover is still in full effect. You don’t want to miss it.”https://www.boxingscene.com/teofimo-lopez-pedro-campa-full-undercard-set-august-13-las-vegas--167578Another good match making on the part of Top Rank, in paper it appears that Campa is a good match against Lopez. True, but I think Lopez will beat him convincingly at 140 lbs and then Teo making some noise in this 140 lbs division. Unified champion Josh Taylor has relinquished some of the belts he have, and there will be elimination and interim fights and maybe Lopez will figure in one of those to have a belt in this division.",

Although I think he will, but it will depend on the quality of the opponent that he is facing, specially true 140 lbs.And speaking of this division, as mentioned, the 140 lbs unified champion Josh Taylor has defended one of his belt to his mandatory and it was really close that there are arguments that he lost again Jack Catterall.",

So I would agree that this is a cherry pick fight for Lopez entering a new territory at 140 lbs. So no more big fights for Haney or Davis at 135 lbs. Although we have seen Davis fight at this division already and winning a belt against a weak champion. Good for Lopez if he can win this fight and then call the other champion and established himself again.",

I don't see Campa among the top fighters in the division but this is a comeback after a loss, they are still building back his confidence to fight top contenders after with Campa.They'd have to make this comeback impressive so fighting a fading boxer will be great for him. Its however very shameful if for instance he lose.",

Teofimo should win this fight easy and then show us that he can still fight at this weight division and maybe give us that scary power he once shown when he was building his career. He is not looking for those 135 lbs champion obviously, his body can't make 135 lbs, and if ever he will face them, it will be in this stack up division. Just imagine, Haney, Davis, and then Ryan Garcia moving to 140 lbs and then we have Josh Taylor as the champion.",

He wouldn't earn anything if he rematch with Lomachenko or Kambosos since both of them doesn't have any belt and Lopez already fought many boxers in lightweight division. He might move to super lightweight division because he's shy with his losses due to overconfident, so he just started his new journey. The champion on the lightweight division are really though too, Haney and Tank.",

What was all that shouts \"I am the best\", after winning Lomachenko, for ? Why not make make a second fight against Lomachenko, I am sure Loma will instantly accept it. Or a rematch with Kambosos ? Even before the Kambosos fight, Teofimo and his dad were already planning to move up in weight to fight undisputed champion Josh Taylor. Teofimo wanted to become the first undisputed champion in 2 divisions. Although in reality, Teofimo never became undisputed in lightweight since former WBC champion Lomachenko was elevated into a WBC franchise champion while former WBC interim champion Devin Haney became the WBC champion. The new WBC franchise belts were not well-received and were never credited by the hardcore boxing community. After losing his belts to Kambosos, his dad mentioned that they will continue to their to move up. There was no rematch clause too because it was a mandatory fight that went into a purse bid.The arrogant father and son duo also dismissed a Loma rematch before the Kambosos fight. They're not man enough. They forgot that Lomachenko donated personal money of around $800,000 to them as additional payment because they demanded more money, something promoter Bob Arum cannot satisfy due to the pandemic. And Teofimo barely beat an injured version of Lomachenko who undergo surgery right after the fight.I hope this unknown Pedro Campa upsets Teofimo Lopez. Quote from: Jawhead999 on July 12, 2022, 02:26:56 PMThe champion on the lightweight division are really though too, Haney and Tank.There's only 1 legit champion in the division. Haney already collected all 4 belts in the division plus the Ring belt. Tank is a fake WBA regular champion just like the WBC franchise belt, otherwise, Haney is not undisputed.",

In his last fight against Kambosos their biggest excuse is Lopez cannot keep up with the weight anymore and he should have moved up much earlier before the Kambosos fight, maybe there's truth to this that Lopez cannot keep up with the weight anymore and draining his body is taking a big toil and he needs to move up so he is now campaigning in this division.Lopez is still dangerous and he is still powerful and skillful he just needs to be guided so he can be on the right track, this is a big comeback fight for him and he needs to be impressive.",

It occurs many times when they hurriedly try to knock out an opponent, they are under estimating a boxer. Donaire tried it to Naoya in an attempt to avenge himself and then not watching out he is also vulnerable by Naoya's power punch.Learning it the hardest way will be good for him after all Lopez is just 24. He's got a long way for his career and will probably face Kambosos with victory.",

Perhaps his body is really growing and have problems making the desired 135 lbs. Looking at his frame, it's a natural process that he will have to grow and can't make that weight anymore. So for sure that is one reason that they decided to go up to 140 lbs. Although 135 lbs has a lot of champions in Davis and Haney, but eventually this two will also have to go and move up and Lopez will have the advantage since he is the first one to do it. Even Ryan Garcia might be targeting this weight. in his fight against Tagoe, it is on a catch weight of 138 lbs. So this is a good move for Teofimo Lopez.",

And for sure Haney might not give him that opportunity since he just beat the man who beat him. So the next best move is to go up in weight try to fight an easy fighter and win.",

Such easy fights never end good. You underestimate your opponent, and then get in troubles and end with decision after a good beating. On one hand Lopez tactics is understandable - they need to gain confidence before next big fight. On the other - if you are a real champion, you do not look for easy ways.",

If he gives an outstanding victory with this one, I'm sure they quickly give him a chance to fight a champion because no one really wants to delay him when he is getting pumped up in this category.
