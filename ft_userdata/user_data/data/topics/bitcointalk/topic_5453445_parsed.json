  "content": "This is the analysis of a FAKE Mining Pool Site Address:  https://ethmine.xyz CLOUD MINING Apparently powered by:https://www.bitmain.com/ First of all….if you google ethmine.xyz you wont have any very detailed results.You will find a couple of places that suggest that it could be fake but withoun any real info. Here I will give you all the info you need to don’t follow these SCAMMERS. First of all, when you enter the MINING POOL you are asked to connect your wallet.They encourage you to use @TrustWallet and use USDT Trc20Thay only work with Trust Wallet, so we can deduct that that wallet has security failures that makes their job easy.When joining you only press a button, just that, anything else You have to pay some ETH to join but is a very low amount so it doesn’t matter. https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgqcpVHM_jmS-zMAzimoA5p1i5GHOdr3np8x5gVxZzEZQ9kQFzIbvJlfxS4TN-smwrVmeeYE1LDlE3Y7JPrFnUBqojmEILNqCmOIk4syjCVbrgyZBrziabHLPSmgwVIqPmyHXXMdie5QdNHwJfiiX_GmqZQmbP0UIA-Q_Bg-1aNedBE46CRk5Qz4iKKnAYour money you keep it in your Wallet, so, you are secure that no one can access it and you are safe. https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhXHKIo0dgT4GHYunfC-WdBifmeqDnKsiVtf0hqvwfsIl_vLJCVLDOIN6Rh2n2y6cDLQEzyGx6GMVtqKOSTGyrJr0rKueuh7omIRugopDbaSmc1KfgL9yPTqlxnWe6lzoZyG1pF6VAqcz6Qhxsg0Wh8AmzpgdOxiXuz7zJsjpEBPYG0v1ZQFYRIzu2xOQThe money is in your wallet and you can move it, transfer or whatever.That hold on the picture that you have your money safe and no one can access it. Every day you receive your profit depending on the amount you have in your wallet.2% - 2,5% or 3%As you see that everything works ok and each day you earn more, you feel safe and put more money in the wallet. After some days, you enter and you find out that your wallet is empty.Yes, empty, how….dot know. All your money is trasnfered to a wallet of their own, without any notice or any security protocol of Trus Wallet to block that transaction. When you check your profile in the Mining Pool you will find out that your money is in there.Tha very but very very good news is that you have gain an AIRDROP or a lor of money so you are VERY LUCKY.Your money was “secured” because you have to pay the TAXES of all your profits of that “fantastic” Airdrop you gain. So…your money is gone, holded in somewhere.They will only give it back to you if you pat¿y them the taxes of your gains. That mean, for example.If you have 10000USDT in your wallet they keep it and secure them.They told you to pay 8500USDT for taxes to liberate your money and the 19000USDT of the reward.Of course all of it is a lie.And these people are thieves, but this is how they work- I will post here the telephone numbers of this people.The “support” phone, where you call complaining for this situation, and other phone of one of the catching ladyes that as they told me, is the one who become your friend and encourage you to invest in the site. So keep this numbers on your mind and not trust anything from them. +16234519681+66993097882 Also, it can be a good idea to start messaging them to break their balls as much as we can.And why not…any Interpol office, FBI, or whatever …why they don’t track this guys and go and catch them?They are smart but it can be easy to do it with their resources.Track IP and phone numbers, cant be so difficulty.Why they don’t do that?That’s another question to solve out.Where are the institutions that protect us??  This are the pictures of the lady who does the catching homeworkShe don’t even speak in EnglishBut the pictures are real because the one who gave them to me make a video conversation with her, so she is real and there are not pictures stolen from other places.https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgdqb9AXgKtx82oWHldLJdU5to3MkuqZlo0vXzd1eZnQphr1Ux1nHQf1cXFm7Vcen5rGK7GKYE3gZGmRqzI81BhX1QQR3GG5yWFQgO0G_vv0sNOPMx_84Dz1mVM1oJH4knOnxVeLZASNIAyvvph-1SukgAaJar90nOQXWUylLMGyisT3njsZJQl2vZ40Qhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhWAZpVHbBk3B3EB3TALKBxCE-UusFTBIrhEA7NI_wQLyjTgnKbtLn5h_mmDtMpPjQIx8tIEtcsSvgXSqVFsI8yJmVf2wED-SpO2f4H_RU-Xz1z1ie1FOwzEYXZ6A3VwW8AtTrtC9yjc9R5X3Y1rDyLr-PYykLbrMaWTCYM0kl47ZIaP7VA-3Ct2JetQAhttps://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjj7k6iUSaPyA0FBIJ_4DPv2dOZTXYpX_06B4VFBlBck_7rC4uCmfEzFabsWDCVQj38M02dmPJxGOlsCmCwqQXPyyocqlIgMLBtbZx7l8rux2YkgL0wnkuJ8Gswae8cwiEPFpZvYmG0RnNV4IWfd8IaDXkJK0ZZGgIfMMuSXsnHwXiqZy-nas6tw3R1Mw",

In addition, they return better incentives as opposed to small time scammers. I'm not saying you should give up on reporting because who knows they could a be part of a big ring or smth but it is best to not expect immediate action from them as it's more likely to be inboxed.A careful scammer could also try to obfuscate their tracks which includes masking their real IP, using disposable phone numbers etc. hence it's difficult to say whether one case would use much less resources from the other.",

They pop up most times on your home screen and scammers sending emails of cloud mining sites which is not genuine. Most of them demand for miners withdrawal fee when you have gotten enough and to the point of withdrawal and I begin to wonder why demanding for withdrawal fee when it happens that the coin that was mined Should Serve as the withdrawal fee since it is on the safe blockchain and that  should be alright to go with but after everything one should be able to know since it has happened that way it definitely is a scam.OP has done well exposing these sets of scammers and their dirty gimmicks. With this, their faces been exposed, there contacts as well been exposed and we now know their details and how they operate. We can be able to  show them the exit door when they come.",

These task oriented scam actually earns you money but you have to be the owner the scam but yeah, I can sympathize with that anger that you are feeling about these scams wasting people's time and effort, but we can't blame them, easy money blinds most people and they're blinded by the possibility of making bank with a supposedly easy task so they do it anyway.",

All that happens later or any balance is an update in the site’s database. They can make this number 100 dollars, 1000 or a million, but it is only a number in the database and not a real balance.

This is a malicious strategy that they do to remove the doubts of their customers at the beginning that they pay them and give them their daily profits continuously, and after time passes and these clients reach specific amounts of money, or after they deposit significant amounts, they pull the rug from under them and steal their capital and the profits they collected through the malicious DApps connected to their wallets and transfer this money to other wallets, and they can close their domain and create a new domain for their scam cloud mining platform; therefore, I advise you all to stay away from cloud mining sites, as they are not legit and have a nasty reputation.",
