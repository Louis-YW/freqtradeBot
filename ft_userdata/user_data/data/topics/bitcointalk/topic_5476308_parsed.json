  "content": "And this is the third time I have gotten infected with the clipboard virus. I don't know why I always end up with the particular virus. Though I don't know how to properly define this thing as a virus or malware. I don't use any third-party antivirus, but my Windows Defender is always on. So I have no idea how I got infected. Windows defender seems to not be working regarding this virus. I guess, other antivirus programs won't work either. There is no way to fix this. So unfortunately, I had to reinstall Windows twice the same day to fully get rid of this virus. Such a hassle. Lucky for me, I didn't send out any funds since I remembered my original address. The moment I saw a change of address, I knew something was wrong. Here is the phishing address. The total received amount is almost $28k I wonder how many innocent people fell a victim to it.",

If I say something then I would say that it is better to be safe than sorry. Well, it doesn't feel good when you lost something that you have work hard to get it or earn it and just vanish just like that. It's good that you share this to remind others who have already know this and to let others know about it that doesn't know about this yet. My opinion about how you get this is I think you may have downloaded a software that isn't downloaded from the original website and may be infected with that malware.",

Or do you think that all hacked Windows products are created by good people who save you money?Besides, if hacked games are so important to you, you shouldn’t have created this topic at all and asked questions about what’s wrong with you. I think the answer is obvious to everyone.I know many gamers who turn a blind eye to viruses because there is nothing they think is important on their devices. But if the computer has more power, the same viruses (RAT) can easily be turned into a server, which provides the ability to control it from the outside. And very often, hacked games contain it.

Thank you. Also used this before. But the problem is it's na one time OS. I don't know about security it gives but it was created as a privacy enhancement OS. Also, I don't know if USB sticks are capable enough to run this OS for a longer period of time. Not saying it's bad, it's just not reliable. I wouldn't just prefer this. Another thing, AFAIK, Windoes does have a similar feature as TailsOS. I can't just remember how to enable/use it at this moment. I guess, many of you didn't knew this (I guess again).",

If viruses are in your files, reinstalling the operating system will not activate them unless you click on them. Therefore, if you do not open any file and notice that these viruses are present, then the problem is in the operating system. Either it is from an unknown source, or the crack runs before the operating system and leads to viruses running then even antivirus won't be able to notice it.You can burn Ubuntu to Flash USB and boot from it.

I would say the easiest out of those open source operating systems is going to be a Linux based distro that would have a good user interface and themes which will help windows users to easily get used to it. Linux distro like Linix Mint is going to be my choice if someone wants to have a safe operating system that looks similar to Windows.Another free and open-source operating system that I used in past which's very similar to Windows XP is ReactOS. I don't know if that one will work or not as I have used it when it was in its early versions but I can say that the programs worked fine on that operating system. You can give that one a try as well.Windows operating system is used by most people and is managed by Microsoft team of developers only whom Microsoft can trust but the Linux and other open-source operating systems are managed by the community of developers who want to help others by providing them free software. You can safely trust the open-source operating systems and surely you won't face such clipboard virus or any other issues with those operating systems.",
