      "body": "Weldone for the update. If the material have been distributed to their various LGA then it is election proper but I pray the election is free and fair as stated by the presidency, there should be tight security, the electoral officers should not compromise standards, they should do their work and not do otherwise. If I may ask how come they only distributed just to three local government yesterday atleast the numbers should have been reasonable so the various Local Government Areas that received early could start preparing in time ahead of the election come Saturday the 25th Feb 2023. I believe you are an electoral officer, you could be updating us on electoral results and outcome in your state so we could catch the vibe from our various locality to knowing what is happening in Rivers State.",
