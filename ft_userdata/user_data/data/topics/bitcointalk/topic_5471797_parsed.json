The U.S. has fought against many countries and groups as part of its efforts categorized under the flag of \"war on terror\".

Obviously it's not all happening in crypto space, it doesn't even have liqudity for that, but you can't say it wouldnt happen at all. If it gets funded by fiat money, why wouldn't it be funded with cryptos as well. I mean even north korea steals crypto as it's handy to them for transactions not getting blocked. That bank account didYou cropped out this part from the articleQuoteIsrael has also frozen cryptocurrency accounts used to solicit donations for Hamas, the statement said.I would argue that crypto isn't used only to fund terrorists and criminals, like we all know, and most people have good intentions, but obviously everyone uses it. It would be weird that only criminals and terrorists would exclude cryptocurrencies. In fact criminals and terrorists will use the tech that works for them. If the tech is good enough, they will use it. As everyone else will sooner or later.But right now the majority from money laundering comes from elsewhere as it's way easier to wash ludicrous amounts of money in traditional way, then trying to use some mixer to obfuscate the origin of money. When in reality that what gets you flagged for FATF.",

It has already proven in the past with many examples that both terrorists and money launderers still seek for FIAT in cash as their main tool to break the traceability of their money.I would dare to bet Hamas and other factions which are willing to use violence for the sake of their own political fight, stake more 100$ bills than Bitcoin or any other decentralized asset.  Of course, the mainstream media does all in their power not to explicitly call out the wrongdoing by banks, if possible.",

They will just do it without proof.  It wouldn't be a surprise anymore if we hear news about BTC being confiscated from exchanges because it's linked to an address of someone from Gaza or Iran.This bill is just one. It's gonna be one step at a time.UK passes bill to enable authorities to seize Bitcoin used for crime",

The money the US Government sends to the likes of Israel to Terrorize Palestine Civilians should also be considered Terror Funding, and we are damn sure it is done through the US dollar. I don't think those that lost their loved ones in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Afghanistan etc, look at American soldiers as Heroes but rather terrorists!

America never allows country or any factor pose threats to the dollar. So I'm not surprised when crypto is accused for aiding terrorism while lots of dollars is used to support wars whose purpose is elimination of human beings, same purpose terrorism and war.",

But we cannot be certain that criminals wont use crypto to for their illegal activities, thats when miney laundrring happens. I mean cryptocurrencies are like any other financial tool that are not inherently designed to fund illegal activities or terrorism but their relative anonymity and ease of use can attract criminals looking to exploit these features. Money laundering becomes a concern when illicitly obtained funds are converted into cryptocurrencies and it becomes challenging for authorities to track these transactions. Terrorist have these unexplainable funds that these fake news try to confuse us by blaiming it solely to crypto.",

The most secure way to fund terrorism is cash because it is difficult to trace or track it. I live in a country where kidnappings are popular and only in one case have the criminals asked for cryptocurrency as ransom. The preferable means of payment is cash. We all know that anti-bitcoin forces will always spread these lies about using bitcoin to fund terrorism. These lies are finally losing their power because more people are now aware that just like fiat is misused by criminals this is also the same thing the crypto space is facing.",

Many banks accounts and even banks executives have been cut up in the web of terrorism financing cases against them,  e.g the just passed central bank governor in my country Nigeria is currently facing an arms deals cases and it all involves terrorism financing and this is banks executives that we all should have thought will be law-abiding and transparent.",

I believe that Bitcoin and crypto is not as much as a big deal in financing groups of terror as many news media wants the average person to believe it is, because heads in terrorist organizations using BTC would imply they have managed to secure a network of weapons, tactical gear, information, explosives and fake documentation, all of it which they could pay with crypto assets, which is very unlikely to pull off, in reality all those illegal network work and are likely to continue to work with Cash and specially with USD. I have got the impression that since BTC has continuing to increase acceptance among people living in inflationary countries and in countries under sanctions, media based in the United States of America have done all in their power to further push the narrative of Bitcoin being used to fund their existencial enemies.",
