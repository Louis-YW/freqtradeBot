  "content": "People, like animals, are subject to herd instinct. They go where everyone goes.If one person has found a clearing with juicy and tall grass (dollars), everyone is crowding like sheep. Only it's already late, the first ones who managed to mow the delicious green grass (dollars). The rest remains only trampled grass in small quantities, for which there is competition.Also with digital currencies, those who managed to rise, ate them, the latecomers get crumbs.The strategy of going where the crowd broke is a losing one.Winning strategy \"Blue Ocean\"",

      "body": "Therefore, we go where there are no competitors.Where there is no ecosystem and infrastructure.And therefore it is necessary and necessary to build this ecosystem (infrastructure) from scratch on your own.What requirements should it meet?The first and most important requirement is that competitors must experience difficulties, which they will have to spend resources (money) to overcome.At the same time, already at the decision-making stage, they should have the opinion that the costs will not justify the profit.At the same time, customers who will be part of the infrastructure (ecosystem) should not experience these difficulties.So, we have a contradictory ecosystem modelConditions for customers and conditions for competitors.And these conditions for customers and competitors, as I have already mentioned, are mutually contradictory.",
