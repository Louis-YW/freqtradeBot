  "content": "Hi,I am looking for someone who can do a simple job. The job is to go through the pages of a website and save their contents locally. All you need to have is a web browser.I will pay $0.05 per page in crypto. Visiting and saving a page should not take more than 10 seconds, depending on how fast your internet connection is. I prefer to pay in Litecoin.PM me if you are interested.If someone comes up with the idea of writing a bot to automatically save the pages, then unfortunately I have to disappoint them. The website uses a web application firewall that blocks automatic bots after a few visits.",
