If FTX, only one of the very few exchanges that is working closely with regulators is being targetted as providing services in the United Kingdom without authoritization, what does this imply with those other exchanges that avoid working with regulators? Is this another government extortion scheme again? This would not be shocking hehehe.The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a warning on its website Friday regarding crypto exchange FTX. The regulator detailed:We believe this firm may be providing financial services or products in the U.K. without our authorization.The FCA explained that FTX is not authorized but is targeting investors in the U.K. Firms carrying out specific crypto asset activities in the U.K. must comply with the amended “Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations,” and register with the FCA.Source https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-regulator-warns-crypto-exchange-ftx-is-providing-services-without-authorization/",

It is what gives them their advantage against their competitors. This might be extortion. It would also not be shocking if crypto exchanges in the United Kingdom are classified more closer to gambling sites than brokerage firms.",

It's simply a case of a financial company operating within the UK that is not registered or authorized with the country's top financial regulator. That's just it. Whether or not the government has ulterior motives in pointing this out against the said company, that would be another story. The established fact is that FTX is operating even if it is not authorized to operate in the UK. So FTX will have to deal with this.",

It also does not help Sam that he has $22 billion under his control. The government might want much of this hehehehe.The next Warren Buffett: Why the world is going crazy over the 30-year-old billionaireHow do you picture a multi-billionaire? They have luxury homes, cars, buildings, yachts, and several workers, Right? But Samuel Bankman-Fried breaks all those barriers and appears to be the world’s most humble billionaire who believes in donating all his wealth. He is the founder and CEO of FTX, the best cryptocurrency exchange ever built to trade in derivatives. At just the age of 30, Samuel Bankman-Fried has amassed over $22 billion, making him the youngest crypto billionaire in the world.Source https://dazeinfo.com/2022/08/05/the-next-warren-buffett-why-the-world-is-going-crazy-over-the-30-year-old-billionaire/",

So, has FTX a license, if not why should they be allowed to do it? They just managed to get a Cyprus license that isn't worth the paper on which it's printed and now they think, well if Biancne managed to trick everyone they are based in Malta and full license and regulated and nobody did shit, why can't we do the same? I'm really getting tired of those exchanges bitching about everything when all they do is fleece their users with fees after fees, push some shitty tokens down our throats by charging 10x for Bitcoins withdrawals,  spending millions in creating some \"stable\" coins but when it comes to implementing something like Lighting network....crickets!",

The economy must be very bad if they begin going after cryptoexchanges again to collect fees and fines hehehe. But the economy in the United Kingdom might not be as bad as the economy of America. The American regulators have begun to crackdown on smaller cryptoprojects hehehehe.The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued an order filing and settling charges against blockchain software protocol bZeroX and its founders, the CFTC announced in a press release Thursday.The order penalizes the protocol and its founders Tom Bean and Kyle Kistner $250,000 for offering illegal, off-exchange trading of digital assets, registration violations and neglecting to adopt a customer ID program required by the Bank Secrecy Act compliance program.The CFTC has simultaneously filed a civil enforcement action charging the Ooki DAO, the successor to bZeroX, with violating the same laws as bZeroX. It seeks restitution, disgorgement, civil monetary penalties, trading and registration bans and injunctions against further violations.Source https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/22/cftc-penalizes-blockchain-protocol-250k-files-action-against-successor-dao/",

Furthermore, this isn't even about taxing, they clearly said they don't want to operate them here without a license, so, in short, we don't give a damn about you go and do business in the Bahamas. If they wanted to go after crypto money in taxes they would have raised taxes and gotten rid of the nontaxable level, right now crypto income is taxed at 10%, and capital gains on residential is at 18/28% for example.
