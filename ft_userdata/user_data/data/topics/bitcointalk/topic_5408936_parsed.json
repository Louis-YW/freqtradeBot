I really do hope that the Solana team gets to the root of the issue and rectify any loop hole that might have caused this anomaly. I guess, I'll have to move my Solana to my exchange wallet to avoid issues of this nature. Thank you so much for the heads up.",

I must say one must have a hardware wallet if he is a holder or regular crypto trader to secure his funds.

I immediately transferred it to my Binance account since Solana is kinda “big” to install in my hardware wallet. Even if I am not affected, I’m just doing it to be sure that my funds are safe than being drained like what happened to my Metamask and Trust Wallet accounts a few months ago where I’ve lost like more than $12k.",

And IIRC, the leaked seed phrase was transmitted with encryption, but the storing process itself does not.A hardware wallet is a practical yet safe way to store cryptocurrencies, but as you said, it isn't widely used by anybody. But the main idea of the compromised seed phrase in the first place is that many users choose futile closed-source wallet.",

Agree with you mate, this hackers are actually evolving day by day and finding ways how to become more creative about their hacking craft. No one is safe in the crypto space. But what investors can do is be more knowledgeable, be more cautious and always think ahead. You never know if you were talking to a hacker cause they really mastered social engineering. I hope solana do more about their ecosystem. Become more safer and much more protected.",
