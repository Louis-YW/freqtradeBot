  "content": "I was wondering would you use your phone to scan QR code that is added as Avatar image in Bitcointalk forum profile?Avatar could be fully QR code or only partially, but this could be used for directing to different websites used for advertisement.This is not the same as clickable signature, but it's very similar, and it would be even more effective with responsive forum design.First examples with my profile and QR code directing to one of my topics:Second example with QR directing to Chipmixer website, and personal text could be added bellow Avatar image:QR code image in post can contain both clickable link and scanning.I know this could open a whole new can of worms, but I think we should be ready for this, since QR code adoption is wide spreading everywhere.Would it be against any forum rules if people started to add QR codes in their posts, and should we report QR codes that are directing to suspicious or scam website?Something like this:Maybe someone knows if there is some script or extension that can automatically read qr codes and show links with mouse hover?",

As for the forum rules, there's no real specific mentjon of QR codes, but they'd likely conflict with the advertisement rule. So, unless you've got a rather substantial thread/post then they'd probably conflict. Quote from: LoyceMobile on February 03, 2023, 01:58:59 PMIt doesn't make sense to use QR codes on a website: if I see it on my screen, I can just as well click a link.You're right. However, there's a sense of intrigue with QR codes, and part of their danger. You don't necessarily by looking at it know where it goes, and since people are intrigued by the sense of mystery, will be more inclined to scan it. It's why I think QR codes are effective advertisements, and you often see random QR codes stuck on things, without any explanation. Now, you're absolutely right that any sensible person shouldn't really be scanning these willy nilly. I've got an application on my phone from F-Droid which allows you to scan QR codes, and then it presents the link without taking you there.",

Most users would be intrigued, and that's why they would work for advertising, and well do work for advertising. I hate the things, I hate that when you go out to a restaurant they have these things for the menus, so you have to scan them. Hence, why I have the FOSS QR code scanner on my phone, because if you think about it anyone can slap a sticker down on a table, and that's a potential security risk.Same goes with the forum, I wouldn't be keen on it. As avatars though, I guess there's nothing really stopping users from doing it, only when they start putting it in posts does it become a problem. Obviously, if the users are using QR code avatars to redirect to malicious sites etc, that would be bannable. However, nothing is really stopping them from using them to advertise legitimate services, just like any other avatar then.",

After all, most users who aren't in signature campaigns don't free place in their avatar area. Also, I doubt that many just would scan that code. Probably some text under avatar in personal text area is needed to attract user to scan it. Something like ''Scan QR insert your phrase here''. And as Loyce said, QR's don't work on websites that well. It fits better for TV screens, street billboards, paper and etc.",

Alternatively, we can use them while we log on  to desktop then trying to use our mobile for easy access or and for quick payment, then we can scan through our phones to proceed with the payment or whatever. I understand is a unique methods of identifying trusted links, website, address and many more. My concern is qr code can only be effective to use if someone have another alternative means to login into a separate device. For instance, you can't scan a qr code without having another device to proceed with the scanning. Else it's only easier to use while making payments.",

I won't bother scanning any QR despite knowing it quickens my access to the \"blinded\" coded information. I don't even like doing a QR that isn't on what I know. The few things I had done it would be to pair devices or a mandatory stuff that has to do with my other devices. Apart from that, I steer clear. I don't like surprises when it comes to online devices. One will never know what's at the other end of the code.
