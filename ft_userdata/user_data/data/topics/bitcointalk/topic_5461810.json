Yes you might experience temporary loss/ paper loss but this losses will not gonna be realized if you will not sold. Being positive on your investment at all time will make you more encouraged to keep holding for greater price instead of focusing on your losses or accepting losses.Losses is really part of investment but we are talking about Bitcoin here with a proven steady price growth so losses is very minimal if you are strong hands.",

You don't have to worry about that, as it's among the things you should think less of. Things I would have wanted to see you consider are security—how you can secure your holdings very well without losing access to them for the time being for which you might have planned to hold them; it's not just about buying; it's also about how secure you can keep them safe till your time of selling; what wallet is to be used; and all of that.

The adoption rate or growth has shown that it is a technology that would be embraced more in the future and as a solution to many monetary crises faced by the fiat currency I am of the belief that it would even live beyond that time as a currency for transactions Quote from: TravelMug on August 02, 2023, 12:07:20 PMYes, it is said that technically bitcoin can be mined till 2140, but we don't know if it will still incentivize miners.If you look at the number of people still building there own bitcoin mining farms or joining mining pools considering how expensive it is to buy the mining equipments then we can say that it is still and would be an incentives to miners. We should note that it is only the mining fees payed to miners that would stop when mining stops, the transaction fees which is also been earned by the miners currently will not stop as even after mining stop’s transactions would take place then. We don’t even know maybe the transaction fee will be then since bitcoin will have grown in great value by that time. Probably 1 satoshi would be equal to more than a dollar then",
