It's only the USD which is in high demand which is just one fiat out of all 150+ fiats on the planet. So surely not all cash is king. Also talking about \"king\" i think king isn't someone who is in demand, King is someone who is able to maintain it's value always and whenever required. Cash which is USD might be in high demand in the international markets but in USA itself it's still being devalued even further which means it's purchasing power in the US is still decreasing.",

The obvious difference is in the level of risk and the amount of profit resulting from it.The difference is a bit like the difference between Bitcoin and the rest of the altcoins, given that Bitcoin is more stable and is considered a safe haven.",

Price of everything has gone up due to inflation. And we are using more money to buy goods that were less valuable. So there's more demand on cash right now. In order to survive, you have to spend money. Thus, cash is now more important to people. Money is just a piece of paper. It has no value. If your government issue a new paper note as cash, you have to use it because you got no choice. It's the \"king\" now because of the situation. Not more than that. Change my mind",

And that's only if the central banks can hit their targets. Most currencies are inflating at a higher rate because of reckless spending and irresponsible fiscal policy by the central banks. Quote from: Fullbear2222 on December 24, 2022, 02:23:02 PMHow can the gold go up If markets works on supply and demand system.There's a definite supply of gold -- long term you can expect the price of gold to increase as the free supply of gold decreases. That doesn't mean within the short term that supply and demand wouldn't cause decreases in the price of gold.Supply and demand would tell us that even if the demand stays the same, that the price would still increase as long as the supply were to go down. And you can't generate more gold than what's in circulation or in the ground.",

It is a frictionless asset. I believe we are living during challenging times where people have had to opt for credit and loans to try to survive, in this context it is obvious to see why cash would be more appreciated, added to the anonymity and wide acceptance around the world. Still we cannot ignore the disadvantages of the inflation and the measures that could be taken by a central authority.",

Fiat currency is affected by inflation along with other economic woes that plague mankind. When there is economic ruins in a country, it’s fiat currency would lose some of its value and its purchasing power, locally and internationally would dwindle. That’s no king in my book. Perhaps a prince of some sort lol but definitely not a king. There are lots of various minerals that are more valuable and rare while fiat could be printed countless times.",
