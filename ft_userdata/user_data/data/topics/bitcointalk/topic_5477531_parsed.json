      "body": "The first transaction has been made with a very low fee rate. With making the CFPF transaction, you increased the effective fee rate to 10 sat/vbyte which is still insufficient for getting confirmation.The fee rate used for the first transaction is lower than the purging fee rate for any node with default mempool size. Therefore, some nodes have those transactions in their mempool and some don't have them. If you want to see those transactions in your electrum wallet, you should try connecting to different servers until you find a one that have those transactions in their mempool. After that, you will be able to bump the fee of the CPFP transaction. If you are using the desktop version of electrum, click on the circle located at bottom right corner of window, right click on one of the servers listed there and select \"Use as Server\". Try different servers until your transactions are displayed in the wallet.  If you are using the mobile version of electrum, tap on the circle located at top right corner of the screen, go to \"Network\" and then \"Server Settings\". After that, tap on one of the servers listed there and then \"OK\".  Try different servers until your transactions are displayed in the wallet.",

Once you connect to a server that has your transactions in its mempool, they will reappear and you will see them again.I just created a watch-only wallet using your address and I could find many servers that had your transactions in their mempool.Here are three of them.Code:fortress.qtornado.com:443fulcrum.grey.pw:51002electrum.turboblaster.it:50002",

This is not a full transaction, and it is also trying to spend an output from this transaction: https://mempool.space/tx/0cbac703825a29bb0e7fafff62c3701e0a5a11b2ce9f6352e46a7a750acce912. What exactly did you do on Coinb.in?I would go with hosseinimr93's suggestion of just using Electrum. Use one of the servers he has listed (I can confirm they all work for me and show me your transactions), and then use RBF to bump the fee of the CPFP transaction.",

The second one was made by yourself for doing CPFP and that's the one you can increase its fee. With increasing the fee rate of the second transaction, you will increase the effective fee rate of the first transaction and they will be both confirmed at the same time.",

I tried it now to accelerate the OP transaction but it can't, it says, (Transaction fee is too low) which means this transaction didn't meet the free service category but I don't know how much you will pay for the paid service.

Other free accelerators are scams that don't accelerate anything at all, they simply rebroadcast your transaction. Blockchain.com says the transaction is invalid because their node has dropped your unconfirmed parent, but that doesn't matter since most other explorers still have it.The effective fee rate of your two transactions is now 39.4 sats/vbyte, which is currently around 10 MvB from the tip of the mempool. Unfortunately for you the mempool filled up a bit over the last 24 hours. You've already been waiting a month for this to confirm though, so if it were me I would just be patient for another day or two rather than spend more money to bump the fee even more, but it's up to you.",
