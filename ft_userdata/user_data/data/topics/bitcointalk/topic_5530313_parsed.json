Infact Bitcoin is the best asset for long term purpose. Many folks can chose to invest in gold for all they care, but I don't see any reason to invest in Gold for all I care. Gold market cap may be higher than that of Bitcoin, but we should also remember that Gold has been in existence for decades, but Bitcoin has just been around since 15 to 16year now and  has gain recorgnition. If Bitcoin can be in existence for some couple of years now and has gain this recorgnition, then by 30years time from now Bitcoin will increase tremendously. So Bitcoin is an asset worthy of investing.",

Biggest difference between Bitcoin and gold is their total supplies. Bitcoin is limited, capped at 21M bitcoins, and gold is not limited with unknown mineable gold on Earth and possible on asteroids and other planets in future.Gold has a larger supply but the demand and practical applications of gold are many times greater than bitcoin. That is why humans have been mining gold for over a thousand years and hundreds of thousands of tons of gold have been mined but there has never been enough gold to meet our needs. Not to mention, gold mining is extremely complex and expensive, and that only causes gold prices to continue to rise instead of falling as many people think.",

But if it doesn't permit and I have to sell for survival, I have no choice. This is what's good with Bitcoin, it's now become an asset that can be passed on to the next generation. It's here to stay and just like gold, it is a wealth that we can keep while we're on it and considered still quite early.

The author wrote about predictive future that Bitcoin will grow up more, get better adoption and Lindy effect can make Bitcoin stronger and stronger considerably with time, like how gold achieved it through thousand of years.It's worthy to say about impressive growth of Bitcoin compares to gold, and Bitcoin is unprecedented thing with its exponential growth rate, better than both Gold and Internet adoption curves.Bitcoin vs. Gold and Bitcoin adoption curve.https://woocharts.com/bitcoin-vs-gold/https://woocharts.com/bitcoin-adoption-s-curve/",

The increment is significant enough for anyone to validate such doubt or curiosity of asking whether if Bitcoin holds a generational wealth potential, indeed it is a store of value and safe haven for a future and generational wealth for those that values it because one most surely determines what means to him or her, there are those who believes and there are also those who doesn't believe but yeah anyone can do whatever they like.",

For profit, it is also the same, even more sensational than gold, although we admit that the market is quite volatile.

Bitcoin is a good store of value and can be used as generational wealth. It's easy to buy bitcoin but hard to keep for long term, especially someone who's no discipline, he can sell his holding immediately he then sees that Bitcoin depreciate a little. However, if want to keep Bitcoin so your family can inherit it, must be that you also teaches them about Bitcoin so they won't misuse it if they have full access to it.",

I’m aware some would rather invest in Gold for its long-term stability and also for generational wealth purpose which is applaudable reason why I’m curious if you can keep Bitcoin for generational wealth.The advantage of gold over bitcoin is just the stability to hold values in a long term and while you talk about wealth, gold stands better for generation inheritance but be it sure that the tendencies of adding in values will less to bitcoin if we considers it a long term goal.So if we also talk about assets, bitcoin holds it authenticatedly because it volatile potential is a grooming to acquire higher values while it fluctuates between the bears and the bulls.Knowing quite well that bitcoin usually do experiences annually events in every 4 years which turns to breaking new Aths as a season of it significant market performance to value increments.If I'm not wrong generation year distance is between 20 to 30 years and now let's look at this factor to figure the two valuable assets historical performance and their possiblities of future performances.We know goldehas exited for decades while bitcoin has only been for 16 years now. Making this comparison from 2009 when bitcoin was launched, then gold was at $1,100 per ounce while bitcoin was on $0 until it gained ait first value at $0.00076. so in distance matter up to date in the interval of 16 years that bitcoin hasn't been up to a generational duration of least 20 years, bitcoin has sustained a a valuable margin of $96,000 + as at when I'm making this post While gold is $2,800 + and in the past 4 years events in their various markets, bitcoin has sustained valuable volume of 117.6% while gold has achieved volume of 44.9%. I guess the difference is clearly notes that in a matter of time holding bitcoin is far profitable than gold which then would serve as reserve of values potentially on increase of values against the future.While still taking Walk around in figure of which of the asset is good to store values for generations to come, it'd be a hands down beaten of bitcoin over gold if we also consider their historical performances such as breaking out of their recent ATH, then is withnessed that bitcoin has achieved an Ath of $109,993 While gold is $2,942.The value of bitcoin has really surpassed the value of gold because bitcoin has a limited figure of 21 millions while gold is beyond measures. For this, if you can store your values on bitcoin within the range of a generation duration, you're sure to see atleast 5 bull run season which is mutilation of your initial value while gold maybe slightly volatile it holding value within the period might seem stable with less profit returns as bitcoin may perform.",
