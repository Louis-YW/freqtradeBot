If you send buyer-funded LEALANA to PCGS they will send you the coins back not in a slab and ungraded. I have had two of my bf LEALANA pieces sent back to me from PCGS without being graded. Interesting. Do you know where/which PDF form you use for their crypto-submissions and costs etc?  Thanks !",

These three coins have a laser edging on the hologram, which I believe was Smoothie experimenting with ways to provide additional security. The laser edging is rare so I assumed they were scared off by this. So, it looks like they are just being extremely cautious. I am working with Stacks Bowers to resubmit these. Steeley",
