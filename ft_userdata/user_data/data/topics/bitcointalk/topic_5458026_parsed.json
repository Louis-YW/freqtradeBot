Waiting for the court to decide who won then it will see the movement of BNB in the market especially when the lawsuit wins then it is likely that the price will rise again, I believe against Binance they can have other evidence in this lawsuit to defend themselves because binance is a big platform still very trusting on this coin, but because it is still bearish, the price is still too low and it is caused by the SEC and this will be considered FUD for some people, but when the bullish season comes, the increase will be unbearable BNB coin will definitely increase even more sharply, I think prices won't drop below $200.",

The same thing is most like to happen to BNB if that case drags on for a long time.Quote from: $crypto$ on June 29, 2023, 07:09:53 PMbecause binance is a big platform still very trusting on this coin, Being a big platform means nothing.

At least, we have some assurance that it will rise back, not going to the dip. Their issue with the SEC is a factor that triggers some panic in the BNB investors and I know they are still there giving support and waiting until it was over but it was possible that these investors will give up and dump their coins once they see no chance for the team to win. That is why it was best to but when they are clear with the issue already.",

Imho BNB just could be safe investment before it, but i have been constantly changed my mind about it. On the other hand the lawsuit could take years, and on the other hand all the markets need is a rumor to move them.Binance probably doesn't fall unless CZ goes to prison, and even then they just might pull it off. Bitmex CEO went to prison but they didn't have any native token that would be a central element of that exchange. There will be many moving pieces on this and result is hard to predict.",

This is an age-old question for any cryptoinvestor when they don't know the right time to buy and sell. You have to take risks and act on guesswork.There is a well-known rule that says: act against the market. If bnb holders are panicking and selling, then now is a good time to buy. But this is not a financial recommendation at all. If I knew what fate awaits bnb, I would never tell you. I myself would use this information for personal purposes.",

However, I don't just think that the BNB team won't do anything to regain momentum and their reputation because many investors and traders will be affected. But anyways, despite that situation, I will still buy while the price is low and hold because I was optimistic that it will pump even though the issue is still there.",

I can be different than others but I will wait for a few months before halving in 2024 to accumulate BNB. I still feel some risks if I buy BNB in 2023 with a bear market.
