  "content": "Well its been time since i am dealing with MiLkZ ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=408677 ).I have bought thousands of Amazon giftcards from him (which can be found in my profile as feedback before he deletes it) ( Proof for that: https://prnt.sc/_BO6cFMg72zo )Consider our long term business i requested multiple time to post positive honest opinion based on our trading experience..Many times he lied me that after the NEXT deal between us he will do it.Sadly the truth was different, because every time i made new trade with him, he came up with new excuse..One day he just show his real face and requested payment for feedback after asking me how do i make my money online :  https://prnt.sc/WDkwDgwuyuK9I am pretty sure he will say that was joke or anything to twist that again but i don't really care.I also do not really care about this forum anymore, because i've seen how \"trusted\" many people are around.That was just the last drop.Feel free to ignore the fact he requesting money for feedback and enjoy ur stay in this forum where scams are not moderated, and the only way to get positive feedback is PAYING and not doing legit trades.Going to lock this topic because there is no need of comments on it, i just wanted to show the real face of this guy.*P.S: After i refused to buy Amazon from him today, he simply deleted ALL the conversation we had on telegram SmileyLucky me i saved the most spicy part...Now you can see he changed his good neutral feedback to negative one right after i refuse to buy from him anymore IF there is still people who care on this dead forum, trust selling were never allowed here since Satoshi..Do whatever you like.Damn i love this scamming forum with the trash \"trusted\" members Newbies, don't get fooled by their \"trust\" do not deal with those people at any cost or you will end like me And don't just blindly trust me :\") Google their names and you will see MANY NEWBIES scammed, tricked and god knows what more by those kids.You can find their ACCURATE FEEDBACK in the \"untrusted\" section in their trust score.There you will find the newbie accounts fucked by all those kids who play the same game to steal money from people You can find the people who protect the trust seller here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=400366 - sandy-is-finehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=234771 - suchmoonhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=257071 - NeuroticFishhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1190631 - JeromeTashhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2003859 - DireWolfM14https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=55384 - Foxpuphttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2739424 - NotATether",

      "body": "Lets unlock this topic and make everyone happy Lets see what MiLkZ has to say about his trust sale Will you give me discount now ? Like 500$ for the LEGIT trades we done so far ? Or after reporting you for trust sale i am not allowed to buy anymore MiLkZ please, tell us it was a joke right ?  Tell us that you deleted the telegram chat by mistake right? Lets keep it easy and simple:Why you asking money for positive feedback?Why you deleted whole telegram conversation?Why you trying to wash your hands with the situation with Heisenberg63 which was solved?How you think you can solve trust sale proof? By saying its joke? Cmon We all know that this forum is long time dead since 2017, no one cares about your feedback anyway or my words.But lets make it visible that people selling trust.I locked this topic because there is nothing more to be said. There is no other side of the story.I requested the positive feedback i deserve for our thousands of trades, and you ask me for money.I am sorry i have to put OgNasty name here but i contacted him weeks ago to ask him should i report the guy and does it even matter... And that's the reason i didn't post it so far. Because even one of the oldest and trusted people around don't see a point doing it..Proof: https://prnt.sc/CyKhDIdeMhSIhttps://prnt.sc/HtH6DnDlrvs7Lets add the proof MiLkZ deleted months of telegram conversation: https://prnt.sc/zyZbBNzEySqWIf you had nothing to hide, why you deleted it ?",

      "body": "First and foremost no scam occurred.  This topic and all other topics he spammed should be deleted. It is sad I have to use my time responding to this waste of life.This idiot even created a false flag..LOL#1I have traded this user gift cards for a decent amount of time.  He goes first, no issues there.  We have not had a new trade for awhile now because of my refusal to provide him positive trust.  As you can see he is VERY butthurt about it.After about a month of no contact, today I sent him a message asking if he wanted more gift cards.  He responded with a smart ass remark.  I knew at that point we would never trade again.  I informed him I was removing him from telegram.  I deleted our convo and hoped to never have any interaction with him again.Let me reiterate there was absolutely no reason to save our convo/keep him on telegram.  Any trading relationship we had was now completely broken and no trade had actually occurred for a significant amount of time. I wish I had kept the convo because it had his alts, all his begging, and full context of our convos..lol  ..I never imagined I would have to respond to this utter nonsense..#2 For months, this sad excuse for a human had been begging for trust.  I did not wish to provide him with said trust because: his constant nagging for it was concerning, he has alt accounts here on bitcointalk with negatives, and this is not his first time lying/causing completely fake drama. Somewhere along the line I finally caved in and gave him a neutral, but that was not enough for him.  He proceeded to ask for a positive OVER and OVER again.#3The screenshot he provided of me saying my feedback costs money is obviously a joke with my pepe emote. This user had just got done bragging about how he makes tens of thousands of dollars per day doing \"DMS\"(hence my 100k dms comment).  I was obviously messing with him.  I trade with various users of this forum and have been a member for 7+ years.  No rational person would believe I was actually asking for $600(this $600 is in reference to this \"dms\" stuff he was talking about prior to my comment) for a trust review.  I had refused to even provide a neutral feedback for months, let alone a positive one.The fact that he saved a screenshot months ago and cried to ognasty about it is amusing..lol  It is also extremely convenient that he ONLY saved part of the convo with no context of what came before or after..#4This user originally locked these false topics for a reason.  It is not normal behavior.  #5Why did koil delete his posts with racial slurs? ---> https://imgur.com/a/IvNQLZg#6If the forum is dead, why don't you kindly piss off?#7You NEVER deserved a positive trust rating.  I was clearly correct not to give you one.#8\"Why you trying to wash your hands with the situation with Heisenberg63 which was solved?\"what the hell does this mean?",

You wonder why i insisted on getting positive feedback ?  Because i've done with the guy THOUSANDS of dollars in trades and obviously i deserve it? And not in last place, i am tired of being scammed 1-2$ for random cd keys i need to buy from newbies.Now i expect you to say \"But why would you go first to randomly created newbie account\". Well because i need the cd keys and its just 1-2$. But it is sad when you get scammed with 1-2$ 10+ times so at least with positive feedback i can somehow show those newbies i am trustworthy enough for 1-2$ cd key sales. Because if you think they respond for escrow request, you are so wrong or never tried to bought cd keys from randoms. And what does that have to do with the trust sale anyways ? How much are all the trades between us? 3-4k+ usd",

You can always place positive feedback including message that people should always use escrow if you have any doubts#3 I does have alt accounts were scam related? Why don't you prove that?#4 I have several telegram accounts? No i don't  Why don't you prove that ?#5 Fake drama ? Lying ? The screenshot talks more by everything, even the conversation with OgNasty month ago prove it enough. And where is the fake drama? That you wanted to sell me feedback that i deserve for 600$ after you realize how much money i make from other services off-site ?It is funny how you saying things not related to your trust sale report  Also it is funny how you trying to add the thing with Heisenberg63 which caused my account locked.Thanks god Heisenberg63 is WAY WAY MORE TRUSTED AND LEGIT than you, and help me to resolve the issue even when i was at panic with my less knowledge. And this trust SALE have nothing do to with drama, issue or anything technical related problem.You just ask money for positive feedback  That's all.No matter you get negative tagged for it or no, i can't care less. At least i will show what person you are, and that you selling trust for money.OgNasty was informed month ago that a \"trusted\" seller a.k.a you is trying to sell trust for money, and the private messages exchanged between me and him about it is above.It took me so long to open this report because YOU LIED that after another one purchase you will do it.You manipulated and lied me to buy more and more from you just to get negative feedback  So congratulations, by one or another way you already took those money from me but by other way I prefer paying MORE and dealing with legit people like Heisenberg63 than being lied and manipulated by trust sellers and liars like you.It is also funny how you ignored ALL the questions so far.Why you deleted ALL the telegram conversations from months if u have nothing to hide ? Dude, people are not stupid...",

To spam? If you have anything to say about the CURRENT situation, feel free to.As you can see, OgNasty was informed month ago about this and i was patient enough to wait to see what MiLkz will do.Well i take OgNasty advice to at least see what's going to happen, no matter whatI can't care less about this dead forum but i have no problem reporting shady things such as TRUST SELLING.And i love how the trust seller get defended and merited  That clearly enough prove Ognasty point that place is dogshit since years.Everyone trying to twist different things and no one talk about the current TRUST SALE. And that's why the topic was closed, and will be closed if this continue to be spammed.I did what i had to, i informed the community.

It is not only the 600$ he requested, its about he lied me to buy more and more from him for that trust i deserve. you just confirmed that you did all the trades just to get positive trust. buying a positive trust is just as bad as selling.feel free to complain about why you still haven't received a negative trust, because you really deserve it.Quote from: Koil on June 08, 2022, 09:52:31 AMI don't give a fuck anymore about any positive feedback in this trash forum.in the menu at the top of the page you have the option \"Logout\", don't bother on this trash forum anymore.Another useless spam here.. It doesn't matter do i deserve trust or not  And i talk like that just because of the situation.Also, Do you have anything to say IN-TOPIC for the trust sale ? Dude, you can logout from life... Not sure why you think people care about your OFF-TOPIC opinion.I will just lock this topic if no one going to post anything IN-TOPIC about the TRUST SALE related.No one care about me or do i deserve positive feedback, neither me or any of you should.This topic is for something else, start reading and stop rising your post count for your stupid signature campaigns.Also, nigger, with your attitude, i am not sure how you are still alive, but most likely because you spend your entire life over internet.I do not care will my account get negative or positive feedback.I can see that there is nothing trusted on this forum, but it can be bought to look like",

Yes, that's why he's also shady.Quote from: Koil on June 08, 2022, 09:45:22 AMAsking for positive feedback based on LEGIT deals worth WHOUSANDS of dollars is shady ? What kind of mushrooms do you actually eat?I think that you're the one on mushrooms. No matter what trades you've made, it's 100% up to his discretion whether he gives you trust or not. That's how things work.On the other hand, begging for trust is also not allowed and shady.Quote from: Koil on June 08, 2022, 09:45:22 AMI have history of odd accusations? Dude, i suggest you to post when the pot drops youI suggest you look into your own trust rating now and then.Also this answer of yours just proved me that my decision to not hurry in trusting you was correct.PS. I've done trades now and then, I've given positive feedback now and then and never asked positive feedback in return. And you know why? Because I do know how this forum works. Nigger claims BEGGING ( can't stop laugh, where you see me begging ?) is not allowed and shady.Also asking for it should be right ? In other hand, the nigga don't think that ASKING money for trust is shady Sadly all of you niggers don't see he deleted months of conversation to show you way way more spicy things All of you ignore the fact He wants money for trust.All of you ignore the fact HE deleted the whole conversation in telegram (Why right? )All of you ignore the facts and the In-Topic issue.And if ALL of you think like the guy who asks money, makes it even worse because he was willing to sell me that trust no matter what  Only 600$Even if its a red flag to ASK (not beg, not request, not force) for positive feedback, he have no problems with that only for 600$ Whatever you guys say, just makes the things worse and worse for the trust seller.",

How many accounts i have since 2017? This one. Didn't know lurking without account isn't allowed I don't need arguments, i have proof for my words. I am not here to scratch my tongue because i have nothing better to do. I am here to posts the facts.Of course he were \"messing\" with me  That's why he lied me and manipulated me to buy more and more Amazon giftcards after i told him i would never buy anything from him anymore because i feel unfair to not receive LEGIT feedback based on our sales.Because i always send him money first, always agree on what he says but one day i just stop because of his attitude But as i said above, he already made those 600$ he asked anyway, by lying and manipulating me buying more and more from him to receive that feedback so no matter what his mission is complete It is really sad that he deleted the telegram conversation, otherwise i had WAY WAY more things to show than just this trust sale If someone has nothing to hide, he won't delete the conversation.

This forum is dead, you can't start anything here but only farming campaigns what people with trust do.I didn't started any business here but buying only actually",

Selling trust is not \"It's not a DT-taggable offense\" you said right ?  Why would be consider the scams are not moderated  Account selling should also be \"not a DT-taggable offense\" right and the account sales ?  lets make this pig house so called forum more worse It doesn't matter is he DT1,DT2,DT3. Account sales, scams, TRUST sales,Merit sales all should be treated by one way  But if he is doing some kind of busines with you, of course you should look somewhere else not where people you work with get caughtEveryone defending  people who sell trust, accounts, merit and scamming are just the same",

It is clear now he was saving this screenshot to use it to slander/blackmail me because I was not giving him what he wanted.I can only assume me deleting him from my telegram gave him the pristine opportunity to create these threads.  Not having the entire convo only hurts me.  If my statement was anything other than the obvious joke, why would he wait over a month to bring it up? Once he did decide to use it to slander me, why did he lock the threads he created, was he afraid I also had screenshots hidden away?As I previously stated, prior to this screenshot koil had been bragging about how much money he was making doing \"dms\". That is where that $600 figure came from.  He kept bragging about how he makes like $600 per 100k of this dms. At the end of this screenshot koil says \"I would never pay for it\", I know for a fact I told him, in some fashion, I was messing around.If I was someone that sold trust and did not care about the integrity of the trust system I would have just given him a positive.  As stated already, it took me months to even give him a neutral, and when I did, it stated: that he goes first and to be sure to use ESCROW-----Quote from: Koil on June 08, 2022, 07:08:18 AMIt is funny how you saying things not related to your trust sale report  Also it is funny how you trying to add the thing with Heisenberg63 which caused my account locked.Thanks god Heisenberg63 is WAY WAY MORE TRUSTED AND LEGIT than you, and help me to resolve the issue even when i was at panic with my less knowledgeYou understand that heisen did not have any screenshots to provide you and came to me asking for help.  It was ME that provided any and all screenshots and it was me that helped you reopen your account.  I shouldn't have done any of this, you deserved to lose that money.I love how you state \"Heisenberg63 is WAY WAY MORE TRUSTED AND LEGIT\" when you not to long ago completely slandered him. You even mass spammed PMs to people slandering him.You are a joke.Quote from: Koil on June 08, 2022, 07:08:18 AMYou manipulated and lied me to buy more and more from youIf you do not want to buy gift cards, do not buy them, what the fuck kind of bullshit statement is this..LOLYou purchased gift cards for months and months, no one manipulated you to do anything.  What are you 5 years old?----Take your racist ass off this forum..",
