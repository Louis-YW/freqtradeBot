  "content": "It seems like a habit now that you always employ and ask shit posters who have the neutral tag to get rid of it, even though those individuals are high-level bounty spammers and shit posters, and there is only a 0.1% chance that they will get those tags removed by looking at their post history.My questions;1. Royse777 If you care about (DT), why do you always add tagged (shit posters) to your campaigns? Are you implying that these spammers cannot be replaced by any other individuals who are competent?And 2. Why not just go ahead and work with them instead of asking them to get the tags removed if you think they are inappropriate? I'm curious.If we're being honest, these users don't deserve even $1 from the crap they post on the Altcoin discussion, Bitcoin discussion and bounty board., but at the end of the day you are the manager and your decision is final.Username: MFahadUsername: Sayeds56",

      "body": "Recently, there was a similar discussion: \"Members Asking For Neutral Trust To Be Removed\". JollyGood responded to my query, stating that it was related to the sinbad.io campaign run by Royse777. It was claimed that he recruited members who had a neutral tag from certain DT members and later asked them to remove neutral ratings from their feedback pages. As I previously commented in that thread, I have never witnessed such requirements from a bounty manager and I am not sure of its moral correctness. Every manager has the right to select participants in their campaigns, but they should not abuse their managerial position to sway the DT system.",

      "body": "In 2018 and years prior, the forum had a plethora of available campaign participants. It was nothing for me to fill 500 spots in a week with active forum posters. Now when filling campaigns, the number of decent active forum users is a lot smaller than it used to be. Now managers have to look at accepting less than average participants to fill a campaign IMO. Should managers accept these poor posters and spammers? Probably not, but sometimes a person wants to look like they are competent. If you cannot fill a simple 20 person campaign with decent posters what good are you? I'm not saying royse is not doing their job, i'm just saying this is likely what goes through some managers minds. The neutral trust thing is a pretty bad thing to worry about IMO. Either don't hire those users or ask them to get it removed before hiring them. Don't add them and then request they get it removed. These days it's very hard to get someone to change their trust. We all get stubborn with our opinions. Regardless, they're his/her rules so they have the right to use them, I just wouldn't.",

As far as I know, it started with joker_josue and another member, as discussed in this thread. They were both accepted into the Sinbad mixer campaign, and after a week or two asked JollyGood to revise the neutrals on their profiles. JG wrote about it here.",

So when a few genuine people (who have improved their posting habits) will PM DT, at the same time a lot of others will PM too who haven't improved.A shit poster can improve and can become better while a good poster can be at times becomes a shit poster. Ideally, when we give feedback to anyone about their posting quality, it should be checked after 3 months or 6 months to see if he has improved. Since people usually forget after giving feedback, so the only option left to the people is to PM the DT members. I would not call it begging because it is the only option if you have improved yourself and want to bring attention to the DT member.",

It's not negative tag. But.. But there can still be problems.Neutral tag for spamming should be a warning exactly for bounty managers. Of course, a bounty manager can accept even a spammer and not count (and even report!) the spam posts; this could even act as a lesson.Also some write neutral tags in the way they're clearly negative ones; those may be seen as negative.Then somebody also rightly said that tags are difficult to remove and I agree. I had a neutral tag many years ago from the mighty Vod. It took me years until he got indeed convinced I should not be tagged, even with neutral.And tags can no longer bear meaning. A Jr. Member can be easily shitposting because of his lack of knowledge (one has to have a certain level of knowledge to understand how little he knows), and he may have become a decent poster by reaching Sr. Member level. Still, he may have a neutral tag.I don't say it's the case, I came with hypothetical cases.All I say that it's not OK to generalize. Every single case (user, manager, campaign) can be different.I also don't say Royse did good or bad. I think that the measure of all this should be the quality of posts in his campaign(s). If a spammer is allowed to spam, then yes, the complaints are more legitimate. But until then, all this is hypothetical at best.",
