Just the site’s domain name and \"lottery\" keyword won’t help you attract potential gamblers.

You should create or make an announcement thread first to properly introduce your platform in a good and better way. To do this, I would advise you register a copper member account so you could upload graphics of your casino which are majorly the catchy and selling point for your platform.However, have you been able to do a beta test for your platform?  because from my observations, this is the first you have done here and if you have not, I would advise you to do that and also a review so that members here could help you review your platform while noting down some observations for you to properly make amend so you do not have any error in the future or possibly bug.For publicity, promotion and marketing, you can contact @Royse777 to help you do that as he is a reputable and well known campaign manager here with vast work experience and knowledge. You can rely on him to help promote your project here professionally.",

Remember bitcointalkers take privacy seriously, just using email alone is hard for some Bitcointalkers not to talk of them giving out their private number, for now I don't have an account in your site but I still have more to talk about just on the home page alone.As for your ToS, it says nothing about KYC, minimum withdrawal, to be sincere it's basically empty... You will have to work more on your site if you really want the people of bitcointalk to accept your site, we all have seen sites like this come before and before you realize what's going on the sites will rug pull and that's why everyone is skeptical about yours.",

Get a corper membership so that you can post pictures of your service and forum members can be attracted to it. I am not attracted to just a link to go and click on because you are using a newbie account and not all links are to be trusted and to be clicked on. If it is your casino,it is better that you create a ANN thread so that customers can see your service and someone can also respond to people questions there. Yo should also note that we don't give out our information easily because our privacy matters a lot to us,the idea of asking for phone number during registration will make people not to patronize the platform",
