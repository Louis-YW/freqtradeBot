  "content": "Does anyone use TALKimg as a custom uploader on ShareX? Actually, I used PostImage's software, now I want to use TALKimg, But I am getting boring to go to Talkimg's website again & again and upload images, so I want to use it in one of the best screenshot application ShareX. But I keep getting errors in the settings of ShareX's custom image uploader. I read talkimage's API page but still don't understand it properly. If anyone has experience using TALKimg on ShareX please share. :\")Anyway thanks in Advance",

Just add it manually afterwards (you can get the album_id by creating an album, clicking on it, and looking at the url).",

Only MaxSecure detected it as Trojan while the rest of the anti-virus software didn't found any virus in it. It's still better to compile the software yourself because the source is available at Github. The best thing about open-source software is that we can compile them easily ourselves so there won't be any fears from any kind of viruses or malware.",

I apologize for the off-topic.I have been using ShareX for years, never had any issues nor got hacked, so Iâ€™ll also go with the false positive probability. Even my own software already got more hits than a single AV I never heard about. Remember that most AVs only do pattern checking. If a malware fetches a server to steal your data, bytes for that feature can be labeled as such, and a legit software that also fetches a server - but to upload images - can mistakenly be detected as something potentially suspicious.",
