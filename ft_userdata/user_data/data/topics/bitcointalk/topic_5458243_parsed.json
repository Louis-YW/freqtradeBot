How do you find this page because it’s very rare to land on this scam website when user is searching for Bittrex since there’s no similarity on Bittrex URL that can mistake this casino for the original one.Bittrex already file Bankcruptcy last May so there’s already few demand for this exchange even with the original exchange since most of the users is already leaving this service due to the upcoming closure.",

So it's a very very risky for everyone specially new users.This is what made me laugh; frankly, they claim that this phishing site is a beta version of the Bittrex exchange which is in the process of being tested before the official release; these scammers with low IQ do not know that there is an exchange with an official release now and it is already bankrupt. I do not think that there is anyone who will connect their wallet and believe this Nonsense, most of the links of this phishing Bittrex site are broken, and the HTML pages are stolen from the official platform and not loaded.Anyway, thank you, OP, for this topic, and I hope that every newbie will have good foresight and not connect their wallet to such phishing sites even if they are similar to well-known exchanges.",

And this is the reason why first of all when someone sees an .xyz domain, you shouldn't be surprised if it's used for scamming people and copying legitimate businesses. Whether it's an exchange, a crypto casino or any other genuine business, you don't trust them.While these scammers have it all prepared and includes an app, I think this isn't the first time I've seen it but it's rare to see them very well prepared that even they create an app and upload it on the Google Play store or Apple Store.They're spending lots of money knowing that they'll victimize a lot of newbies.",

They want us to connect our wallet to sign up or log in. I am upset that I won't be able to troll them. Most of the time, when I see phishing websites that pretend to be original website, I go to the login page and write a bunch of random email and passwords and make them be happy for a few minutes until they figure out those emails and password doesn't really exist. Back in the old days, there was a lot of spam phishing. They were trying to hack Facebook, Gmail, and Yahoo accounts, making phishing websites and asking users to log in to get a bonus. Some of my friends tried to trick me a long ago, saying you can use free Facebook using this URL. Fuck it!",
