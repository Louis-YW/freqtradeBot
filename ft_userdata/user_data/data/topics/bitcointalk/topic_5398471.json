  "content": "Against the background of all the bad news lately and the terrible state of the markets at the moment, here is some positive news which should put some more confidence in the newbies, that not everything is lost, and how the bitcoin market died for 1000th time, again.Don't get fooled by the news sources saying that Bitcoin is dead and crypto is just a bubble. This type of narrative has been around since satoshi's era so, let's focus on the positive.Here's the link to the news..https://news.bitcoin.com/report-uae-airline-emirates-set-to-use-bitcoin-as-a-payment-service/QuoteThe United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s leading airline, Emirates Airline, will soon embrace “bitcoin as a payment service,” the company’s chief operating officer (COO) Adel Ahmed Al-Redha has said. In addition, the airline will add non-fungible token (NFT) collectibles on its webpage.Reports of the airline’s plan to embrace bitcoin come just a few weeks after it revealed its NFT and metaverse plans. As reported by Bitcoin.com News, the company’s goal with the metaverse launch is to ensure the airline is “aligned with the UAE’s vision for the digital economy.”",

The fact is, people can now pay using bitcoin, and at the same time them adopting it will give bitcoin more and more legitimacy. That in itself is great news adoption-wise, regardless if they planned on selling NFTs or not.",

Its always attached to it that any company announcing their services in exchange of BTC is called marketing or advertising regardless of what sort of services. If its a well known ecommerce site accepting BTC, we could still consider it advertising or marketing but looking at them adopting Bitcoin is a plus for the crypto community. It could be that companies today are realizing that the fiat money they got from the services they provide is less valuable already due to inflation.",

Now, it is really a refreshing to see that despite of the red market, adoption of cryptocurrency by merchants and big business is still coming in. Let's hope that this is just the beginning for many other major airlines to also be accepting Bitcoin...as this shows that BTC is now being looked as the most important important and most viable digital currency. I am hoping that Emirates will have a promotional activities for this development and that they offer something special for customers using Bitcoin.",

It is not difficult to guess that the UAE airline's management was preparing for bitcoin introduction as a means of payment for a long time. I can’t say what influenced it, this news or just people began to buy BTCbecause of the discount price, but bitcoin price increased by ~$3k. Although we have not been given a date when what the UAE airline has said will be implemented, but in the future, this news has very serious and positive consequences for bitcoin and the crypto industry as a whole. This may seem like a signal and set off a chain reaction when other companies, not just airlines, start using BTC as a payment service.It looks like serious business also wanted a piece of the BTC-pie. This is a good signal and a reason for ordinary people to think, despite the current decadent mood.",

I dont know about what NFT they are going to sell, but we can keep that aside for now, we are interested only in the bitcoin payments.However their statement that they will use metaverse to transform its processes - seems more of a gimmick and vaporware for now. It is also possible that they are trying to stand out in the global aviation market in the post-pandemic travel burst.It would be worth noting if other international airlines follow suit or what the government decides about crypto transactions. UAE government is very conservative, hence I am skeptical.",

For example, we have been at a point where Bitcoin has fallen and gone up many times, while altcoins have fallen and are hard to get back up. This is a sign that people should be aware that no company would dare to take the risk of accepting altcoin payments. Hence Bitcoin as an option. Moreover, belief in altcoins should be a harbinger of worry for those expecting a 1000x increase, while Bitcoin has been at the forefront of addressing those concerns several times.",

Imagine if they are publicising this in bearish market also then they care less the current state of market. All they want is acceptance of bitcoin as payment and think about the market valuation later. Emirates is big airline from the list and way popular in the business class too. Definitely there will be huge support to this payment system. Peeps would love to pay in bitcoins as everyone has hold of it these days. Not sure how fast they will act but definitely positive seed in the bearish market.",

UAE airlines to accept payment in bitcoin is a positive news and could be followed by more other airlines. However it should not expect big usage, because in the past Expedia started to accept bitcoin and stopped the service within a short as it didn't get good usage as expected.",
