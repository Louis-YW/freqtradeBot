      "body": "Nigeria politicians see election as a do or die affair but these time their plans have failed because if we vote the right person into power,we will see election as a way of voting out corrupt leaders and not giving them the opportunity to manipulate the figures or vote buying. These time let's go out and use our PVC to make a better future in Nigeria for our children and younger ones by voting into power the right man. If the right person is not voted in,it might be another eight years of suffering and lamentation. Tribalism is what has landed Nigeria into this mess she is in,because we feel that tribe is better than competency, which is a wrong orientation.",
