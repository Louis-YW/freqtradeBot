I created this topic because I have come to realised that account sold out are still stollen back by the seller for the reason being that they have access to the email even though the account buyer change the password to the account still they can still have access but if we can change email connecting our account after is created, it can minimize scam or stollen account related cases. This change should only be made accessible for the account owner together with strong password.",

It leads to another trick. If you want to terminate your account, you can change initial register email to a random (non-existing) one, change the account password to a random and log out.QuoteI created this topic because I have come to realised that account sold out are still stollen back by the seller for the reason being that they have access to the email even though the account buyer change the password to the account still they can still have access but if we can change email connecting our account after is created, it can minimize scam or stollen account related cases. This change should only be made accessible for the account owner together with strong password. It can be done by a step above but why do you have to do this if you set up good passwords for your email, your forum account and 2FA for your email too.For people who are careless with it, I am sure they will not care about changing their email only because to avoid hack. In addition, register email is one of way to recover your account so I don't think it is wise to change it to a non-existing email.There is (un)official recovery method, by a signed message but email is important too.Forum account: security, privacy, and recoveryHow to sign a message?Stake your Bitcoin address hereCreate your own non custodial wallet, get an address, sign a message and stake it in [3].[GUIDE] How to Create a Strong/Secure PasswordIt's good to take care of account security because it is good for you as well as reduce recovery burden on forum moderators.By the way, I think it's better for you to learn about Bitcoin than try to learn about forum rules, trust flags, merit because Bitcoin should be a main reason you join here.",

Now lemme now clear you the reason why I created this topic.I came across this topic https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5405280.msg60587645#msg60587645 on the thread few days ago. I felt the employee that created that account with the company email may still have access to the company password to the email, if this is true then I think there should be alternative for this account email to change for the employee not have full control of the account anymore.Am sure some users may have also experience cases like. Think about this idea once more if no need then am satisfied",

Removing it modifying it will deny the original account hack victims from recovering their accounts.If one bought an account instead of creating one which is very easy, and the sold account gets regained by the original user, then they have no one to blame except themselves. Why would they buy an account in the first place?",

It's good to have it set up this way because if someone loses his or her account, he or she can still access or retrieve it using the linked email address.Changing this policy will allow scammers and account hackers to hack some of the forum's most reputable members in order to scam or bring something that will have a significant impact on the forum's reputation. It's not a bad idea, and I believe the email system was designed for such a purpose.",

Unless am reading this wrong otherwise the whole topic seems to be based on a wrong assumption! Because it's possible to change the email address from your account settings. So am not sure what the problem is exactly?If you sell your account and the new owner changes its password, you can't recover it without knowing the new password even if you have access to the email linked to it.The new owner can change the email too and all you can do is to lock the account from the link on the notification email you will receive.Quote from: Hyphen(-) on July 23, 2022, 05:20:26 PMIt is forbidden to sell or buy an already build account in this forum.No. Buying and selling accounts is not forbidden according to the forum rules. However, it's frowned upon by the community.",

Of course with the exception of the bitcointalk account which is highly prohibited activity here. As far as I know OP email can be changed maybe you arent noticed it, just head to profile section and edit it.",
