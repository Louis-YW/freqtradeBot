  "content": "DISCLAIMER: THIS DOES NOT MINE NEO - It Mines DOGE and MXC. (NEO miner is just the name they chose)  Hello Bitcointalk family.I have another cool new toy to talk about from MatchX.Please see my last review about the M2 Miner: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414351.msg60979066#msg60979066This time I am here to talk about their new product: The NEO miner.I have been using the MatchX M2 miner for over a year now and I have been very impressed with its performance and earnings. It is a great device for mining MXC, DHX, and BTC tokens on the MXC data network. However, I noticed MatchX released a new NEO miner. NEOminer is a low-power, multi-token miner that offers a powerful and low-emission solution to change mining in the PoW and PoS era. It also creates a data network called LPWAN by connecting to other miners, and it can certify and verify digital and physical goods, including NFTs.I preordered multiple NEOminers during the pre-sale and it is scheduled to be delivered sometime this month. According to. The setup process is very easy and intuitive ( It is the same as the M2 miner its like a 5 mins setup).  plug in the power and ethernet cables, scan the QR code on the device with the DataDash app, and follow the instructions on the app to activate the miner.The NEO miner uses a mining algorithm called PoP (Proof of Participation) much like the M2 miner, which rewards miners for providing network coverage with their own miners.The NEO miner runs smoothly and quietly and consume very little power. According to the app, it only uses 1 Watt of power, which is amazing compared to other miners. It also generates a lot of data packets that are sent and received by other miners on the LPWAN network. This helps to increase the coverage and security of the network, as well as earning me more tokens.One of the most interesting features of the NEO miner is its ability to certify and verify digital and physical goods. I am excited to try out this feature soon. According to MatchX, NEO can work with N3XUS, a next-generation NFT beacon that can display NFTs in real life. NEO can also certify indoor sensors and luxury goods using its Low-Scale Certification (LSC) technology. This sounds very promising and innovative.                          My genuine thoughts on the NEO MINER: (11 months)I believe like the original M2 that this will be extremely profitable this makes an extimated $5 per day excluding DOGE rewards from bonded MXC, it basically pays its self off in a few months, I am pretty damn excited.Earnings $5 per dayThe Miner costs around $495 euros Payoff 100 days approx Just like the MXC M2 miner, the NEO runs silent, and produces no heat and is profitable. A miners dream.                  The Basics of the miner:You want to keep miner health at 100% to yield the maximum rewards. (how to mine the maximum amount of MXC through your Neo miner)There are a few different factors that affect miner health:1. Uptime:How long your miner has been connected to the internet. After 7 days you have 100% uptime. 2. Fuel tank:This is how much MXC you have mined, if you withdraw your mined MXC your miner health will be affected. If you withdraw all of your fuel your miner health will reduce to 20%. You can trade the markets and sell MXC at a high price, then buy it back at a cheaper price and refuel. 3. Proximity:You can only have a maximum of 50 miners in a 2km hexagon. If you add more miners beyond this you will start to experience reduced miner health.             Bonding MXC:Like the M2 miner, you can bond MXC to earn alternative rewards, The NEO Miners secondary coin to mine is $DOGE: Bond MXC tokens with your NEO miner to earn DOGE reward:Basically lock MXC tokens for a few months and in reward you earn $DOGE                  MXC Coinmarketcap:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mxc/You can purchase these through the official website:   https://www.getmatchx.io/24521TH/D42TT/ (ref link)OR AlternativelyContact me on discord: Bittawm #7197 or PM me here. Please note:  I can help negotiate good discounts and will be frequently buying in volume.I WILL CONTINUE TO DOCUMENT MY NEOMINER EXPERIENCE SO YOU CAN ALL SEE HOW I GET ON, I ORDERED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEO MINERS",

A miners dream.What does this miner do if it consumes 1 watt?It looks like a token price scam because you need to stake for mining to work. The more you take fuel (coins) the worse the miner works, which makes you not sell coins. This is definitely not mining, but a very cunning scheme.",
