I have been sticking to that strategy and even put larger amounts when there was a steep decline in a short period of time, everything on my cold wallet, nothing left on exchanges.With prices starting to slowly rise again (not sure if I really like that, always have the feeling to never have enough), what would you thinkis enough to retire in 2032? I know that nobody can tell that with certainity, but would love to hear your estimates:I think 10 BTC and 100 ETH would set you up for good, so once that is reached, I would stop accumulating, what is your plan?",

If you are a fairly simple person and have a lifestyle that is not too high, I think the amount of 10 BTC and 100 ETH is enough, but if you have a lot of needs and the lifestyle you have is also high, like you want to have a ferari or a luxury house in the elite area, 100 BTC in my opinion will not be enough either.",

Combine both and you're still short of 500K assuming that the bullruns don't further dilute your holdings. That is if you are able to continue buying while maintaining some spare cashflow for daily expenditures.I'd just go with whatever amounts that suit my fancy. There are other assets that will continue to appreciate so the amount of BTC don't matter to me.",

I guess these days, owning 1 BTC is extremely difficult for many people, let alone 10BTC and 100ETH. The goal of accumulating assets for retirement will depend on each country and each person's life needs, with your goal, for example, I never dared to think about it because it is a huge amount of money. In my country, if I get that fortune, I won't need to work from now on and can live the rest of my life without many worries. That's too much money to retire.",

For an average guy like me, this amount is really enough for crypto retirement, adding to other forms of assets that you might have accumulated before your actual retirement date. And if you are lucky enough before retirement, both coins might have doubled in price, which will be a lot of money compared to what they're currently worth.",

Personally, I don't know how much is suitable for retirement, but as long as I can still earn from it, I will continue to try to make it.",

If that money is surplus to you and you are not afraid of losing it, then go a head and HODLING.",

In 10 years, it may not even be around let alone be worth higher than this. Not to mention that the past 5 years that ETH has been dumping consistently (from 0.15 to 0.06) has proven that it has no long term potential.As for bitcoin, the way I wouldn't rely completely on bitcoin for retirement. In 10 years with the way inflation is going and if the adoption is slow and price doesn't go that high you may not have enough bitcoin to retire comfortably. In most countries the cost of living is already huge and is increasing fast.It is best to diversify into other assets and I mean real assets not altcoins.",

If you want to retire in 2032, you should consider how much you will need to live comfortably and plan accordingly. Are you looking to retire completely or just reduce your working hours? Do you need to cover your retirement expenses as well as your cost of living? These are all important considerations when planning for retirement.",

In my neighborhood, at a low-medium economic level, it's $200 monthly fees so that would be $2.64k a year or $26.4k for 10 years of life spending.Then 1 bitcoin will be enough if you live in my country.

If its me, Id say 1k bitcoin and 10k eth at least, but reaching this figure needs a lot of time and works or yet to say luck to have gained more than what you could do in a lifetime. But it will always depend on btc or eth value isnt it. Let say it reaches 1 btc= 100k; 1eth=10k then I have 1k btc then thats gonna be a lot of avtivity in life without worrying.",

I think you are either referring to being able to retire in those countries, which no matter how cheap life is there is going to be impossible if you retire at 50 and we assume you live until 70 with only 1 bitcoin, and if you mean let's say one year it seems a bit high for a poor country.

Only you can decide how much will be okay for you since you are actually the only one that knows exactly how much you spend.
