If you have that amount to loan, you will need to lend the money to people that you know that can not afford to be able to lose their Bitcointalk account. People in signature campaign should be able to pay the loan back if they are collecting good amount of money weekly. You need to read the lending service of other members on this forum, make your OP more official and avoid scammers.",

With the thread you just created now, it shows incompetency, which is something you should not have made public without starting a proper thread.There are some other old existing lenders on the forum; if you need some guidance or advice from them, then you can send a PM to them, or better yet, read the sticky rules on the lending board. Also,Â  go through the lending threads of others, and you will learn.",
