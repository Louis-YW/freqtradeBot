Upset can happen as each Filipino fighter who got that chance to fight a well-known opponent always desires to win.Though on my opinion, Garcia still have that upper hand here, though by experienced Gesta already have 33 wins and 3 losses at the age of 35, heavy puncher but I guess his stamina might be the problem facing a much tougher opponent, knowing Garcia, he will try to box his opponent and with that solid combination that he can throw, it will be a big problem for Gesta.",

      "body": "I thought there was already an official statement and I looked it in the bookies, I support the Mercito but I really think he will be knocked out by Ryan Garcia in less than 12 rounds. Ryan Garcia has the fastest punch that has a good counter but his punches was not that yet good with combinations and that could be one of his current weaknesses. Also, he needs to improve his jabs as that could be really helpful throughout the rounds, so far I go along with Garcia in this match.",

Mercito Gesta an unknown fighter gets the lucky break. Hector and Mercito still got a good opportunity to make an enormous amount of money. So it's still a win for both.  Hoping for an upset.",

He mostly lost when fight against good boxer and few times he win with a close decision either majority or split. If there's a bookie will add this match, I wouldn't surprised if the moneyline odds for Garcia is lower than 1.15x. Gesta haven't lost via KO even though there's few match if he's fell down, so it's will be interesting if Garcia can win via KO.",

Has solid punches, good footworks, and can dodge close range punches with ease. And what's special to him is his dedication with this sport. To those who does not know, videos of his fights, sparrings, trainings and such are all over the web. I also saw Mercito's fights and unfortunately, I kind of agree with a complete domination for Garcia in this fight. But ofcourse Gesta won't be in such position to match up with his opponent if he's a no one. His name is also quite being noisy especially with his previous fight. But still, I'd probably vote for Garca.",

So yeah, I good test for Ryan Garcia here, but who knows, Gesta might derail if he still has something in his, just one punch that will knock out the hell out of Garcia. We have seen the Ryan did go down from a pillow fisted Campbell, but if he is going to be touch by Gesta, just maybe he will taste the canvass again and see if he can get up or not.",

Probably a test on Garcia test, and as what we have said before, there could be a \"puncher's chance\" for Gesta but it is gong to be very slim.Filipinos though have big heart, so don't underestimate that. If he will lost on him, this will be one of the biggest upset and I don't know how Ryan can get over it. Maybe he will have a nightmare and his mental issues will surface again.",

The fight could go into the full 10 rounds because Gesta has a good defense and can take a punch.",

Back to this fight, I'm not really expecting that much either knowing that Mercito Gesta is just there to keep Ryan Garcia in shape as this is just a mere tune-up fight. And as usual, Garcia got the size advantage as well as the reach compared to the Filipino boxer. Although, Garcia should still be careful and not lower his guard at the crucial times because the experience always speaks the most and Mercito got those advantage.",
