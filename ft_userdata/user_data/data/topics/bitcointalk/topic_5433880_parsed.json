Â I remember before, some scammers will change some of the letters on the site name like from l to 1.So people at first, won't distinguish the difference. They thought it is also the official website of the project.This is a reminder to everyone that scammers are still not changing their tactics, as long as they can screw up these gullible people, they will.This is also the reason why we need to be meticulous in joining those sites as fraudsters are everywhere.",

Especially if you don't want to wait too long until start investing, as if we wait for too long the opportunity may not be available anymore later.Thanks for the reminder, next time I will pay more attention to projects raising funds in name of famous and consolidated companies.When we suspect of another project futurely, there is instant way to check its legitimacy. The safest approach would be to contact the company they claim to be raising funds for, wait for a reply from their official support and only then proceed. Unfortunatelly, it can take up to several days to receive a reply from such companies. That is, if they reply...",

This kind of scam is very common, scammers spend all their time trying to figure out how to lure their victims, and one of the easiest ways to do this is by creating a scam related to a topic that is currently hot, and AI has been a hot topic recently so it does not surprise me they have used it to scam you, and they have probably scammed many other people during the last weeks by taking advantage on the desire of investors had on putting their money in a project like this.",

But make no mistake, even though most Shitcoins are scam coins, there are also those that you can really rely on to take profits.Recently listed Shitcoins have very low prices and we can find out and choose Shitcoins that have good progress, That way there is still a large percentage of chances that one day they will experience Hype and the price will soar.Although indeed if investing or trading in Shitcoin you have to be extra careful because it has a very big risk of losing the money invested.The ups and downs of Shitcoin prices also tend to be faster and more unpredictable.",

Either way, it's good that you made a thread spreading awareness to scam coins like this one that they are taking advantage of what's hype right now which is the ChatGPT. This is also the reason why I'm only focusing on Bitcoin and other top altcoins. 90% or even 95% of the total number of altcoins right now are either a scam coin or a dead coin. Just better to invest into the top altcoins and Bitcoin of course. I just hope that no people or at least a few only will fall into this kind of way of scamming.",

I also have to say though, that you should have done it the other way around obviously. You should have done your research before you bought those coins and not afterwards and you should do it this way all the time before you invest into anything. That being said it seems like you still made a pretty good purchase as the price is up 170% in the last 24 hours so you could have make a nice profit if you sell now.I am surprised how many naive investors are out there in the crypto world. The volume of that scam token is also up more than 1200%, which means there are probably hundreds of people that bought this coins without even checking who is behind it.",
