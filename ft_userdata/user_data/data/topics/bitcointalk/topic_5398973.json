I am super excited that it is finally happening. The book club is called -  Bitcoin Tribe Book Club. Bitcoin Tribe Book ClubOn 5th February 2022, the Central Bank of Nigeria ordered banks in Nigeria to close the accounts of persons or business entities transacting in or operating cryptocurrency exchanges. Read it here -  THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA BAN ON CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGESDespite this crackdown on bitcoin, we love bitcoin. We believe in its potential to help our collapsing economy and in its ability to secure a better future for our unborn generations. Therefore, we thought it would be a great idea to create a conversation that revolves around bitcoin. We hope that Bitcoin Tribe Book Club will grow to be the preferred platform to read, discuss, brainstorm, and find solutions to some of the toughest challenges in our nation using bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies. Our first meeting is on 1st June, 2022. Here is our Instagram account  @bitcointribebookclub which I just created. I would very much appreciate your thoughts, comments, and ideas. Thank you.",

In most countries Banks had siezed accounts pertaining to Crypto transactions and later they allowed and again banning happens. I would suggest you to concentrate on your book than these Government rules even here we see our govt plays most time for crypto investors.You will see some results when the times just like a blog that turns into money making machine.",

Perhaps you can seize this opportunity to educate the ignorant ones over there about btc and help change their misconception about btc especially from the negative things they must have read online about btc. Although am wondering as a book club it means you will also be needing hard materials about btc to fill your book club and am wondering if there are enough such hard copies about btc out there, i know most of the materials regarding btc are online.

Remember it took some projects like Binance 30years to succeed (he replied me on Twitter) and some 2 years. CZ added that they invested everything they got and borrowed just to make it happen. Therefore, what matters is not how long it took them but, the success came at last. Good luck.",

Is that really accurate? Because from my understanding of that piece that was released within the week, it only imposed regulations and that was from the SEC. Either the ban has been lifted or not remains a puzzle as, local banks have not gotten the required go, from the CBN to fully transact or allow accounts to transact in cryptos. The SEC might permit this only within the registration and regulational rights for which, they will act as an umbrella in investigational cases and aside from that, your just by yourself.Meanwhile, I think you guys @OP have done great to have come up with the idea of having a cryptocurrency bookclub. It's a nice one and as pioneers of this innovation, I hope that you guys do the needed research of what makes a bookclub a bookclub and hope to make it stand. Also, ensure not to discuss your private portfolio as per hodlings to keep off unnecessary attention for privacy and security reasons.",

Yes, it is a good endeavour to educate people about bitcoin, and your concept will assist them in comprehending the importance and strength of bitcoin, as well as its usage and objectives. It also encourages them to be daring and learn more about bitcoin because they will have enough information to guide them through your worthwhile project while also providing them with more financial freedom.",

In addition, we plan to organize seminars and symposiums in the city. Also, our Instagram page will create engagement with Nigerians online.

However, far too much emphasis is put on the amount of Bitcoin can go up, and too little is focused on the true value of Bitcoin, allowing you to ditch third parties, take control of your own money, as well as looking after your own privacy. That to me is invaluable. Obviously, there are other benefits to it, but for me those are some of the key components that need to be taught, not the fact that Bitcoin can make you some money. I'd like the emphasis to be shifted towards educating people on investing to better your freedom, rather than to lie your pockets. Unfortunately, the latter is usually the center of the topic.",

There are limited job opportunities which has made the youthful population of Africa unemployed.  Therefore most citizens are looking for diverse get rich quick schemes and many don't having value for learning. The only thing that can attract most youths to your club is the financial benefit they would gain from your events. Even religious organizations in Africa have to entice people with financial and other benefits for them to attend their programs. Hence, you must ensure you combine lessons on the true value of Bitcoin and the financial benefits of Bitcoin. However, I believe you can still attract persons that are interested to learn about the freedom Bitcoin offers. Best wishes.",

We should educate others about Bitcoin concept to help them understand what bitcoin is and how important it is to us instead of just worrying about making profit without knowing the functions and the utility that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bring. Once again I wish your Bitcoin Book Club to grow stronger and create more value for the Nigerian people and wish the Nigerian bitcoin community to grow more and more.",

I'd probably make something wider, adding discussions of articles, as well as of crypto-related movies and TV shows, to lighten up the whole thing and broaden the scope.
