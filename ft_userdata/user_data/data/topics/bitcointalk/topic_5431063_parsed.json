Have the capabilities to asses a project if it is shady or not., Although this is hard to do, you can always refer to a long list of users in this forum who constantly report and warn users about scam projects/companies.2. Have a boatload of patience. You will be needing tons of patience as many bounty hunters will test you, ask you and even just annoy you. Prepare to be bombarded with redundant questions from dusk until dawn. And, it's not just bounty hunters, project teams will also do the same, especially those teams who are first-timers in doing bounty campaigns for their projects.3. Keen to details. You need to be wary of all the little things on your bounty campaign, especially with all the data on the campaign spreadsheet. Remember that people's rewards are dependent on those data.Quote I have a lot of interest to become a Bounty Campaign Manager.It's good that you have an interest in being a campaign manager but that alone would not help you get what you want. You need tons of contacts, to be able to communicate properly and encourage project teams to hire you. Nowadays, forum rank isn't so important anymore. I mean just look at the bounty section; plenty of newbies running bounty campaigns. It all boils down to how well you'll be able to manage and help promote the project so you can start building your own portfolio. Although some knowledge about excel or google spreadsheets, forms, photoshop, and how social media platforms work will help a lot.QuoteHow do I become a Bounty Campaign Manager?There's no clear answer to this. You're a freelancer. You can either post a listing on Fiverr or Linkedin or just plainly communicate to the project team and beg them to hire you. Once you've got tons of experience and previous projects under your belt, you will start receiving messages from project teams wanting to do bounty campaigns.QuoteWho will give me the project? A project isn't given to you. You're only given a chance to help promote it by managing a bounty campaign.",

If that's what was true, why Hhampuz is managing the most bitcoin paid signature campaigns while others are getting a hard time getting a single one? Hhampuz is currently managing ~10 signature campaigns, while Royse, if I'm correct, is managing 3 campaigns now. What about others? It's a lot of things you must know before being a quality campaign manager which will eventually get you more campaigns. It's not that easy bro. You can see a lot of campaign managers out there. How many of them get a quality project on hand to manage? Very few of them. Others are managing poor/scam bounty campaigns.I wouldn't discourage OP but remember that you need a lot of reputation to be a successful campaign manager here. Alternatively, build connections with more people here.Quote from: julerz12 on December 24, 2022, 12:52:54 PMNowadays, forum rank isn't so important anymore. I mean just look at the bounty section; plenty of newbies running bounty campaigns.True indeed but guess what, some of them even don't know how to maintain the spreadsheet properly. Also, it becomes easy to get a project when they charge a very small amount. I have seen a campaign manager getting paid $50/week. Some scam/shit project look for cheap services and that's how newbie gets the project because they charge according to their skill and rank. I'm sure no high-rank member would ever consider managing a bounty campaign for $100-$150/week even.",

Be a good participant first to become a good bounty manager, as much as possible get in under 3 to 5 trusted managers observe their work and how they communicate, and what criteria they asked on participants in the bounty campaign that they are managing, good communication is very important, and you know how to present yourself to project owners.

Managing a campaign does not require special skills or learning academic materials. It just requires knowing the forum rules and have enough time to organize everything.First, money management. I guess that the project team gives the bounty budget to the campaign manager who will decide how to spend it according to the rank of the participants.Second, how to choose the campaign participants is something that should be taken care of. Campaign manager should select good members depending on their reputations and activities in different forum boards.Thirdly, the difficult part, is to check tasks done by each participant, and check if the conditions and campaign rules set by the manager have not been violated.And all this is improved by experience, reputation, and punctuality.",
