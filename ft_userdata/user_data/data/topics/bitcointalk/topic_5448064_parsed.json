  "content": "Hello, I have a T19 antminer. It consumes 3150W for 84th. I know there are 3 ways to optimize this miner: -add a control board for overclock (sold by zeusbtc)-inject the eeprom of the s19 76chips in the hashboards and modify something else...(which I don't know, without the password of the ssh in root mode, no modification of the cgminer.conf file)-flash the s19 76 chips bitmain firmware on the miner t19 ( i don't know how to do, classic flash not accepted by miner)-flash with other firmware( vnish fee are 20% , i test braiins but not working).My goal would be to either be able to use the bitmain firmware of the s19 or to be able to underclock the miner.Â If you have the solution(s), thank you in advance.",
