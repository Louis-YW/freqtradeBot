Doesn't make any sense and they dont keep it in a multi-sig wallet.",

Having that sums of funds and downloading some app that you know that might compromise the hot/cold wallet, what kind of thinking is that?",

But that never happens, either the crap code stays up because the funds get spent on something else. Or the money needed never comes so they wind up leaving the crap code up because there is no money to fix it.Either way, it's going to continue to be bad until people stop putting money into crap exchanges.-Dave",

I don't think bridges are going away or will still be continued to be used because they provide for easier way for people to convert their tokens into different chains.A lot of people have always been very complacent. We can easily observe this not only in Discord and Telegram and social media sites and by connecting their main wallet to bridges, but also in the fact that many are leaving funds in centralized exchanges, or investing money in staking and liquidity pools and lending platforms, or installing extensions which they then connect to their main wallets, and so on and so forth.Convenience and ease could be dangerous especially to many of us who are mere crypto laymen. When we use a bridge, for example, we don't do technical checking whether it is safe to use or not. We don't take even a quick peek at its smart contract whether it is secure or not. We simply trust. And given that within the year alone a total of probably at least 10 bridges have already been hacked and at least a billion dollar lost, I don't think it is still safe. So rather than risking, it is probably better to just generalize and avoid using bridges altogether.",
