For people transacting huge amount, the fee is insignificant that they can pay it conveniently. But a situation whereeby the fee is close to your weekly investment amount, it becomes a big problem.Quote from: Agbamoni on November 26, 2023, 01:28:16 AMWhile I'm considering this alternative, another option is to wait for a month or two, then use the amount we kept for weekly DCA, hold it for a month or two, and lump sum.

My investment budget for a month is not that big that I have to worry about the risk of keeping them in CEX. I just hope the fees normalises soon.",

      "body": "Seriously DCAing in this period of time has been a thing of concern because in can’t move the funds to their wallets. I also encountered such problems when trying to purchase some bitcoin and had to pay close to 0.2 of the intended amount for DCA on transaction fees. The right idea is to buy bitcoin and accumulate and move it to your cold wallet biweekly or monthly or when the fees reduces a little. But the problem remains on which exchange.My advice is to buy from non custodial exchanges like Bisq, aside the privacy advantage on bisq it also has an in-built wallet that can generate your seed for you and you can simply password it1. This way you wouldn’t bother too much of any centralized exchange collapsing. You leave your funds on that personal bisq wallet and later move it to your cold wallet. 1.  https://docs.bisq.network/secure-wallet",

This is a discouragement truly but is not the first time that we will experience this kind of situation, which is why I know it's not going to be the last. You and your friend have also made the right suggestions, so don't be discouraged, I also advise you to continue to DCA without minding the situation. You can use your Debit/Credit card, P2P, or Lightning network if the money is not big. But if the money is big enough, I wouldn't mind the network fee if I were you, but I will be DCAing once a month.This would have saved you a lot of money if followed and could be paying barely $3+ for the transaction a month if you study the Mempool correctly.",

It stops being DCA since you're going to buy in a slump sum that might be 50% of the average , for better or for worse, it could also be the exact average of for the whole year, exactly on that day but anyhow it will be better than spending 10% or 5% of fees, those are lost money anyhow.Quote from: Agbamoni on November 26, 2023, 01:28:16 AMI feel like I may use the money kept for DCA for other expenses.That's your problem, and you must overcome that with discipline, if you feel like you're wasting that money on unnecessary expenses then better just incur the fees, at least you end up with something while buying rather than just spending, but again, it com down to what expenses you think of.Anyhow I would suggest trying LN as your fried did, the rest are just measures that will chip money from you with other expenses- moving between coins to save on withdraw fees and then change back to bitcoin will again incur extra fees- using a dex will get you in problems with sending small sums to the buyer, you will see increase fees thereIf we would have a truly cheaper solution for this ready then those exchanges would have already been out of business.Quote from: Dave1 on November 26, 2023, 08:35:53 AMI do agree, but this is just short term effect of the high transaction, sooner or later it will go down a bit.

The collapse of FTX is a warning to us that storing assets for long periods of time on exchanges is something we should avoid. Furthermore, just because FTX collapsed doesn't mean the remaining exchanges will collapse anytime soon, and temporarily leaving some bitcoin on exchanges isn't a bad thing.

I recommend storing your fund somewhere for weeks before buying Bitcoin unless the transaction fee becomes reasonable enough, if not it's better to keep saving up the money first, this will be a very hard thing in the coming bull market as there will be a lot of congestion on the network and only those with the $$$ will be able to do some transactions successfully, it's really a big concern.I am glad that I already bought some Bitcoin before the transaction starts going up but now I can't make small transactions because I am worried about the transaction fee, I just decide to use something else for daily payment solution.",
