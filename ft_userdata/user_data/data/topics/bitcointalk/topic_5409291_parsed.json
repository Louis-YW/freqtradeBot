Even if you got free or cheap power or even during a time when ETH is hitting ATH and profits are very large.If you over clock too much you will most likely get errors, or worst you might get a crash and then you need to reboot or worst you might get a complete freeze which requires taking the power out and doing a cold reboot. Both of these will cost you more money and it‚Äôs not worth it. Keep the clocks stable and don‚Äôt overclock to the point where you get crashes.",
