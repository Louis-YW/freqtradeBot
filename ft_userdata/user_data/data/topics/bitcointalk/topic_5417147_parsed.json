You do know that a bear market doesn't end overnight, right?Anyway, it's good to make a calculated move so that you don't end up selling the mined coins at very low prices just to cover your expenses.Quote from: igotek on October 14, 2022, 08:30:40 PMWhat are you mining now ?Personally, am not mining. Just doing DCA on the likes of Dogecoin when the prices are still low.",

These low cap coins won’t survive the bear market. They will go to 99% loss. This happens every cycle pretty much. You might get lucky but most likely many will be a slow bleed down.",

There's no guarantee the coin you've mined before will go to the moon, moreover it could become a dead coin and you're already wasting your electricity, hardware lifetime and your time. Right now I'm already stop to mine since I don't get any profit, I will wait until the market recovery.",

Most likely the coins you mine will lose 99% value or you will basically give up and sell all your coins because you think crypto is dead.Every cycle I knew people personally who just couldn’t survive the bear market anymore like in 2015 and 2019. Nothing was moving. All coins were trading sideways or going down. So people gave up. Thinking crypto is dead and that was the bottom. Most likely the same will happen to most people that have this mentality.",

Solar panels don't provide free electricity all day long. Do your mining farms only work during the day when electricity is free, and at night you turn it off?The generated power varies during the day and depends on the weather.

They will liquidate their farms of GPUs and instead buy BTC and LTC ASICs and mine with those.Mining with those even at a loss makes more sense since those coins aren't going to go -99% like most other mineable GPU alts. I remember maybe people back in 2015 were selling their R9 280X that they used for LTC mining and bought Antminer S5's and SP20s ASICs since they were more profitable and it paid off when BTC ran later that year.",
