      "body": "I suppose it has already been explained to you, but as I see that you insist with this thread after the red tags I would recommend you to think a little.When someone lends you money for an interest they have to have a certain guarantee that you are going to pay them back. You do not offer any collateral, which could be a guarantee, nor are you anyone with a reputation on the forum making money on it that could lose more than gain if defaulted on the loan.So it's not a question of respect or not, it's that you are banging your head against the wall since the only thing you will get are more red tags or you will be put on ignore.",

      "body": "To me it is clear you will not be able to get a loan (for reasons explained by several members in various threads) but if you insist on trying, you should consider taking a different approach.There are only a small number of lenders within the forum, did you try to make a request in every lender thread? Rather than post here and wait in the hope for a lender to approach you, why not consider approaching them all directly?Quote from: Alice102030 on September 23, 2023, 07:19:18 AMThis Is My Latest Post Due To My Faith To Respected Members Of BitcoinTalk.

Probably not ranked but, an account that have been around for a while or perhaps your just a quick learner with which, I will commend to have noted the navigations quick.Did a little review in your posts and your up and about looking out for loans. It doesnâ€™t tell well on you if you would permit me to say a little on it.About the loan request youâ€™ve got up there,Donâ€™t you think thatâ€™s a loafty some for anyone to hand right over to some random user on the web? Be it Bitcointalk doesnâ€™t matter. Itâ€™s still the web and filled with anonymity. I wouldnâ€™t do that on any grounds and I donâ€™t think you would should you have such balance or would you?In either case, you might consider being more involved on the forum and perhaps seek loans that could validate your account as this is too huge to get off anyone.",
