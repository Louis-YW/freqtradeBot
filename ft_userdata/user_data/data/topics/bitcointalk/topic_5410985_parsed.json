I'm sure it won't be easy to make money in leverage which is very risky or depending on how much leverage you set up I usually trade only in spot trading and I can't even make that 800% of profit in just 16 days or even a month.",

How come this is a fully documented trading while you are just providing screenshot of your position and doesn’t have any info on the result of each closed position. You should tabulate all your buy and sell orders that you can see on your trading history if you want to disclose your full trading activity.You are using 20x leverage with 2000USDT and above margin which is very risky. You are literally just gambling your money and not trading due to the risk involved. I saw you are losing 500USDT+ for just hitting your SL.",

Are you really the one who grew it from 1k$ to 8k$ according to the Twitter post you showed? It's easy to make a story dude. Then your only proof is the screenshot, I don't think that's credible to say that what you say is true, although we don't care about what you say.Most people also know that it is not easy to do the leveraging style in trading, then you are just that easy for you, I can only believe if you can show me some of the images when you started with 1k$ that you set up in actual trading how it grew and grew little by little in your trading activity.",

      "body": "Just as previous poster said. That's exactly what I think we are seeing here. False god doing 10x in 20 days (thats from 1000$ to USA M2 money supply = $21T in less than 1 year) to build followers base and than sell trading courses or copy trading.And it does not have to be a demo. it might be an average day trader which is manipulating data showing not all trades. With 20x leverage a 7% profit is a matter of few minutes if not seconds. No one will check if tweet was posted before position was opened and second one after it was closed or both SS were posted after it was closed only if it was profitable or slightly unprofitable from time to time to avoid suspicion",

Or maybe they are only doing this to encourage people that it is still possible to earn during this tough market situations. If we are in doubts about it then that is a good sign to avoid them but if we are fully convinced on what we saw then why not give them a try? Just always start with small amounts. That is great if they show their trades live and I think there is a way to tell that they are trading with real money or not.Usually in a demo trade, the results are always favorable. In case that is what you are watching then don't easily believe on it because the situation can change when it comes to the real trade.",
