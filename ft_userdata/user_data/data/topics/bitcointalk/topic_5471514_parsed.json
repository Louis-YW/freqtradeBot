We need good economy and good standard of living, but our government can not give us that because they themselves do not understand how they can, which makes them not to be good leaders. I aso think there is something innate about us that we just prefer not to believe that we can be like the Whites countries and other developed countries.

Gone are those days, those days no dey like nowadays ohh, for example we no go fit compare price of those days food stuffs to nowadays. Why Nigeria economy and situation dey like this na only God know why, For example subsidy was removed so that every state allocation will increase and the major reason why Tinubu removed subsidy he wanted the salaries of all civil servants, workers, salaries to be increased but rather state governors has refused to increase workers salaries, like my state allocation use to fluctuate sometimes 32bn or 33bn but nothing to show. Things like this are attributed to bad government and poor economy.But the fact that young and old people take this hustle dirty and illegal is still wrong and needs to be prohibited, people making legal money aren't foolish, in essence we should still be hoping for a better Nigeria.",

When salary comes, the managers have their percentage from the salaries paid to these ghost workers. The vacancy is only physical and not in the pay roll. The government is not to blame alone, although everything stems from their poor organization of the country,  corruption and favoritism is everywhere in the grassroot.

A large chunk of the blame also goes to the people of Nigeria because we have a very wrong mentality and how we have made today's society to be seen as a competition of wealth shows off,  and most times those wealth sources. Another blame goes to some of our parents of Nawa days because I don't expect a father or mother to celebrate the success of a child whose source of income is unknown and can be traced to any profitable engagements in real life,  a lot is going wrong,  aside from the government not giving job to graduates,  there is still also high rate of an unfriendly government policy that makes it hard for young graduates to start up any start-up businesses.",
