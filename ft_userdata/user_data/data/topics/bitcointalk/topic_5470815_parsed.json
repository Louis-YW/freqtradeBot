  "content": "I noticed something for a while, but only recently I figured out how things work.So if you have some boards at ignore you can't quote posts from them.During times I noticed sometimes that I can't quote some posts but I did not know why. When I was clicking on Quote button the screen made a short refresh but the quoted text did not appear in the Quick-Reply field. After I kept encountering this situation for a long time I finally managed to understand why that was happening.The problem occurred only when I was trying to quote texts (posts / topics) from ignored boards. However, you can open links of posts from ignored boards.Let's take this link, for example: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5470785.0. It is from a topic posted in Russian local board, inside Hoвички child board. If you have Russian board at ignore (together with all its child boards) or if you only ignore Hoвички board, the link will still open when you click on it. But you can't quote it.A similar situation occurs also when trying to merit posts from ignored board: you can't do it. However, when trying to do that, you get an error message, saying that you can not merit that post. But when you try to quote a post from an ignored board no error message is displayed, which makes things more confusing.I thought to share this with the rest of the users, in case others also encountered this issue and did not know why it happened.",

It worked.Yes, that's a very useful link and it's not bad that you mentioned it, although it has no relation to OP.I was thinking that, maybe, it would be useful to have an implementation stating an error message when trying in vain to quote posts from ignored boards, such as the message shown when trying to merit posts from ignored boards, thus the users would know why the quote does not work. I don't know though if theymos would find the idea to be useful or useful enough to cover the work for making the code changes.",

To be honest, I was not aware of this because I merely ignored whole sections or topics. Yeah, I ignore topics, but I never tried to make quotes or give merit to them. I don't know if it will be of any help to me in the future, but if I do not read this post and end up in the situation that you faced, then I will probably be wasting my time on it.Again, thanks for this, and I hope the notification message will be shown when we make a quote on an ignored topic, just like it showed while giving merits to ignored topics.And after reading your more replies, I came to know that we can make posts, but we cannot make quotes in them. Well, that was also new for me.",

I didn’t put this meta board on ignore but just to quench my curiosity I did so after I read digaran reply and when I tried to quote his message I got the reply In the image. Then to further clarify my doubt I went on to put him on ignore and unignore the board and the quote wasn’t at first shown but when I click the show/hide button it came up although his reply didn’t appear just the subject of the post did, but when I then went ahead to quote him it did appear. So I don’t get why yours isn’t giving out that error message",
