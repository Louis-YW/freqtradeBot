  "content": "Hi, I just bought a rig with 4x 6GB GPU:s.When I start it a software starts automatically, I think it’s T-Rex miner. The seller said I must change to my address in the bin file. I need help here. How do I locate the bin file? I can’t even find the program itself. And what address should I get? I have a Coinbase account. Should I keep this installed software, or is it easier to install a new one and get started? It doesn’t matter what currency I mine, I just want to start easy and see some coins ticking in. Thankful for help",

Thankful for help To find the bin file just click into the search bar of Windows if it is Windows and type there \"shell:startup\" without the double quotes to go to your start up files and you will see the bin file there,click on it,put your coinbase wallet if you want to continue with it and let it run.That is all you have to do if you want to continue doing the same mining as that of the guy you bought the rig.I suggest you use your own wallet like Electrum and not a third party wallet like Coinbase as you don't own the private keys in your Coinbase wallet.",

      "body": "Use a noncustodial wallet. Avoid coinbase.com. If you like coinbase then at least use their noncustodial wallet (coinbase wallet) other multi currency noncustodial wallets are trustwallet, jaxx liberty, exodus. Electrum is noncustodial but supports only bitcoin and GPUs are good for mining altcoinsUse mining profitability tools to see which coins you can best earn using your current mining gear. Please be informed that the current bear market means very low mining profits, sometimes you may even mine at a loss.",

      "body": "This is probably the worst time in the history of crypto to start mining.For a wallet custody refers to who has the keys. When you have the keys you aren't dependent on any provider but you are ultimatelyresponsible for them. Lose the keys and you lose your crypto, there's no recovery mechanism. You are also responsible for securing yourkeys so they don't get stolen. But they keys can be used with any wallet software.With an online provider you can only access your crypto through them. If they go out of business, or get hacked, you may lose your crypto. It really only matters if you have a substantial amount of crypto, meaning it wouldn't matter if you lost it, and where you believe the keysare more secure.",

So first thing is to install a new and fresh OS.If you have a standard rig, it'll be easy, but first give more info ok?Do you have any preference about the coin to mine?If you answer we can help you, because there's a lot of coins to mine, and possible different walletsA quick and easy way to start is with Nicehash, you'll sell your hashrate and be paid in Bitcoin.Avoid using exchange wallets.",

Given that he has bought a GPU mining rig at the worst possible time in mining history I don’t think he is at risk leaving 2-3 figures worth of crypto on Coinbase. Never heard of Trex miner. My advice is to go to the directory and find a readme file and look there. It will tell you where you need to input your wallet address.",

In any text editor, you can change the name of the rig and the address of the wallet.If it is a Linux system, like Hive OS or Raven OS, then a new wallet is added in the settings.I don't understand what operating system you are using.Better watch a few videos on YouTube and install Hive OS or Raven OS, 1 rig is always free. If 2 rigs, then I use Hive OS or Raven OS. Yes, I'm greedy",
