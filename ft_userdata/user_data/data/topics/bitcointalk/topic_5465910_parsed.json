  "content": "https://twitter.com/ESPNRingside/status/1699108446136852975So we have another good fight in the horizon here. Shakur Stevenson will finally have a dance partner in Frank Martin. And it's interesting as the rivalry between the two camps, Crawford, who obviously will back Shakur here, against a fighter of Spence in Frank Martin.Shakur is rank #2, while Frank is rank #4. And perhaps the winner here might go after the WBC champion in Devin Haney (although he doesn't want no part of Shakur hehehe as he has plan to move up in weight class and fight Regis Prograis).With that, this is very exciting fight, and for sure there will be a lot of trash talking here. And we will see if Shakur technical abilities will be too much for Frank Martin to overcome.",

And as the OP said, there is a some competition behind as Stevenson is very close to Crawford, not sure though if they trained under BoMac. And on the other hand, Martin is under Spence. So for sure there are already some animosity behind this fighter even before the actual fight.",

And with this fight, I think more is on the line here for Shakur, to the point that I think this is a must win for him to stay in path for at least the WBC belt.But as you have said, his oppponent is one underrated fighter, and so he will try to do his best to upset Shakur here. So let's see how it goes, Shakur might be the favorite but I think it will be a close one in the sport bookies.",

I agree, he is about to hit the prime years, and we all know that high caliber athletes when they are in their prime are hard to beat. And as much as Frank Martin is good, surrounding himself with good promoter like Spence and trainer in James, it's going to be hard for him to stop Shakur and it might be a bad timing for him to face Shakur at this point.The thing with Martin is that he lack the experience, seen his highlights but there are no known boxers in his resume. While Shakur since before the lower weight has face a lot of great boxers and he all beat them technically, and some with body shots.",

This is also what I'm thinking, because Shakur might try to go for a couple of rounds and see how Frank Martin will react and then adjust his game plan. And although he has a decent power, he is not a knockout artist in the mold of Tank Davis.So very careful in the beginning and then just starts to get hot in the middle of the round and takes over and win by a good score in the judges hand. And as what we have been wanting to see, him and Haney at 135 lbs will be good for a unification fight.",

The WBC however is not making it easy for him as he is to fight one of the technical fighter. Shakur had capitalized his wins against the big names he fought.Nobody is a champion here, Shakur is already fighting in lightweight division (135) and not in super-feather (130). Both of them is fighting for the vacant WBC title because the Devin Haney is now at 140 trying to challenge the champion, Regis Prograis. Although there is a slight twist to this bout because the title is not literally vacant after all because WBC is just naming Haney as a champion in recess because of his current situation which I mentioned above. But if Haney will be successful in his upcoming fight and will choose to continue his career at 140 then he will be stripped all of his belts which are situated at 135.About the two of them, Shakur got more experience and not Frank.You can see both of their records here:https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/814937 (Frank)https://boxrec.com/en/box-pro/790719 (Shakur)",

What Frank Martin has is he is used to this division or even higher so he is the stronger guy. We shall see if Shakur gains power gaining weight or he's power remains mediocre. Nonetheless, Martin has to show no respect for Shakur if he wants to win this fight.What makes this more exciting is it is a battle between PBC and Showtime versus Top Rank and ESPN. Top Rank and ESPN are the ones handling this fight. As far as I remember since the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight, Top Rank has 3 wins with a draw while losing none over PBC. Two Tyson Fury wins over Deontay Wilder and a draw and the latest was Naoya Inoue's dominating win over former unified champion Stephen Fulton. If Bud Crawford hadn't left Top Rank, it would've been another solid victory by Top Rank over PBC. Seems like PBC's big stars are hyped inside their network but lose big time every time they face the other networks' stars. Tank Davis is the only remaining undefeated PPV star of PBC and I also believe that Top Rank's Shakur will put him in school in dominating fashion.",
