They are not the most effective marketing channel, nor are they suitable for every type of business. Plus OP wants a specific approach to the promotion of his services. Perhaps for the participants, the signature campaign is the most profitable, but it should not be limited that it is the peak of the advertising.",

If you take a closer look at platforms like 'X', you'll see loads of the Forex firms with heavy and consistent ads ongoing, same goes for Facebook and Instagram. It will be ideal if you can subscribe to digital ads for your firm, a social media manager can handle it for you and make sure to target your preferred audience.",

Contact wwzsocki he is the owner and manager from there. (now he is mentioned here, maybe he will contact you himself)Thank you for recommendation @Examplens (don't have merits to reward this post, but will do it for sure when I will receive first one)@Raivien we offer all requested services and much more, I will be happy to talk, send me DM here on forum or contact me on Telegram @emoneyabc (check my profile here on forum) this is my username therewe have a lot of experience on Discord when it comes to shilling, chatters, mass DMs and other guerrilla marketing strategiesQuote from: examplens on November 15, 2023, 10:03:55 PMWhy do you insist on a signature campaign? They are not the most effective marketing channel, nor are they suitable for every type of business...fully agree, signature campaigns are effective only if done correctly and not suitable for every client, one needs truly decent campaign manager and approach to get the desired outcome we have to mention that this is rather expensieve comparing to other marketing services that can be used insteadI was asked many times for opinion if client should start signature campaign here on forum and unfortunately I advised against it in most cases, as mentioned earlier, in my opinion, it's not effective, especially in last yearsfor example meme coin or any other shitcoin, such campaign here on forum today will give literally nothing marketing wise, in my opinion that are lost money, majority of such campaigns are saturated with bots, even with higher payouts many top tier members wont agree to advertise it...Private deals for signatures with high ranked and most recognized members are worth attention, with right people it can have a lot of impact (advertising power) but same as signature campaigns not suitable for everybody, lately i haven't seen many of such custom deals so one may have some advantage here when it comes to advertising on the Bitcointalk forum.",
