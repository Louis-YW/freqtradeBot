Do you offer a service in online and you're mention your telegram in order to reach you? if not, there's no reason to reply a stranger. I always avoid or delete all of stranger reply to my accounts.",

      "body": "It is almost always a question of the intention of fraud. The conversation usually starts with a short introduction, an inquiry about personal life and, if possible, giving a certain dose of empathy. It's actually a psychological game and it's trying to gain some kind of trust. Everything is actually preparation for what follows, proposing a very profitable investment, business or whatever. Because you will more easily accept and believe in advice from someone you already know in some way. if you are a little more inert, it will be harder for you to tell him to screw up, and he will use that to pressure you to give in and believe his proposals.If, for example, you would slow down the conversation or answer only briefly, the business proposal would arrive quite quickly, without further intimation. still want to try because you are responsive and didn't block him immediately.Always keep in mind why a complete stranger would contact you and propose a super profitable job or investment. That doesn't even happen in fairy tales, there is always a final motive.If such things bother you, right-click on the username and the \"block\" option is the solution. You should not allow any harassment from unknown people on the Internet",

I understand that things like this cannot be avoided if you sell something online or offer some virtual services, but if you leave your contact around, then you can't expect anything other than that all kinds of strange people (scammers) will contact you.If I were you, that chat would end after one or two messages, and that user would be blocked. It's not that I'm afraid that someone will deceive me or something similar, but I consider such things a complete waste of time.",

I laughed and start to take his time too. Where it landed is a lie from me to have a physical visit with me in my country. It ended as nothing, no scam success because I knew he was a scammer even before the start of our conversation. Nothing like online friends to me, they are all scammers and they have not disappointed me before not to be a good person. Recently I got busier and I just ignor strangers. I did not also join groups again and nothing like new stranger 's messaging.",

This is because of you are in a group, predatory people take the user IDs from there and spam every one of those with tempting messages from a different user id, so the other one remains in the group as an innocent bystander profile, pretty much a sockpuppet advantage that telegram gives them. You can be assured that these are all scammers so block them on their first message and never reply back, it is a waste of time to do so.",

To me is very suspicious and too risky to continue communicating with her before you could fall victim of being scammed, next is to block such people except in a case were you shared your contact to such person then you guys could continue discussion.",

This type of scam is common on TG, and I'm sure it pays, which is why it's still around.I'm the type of guy who talks to them until they run out of words, then tells them to fck off and blocks them.",
