I'm not even sure how to use an escrow also I still have to have the buyer pay for shipping while I'm at the post office. I can't cover it. That's why video chat is necessary and I'd need payment upon tracking number.",

      "body": "If you want to actually make sales here utilize escrow You make agreement with buyer , maybe they send you shipping funds as part of the agreement or a label to print.Buyer pays escrow , escrow okays you to ship , buyer receives goods and tells escrow okay release the funds or disputes said transactions. For hardware there's a couple guys that come to mind Philima1957 ,OgNasty MoparMiningLLC and a few others just check trust feedback on your decided escrow. Most are usually around 0.5%-2% fee that a seller can put on buyer I generally charge for shipping and bundle it towards total in escrow.Escrow provides a layer of security for both the buyer and the seller it's pretty necessary specific to you as your so new and still lack trust here. As you build trust you might get a few non escrow deals ,but as a buyer you should always demand it if anything strikes you odd in a transaction or with new users. As a seller you should always accept it if asked or offer up preferred escrow providers before they even contact you in original sales post , agree on escrow provider (use trusted sources) As you frequent here you'll start to understand why.Cashapp and Bitcoin in particular are a no refunds environment so there is necessary precautions in play around here.Â Welcome to the forums and good luck with your sale.",
