What I will also advice is to get another Metamask wallet which is used for this. But not only that, only be using very small amount to gamble on this  sport gambling site for now, we should not trust anything until we see good feedback from people after long period of time of using the gambling site.",

Please give our site a try, and we are confident you will enjoy your stay!5/ There are many so-called web3 casino/sports betting platforms that advertise crypto acceptance. However, you still need to deposit your crypto into their centralized wallet. With Nova88 Cryptosports, your funds remain in your Metamask wallet. Whenever you place a bet, the stake is locked in our smart contract, and we will match it with our own fund.

Please join our Discord to stay updated. We are also giving out 1 ACT, which is AminoX's native token, for every $10USDT bridge to pay for your betting transactions. The gas fee is on us!

The Tether USD seen currently on our site is on the AminoX Blockchain, which has significantly lower transaction fees than Ethereum. To place bets, funds can be bridged in and out from either BSC or Tron.In addition, we do plan to support multiple chains, which will open up new possibilities for our site.

However, you are still requiring user to connect wallet on your website that might expose privacy of our wallet. Directbet is a casino that doesn’t require any connection to our wallet. This casino only provides deposit address for the bet pick then once bet amount was sent, The smart contract will automatically payout the balance on the sender address. I think your casino has the similarities. I will try to explore it later.By any chance, do you have an audit for your smart contract?",

The color combination is really fabulous. As expected its smooth to load considering there are not many games yet so the server load must be at its lowest. Just hope that you will present the casino more prominently. As you have mentioned it’s KYC free, people are gonna love it considering the bad past experiences on the other casino. I just hope you will not start asking KYC if casino starts earning bill revenue in the future? Have you got any plans for the jurisdiction where your casino belong to?",

I see you already upgraded your account to a copper member which shows your experience as a good marketer and your regards for forum policies. I had to check your website I noticed you have a board for tutorials which is a welcome development as I rarely see casinos with that feature. Atleast for you to have that feature your potential customers would try it and have knowledge of how your games roll.Another thing I looked out for was your license and as usual, most casino do showcase their various licenses on their website for their potential customers to see so as to have confidence in their services rendered but I could not see any thing of such on your website and where you are operating from.It is good you identified with this great platform with a huge number of traffic but I must say your chances are very narrow because you would have big names here to contend with in terms of popularity and awareness. So therefore I will urge you to seek the expertise of reputable campaign manager @Royse777 for the promotion of your casino. Feel free to contact him and he is well known in this forum.Once again welcome to the bitcointalk platform.",

      "body": "welcome to the forum, I noticed that your casino does not have KYC, although I and many other people do not like KYC, international laws force people to do KYC, international laws force casinos to have a license and ask their customers for KYC customers to comply with international anti-money laundering laws, even if your intentions are good, when governments hear that your casino doesn't ask for KYC they will shut down your casino, learn all of your servers and currencies, and tell you accuse of money launderingmy advice is that you strive to be licensed and ask for KYC or else you will risk being chased by the police and you will be arrested accused of money laundering and operating an illegal casino without a license and they will confiscate all your casino coins, the governments they put very high prison sentences for money laundering crimes, in my opinion it's not worth taking that risk, and for people who use your casino they will also be running the risk of one day seeing your casino closed and all coins confiscated, I don't see it advantage of it allunfortunately the damn KYC is here to stay for many long years to come, circumventing KYC is the same as breaking laws and asking to be arrested and get many years in jail, I hope that all people think a lot about this and not be deluded into thinking that things like not having a license is a good thing or if they are not asked to do KYC then they will be safe and there will be no problem",
