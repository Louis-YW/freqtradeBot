Cutting every bit of cost is crucial for miners and in your perspective exploring 2nd hand mining machine can be a good strategy.

The E9 Pro mines the SHA-256 algorithm, which is used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, while the L7 mines the Scrypt algorithm, which is used by Litecoin and Dogecoin. The SHA-256 algorithm is more popular and has a higher hashrate, but the Scrypt algorithm is more profitable at the moment.Your friend's experience with the Abyss model shows that even the most profitable ASIC miners can lose value over time. This is because the difficulty of mining a cryptocurrency increases over time, which reduces the amount of profit that can be made.The halving of SHA-256 rewards is definitely a factor to consider. When the next halving occurs, the rewards for mining Bitcoin will be cut in half. This will reduce the profitability of mining Bitcoin, but it will also reduce the competition, which could make it more profitable to mine other cryptocurrencies.The L7 has already undergone halving, but it is still one of the most profitable ASIC miners on the market. The L9 is expected to be even more profitable, but it is not yet available. If you are looking for the most profitable ASIC miner, you may want to wait for the L9 to be released.However, the L7 is still a good option if you are looking for a profitable ASIC miner that is available now. It is also important to consider the cost of electricity when choosing an ASIC miner. The L7 consumes a lot of power, so you will need to make sure that you have a cheap source of electricity.The decision of whether to buy a second-hand mining machine is a personal one. There are pros and cons to both new and used mining machines. New mining machines come with a warranty, but they are more expensive. Used mining machines are less expensive, but they may not have a warranty and they may not be as reliable.Ultimately, the best way to decide which ASIC miner to buy is to consider your budget, your electricity costs, and your risk tolerance. If you are willing to take on more risk, you may want to buy the L7. If you are looking for a more conservative investment, you may want to wait for the L9 to be released.Here are some additional things to consider when choosing an ASIC miner:The hashrate of the miner. The hashrate is the speed at which the miner can solve cryptographic puzzles. The higher the hashrate, the more profitable the miner will be.The power consumption of the miner. The power consumption is the amount of electricity that the miner uses. The higher the power consumption, the more expensive it will be to run the miner.The noise level of the miner. The noise level is how loud the miner is. If you are planning to mine in a residential area, you will need to choose a miner that is quiet.The availability of the miner. Some miners are more difficult to find than others. If you are in a hurry to get started, you will need to choose a miner that is readily available.I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.",
