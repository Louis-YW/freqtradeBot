OK. Children are responsibility of parents to guide and mode their efficacy of characters and intellectual prowess. You can intermediate good behavior anywhere is found. If you as a parent trained your child properly, I don't see need to be panic about a child be bully in school, a child with good moral vibes find time for things that are important and not looking for some junks behavioural children to play. Is from play before bully, but if a child is smart he or she knows who to avoid in school, so that's your responsibility to give them what morals they represents outside.Coming down to relative abuse of female children, I don't understand. No normal human being will abuse a child and no normal parent will allowed a child around abnormal people. This also balls back to training and upbringing. Children are smarter than adults if they gets good background upbringing. You can't try will jokes with smart children, they know who their relations are like. They observed, detect, calculate, and monitor your presence if you're a funny relatives. So that's your work as a mother to put children in a right direction.Finally, as I said earlier every good child has a way of applauding his or herself. All they wants to see is the morals you as a parents you deposits on them. We should learn to give children good characters, character is everything. With this they will always makes you proud, as for compliments they deserved it when you deserved it as parents.",

If you make your kids to be scared of you, many things going around in the lives of your children you will be very unaware of them and the ending result will not be nice to you.",

If children are not well groomed they might end up becoming misguided and unproductive. Most of the criminals and abnormally behaved adults in the society are products of a dysfunctional upbringing.Every parents must be close to thier children so that they can always open up and tell them what the are going through everyday. Children should be able to freely communicate with parents without any form of reservation or secrets. A child should be able to inform his parents when he is been bullied in school and the parents should take immediate action. They must visit the school and ascertain where the bullying is coming from and it should be handled immediately. Parents should also observe when their children are showing some abnormal signs. An example is that when you child that was always happy to go to school suddenly becomes scared and doesn't want to go anymore. It might be a sign that he is been bullied.It is not every relative that is welcomed in my home. I don't trust anybody with my children. I can't allow you to stay alone with my daughter because you are my brother. If you have a close relationship with your child she will always tell you what maybe an uncle is doing or did to her. Also your girl child must know about sexual molestation. She must know when the touch is getting out of hand. She must know the part of the body that nobody should see or touch.Every child has a gift or talent. And if you spend quality time with your children, it will be easy to identify them. It is the responsibility of the parents to support and guide their children to develop these talents. Currently, there is no skill that cannot be developed using social media platforms like YouTube.",

There are techniques to do that so that your kids will always be open and will tell you quickly if something is bothering or hurting them. True, observe your kids and if there's something wrong or odd, you should take care of it and facilitate their feelings.When a kid keeps secret from you, it's no good.

These innocent children needs to be protected from misinformation in these social media platforms. There are many information out there that are wrong and destructive. Our children have been exposed to negative vices like pornography, bullying and suicide through the social media. That's why it is important that parents closely monitor their children's phone use and control the sites they visit as well as the people they communicate with. Some parents feel that buying phones for their underaged children is a sign of care or love. Even when the child is insisting to own a phone, it is the responsibility of the parents to ascertain if the child is matured enough to handle the negative influences that is related to the internet.",
