And with this coin, I don't think they can even survive for couple of years in the trading market.Though it is too early to judge, but if you have seen a lot of projects already, I don't think this one will find its valuable application in this market. They need to address certain problem to keep afloat in this market. Otherwise, this can easily be abandoned without warning.",
