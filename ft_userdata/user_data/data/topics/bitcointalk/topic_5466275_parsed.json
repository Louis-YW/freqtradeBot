We cant blame them to pursue such potential free nft however, with massive scams due to hack account of prominent personalities it increases the crime of those scammers. Whatever process they did to hack Vitalik account isnt acceptable. Those should be captured and punish. Maybe Elon Musk could offer some help sincr its happened on his own platform afterall.",

The account already restored to the vitalik and he had removed the phishing link that posted on his twitter last day. The thing that makes me curious is how dumb people is? They were only clicking the link blindly like they have no brain to think. I don't even know how many stupid people who trapped in that phishing link but they must be dumbest people. They were blindly clicking the site and filling what already asked/connected to the scam site. There are still many people who act like bots in crypto.

If it was getting hacked through simswap and he has been losing everything. This case is a common thing in the x. I saw that so many golden badge accounts were also getting hacked. I dunno what's wrong with x but this platform is far from good on its security. It's often being hijacked b the hackers. The security owned by x is really weak.",

Now, how is someone supposed to prove that their account was hacked on not?There is no way to verify whether the account has actually been hacked or not. Even Twitter itself cannot prove that this happened if no suspicious change occurred in the account settings. Of course, this raises the hypothesis that Vitalik, the owner of the account, is claiming this to justify the hack, which it would be assumed that he himself was the one who carried it out. The stolen amount is not that large, and therefore I doubt that Vitalik is claiming that his account has been hacked, and at the same time I find it strange that a developer of his size is unable to properly secure his accounts.This raises a deeper problem regarding trusting the accounts of these “influencers” as if we trust them themselves. People who lost their savings did not bother to check before connecting their wallets to the suspicious site.",

He shared a phishing link by mistake? Certainly we cannot accuse Vitalik of sharing a phishing link himself to scam his followers or can we accuse him of working with a hacker and let the hacker borrow his account. It would be very head shaking if he did.In any case, everyone should be very skeptical on offers of free NFTs from influencers even if they are real. Much of them is a waste of gas fees.",

His account got hacked due to the sim swap. I think that it has nothing to do with twitter's security but i do agree if twitter's security was weak. There have been many similar cases happened since a few years ago. Glad vitalik has gotten back his account again.",

Vitalik becomes so bored and broke he needs to create a phishing site for victims to fall into the trap of wallet drain, this does not sound like what the likes of Vitalik can do.But what actually is kinda weird is how such a person's account got hacked! it just goes to show no one is safe from hackers, irrespective of how careful or secure you may claim to be.",

People can just social engineer their way to your account via gullible phone network staff.While looking at this closely, i also noticed that google 2fa is not an option anymore for non-subscibers, which is just mad. There are many influencers that are not paying subsctiption, because of principleAnd platform formerly known as twitter thought, that it might be ok for their followers to get scammed, if they don't pay for subscription. Now it turns out it doesn't even matter if you pay subscription, if hacker uses social engineering to telecommunications company.Twitter is working like a toilet in a public train.",
