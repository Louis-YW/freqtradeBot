Ofcourse, Whale lost control since Bitcoin became very sophisticated and hard for them to understand or control. It's not really much about demand and supply thesedays. It's recalculated to include \"Clean Bitcoin\"...  0.0002 clean BTC could be worth more than 10 dirty BTC with the recalculation. Besides, working for the good of Bitcoin can also increase the price and make it more valuable.  And, if you are influential person, you can make the price increase by speaking well of it or with the Power from our CREATOR. Hope with the above criteria you may be able to guess who currently controls the price. Very few people are qualified.",

It doesn't matter whether the whales are losing power and nothing will change the fact that they've got more bitcoins and they still have a huge influence to the market and its community. If they're losing less bitcoin, it's also possible that they're experiencing the opposite of gaining more due to their experience and resources.IMHO, the real powerful folks for moving the price of bitcoin aside from FED are those really influential and wealthy people that has got a household name on their each industries.",

I have heard that statement more times than I can count or maybe  but if they really control Bitcoin, couldn't they just keep the market up all the time instead of this long bear season?",

We sometimes see this whenever price shoots up despite their attempts at market manipulation by dumping large amounts or placing big sell walls hoping it could prevent the rise.But there are also whales who were smarter and didn't go against the market and actually increased their wealth. In any case the way bitcoin blockchain is makes it hard to come to any conclusion about how many whales there are and how much bitcoin they own or whether their \"wealth\" has gone up or down.",

I was hoping that he finally left those ideas behind, but it seems that he will take the credit again because the price of BTC is rising...People who have large amounts of BTC can influence the market, the only question is whether they want to and to what extent. Of course, when it comes to profit, whales behave like the real killer whales in the oceans, and small fish don't stand a chance against their tactics if they trade. A lot of money usually creates more money, and a little money usually leads to a complete loss. We must know that someone's loss is always someone's gain, so if 95% of crypto traders lose, that means that those 5% make exceptional profits.",

I think that until now whales are still influential in the Bitcoin market and are the caretaker. Especially if a group of whales decides to unite, the impact is very significant.What you say is true, regarding their strength starting to decrease. Why is that?? This is due to the growing adoption of Bitcoin which is increasing which allows more people to access and use Bitcoin.The proof can be seen in the increasing number of exchanges and wallets that store large amounts of Bitcoin. As more people join the network, the number of whales holding large amounts of Bitcoin decreases, making it more difficult for them to manipulate the market.",

To the level of my knowledge and understanding. Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone. Bitcoin is not controlled by anyone but those who hold large amounts of bitcoin, they can manipulate the bitcoin price in their favour. To me, bitcoin is still a market manipulated by oligarchs rather than relying on supply and demand. The financial market, cryptocurrency is the youngest market and has not been regulated or regulated by any government agency, so manipulation takes place a lot in the market. Hopefully, in the future, when the market is more mature, the manipulation will disappear so that we have a fairer and cleaner market.",

You need to clear your concepts a bit. No whale can control the bitcoin, yes those have large amount of bitcoin, they can sell the coins to create an impact on the market. Similarly, anyone with billions of dollars can buy bitcoin leaving an impact on the market. Mostly exchanges hold a lot of bitcoin and they just do the pump or dump to liquidate positions.Also, even if we believe you, then it is good that whales are losing power and bitcoin is vastly spread among the masses. Remember when bitcoin will be adopted all over the world, no one would have the power to influence bitcoin price.",
