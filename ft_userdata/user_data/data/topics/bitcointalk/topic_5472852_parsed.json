The key on here is just that dont tend to chase up those billionaires or millionaires who do gamble out like crazy. Of course they do have that financial capacity on which means that they could normally be able to wager up millions or even billions basing up on the link given. We know that in this world which there's no such thing about balance on where anyone could really be that filthy rich or simply just that some average joes or gamblers who do willing to spend up some bucks. If you dont like on being that having that emotion which you do get jealous then its better to ignore it out because once you do find yourself trying to mimic those whale or millionaire gamblers then you would really be ending up on messing your life. Why? you would really be justtending to do the same even if you do know that you are really just that a speckled dust into their hands.

I wonder if how much of it are from sponsorship from the platform itself as most streamers are paid by these platforms. Anyways, my personal total wagered amount is around 50-100 thousand only and that's for my whole gambling activity on one gambling platform I mostly play on.",

Like you rightly answered him, I also do not try to know the amount other people put into gambling when I'm gambling, rather I stake the amount I want and which I know I can be able to take the losses when I lose.",

After all, an addict can stake his life, but for someone like me, I can stake money that I can afford to lose and bokayok with. So instead of struggling to have a chance to meet up with those billionaire streamers,  it is better to save yourself the energy and concentrate on winning against the house,  don't get distracted at any point.",

(!?)So the point is, as you mention, anything that takes you out of your betting size is just a reference, they are not paths to follow.",

I have some tricks of my own and I never chase bonuses from wagering. So I never think about how many wager I get in one week or one month. Although I'm sure my wager will be very small because the deposit I made is also small. But I'm surprised anyone can have wagering that much, maybe he deposited at least 10% of the total wager he earned, that's a huge amount.",

And the article also says that he made 7.5 million bets - this is a huge distance and he cannot be profitable on it purely mathematically.Basically just speaking on the house edge and the amount wagered then it is really that talking about multi-millions on which from that alone then we could really say that he had already lost that big.This is really that hard thing on online world on which every information couldn't really be that exactly be precise or just simply telling the truth. Lets assume that this one is legit then there's no way for us to reach out on what these people been able to do so. There are rich people there are average and poor ones. There's no such thing in speaking about equalityyet this had been always a normal thing on todays society on where it is really that divided basing up into your financial capacity.For me then total wagered for this year is already playing around $1000+ and im not really that a heavy gambler. Amount might be small but this is only the money on which i could really that afford to lose. If those people do able to make such huge spending that only elite people could do then just let them be.Its their money that had been used not ours. It is really just that there are people who do really love on seeing these spectacular amounts.",

He is a good example of a gambler who is addicted and at the same time have so much money within their disposal to use in gambling. $14billion total in bets??? it sounds ridiculous! but check out, if you are able to see the total you have spent on gambling yourself, the figures will indeed even still surprise you.

How can we compete in some wagering wars and competitions against players who wager so much? Do we even have a chance? Yeah, saw some of his twitch videos in the past and it's insane that he might have gambled that huge money. How about Drake though, he is for me the biggest whale of them all as far as online streaming goes as he is the one that I saw betting $1 million per spin in a slot game. The game has to change and cater for him because as far as I know the max bet for a roulette in slots is around $300,000 only.I don't think we have a chance against from this whales, they might be wanting to out duel each other. But nevertheless as a regular and average joe gambler, we can't take that risk and will rather be just investing those huge money if I have the chance and not to gamble that much.",

The result is that I won that bet thankfully, but that is the first and last time I will bet that much because I can't take the anxiety of what will happen to my bet. It's not that I got afraid, but I'm more careful now. To my next bet or stakes, I only limit myself to $100 every session or in one bet. That's it, nothing more, nothing less. It's more like my limit and boundary. I set this limit to minimise my gambling spending and it has proven to be effective because, as I monitored my wins and losses, I saw that I earn more than what I lose, which is a good indication that having discipline in gambling is much better.I have friends that spend quite a lot of money on gambling, mainly sports betting. As they are fans of the NBA, they spend a lot on it. And they don't track their wins or losses, but I think in a day or a game in the NBA, they can spend around $200–300, which is a huge amount.",
