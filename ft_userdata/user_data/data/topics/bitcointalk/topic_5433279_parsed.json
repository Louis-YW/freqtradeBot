I think hiring a professional to manage the job is a good idea, but if you already have a capable developer, there are some free or open-source solutions that can get you started, like for example Poof https://www.poof.io/ and BTCPay Server https://btcpayserver.org/. The main benefit of using an open-source solution, like BTCPay Server, is that they are not cloud-based and do not require any third party for the integration. It means that the entire process is under your control, and you don't have to worry about security issues or data privacy.",
