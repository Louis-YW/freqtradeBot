Actually this image has just 2 visits (3 with mine)...Â  No it is not an auction.I sell my artworks in local galleries and am taking those online now. NFT's seem to be a great platform supporting such artworks so have started with my crazy artwork collection.I am not selling those on NFT marketplace as of now. I am selling those to direct customers interested in my collection.I am running those on polygon.$300 is not the exact valuation. I am hoping for the interested parties to quote their perspective of valuation.",
