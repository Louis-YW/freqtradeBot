If at least one person will be motivated by this post, it is a win for me!Clearly, by the LUNA fall and then we are experiencing a bear market. No one can deny that.I have been in the space since 2017 - I wasn't just too bored to write here, since now   - and I have seen a lot of ups and downs from the market all this time.It is obvious that people are losing attention when the market is down and they try to grab opportunities from serious even from scam projects during a bull market.I just want to say to all the members that will read this that a bear market doesn't say anything about your investment. In the long term you are going to reap profits from the coin you have selected, especially if your coin is a well established one with developers with experience and passion for crypto evolvement.A hint for that is the growth of Bitcoin through the years.https://imgur.com/a/lHlwUsBBitcoin ROI is at 13820.78% right now, cosindering the fact that the price is pretty low right now it can still explode.Keep accumulating crypto and you will reap the rewards in the future!",

People should be careful, those that invested on some altcoins when their price was very high may not achieve the aim, expecting the price to increase and reach the price when they invested it, they may be disappointed after they have waited for years, expecting the coins to reach the price when they invested on it but remain unrealized loss when bitcoin reach all-time-high. I will advice people to invest in bitcoin.",

Scams are always present, maybe even more so in a bear market when various projects try to sell the idea that they are better than others for some reason.Their methodology is very simple, and it plays on one of the most widespread human traits, which is greed. If someone invests in Bitcoin today and hopes for x5 in the next few years, it's not something most people consider a great opportunity - but those who promise x50 or x100 are much more interesting, especially for inexperienced beginners.",

Terra (LUNA) was a great choice as far as altcoin investment is concerned. It was the best until it wasn't.

But thats normal having doubts isnt something you can easily erase.  Invest on altcoins and surely youll definitely experience loss but also has a greater chance of earning much more than btc. Of course that depend on which coin you choose. Pick a good and establish one and you are good. Avoid some shitcoin these are short to medium period only.",

Vast majority of coins won't either survive bear market or even again reach the previous all time high, just like it happened previous time. Another thing that people often do is that they hodl for too long and they don't have guts to sell with the loss and instead they end up being bag holders.
