I know several threads have been made in this regards with most of them moribund. I created this post because I feel so bad regarding what happened in my country.

The buildings were built in an area that the government now considers illegal to build or something like that?Yes, Bitcoin if you self-custody it and use it well is much more difficult to fall into the clutches of the state as in this case, but the house you live in, apart from being an investment is necessary. You are not going to have everything in bitcoin and live on the street. The other option would be to live renting and have everything in bitcoin but it is better to diversify a little and that what you pay month to month is towards the equity you have in the house, not a sunk money that you give to the landlord.",

I don't really understand your video gan.bitcoin is indeed a masterpiece that is not expected, its intention is to test transactions between users but currently many are using it for investment, transaction tools and even certain countries consider it legal to shop as currency.sir, I myself still have bitcoin even though I invested in spot trading on CEX, I know the risks but that's the easiest way for me to utilize my bitcoin.If I can choose ... physical investment is also needed, of course bitcoin complements and makes it easier for me to invest.",

This is a confirmation that Bitcoin is safer and better than many conventional investment portfolios. I think you are missing it here mate. Bitcoin is indeed a promising investment, but like all investments, it carries risks. Just because you've invested in Bitcoin doesn't mean that other investment opportunities lack merit. Diversifying your portfolio by also investing in assets like real estate, which tend to appreciate over time, can be a wise choice. Bitcoin's volatility makes it riskier compared to real estate.The distinguishing factor is that you can invest in Bitcoin with any capital you desire. I also came across a post this morning in which someone sought advice on whether to invest in Bitcoin or land as assets. The answer is straightforward \"what ever you may think about investing on, the choice is ultimately yours, as long as it has the potential to yield profits over time\"",

The only thing that matters is how the investor understands and interpret the risk factors, because he/she must be ready to bear the cost.",

Bitcoin is not a perfect investment because it also has some level of risk. I have also observed that there is no need to compare Bitcoin with any other investment such as real estate because they are two different sectors. I am one of the people who have so much respect for the real estate sector because it has less risk and appreciates significantly. But the recent happenings in the world are making me change my views. The recent earthquake in Turkey, Morocco and Afghanistan the flooding in Libya and the destruction of Gaza are all indicators that the Real estate sector is not risk-proof. Investing in bitcoin is not also a safe haven because many people have also lost their funds through hacks and other attacks. The best option will be to diversify your investment and learn the art of keeping your investment safe.",

      "body": "Bitcoin has many advantages over traditional investment options. The main advantage of Bitcoin investment is that it is decentralised and can not be controlled by an institute or a government. You will have a complete hold over your investment. You can easily transfer Bitcoin around the globe with a click of your finger, while traditional ways have many limitations. As the supply of Bitcoin is fixed (21 Million), it can not be mined above this number; on the other hand, dollars can be printed whenever the government likes, and we have seen this during COVID and post-pandemic and could influence currency devaluation and inflation. Return on investment is much higher in bitcoin investment compared to other investment options. It can also be used as a storage of value at the time of emergencies. The only limitation of Bitcoin investment, in my opinion, is the volatility and regulatory concerns. I think it is better to diversify your investment portfolio and not put all your investment into a single asset. You should invest in real estate, stocks, and business, along with Bitcoin investment.",

With bitcoin as an investment you donât need to have a huge amount before going into it like other investments. When you invest in them you still have privacy and not like other investments that at least a middle man must be involved. All this are its benefits but I will tell you that using only bitcoin as investment tool and not diversifying you portfolio is bad. This portfolio do not mean Altcoins but investments like real estate and precious stone. With precious stone been too scarce to buy then real estate is the ideal portfolio diversifier after bitcoin. The real estate investment appreciates if you invest in the right places. The news you posted still lack some information because I am very sure that government must have made an announcement if that place was at a wrong place and would have actually compensated them long enough before that destruction. But many people turn deaf ears after collecting the compensation most especially if they finds out that the government has changed hands they will feel the new government wouldnât do anything and they proceed to spending the money and living there life till the day when they ask for evacuations.. that estate destroyed must have been payed for before that act occured",
