  "content": "Fennec is a YescryptR16 mineable cryptocurrency that will be launching November 21st, 2022. This means that it will be CPU/GPU mineable.Fennec has many updates on our Telegram and Discord chats, but Telegram is by far the most active. Our specs can be found on Telegram by typing \"/specs\" in the main chat, or by seeing our previous posts on www.BitcoinTalk.orgTelegram: www.t.me/FennecPortal (If you cannot get through the Captcha bot, please message @FennecOwner and you will be provided with the private invite link. We are trying to avoid providing the private invite link to too many people, to avoid an influx of bots.)Discord: https://discord.com/invite/97xvrQPchnLinkTree: www.LinkTr.ee/FennecBlockchainWe are predominantly a community build from Telegram networks and 4chan. Our Telegram networks predominantly include people who play on smaller tokens within the Ethereum Smart Contract Token ecosystem. However, it should be noted that Fennec is indeed a coin, not a token. This fact makes Fennec stand out to these Telegram communities, because it is a fairly new concept to them as far as an investment vehicle.As a result of having our roots on Telegram, we have many ETH Smart Contract Token callers shouting out our project, to potentially bring in new miners and investors. Our Telegram group has approximately 380 members, and is about 3-4 weeks old. We have been anticipating our launch for some time now, and considering the fact that it is 11 days away (at the time of writing this), our community is very excited! Many of our community members simply observe the chat, and are waiting on the sidelines until our Peer to Peer sales event.We are having a Peer to Peer sales event to fund exchange listings and marketing for Fennec, more information will be on our website. We are assuming that www.FennecBlockchain.com will be live by November 14th-November 15th. Our QT Core wallet will be available for download on our launch day, November 21st, 2022. Anyone uninterested in the Peer to Peer sales event is free to mine Fennec at launch, and simply accumulate coins by this method. Our specs can be found on our website in several days, and are currently available on our Telegram and Discord groups.We also have plans to release FenneChan, an imageboard that will be a platform for crypto and business news. All self-serve advertisement adspend will be payable in FNNC, providing Fennec with it's first use case. We are also considering the creation of a merch site, showcasing Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, as well as Fennec merch, all merch will be purchased in FNNC, not USD. We are also considering the creation of a small exchange where FNNC will be the native coin of the exchange, as well as BTC and USDT.Please feel free to shoot @FennecOwner a direct message on Telegram with any questions, comments, or concerns about the project.Thank you for your time, and thank you for considering Fennec.",
