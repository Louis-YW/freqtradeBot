Ordinarily,  you can't make a perfect decision on your own and stand by it; you will literally do anything that someone tells you without even thinking about the outcome. So getting yourself involved in Bitcoin trading with such a mindset might make you incur losses that you might not be aware of, and you will not know what market analysis you will have to follow in order to make the right trading decision.And holding Bitcoin for a long time requires courage. If you happen to be holding Bitcoin that you have decided to hold for a long period of time, that could be possible for you if you avoid hearing what others have to say or the opinions that they have to share about holding. Today some might tell you to sell and take back your money because it's not safe for you to be holding Bitcoin, and the next day another person will come up with another suggestion, and all of that, in the end, will cost you a waste of money instead of you making a profit.So if I'm to advise you, I will say you should first work on yourself. You need to take away fear from your mind in order to be able to overcome some fuzz that could result in panic selling. If you can control your fear and be your own decision-maker, then I guess you will be ready to learn other things that will make your trading life easier.",

It's like going to war without prior preparation and training you're fated to lose and same implies in bitcoin trading, that's why it's advised to first get a thorough knowledge about it before going into trading as your knowledge about trading would embolden and build you to be strategic and avoid/reduce supposed loses that you would have made being a lily-livered.And also making use of Indicators like RSI and MACD could be helpful to you in the market if you could frame yourself around one or more with which you make your technical analysis giving you a direction about market trends. If you jump into bitcoin trading as a whimp you would end up running series of losses that may blow your account to zero.",

So i ask, is bitcoin trading advisable for the lily-livered?To engage in Bitcoin trading you are expected to get some foundational knowledge about the field. You should be conversant with fundamental and technical analysis. It is a risky sector to venture in because the price of bitcoin is unpredictable so you can gain sometimes and other trades might not be favorable. There are risks attached to all businesses in the world but trading risk is higher and the profits are also good and fast. You need to be brave to venture into such a sector. You should be prepared for the worst. It will also be to your advantage if you won't put all your money into Bitcoin trading. You should invest the sum so that even if you lose all, you would still live a comfortable life. Don't also borrow or sell a valuable asset to invest because bitcoin trading is risky. If you are not a good risk taker, trading might not be your calling.",

Do you really think that the experts are wasting their time on YouTube instead of making money or they just looking for some contents so their videos will get more views.First of all don't believe in everything they tell and no one is really 100% successful in trading cause the nature of it is highly volatile makes it unpredictable that is why still people are interested in playing with the volatility. Trading is not suitable for someone who doesn't have multiple income sources.",

So i ask, is bitcoin trading advisable for the lily-livered?Imo to be a successful crypto trader, you need to have the skill set and a certain temperament to do the job. This isn’t something you are born with, anyone can learn to develop a strong mindset. Trading is a psychological exercise and your emotions can cost you money. It’s not enough to have one without the other, you can have a good knowledge about trading and still lose trades because you’re not confident in your trading plan, and you can also have a strong mindset and lose trades because you do not understand the trading patterns.",

You can take advantage of the money you used to spend on tobacco, to now buy Bitcoin. If you lose, it's like you spent on tobacco, if you win, you'll be all happy!",

Everything that have high risks are actually not advisable for those who easily faint because they lack the courage and determination for it.

That way, they will be more motivated to learn and adjust to the market as well so they can be more suitable in trading.",

If yes, you can try something. If not, it is better not to invest.I agree because we invest to make our life easier, not harder. So if we lose our capital with one investment, we should not become homeless. To avoid being homeless after one failed investment, we should never invest all capital we have.The most important rules of investingQuoteThe Challenges of the Investment RuleIf you remember the \"Never invest money that you can't afford to lose\" rule and never violate it, you shouldn't have to worry about running out of funds during retirement. You'll have the funds to handle something potentially catastrophic that occurs, like job loss or illness. The key is to build up your savings before you start to invest. You shouldn't invest money that you need to meet other responsibilities.There's a natural human tendency to want to overreach, put in more money than you can afford, and go for a huge payout.This trait tends to become magnified in the face of losses. This is referred to as the \"sunk cost fallacy\"—the belief that you've invested too much to walk away. Rather than selling in the face of losses, someone might hold on to a stock that's underperforming or, worse, buy more.",

If you proceed with Bitcoin trading even if you know that you are emotional and weak, could easily be swayed from objectivity, has very low risk-tolerance, easily panics, and so on, you will lose. But if you've gone through losses, it would either be that you learn lessons, get better, and toughen up or you will continue to lose until you will finally be discouraged enough that you call it quits. But, is there any other way to become a good trader? You will probably start fearful and weak; that's normal. But surely you can minimize the risks by doing some research. Also, after studying, by the time you do actual trading, you will start small, of course. You could even start with demo trading.
