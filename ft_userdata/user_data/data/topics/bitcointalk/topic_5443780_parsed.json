But campaign manager may not know that this service section is not for managing campaign with Token/USDT/BUSD. But if you run a campaign with tokens, you must put it in the bounty section. I hope the manager understands.",

Token will be distributed to Bsc networkPlease move your topic to Altcoins Bounty section Manager should move the thread to bounty section, Since the payment on tokens. From what I understand is just for the OP to update his payment rate for each Rank, which he has already done it. And I also believe the payment is for bitcoin since he mentioned [BSC address:] on the application format. BSC is bitcoin address. Op is new to the forum so instead of telling him to move the campaign to Bounty why can you ask him which campaign it is, then you tell what next. I hope he is also learning.",

Goodluck.A token payments campaigns like this are supposed to post on an altcoin bounty thread, not on the service board thread. The OP has to be aware of that than asking for a chance to join. Engage as a member rank so that you can have the opportunity to participate in the campaign right? If you are looking for campaigns to promote as a member rank, go through the altcoin bounty thread to find yourself one to partake(promote) in. For your notice, not all altcoin bounties you promoted will pay you well as a member rank due to the number of participants involved in the campaign. Do yourself good by focusing on building your account to a higher rank of full member and above. That's when you will have the joy of promoting bounty campaigns.",
