  "content": "I just observed a kid on Twitter doing a Bitcoin payment transaction at McDonald's, and it's amusing to see that they can do it. However, I feel bad for the kid because he spent something like 170,000 Sats or something. Its parent must have a sizable amount of Bitcoin.But even so, I'm still in awe of how these kids were raised by their parents since even at such a young age, they are progressively learning about the idea and features of how important Bitcoin is to them. I respect parents who do an excellent job of educating their kids.Reference: https://twitter.com/naiivememe/status/1705167273609368057",

Either way, new generation kids are so modern that, at an early age they are aware of the full usage of smart phones, while when I was a kid, like around 10 to 14 years old, no one gave me smart phones to use, I mean I don't have the privilege to have my own phone so I have to ask elders to use their phones and all they did was, not gave us their phones even for a second, by saying that we might break their phones. If I recall those memories now and compare them with the current generation then I concluded that this generation is so advance that they knew how to use phones. They knew how to make online transaction via banks. They are now getting familiar with the btc technology. That's not a surprise to see but using btc to pay for products is very surprising. Even though their parents or guardians were helping them, but still, they are learning at an early age and with time they will become experts.",

Bitcoin is too valuable to be spent on junks. The sats are better saved than spent on things that are not as valuable or profitable.If you must spend your bitcoins spend them on things that compensate for the profits the bitcoins would have given you in the future. If you wish to spend them on foods, spend on the good ones that can make you productive enough to work sufficiently to produce things that are greater or equal to the amount of profit you would made from saving the coins. If you wish to invest the bitcoins on something else make sure the future profit from the investment is equal or greater than future profit from the bitcoins. And it's much better to spend the bitcoins in Bitcoin economy, or better still, in economy (decentralized one atleast) that uses Bitcoin as currency.",

Buying something and paying with bitcoin is really a good idea as it shows that the currency is being put into good use, but when the one who have their hand on it don’t know how to careful use it, it might be some sort of asset abuse.",

Probably the tweet is not more visible because I also tried to view it, but it was not viewable. From all the indications, these children's parents are into bitcoin, and they may have some bitcoin in their wallets. They have guided these children in the right way to be independent of banks and governments; they will grow up with financial freedom; they will grow up as bitcoin experts if their parents teach them about bitcoin well; and I am sure they will have a bitcoin wallet set aside for these kids as their future investment.",

As the link from Twitter is not working and nowhere to find the real thing, I am a bit disappointed. But with all the videos and articles I saw upon searching, it seems like this event took place in El Salvador or Switzerland. Most of the McD in those counties are accepting BTC. But everything aside, the new generation is really getting into the technological stuff quickly. And this gives us a great learning point. We are the ones to guide the next generation towards the future. As the parents are helping their children to understand the concept and teaching them how it works is good to see. I hope every parent at some point teaches their children about Bitcoin.",

Why some great event like this always has confusing records? So we have a kid who’s paying with bitcoin wallet at billion dollar food chain store and the news comes with a tweet that is too not available anymore. What a dull stuff man.
