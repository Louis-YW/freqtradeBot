      "body": "Some coincidences.1- In 1978 and 1986, Argentina played the final against a country that had been a finalist in the previous edition.üá≥üá±Holland was in 1974 and üá©üá™Germany in 1982 and now France was in 2018.2- In 1986, the referee was üáßüá∑ Romualdo Arppi Filho, born on January 7, 1939.üáµüá± Szymon Marciniak, referee of Sunday's final, was born on January 7, 1981.3- In 1986, there were several results that are repeated in this world cup.üá®üá¶ Canada participating.üá≤üá¶ Morocco passing the group stage in group F and beating Portugal (3-1 in 1986 and 1-0 in 2022).üáßüá∑ Brazil being left out in 4th due to penalties.4- One related to PSG. Ronaldinho joined in 2001 and was champion the following year. Mbapp√© joined in 2017 and was champion the following year.Messi joined in 2021...5- In 1978 and 1986, Argentina played the final with its starting jersey. This was not repeated in any of the other three finals played by our country. And in 2022 Argentina use the starting jersey, so its 3/3.6- Only in 1978 and 1986, the goalkeeper of the opposing team wore a yellow shirt.Lloris will use the same color.7- In 1986, Argentina reached the final 8 years after reaching their last final.In 2022, Argentina reaches the final 8 years after the last final played.8- Only one World Cup had been played in Qatar, the under 20s in 1995. Argentina lost 1 game in the group stage (0-1 vs. Portugal) and won the final against Brazil, the defending champion.In 2022, Argentina loses a match in the group stage and plays the final against the defending champion.9- Gualeguay (alittle city of Argentina) is also part of a coincidence.It was the only city from Entre Rios represented in both 1986 (Burruchaga) and 2022 (Lisandro Mart√≠nez).10- The last time a Cordovan wore the number 9 of the Argentine national team was Cuciuffo, in 1986.Now, it is also used by one born in C√≥rdoba, Juli√°n √Ålvarez.11- Maradona left Barcelona in 1984, to play in the league of the country that had been world champion (Italy).Messi left Barcelona in 2021, to play in the French league (last world champion). 12- Belgrano (an Argentinian team) came out twice champion of the Argentine promotion to first division.In 1986 and in 2022.Well we have some more but this are very well recopilated by this guy, all credit to him. Its in spanish and i traslate and add some hints to make the post more clearfullhttps://twitter.com/Tomiconcina1/status/1603575924582031360If some of you like this kind of post let me know and i can bring more.",

Harapan answer perfectly for me. But im gonna add some more, maybe you are not so envolved in sportbetting but a lot , of bettors make bets only for this kind of historical things. Its weird i know but its the reality.And also a lot of gambling threads here are most talk about the sports or whatever around the gambling itself.",

There were so many hidden signals indicating Argentina was the chosen one for the victory. It all mean the perfect alignment of the stars to give Messi the title he was waiting since the beginning of his career. By reading all those points I guess the result couldn't be different.If someone points out decent coincidences like this for a next tournament, I'm going to place some bets based on it. At least, it seems more accurate than the traditional analyzes that lead many gamblers to losses this World Cup.Quote from: harapan on December 23, 2022, 06:11:21 PMQuote from: RapTarX on December 23, 2022, 05:52:09 PMHow this is related to gambling discussion?So where should the topic be?
