The followers of the hacked Vitalik account have lost vast amounts of money and dozens of expensive NFTs like the CryptoPunk NFT collection. Sad about these immense losses for the victims, but this is a harsh lesson we learn from it that no one should open any malicious link on account of any famous and influential person if he finds a tweet for Giveaway or a mint of Free NFTs while seeing the comments button closed, also accounts like @ZachXBT on X platform who is a Blockchain investigator and those who constantly uncover scams and scammers' activities are the first to be followed up by us to remain vigilant in the event of any mysterious incidents.SOURCE: https://twitter.com/zachxbt",

That's why it's no surprise to me that for how long the link was open, they were able to steal 700k USD already. It just saddens me that Twitter/X as a platform is no longer a safe space because everyone's trying to scam someone there, it's not worth to sift through the muck that we call a social platform, hopefully Vitalik's image won't be damaged as much because as much as we know that it's not his fault since his account got hacked, there's definitely a goofbrain out there that got scammed that will definitely blame Vitalik.",

This is not new again. I mean it is not new again that Twitter account of people like Vitalik Buterin are hacked. It occur almost all the time. I will not blame Twitter because people can use 2FA like Aegis with their Twitter account. Another option is the use of security key. If these can be on Twitter to secure your account and people like Ethereum founder and other crypto well known people continue to remain careless for hackers to scam people using their account, I too will say they do not care about their followers.",

I guess the only difference is that hackers don't find us interesting.When people become big they don't have time to maintain their social network. They hire people to manage those networks and they get paid a lot of money for doing it. So when a celebrity or a person with huge influence get their account hacked, it does not make me surprise. On the other hand, you, me, and others who have enough time for us keep our things [if we are in social media] in our hand. If this is important to us then we use every security measures available like 2FA and things.I do not think a social media account for VITALIK and other high end influencers have any importance.

That is to say, we have not heard of any famous person’s data being leaked or even a report of the loss of currencies, so the matter is a little confusing as it is either a lack of interest on their part or a problem with all social media applications.",

So yeah, Social media people like on twitter are the worst that’s why scammer are feeding on their money.",

I suppose there is a difference between hacking to steal funds and hacking to steal private messages with intent to blackmail.Hackers that target X seem to show no interest in accessing DMs which could be a lucrative business for them. If the hack is server based and not related to a password being used, that could explain part of the issue but it is surprising.

The dead influencer? The phone company that did what it has done for years as per their contract? The social media website that will have from now on to phone every user every day to see if they are still alive and ask every user if they are still the ones in control of their account?",

The reason for the hack is unknown or if Vitalik will compensate with the victim.One thing is for sure that “twitter security is not designed as financial platform” according to CZ so we people out there should always use common sense as CZ advice to the public.",
