  "content": "I saw this post made by Trading View that Wrapped BTC(WBTC) has been depegged to bitcoin for 14 straight days. To those that are into WBTC, you may take this chart as a potential warning.https://www.facebook.com/tradingview/photos/a.802024629816535/5993085974043682/And after looking at this chart, I've compared from a few sources, cmc and coingecko for its price. So for those who don't know it yet, wrapped bitcoin is like USDT that's tied and pegged to dollars while wrapped bitcoin is tied and pegged to bitcoin's price. But look at the difference of WBTC which should be pegged to bitcoin's price. I know that there's a difference for different source of market prices. And with these two sources, coinmarketcap and coingecko, looking at both wbtc and btc that proves that it's not tied or pegged to btc's price anymore.[Two images at top from coinmarketcap.com][Two images at the bottom from coingecko.com]With the bear market and things happening to exchanges and projects, it's possible that this (WBTC) could be the next to bite the dust.

Usually, projects that are smart contracts and is just sitting on another chain can easily be manipulated by whoever has made it. It took a long time before this has been depegged and just like the crash of UST, this could be continuous.I'm not wishing ill those that are holding wbtc but it's not the real bitcoin. They better buy the actual bitcoin and hold it as is and not with a smart contract that could be badly dumped by whoever has made it. I just looked at the pricing again and its still around value and price of its DE pegging.Quote from: Dave1 on November 25, 2022, 07:59:52 PMThanks for this link, in any case though, if this is true then the effect from those investors or those who think that everything could be pegged on USD or BTC might be wrong.

Bringing it back to 1:1 can be done by its community naturally but if it's the opposite that's being done by major holders of it, then we might not see it again par to bitcoin's price.",

The trend of peg token has started when bitcoin has not yet got any improvement to fix the scalability problem and yeah people were looking an alternative way to send bitcoin with cheap fees and some solutions to create a wrapped tokens were coming in the past but since bitcoin has gone some improvements like LN and then people might not have any reason to keep use wrapped token anymore. They should go to the real BTC instead of fake BTC that claimed backed by real bitcoin. They were buying it on their own risk. They might never learn until another big incident to happen with it.",

It's not that they are smart, probably it's the greed that taking over most of our traders in today's era. Although we can argue that the market is still fairly young, but I do think that traders that started in 2017 might be very different to traders that recently get into the picture, lets says 2021. So it's hard to compare them as the mindset might be very different already.As for the de-pegged, if it will continue then for sure going to be very bad for us.But if this is just for a short period and then they start to pour again to hit 1:1 then good.

Yeah, those are essentials for having wbtc to do things but what I'm trying to say if someone is keeping this just as how we keep bitcoin.

Self custody with native wallets should be the starting point for everyone who enters the crypto scene. However not everyone is that tech-savvy. Many of them struggle even with CEX, but people holding wrapped tokens are important part of crypto growth as they create liquidity in DeFi. Even if you wouldn't like the \"IOU\" like fundamentals of it, cross-chain liquidity is essential if we are looking any kind of adoption for DeFi",

There is exactly a 1:1 ratio of wbtc and BTC. What happened was basically it took longer than usually to mint and redeem tokens and it was a little over 24 hours and panic started. Fud started with the coins linked to alamada and people started to dump wbtc at a loss. Now that the minting is back on, the ratio is pretty much back to normal.",
