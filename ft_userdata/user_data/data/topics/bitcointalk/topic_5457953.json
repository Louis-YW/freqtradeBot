I was wondering if we lost track of btc on chain when we sent them to a lightning wallet. Electrum Lightning Network walkthroughBasics of the Lightning NetworkThe Lightning Network FAQYou can not use Lightning Network for mixing your bitcoin because there are two on-chain transactions needed. Opening your Lightning Network channel and Closing your Lightning network channel. Those transactions can link your bitcoin and no mixing can be exploited.If you do all steps by yourself (you will do because you care about privacy), opening a channel, making transactions on Lightning Network, closing your channel, you can not hide your coin inputs and outputs.If you use Lightning Network on a third party service, I am not sure you will have privacy with them. They can store your account and transaction logs which can be leaked.",

      "body": "If the Lightning Network is set up correctly and overlaps, it could act as a central mixer that users contribute to, or as a second layer protocol that works like coinjoin, but still, in my opinion, the quickest solution to mixing is what the chipmixer did by splitting the bitcoins into fixed inputs and giving the users a private key with an unknown time difference between the input and withdrawal addresses, this requires the mixer to contain a good amount of bitcoin, which I do not know why other mixers do not provide it.",

They can store your account and transaction logs which can be leaked.Yes, but in the eyes of an outside observer it would work as a casino, no? I mean that many casinos have an anti-mixing policy with wagering requirements, because if there are no wagering requirements, I deposit now in a casino and make a withdrawal within an hour and the track of my Bitcoin is lost to the eyes of an outside observer, although obviously before the casino I have no privacy. It is not as good as a mixer but it can be used to make people lose track of you in some cases.",

They also have a mining campaign that would stop after 10,000 deposits, this obviously they want to get a lot Bitcoin and increase the privacy level of their service.Quote from: Poker Player on June 29, 2023, 04:14:01 AMIt is not as good as a mixer but it can be used to make people lose track of you in some cases. Yeah, as long as you didn't withdraw all of your deposited money in once.",

This is not exactly the same thing as using a mixer or coinjoin, but it does provide some privacy if you use different address to convert LN coins back to main chain.There are some wallets (like mercurywallet.com) that work on bitcoin layer-2 with state chains, they are much better for privacy and I think they are working on integrating Lightning Network.So best combination would be to use Mercury wallet together with Lightning Network if you want to have something very similar with a mixer.PSNote that you will have to pay transactions fees each time your are going on-chain and off-chain, and you will have to pay some fees to Mercury wallet.Doing this for small amount of coins when mempool is full, is not really a good idea.",
