      "body": "I noticed that some opcodes get disabled.https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#OpcodesBitcoin uses a scripting system for transactions. Similar to Forth, Script is simple, stack-based, and processed from left to right. It is intentionally not Turing-complete, with no loops.Bitcoin uses an append-only ledger to record transactions. Once a transaction is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is to prevent double-spending and fraud.In accounting, this principle is known as the historical cost principle. It states that you should not change the original transactional value of an economic item reported in financial statements. Instead, if a mistake is made, it is corrected with a new entry, ensuring the integrity of the financial records. It’s like in bookkeeping - there is no erasing. You can’t go back and delete entries in an accounting book. It’s a move-forward-only system.P.S. I really don’t like the idea of Turing completeness. For an accounting system, loops are totally unnecessary.",

I agree with fight for freedom and against censorship because it is core value of Bitcoin and vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. We don't live our life with Satoshi Nakamoto's vision but if it is good practically, it can be continued. In contrast, if the vision is no longer good practically, something must be done to fix exploited holes.",

And few days ago people were praising Taproot and some are not as OP is not praising Taproot. Everything comes with some pros and with some cons as well. But I think the pros are more than cons, although due to money making minds of people, the usecase of taproot's first protocol of 340 is less while the usage of protocol of BIP-341 and BIP-342 is more. But still, I think certain limitation are needed to minimize the tx fee otherwise, things will gets a little difficult for the adoption of BTC.",

Opcodes enable the execution of specific operations within a Bitcoin transaction. When new opcode subsets are released, it can modify the rules of Bitcoin by allowing for different data sizes and validation processes.The introduction of new opcodes can increase the data capacity of a transaction, allowing for the inclusion of additional information that may not be directly related to the intended purpose of the transaction. While some Bitcoin nodes may not validate or analyze the content of such added data, it still becomes a part of the transaction.yes, past tenseactually no.. let me clarifyopcodes used to only be activated when they were needed for new features by actually including conditions, limitations and expectation to give nodes something to validate and reject if they didnt meet those conditions.. however activated opcodes with no conditions is the problem.. as there is no size limit or validation formatting requirement of unconditioned opcodes.. and there lays the exploit/problemthere was a subset of opcodes made during segwit activation season where a few dozen extra opcodes were made active but without conditions setand then when taproot activation occured, now there are hundreds of opcodes that are active without conditionsthese opcodes should not have been active by default(hindesights a b!tch). but instead should have periodically activated when new features were needed/(after proposed, reviewed,scrutinised), where conditions would have been set and the network of nodes would then upgrade to be network ready to validate such conditions and then the feature can be activated knowing the network is ready to validate a new featuresbut the softening of consensus (which WAS a concept of network readiness majority before activation), has caused the controversy.now there are many opcodes that nodes dont have conditions to validate, so just pass and let into the blockchain. unchecked. and people are exploiting that consensus softening of not needing node readiness for new featureswhats needed now is to clean up the cludgy code.. and refine the code to actually want to know whats being added to the blockchain by requiring new features to be proposed where a myriad of node brands collectively use consensus to be network ready of new features before feature activation(before trojan gets passed the gatekeepers) whereby the new features have conditions of validity to be checked. where every byte is explained by its purpose and every byte is counted and has reason for being. its called network securityits called data efficiencywhere we get back to offering feature of actual utility and leanness of real functionality and validity checking",
