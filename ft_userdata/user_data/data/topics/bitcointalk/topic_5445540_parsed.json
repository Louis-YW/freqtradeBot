So always utilize your spare time over here than quitting your job. Besides there's nothing to wary about merits, you are still new here and there are still time for you to learn and study the forum.

And I don't think Bitcointalk is the best option for generating your regular income other than having a regular job and salary from a company, and this forum is more suitable as an extra or side income because income is not always there.It's best to think and reconsider before you make a decision and do research on this forum as a whole because you can still do both if you can find one that suits you and without compromise too, because having a steady job is very important, because it's your steady income that won't go away.",

Op, on a more serious note, even if you manage to gain the 1000 merits needed for the legendary rank you still have to wait up to a year or two before you can attain the required activity another thing you should take note of is f there's no guarantee that this forum signature is going to last forever, and you depending solely on this forum as your source of living is a very risky thing too. You should keep your job and create some time for you to learn a new digital skill, that way you can open a service thread here and also sign up on some other freelancing websites and get paid for your skills.",

QuoteMy Job pays less that $300 a Month. I am in a serious dilemma.I need some motivating advice on what to do.Don't leave your job yet if it is a stable job that pays you continuously just allocate an hour or 2, that amount of time is enough to post constructively, but do it out of passion and don't force a living out of it, when you reach a level that you are qualified to a signature campaign that's the time to think if it is worth leaving your current job.",

First of all, it will take you quite some time to actually achieve the rank needed to earn that kind of money (read 1+ year). 2nd, you never know what future brings and signature campaigns might be completele reomoved, or traffic on this forum might drop so much that it won't be interesting to advertisers anymore. What I would suggest you to do is to edcuate yourself, learn new skills that will open you to a possibility of a better job, while being active on this forum so maybe one day you can earn some extra money from it.",

By then the campaigns may pay less or have disappeared as the colleague who commented above said. Even if your job sucks, I think the question to ask yourself would be, do you have a couple of years of salary saved up so you can survive without working by focusing on the forum? It looks like you don't, otherwise you wouldn't be in a shitty job for $300 a month.You see our opinion is unanimous.",

(This is running through my mind) You can look for another job that would not be as demanding as your current job, and if you are successful in finding it, then you can quit your current job for it, this will give you more time to yourself to enjoy life with family and your friends. If you are working for almost 24 hours a day, soon you will break down physically and mentally and all your work would be for nothing. What i just said has nothing to do with quitting your job to write more often on this forum.Now if you get a job that is less demanding, you can now learn skills, build a business, or have enough time to learn about BTC and discuss with other members in this forum, so you may rank up and earn from the forum, while still working. But if you want to quit your current job because you feel you can earn more on this forum, then ask yourself these:1)Are you sure you have the knowledge to ever rank up high here.2)Are you sure that if you spend years ranking up, you would be able to join a campaign that will last for a very long time.3)Are you sure your account would not be hacked someday and it takes you a very long time to recover it.4)Are you sure campaign earnings will be sufficient for you if you truly rank up someday.The answers to these questions will help you to decide on what you should do!",

Not the forum nor your job. Take some time to rest your head and stop thinking of multiple things at once. Many people have lost it all by working all day, even those who made plenty of money ended up being fed up from doing such work. I think you should spend few time with family and discuss often with friends. When your head calms down and you think you can do other things then join the forum. I do believe that they must be some free time for every busy person. So, use those time and focus on your health, because writing is not easy and it's the backbone of this forum; consistent quality write-up. In such situations as yours quiting the job won't solve the problem, everyone already told you how far it take before you make a dime here. Don't take a risk you can't withstand, find a way to look for jobs elsewhere, once you land a new job, you can move away from the time exhausting work safely.",
