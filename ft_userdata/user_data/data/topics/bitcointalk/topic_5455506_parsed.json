      "body": "The commissions in the Tron network have become very high in the last 8 months. To reduce commissions or even remove them altogether, you need to buy a number of tron and put them in the staking. For this you will get energy and bandwidth. And if you have enough energy and bandwidth, then transaction fees can be removed altogether.",

I'm using Binance exchange to transfer my Tether USDT in tron network here only 1$ USDT need to transfer it’s seems very low transaction fee i think.",
