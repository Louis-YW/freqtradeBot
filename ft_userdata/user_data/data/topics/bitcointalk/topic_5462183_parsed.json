Totally agree that we shouldn't be worry, and if I'm being honest, I think that it's a good time right now to spend your fiat to buy cryptocurrency since most cryptocurrency are on the red meaning that they're somewhat selling at a discounted price.",

There’s an article regarding this on coindesk https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/03/crypto-markets-today-btc-eth-ada-sol-matic-price-analysis/ which is a good analysis on what happened. Bitcoin failed to create a rally during the opening week of the month instead it go sideways. Those who purchase on the price dip before the end of the month probably sold now due to no movement at all.We are just always noticing the red but failed to notice the greens which are thise people that hoping that market to pump more after they purchased.",

It is clear that a lot of negative news makes the price no longer rise above $30K.You mentioned altcoins above I didn't pay much attention to it because I haven't been an altcoin holder since more than 1 year now more focused on bitcoin as the only investment in crypto, no offense because I also believe there will be a higher potential increase from the altcoins mentioned but I am not a holder.",

I think we have been trading extremely in a tight range and when we get some type of breakdown as this, we think something negative happened and was a result of some bad news. If you take XRP for example, this drop is only around 5% from the current price. For an alt coin that is nothing. When there is something bad, usually alts drop -20% in a single day. Probably one more month of this before we get some liquidity and trend in September or October.",

Spent day by day with red day and August have been several days but not bring light for the market back to higher price. Its depend with Bitcoin stuck under $29,000 and difficult for all altcoins going up to higher price.Must be patience for one or two months later with pass red day until get chance bitcoin wake up to higher price. Long term holding when seeing altcoin not good progress up to higher price, spent time with another activities until coming back when bitcoin and altcoins back to the top price.",

But since there is no %100 clear evidence of what the reason was I would definitely suggest realizing that we are not going to end up with anything that clear that quickly. Its going to be something that focuses on whatever happens happens mode, this is how crypto is. I get that we are at a stage where we can make a big difference, so we should definitely consider the current situation as usual and do not look for a reason, its just not that big of a deal anymore and doesn't need a reason.",

And this small drop or dip in price is actually normal because not all the time we expect the price to be favourable atleast that why it's even called a market.",

I do agree that its something not big to worry about. Normally when bitcoin is stable on some value then we saw such fluctuation in values of Alts.Its time to sit back, relax and hold your nerves.

Normally people start selling there coins when they see market going in down word direction. It is something day traders have always considered a good strategy to know when to stop losing; seeing the market go down unexpectedly makes them take some hard decisions, considering they never planned to hold their coins for a long period of time but just to trade and make profit. Panic selling always results in some losses, which they considered better than losing all.But in whatever market condition we find ourselves in, there are always those who take advantage of it, as it creates the right opportunity for them to enter the market at their expected time, which anyone with spare funds should consider doing, but should make a better choice as not all altcoins always survive after a mass drop, which I don't see happening anytime soon.",

These are a form of saturated currency series operations. In my case earlier most of the times when I went to invest the market would go down. And the reason behind this is because my fundamental and basic knowledge was less then. I think it is better not to go into trading or short term trading without acquiring some technical knowledge and fundamental knowledge or the ability to read candlesticks on charts. In this case, you can continue investing by managing a DCA for the long term.",

It is normal in this industry that we attribute every drop and rise to something. But this time around, continuing to mention SEC doesn't make much sense to me. I think the SEC influence is no longer huge in the present market.As you do not care, so also do I also not care.
