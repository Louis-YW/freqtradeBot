Crypto exchanges kept failing from the early days (e.g. Mt.Gox) so only a fool would trust centralized platforms. Some people still leave their coins on exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, or even exchanges that do not require KYC because they believe those exchanges have a reputation and will be around forever, not realizing that those exchanges also encourage hackers to hack, just like others they believe do not have a reputation.With all of the headlines regarding CEX hacks, why are some users still keeping their coins in their possession? That is the question I am always asking. I understand that CEX has the most advanced trading features, however they cannot be trusted with our funds.QuoteTweet is back as it can be seen in my previous post, including that part about compensation.I saw the tweet now, and I am impressed with the way they address the issue, and they assured people that their funds are safe and not tempered with.

The precise amount of the loss is still being determined, and the affected fund is just a very small portion of CoinEx’s total asset.I hope this is true, though they have assured that the business will continue to run as the amount stolen is just a small portion. Personally, I'm a bit worried because $18 million+ stolen, in my opinion, is significant, especially considering that this exchange has only a daily trading volume of just over $28 million according to CMC.https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinex/",

Further investigation might still change this number higher.Even in their statement you can feel a lot of pressure. That's obvious, especially when they say that \"We assure all users: your assets are secure and untouched.\" followed with \"Affected parties will receive 100% compensation for any loss due to this breach.\" LOL!  Their token has also suffered a double-digit decrease in value.

What's interesting though is that just a few months ago they allegedly had $182 million in their reserve and now it fell down to barely over $20 million. https://web.archive.org/web/20230620035753/https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/coinex/",
