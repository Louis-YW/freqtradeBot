You can compare the coin pairs individually. What you do is to view more than 1 chart, like up to 4 at once on some exchanges  which you can use to be viewing the price of 2 or more coins at a time. As for my preference, I prefer 1 chart. And this is used by traders instead of investors. Viewing chart is easier for holders. Do not make things complicated for yourself.",

Why would you compare Bitcoin with other altcoins when you can invest mainly in Bitcoin to secure your investment since the current market trend is determined by the price momentum Bitcoin displays in the market?",
