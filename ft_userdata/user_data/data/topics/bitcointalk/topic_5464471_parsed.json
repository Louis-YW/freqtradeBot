  "content": "Hey my country people, I see this in my email today and I say make drop am here make everyone see am so make everyone know sae something like that dey Happened for there, today I come received one email and im come tok sae Ramitano e dey under maintenance so those people wey dey use ¬†am e no go fit deposit and withdraw bitcoin so with that your coins go fit frozen for di main time but dem go later unfreeze the coins for you.And you can only withdraw from Binance Smart Chain and that is the alternative given to those who want to withdraw from Remitano now. So all those people who want to deposit BTC to Remitano now should suspend their plans now because you fit enter gbege like this in the site. See weti dem tok in the below üëá.So for now make una suspend all transactions in Ramitano to avoid wahala. And be like say na the first time wey I dey experience this matter for Remitano be this. Since when I used am I never experienced this kind this. And one thing we have to know be sae, \"No be you key, no be your Coins\". Remitano na centralized exchange platform, so weti I go advise be say, if you have coins there use the alternative mean to transfer your coin in sharp and relax your mind before you come here di tori wey e no go sweet for belle. Nai I saw make I come yan una for this one here.Please if person don dropped this kind tok for here in di local board wey I no know, please call my attention so I go shapally, lock dis one and make comments in the other thread. ‚úåÔ∏è",

The last time I used it few years ago, it was supporting just few coins and there was nothing like margin trading and derivative market.I expect people to just use it to exchange to naira and nothing more. It is good to get an address directly from the exchange (or wallet) anytime you want to receive coins and which should be from receive or deposit page directly.@Mate2237Nice for bringing this up here on Nigeria local board.This is another example of not your key not you coin.",

I have not heard of wallet maintenance from Remitano before,¬† but since it is a centralized exchange where you don't own the keys to the wallet so your coins are not yours to control so to avoid such situations everyone needs to stay away from Remitano for now until when things normalize.",

It is a way of not depending on centralized exchanges to hold your coins for you. Not your key not your coins.Some of the reasons some people can leave some amount on exchanges is because they use the coins in margin trading or to be used for leverage trading in derivative market. Is Remitano having margin and future trading? Trade with the amount you can afford to lose is like keep the amount that you can afford to lose on exchanges.Quote from: Igebotz on August 27, 2023, 11:30:44 PMIt was my fault, but I'm not sure how long the maintenance will last; it's been three days already.Three days already?

I will not be surprised if there is a breaking news that Remitano has been hacked.The site support is already locked, other coins deposit and withdrawal are still open, but my concern is why has this taken this long when the BTC network is not even congested, and why allowed withdrawal and deposit on only the BSC network, and the negative comments on their social platform aren't helping either. This is not good for their reputation, and if they return successful, they will most certainly lose customers, beginning with me.Quote from: Charles-Tim on August 28, 2023, 08:30:45 AMQuote from: Igebotz on August 27, 2023, 11:30:44 PMNot your key, not your coins but we can't do without CEX.
