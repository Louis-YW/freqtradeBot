As for the others who will gonna ride the market of those coins, they already have some plans on how to get out and they will gonna pull out their investment when the time is right. As for us who have no clue about this pump, it's better to stay vigilant and be careful on to put ur money in this kind of market because they might not gonna be the same scenario in the next days to come.",

I have been taking my profit from USTC. I make about almost 6x from my bottom buy. what a good day for any luna scalpers. Im sure this will be dumped again very soon.

It's better to take risks from high reputable coins. give it few months, and we will see if they can sustain this kind of pump. at some point, they will get tired of pumping a coin that has no long-term vision. right now, they need to save face because of the failure of the original terra. they are finding ways on how to gain the trust of their investors again. however, people should not fall from this trap. they need to be cautious on this one. better look for a valuable project with very good use case in the market.",

When a coin pumps then there's always two possible reason.1. Whales pumping it2. Manipulative buying by the team itself.On times like this then this do really create some Fomo effect which do really possibly able to hook up investors just because they dontreally like for themselves to get left behind thats why you should really be careful on taking your self some action just because you've seen a shitty projectdo make out some pump.
