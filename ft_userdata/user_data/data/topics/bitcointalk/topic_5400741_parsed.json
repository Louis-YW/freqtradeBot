A signed message allowing the transfer of a value from the owner of one key to the owner of another one (in the simplest form - more exactly: to the person able to provide a signature matching the public key hash, i.e. address).(I've once made a thought experiment: if Bitcoin was banned globally, one could replace the current payments with \"human-readable\" messages like \"I want to thank the person X.\" or the like, with the public key hash encoded in that message. Would be perfectly possible although obviously we would need to change the tx format for efficiency. Of course that wouldn't impress the regulators much, but it's funny to think about it.)The Bitcoin blockchain obviously wouldn't work if there were only \"non-payment messages\", because there was no value attached, no miner would like to provide security for it. But even if there are only few payments and 90% non-payment messages it wouldn't be a problem, because of simple economics - storing only text messages in the Bitcoin blockchain would be way too expensive in the long term, and they would have to at least compete with miners wanting to sell their coins. So a \"non-payment message spam attack\" would probably not put bitcoin in danger as long as the fee market works (this is obviously an argument against BCH/BSV and other \"big block\" shitcoins, in BSV for example there was a weather app which spammed 96% of the blockchain space).About the original question: BlackHatCoiner's method with OP_RETURN is imo the way to go.",

      "body": "QuoteBitcoin Core may be too?If you use Bitcoin Core, then you can make any transaction. For example, you can send coins to \"OP_DROP <pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG\", then you can spend it by pushing \"<signature> <message>\". And then, you can push bigger things than 80 bytes (as far as I know, up to 520 bytes, but then you can use more tricks to go above that). Also, putting message as a witness is cheaper, because of Segwit.QuoteDo I understand correctly that there is no such possibility on hardware wallets?Technically, it is possible. Practically, it could require writing some software for them. And that's another reason why I avoid hardware wallets: they are too limited for me.Quotehow many characters can approximately contain these 80 bytes?That means 80 English characters. For other languages, it may be less, but probably between 2 and 4 bytes per character. Also, you can use Unicode to put \"<burger><heart><smile><human>\" as emoji, then it could make it shorter, because \"burger\" will take 6 bytes, but some icon would take at most 4 (unless you want to use a combination, for example a \"hand\" with a \"skin tone one\").Quote(I've once made a thought experiment: if Bitcoin was banned globally, one could replace the current payments with \"human-readable\" messages like \"I want to thank the person X.\" or the like, with the public key hash encoded in that message. Would be perfectly possible although obviously we would need to change the tx format for efficiency. Of course that wouldn't impress the regulators much, but it's funny to think about it.)I also thought about that. But then, there is a bigger problem, because you need some way to implement mining. So, I can see two options: hashing each message separately, or implementing a hidden chain. I prefer the second, because then all hashes could be hidden as commitments. Then, the only option to stop that, would require banning all ways of encrypting anything (or pushing any random, non-explained data), which is hard to enforce.",

Some example: 000000000fdf0c619cd8e0d512c7e2c0da5a5808e60f12f1e0d01522d2986a51. In this case, no blockchain is needed, but only miners can send valuable messages, most people can only send CPU-mined messages in this case. It is just a hashcash, you can use that as your antispam filter in e-mails.Quoteimplementing a hidden chainYou can hide all commitments of any arbitrary size in a single signature. Just use your r-value as a Taproot public key of your commitment. It can be very simple: you can just make any Taproot address, by using some random public key, and creating all of your commitments inside your TapScript. Then, you can put your 32 bytes in a signature, and by the act of making it, you can prove that you control the relation between your public key and your signature nonce.Later, it is technically possible to validate your commitment, just by taking r-value from your signature, and checking if some commitment can satisfy that public key. If it can, then your commitment is valid. Also, you can sort commitments in your TapScript tree, by putting all hashes for all leaves in ascending order. If everything is always sorted, then you can create an SPV proof, just to show that some spending path is not a part of your TapScript. Then, in your own network, you can reject unsorted commitments as invalid, in this way you can write conditions that would take two leaves, to prove that no commitment is between them.",

That leaves 40 chars.Arabic and CJK are the worst offenders taking up mostly 2-3 bytes per character. That leaves somewhere between some 30ish characters to encode in there.
