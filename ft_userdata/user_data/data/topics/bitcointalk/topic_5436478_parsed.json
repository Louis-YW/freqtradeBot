  "content": "QuoteThe DA’s office said the victim asked Argueta to claim the prize on his behalf to remain anonymous, promising $50,000 of the prize.Argueta, who lived in Virginia at the time, agreed to claim the prize on the victim’s behalf and drove to New York to receive the winnings.At the time, though, the New York State Gaming Commission was not accepting winning tickets in person, so Argueta mailed the ticket to the commission on Nov. 13, 202, instead.Within weeks, Argueta reportedly went to deliver the NYS Lottery paperwork to her cousin, which said the price winnings totaled $20,000. Along with the paperwork, she handed her cousin an envelope with $13,436 in cash, and said the rest was held for taxes. The victim found a press release from the NYS Lottery website saying Argueta claimed the $1 million prize and received a lump-sum payout of $537,440 after taxes, the DA’s office said.The DA added that the victim called Argueta, who said she did not have any more money and if continued to call her, she would take legal action. In May 2022, Argueta forfeited $317,857.13 in winnings from her bank account, which were returned to the victim.[1] https://nypost.com/2023/01/22/texas-woman-pleads-guilty-to-stealing-cousins-1-million-winning-scratch-off-ticket/The valuable lesson that can be learned from the story above is that if you want to remain anonymous for your lottery winnings, do it yourself, and don't entrust money-related matters to other people (even if that person is someone close to you)if i were am victim, i will not reconcile with that cheating cousin, unless she returns all my winnings that she has used, how about you?",

No matter how closely related you guys might be, if something involves money, that blood connection is at risk of being severed due to greed and lust for money. Luckily, the winner still got more than half of the winnings, because if not then that will be a long court battle or worse, violence might ensue. This would have been avoided if the winner traveled to collect his/her winnings and just kept a low profile.",

It's enough to commit crimes and even murder.A person doesn't really need to experience being robbed by a cousin which she trusted. A person can just observe what happens in criminal investigations or in movies because it's usually close to the truth. A son will even kill a father to get the wealth of the father.If I were the victim though I can still reconcile, you don't wanna ruin and burn bridges to everyone connected to your cousins. If anything, it's them who should consider reconciling.",
