App out when you enter your password or you delete your wallet files?Are you sure you have downloaded the latest version? Check it out using Settings > APPs > about. updating it to last verison may solve the problem.If you deleted the wallet data or it was deleted in some way, stop using that phone because it will reduce the possibility of restoring any files (especially adding new files).If you remember the password, you will need an expert to recover the wallet file for you. else, the chance is almost non-existent.",

Anything can happen to the wallet or to the wallet device. I remember just some days back that I mistaken deleted one if my wallet, all I relied on was my seed phrase. Your seed phrase or private key is your coin.",

I have always had sympathy for people who lose their money, no matter how. But I have more sympathy for those who accept responsibility for their actions and don't try to put the blame on other factors like you just did. Trust Wallet didn't lose your coins. You (possibly) lost your coins because you don't know where your seed is. Software and hardware can malfunction that's why it's recommended to have physical backups. If you dropped the phone and smashed its screen, would you also blame Trust Wallet because you can no longer access your wallet? Is it the phone manufacturer's fault that you dropped it and broke the screen?The seed is the most vital element because it's independent from your wallet. The seed can be imported elsewhere in case of issues with the initial software/hardware. Calm down, get some sleep, and think about where you put your recovery phrase and how you hid it.",

Yes, because you have fully control your funds and its beyond their control, closed source custodial wallet or not. This incident wont happen if you have your backup seed save somewhere safe. This should serve you a lesson, no matter how safe and secured your wallet is if you don't remember where your backup seed is, its the same story.",

The most important factor that a non-custodial wallet is is full asset control for the person so without storing the seed phrase the wallet has no owner and no one can control the wallet.",

Make sure that you store everything properly, if this kind of problem occurs and the backup phrase is not found then there is nothing you can do but let it go.The first thing I do when I type create a wallet to accept signature campaign payments is create a new wallet then store the phrases in a safe place and the backups are easily accessible to me. I don't open the wallet app often, I use electrum only for bitcoin payments because it's safer in my opinion.Quote from: CryptSafe on January 11, 2023, 10:03:52 PM~snip~ My case I never prepared for it neither did I see it coming.

No, he means that the application does no longer run on his phone. He can't open it to get access to his coins. Since OP lost his seed phrase and/or doesn't remember where he put it, he won't be able to move his crypto until either the app becomes functional again or he finds a copy of the lost seed. Nothing was hacked or stolen from his wallet. OP said his signature payments are lost, but that's just because he has no means to access his wallet at the moment.",
