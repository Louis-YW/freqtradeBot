If you say invest then I think.Only those who have wealth left by their ancestors can invest without working. Now what do those who do not have the resources to invest in Bitcoin? They have to earn money by working first and then invest. In addition to investing in Bitcoin, it is important to work. investing in bitcoins is not only profitable but also has the possibility of losses. What do you do when you lose investment? Then you have to sit on the way. So you have to invest in bitcoins in addition to working.",

It will make people become inactive and sedentary, causing more consequences than benefits. For me, labor is still something that should be maintained because only work can make people think and be more creative. If we are too lazy and just love to make money without working, the world will soon be ruined.",

You also have to be able to understand how miner software works and set your miner tools to their best performance to be able to make a profit. Indeed, Bitcon miner can give you money without working, but that is also in accordance with your skills and the capital you provide, and your expertise in setting up the device you have, because if you are not good at managing your device it will make you lose .",

Apart from that, you also need to do financial management to run the mining, unless you have a trusted person to manage it all, but again that also requires quite a lot of money.However, mining bitcoins can be a solution to achieve that dream. however, personally, I might prefer to add another business because I feel that mining bitcoins will continue to require additional funds such as upgrading hardware, and so on.",

      "body": "Yes you are correct from your point of view.  But you might forget that bitcoin mining has certain steps that need to be completed first .  Bitcoin mining requires you to invest a lot of money in the beginning without any profit.  You need to find a place with low temperatures, where your electricity bills are low, and where you have to spend money on graphics cards and other equipment.  In every way, if you want to be a bitcoin miner, you have to allocate a huge amount of money to mine at the moment. To buy equipments.  You say mining is a way to make money no problem but if it is from our previous property you can ride a rickshaw but if you want to start from start you have to earn money by doing hard work and spend for mining.  There is no guarantee that mining after that will always be successful.  For this reason we can  said that \"along with efforts, hard work is required.\"",

But you must do mining to earn bitcoins without work so you can earn bitcoins without work. But I think it will be better for you if you save some of your money instead of mining and later invest it in Bitcoins. There are some mining if you want to do it you must invest money first then you can earn bitcoins from that mining. You should invest rather than mining so you can be successful in making money in the future.",

You also need to connect or invest in electricity, maintain the machines, and pay for other expenses. I also know that miners possess some technical skills that will enable them carry out this task effectively. Miners also need to monitor the mining operation and endure some level of stress. This means that just like every other business for one to be able to make money from mining one needs to put in financial, human, and material resources. So assuming that bitcoin mining will give you money without work is highly deceptive. You are showcasing the bitcoin sector as a get rich without work scheme. Bitcoin mining is a big-time investment that is associated with risk which sometimes can be profitable or lead to loss.",

Miners are moving to countries with low electricity cost,so that they can still be in the industry. If you don't have a good amount of capital,you can't go into mining.

You must work in other for you to have money to invest. There must be a sacrifice to have money,because you must put things together to get a better outcome.
