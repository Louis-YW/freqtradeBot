And signing up is easy, you can click any part of the signatures to sign up, deposit and start playing..If you have any concerns, you can ether contact their online customer support or locate their Ann thread in the gambling board and post there, users are on ground to help out at any time.Goodluck",

It's one of the biggest and known casinos in Asia. Quote from: vyliam on November 26, 2022, 06:24:11 PMyeah but I can't register at stake as Slovak citizen.In BK8, you're allowed to register as a Slovak citizen. Check their main thread and I'll quote the prohibited countries on them.Quote from: BK8.Official on February 19, 2021, 01:40:28 AMProhibited countries: Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong, China, South Korea, North Korea, and England.Quote from: vyliam on November 26, 2022, 07:14:02 PMbut they don't have matches I am looking forCan you tell us what exactly are the matches that you're looking for so that everyone will help you and guide you on where we can find that match?",

I support all these three, when picking the right bookmakers you'll go for reputation, feedback, and position in the gambling industry and these three are qualified and highly recommended if you win a big amount you are sure to get it, we have seen in the scam section where winners of big amount are denied of payment and even accusing players of wrongdoing when they can present valid proofs, so go all the best in the industry so you can play with a peace of mind.",

I'd second to Freebitco.in since it's the only one reputable no KYC casino in this forum, while the other is a centralized casino and will ask your KYC to verify your account. Privacy is really important and you wouldn't know what they will do with your KYC, there's a chance if they sold your KYC to get more money.

There are still reputable gambling sites out there that don't mandate a KYC but they will only if you bet big enough and that exceeds on their given limit as a free user but there is no need to worry because you can surely trust your KYC with them.Big gambling sites won't sell their customers KYC because they are already big and they are contented on what they are currently earning. There is no need to do things which can destroy their reputation. Submitting a KYC is only dangerous to a gambling site whose reputation is questionable.",
