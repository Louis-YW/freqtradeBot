  "content": "I setup my MyNode a few months ago. I was able to connect my Sparrow wallet to my MyNode without any issues. I am running an electrum server on my MyNode and I set up an electrum wallet on my desktop which is currently set to \"Select Server Automatically\". I have watched some videos on how to connect my electrum wallet to my node and all the videos show a \"Server\" tab in the Network window. In my case, I only see the Overview and Proxy tabs - there is no server tab. I have tried deselecting the box to select server automatically and entering the ip address of my electrum server in the box but the little light shines bright red. It will only shine green when I select the box for select server automatically. How can I connect my electrum wallet to my node?Thanks in advance for any help.",

You should be able to find enable server tab in mynode homepage. After doing all the steps, you may restart everything and check again. Green light should appear.",

I followed the steps and even tried to connect using the CLI although unsuccessfully. nc50lc: Yes, the video I watched was about a year old. Since the overview and server tabs have been merged, I am assuming that all one needs to do is enter their electrum address in the box as well as uncheck the \"select Server Automatically\" button and tab away. This is when the green light goes to red. I was also able to connect my Blue Wallet connected to my node. For some reason, I can not get my desktop electrum wallet connected. I don't know what else to do than maybe uninstall the wallet and reinstall again.",
