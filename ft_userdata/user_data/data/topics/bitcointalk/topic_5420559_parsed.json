Does not have any news on their social accounts regarding the reason behind its removal. It would have been war of exchanges if every exchange out there started following similar path. I think it could be internal decision. Because if such spontaneous cycle of removing exchange coins started then everyone will end up removing their own TICKER from every exchange.

BNB is not performing badly compared to other cryptocurrencies therefore there reason might not be because of bad performance. A customer can send a mail to them asking them their reason for de-listing the coin. We might have an answer from them. But I think the reason for this actions would soon be given with time. Lets just be patient, it would soon be unveiled.",

But if they continue their dispute display like this, they might be ready to lose both of their customers which is a good chance for the other exchange to invite/recruit them.",

Binance gains much popularity, and fighting with that won't lead to good anything. Any war in the crypto space just will make it worst. Already there is a problem with FTX and they file for bankruptcy. By removing BNB Whitebit will lose liquidity. It won't hurt BNB anyway. Binance is a few x better than whitebit IMO.",

Out of curiosity what leads to the removal of a coin from being listed on the exchange besides bad performance or little to no liquidity??It is possible but why I am thinking that Whitebit is taking advantage of the confusion to give short time notice to their client of withdrawing BNB from their exchange to confiscate any BNB that is not withdrawn on the given time.  It is only 6 -7 days' notice before they disable the withdrawal.  Most take at least a month before they stop processing the withdrawal.  I don't know why i had this feeling as I read the notice.Anyway, I think it won't have a huge impact on the BNB economy, it will only give Binance exchange more users and trading transaction because those client who has Binance coin will look for another exchange to trade their Binance coin and most probably will choose the Binance exchange.",

I am not sure why, since I have not read in detail, but i assume it was to favor their own native stablecoin BUSD within their own platform.In the end, exchanges are businesses and they are competitors among themselves, so I am not really surprised to see some of them taking advantage of their influence to push their own interests, which are mostly economic and strategic in nature, I don't agree with it, of course, but it is little we can do.Considering how important is BNB in terms of Marketcap, it would seem this is indeed a retaliatory move against Binance.",

It is always internal and handled internally and not always out of hand. In fact it is a competition of smartness not a competition of hurting one another. The whole saga happening recently is not in favour of cryptocurrency and its adoption.I sincerely wish all this CEOs will retrace their steps and follow the right way for the sake of our dear crypto.Whatever maybe  the case with Whitebit, they should be very careful because CZ is very smart and well prepared, people dealing with him should be very cautious of what they do.",

Now anything happening with the coins BNB and FTX will be connected with the ongoing exchanges war. According to me, the exchange could've given notification citing the reason for its immediate action than just providing deadline.",

But on this case, I doubt that BNB will have those factors to get removed from an exchange. Maybe there's sort of personal matter of them against Binance and what just happened when they didn't continue the deal with FTX. There could be some serious info that we don't know until we ask this whitebit exchange on what's really the reason for delisting a top and known coin though owned by another exchange.",

For now, let us wait for further results of this drama, I am doubtful that there is possible hidden agenda for this",

I suggest paying a close attention to this (or just avoid them completely lol). I forgot the name of the exchange but frequent delisting + giving people very short period of time to withdraw was their scam scheme before halting withdrawals.",

Every war of exchange is probably similar to the wars in the world. There may be 2 interests from certain parties, but the victim is the community. Is this one way to make the market drop even more?
