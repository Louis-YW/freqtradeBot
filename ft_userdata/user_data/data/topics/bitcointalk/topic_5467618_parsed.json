  "content": "MuskyDoge (BSC token) is over 2 years old. It's a scrappy little project, after the bullmarket like others it came crashing down. Recently added a few mobile games but now starting a Sportsbook with a few NFL games to bet on (more to come). It's currently sitting at a whopping 30K market cap (3M ATH). It really doesn't seem like it will dip too much from here. If you look into it, there was a migration two years ago so that chart is damn near dead. There's not much activity on the charts but maybe with this addition can get the ball rolling. MuskyDoge.net for more information. I personally like to bet on sports so this does sound like fun.",
