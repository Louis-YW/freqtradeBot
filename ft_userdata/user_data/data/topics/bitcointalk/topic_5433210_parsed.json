Would they be able to reimburse customers or would they become insolvent?I asked my close group of friends how many store their assets on exchanges and only 1 out of 6 uses an offline wallet.The recent incident with Luke Dashjr confirms that you are always at risk of being hacked no matter how vigilant you are.Will give my thoughts on the Ledger Nano once I receive it.",

Some newbies who never bothered educating themselves about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin do it because they think that is the way to store them! For a very long time I saw people who thought blockchain.info is like PayPal and is the \"owner\" or \"creator\" of bitcoin so you have to only use that site if you wanted to use bitcoin!!!Others who are short term traders do it because they know that altcoins pump and dump nature requires them very quick access to their shitcoins so that they can dump them in an instant instead of having to make a deposit and in some cases having to wait for thousands of confirmation before their account is funded and they are allowed to dump them.QuoteWhat would happen if Binance got hacked tomorrow and lost the majority of its cryptocurrency? Would they be able to reimburse customers or would they become insolvent?It depends on what happens to Binance after the hack. If people all go away, specially if after the hack another \"good CEX\" comes along and takes all their customers away, they could go under and won't be able to pay their users.After all that is what Binance did to the previous exchange that got hacked when they took all their customers away and pushed them under.",

This because you're need to use an online software to integrate with your hardware wallet, this mean if your computer already get infected by virus and you're not aware with that, your hardware wallet could be compromised especially if you write the private key or seed phrase on your computer.Hardware wallet isn't a perfect storage to combat any virus, but it's 99% way better than holding in exchange or online wallet.",

Between storing crypto in offline wallets and earning no passive income and storing online and earning passive income, some people prefer to choose the second option. However, due to the presented issues crypto investors are facing nowadays with exchanges services, it's really not a good idea to keep money in the exchanges. The risks are too high and there are no protection from authorities to customers, in bankruptcy or scam hypothesis. If at least authorities guaranteed protection to investors, it wouldn't be too risky to let funds at online platforms.",

I think for now even beginners already know where they have to store their assets to be safe. but most of them still keep some of their crypto assets on the exchange because they really continue to trade them or indeed the amount is really, really small.",

They are accustomed to using banks and depositing their money, and they shift all security and safety concerns to the bank. So users will relieve themselves of responsibility, which is fraught with huge risks. Storage on cold wallets requires some knowledge (which is quite affordable) and actions (which are also doable), but beginners don't want to delve into it out of laziness or irresponsibility.So you have decided to seriously approach the storage of your crypto and buy a hardware wallet. That's the right decision. So you will be calm about your funds and reduce the risk of losses, as if you were storing it on the stock exchange. Commendable.",

I mean transferring coins from one address to another address takes time and that \"time\" might affect the amount of profits that they might have thus, they choose to risk it all and let it store on the exchange.Maybe another reason why they are storing it on exchanges is the fact that they can earn a small percentage of that coin annually. Binance have this \"Earn\" feature where holders can earn a certain percentage annually.Quote from: MiliMil on January 06, 2023, 04:26:38 AMWhat would happen if Binance got hacked tomorrow and lost the majority of its cryptocurrency? Would they be able to reimburse customers or would they become insolvent?We don't know. Cryptocurrency isn't regulated so its CZ who will decide whether he will reimburse his customers if the worst thing happens or not.Centralized exchanges are very prone to hacks and with what happened to FTX, for sure the trust of investors towards CEX declined. On the other hand, I believe that Binance will not get hack or at least lose their funds or run away (at least not in the next 3 years ).",

For a trader, other than centralized exchanges, they have almost no other choice, it is considered a must whether they like it or not. OP, storing assets on cold wallets or non-custodial wallets can only be considered much more secure than exchanges, but by no means absolutely secure.
