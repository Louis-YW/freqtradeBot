  "content": "Hi Guys,A few weeks ago I posted my $417,000 win from a $300 bet (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441169.0).Since then I have received multiple private messages from people who are offering me money in exchange for betting tips and advice.I am making this thread to address the above matter plus the issue of responsible gambling.Firstly, I will NEVER ask for or accept money or payments from anyone on this forum. There is enough information, statistics and knowledge for free online that you should never pay for these services. Anybody who tries to sell you \"tips\" or \"picks\" is most likely a scammer who is only interested in taking your money. Do your own research/analysis online for free it really isn't hard at all.Secondly, the amount of private messages from people I have received is crazy. There is nothing guaranteed in gambling and you can quickly put yourself in a financial predicament by trying to win large amounts of money fast. The most important things to remember when betting is to gamble responsibly and only bet what you can afford to lose. This amount is different for other people and if you are not betting within your means you are heading for disaster.I feel like people only post their winnings and not their losses so I decided to show you the reality of sports betting below.The first photo is of a $646,000 bet that I lost by one leg. I took Stan Wawrinka (clay-court specialist) to win 2-0 against Sumit Nagal who isn't a good player and has never been ranked higher than 120. Wawrinka lost the first set and then ended up winning the next two sets6-0, 6-1.The next photo is a $1195 bet to win $1M. I won all the hard games but lost because of four matches that were paying $1.09, $1.15, $1.20 and $1.22. These are matches I thought were \"guaranteed\" and all lost in close games they should have won.The last photo is a $20,000 bet I did on MLB to win $52,000. I thought it was going to be an easy win until the San Diego Padres got a bad call by the umpire and they ended up losing a match they should have won and I lost my $20,000.These examples should show you how hard it is to win big amounts and I hope everyone who reads it understands nothing is guaranteed when it comes to gambling. Luck plays a HUGE part in gambling and the weather, the referees or an unforeseen scenario can be the difference between winning or losing.Please only gamble what you can afford to lose and if you don't have discipline or control you shouldn't be gambling. I can't stress that enough.how to share my pictures on googleurl sign upshare your pictures",

I also remember a thread in this forum sharing his friend that apparently not knowing that he is slowly getting addicted to gambling. Some people still gamble even they don't have enough or they are are using their budget for food and then when they lose they will tell other people they are a victim of scam, take for an example there is a gambling site here which influencers also giving some money for them to register and start to play some people invested 250$ and now they are all complaining they can't withdraw money now.",

I also kinda expected some people will send you offers in private ever since you made that post. It's kind of a rare chance to actually converse with some high roller so I don't really blame them. What's your current betting limit on sportsbet by the way?",

OP just want to show everyone the reality about gambling, and that there can be no big wins without enduring huge losses at first. Well anyway, thanks OP for making it clear particularly for those beginners in gambling who are dying to win huge amount like you had won. Now, they will refrain from messaging you because they know already that you are just trying to recover your big losses. I think what all gamblers should realize that gambling should not be seen as a source of income, or instant wins, knowing it could also lead you to a life changing losses if you don’t gamble responsibly.",

Some bettors don't really look at the risk of losing but are so eager for how much potential is there at the end but unfortunately we know with experience that no game is a guarantee winning because the element of hard luck can outplay itself against a \"sure bet\" just with what op posted on the games he expected to win. Another point is that the difference between huge win and small win is in the staking power, so keeping it gradual and betting according to what we can lose or forfeit and not according to our risk appetite because every person would like a high risk appetite.",

Gambling has too many variables and I think I would have bought Bitcoin with that money instead. Every person has their own take when it comes to gambling. Some of these high rollers don't think about the amount.Whereas, like you, I also don't bet big. I play from time to time just to pass the time, but I always set my limits.Whenever I used that amount, I stop. Though I play to extend my games, but if I feel that I can't recover such losses, I call it a day already.In this game, it is your own self who can only stop from playing. If you think you need to allot your money to important things, you can always do so.It is hard to stop sometimes if you are already chasing losses. This is where some gamblers are getting addicted as they won't stop up until they totally used their bankroll.",

Because in the past, there have been those tips being offered just because they've been winning with the sizeable amount and chances that they've got were better than the rest so they think that they should open a service offer for producing tips and picks every day. But most of those didn't go successfully and just as you've mentioned, it's good that you clear that in gambling there's no guarantee for all of the picks that you'll do which is true. You might also satisfy some folks that have been looking for your losses because they're not satisfied about what you've shared which was only about your wins.",

Gambling is for fun and only bet on the amount which you can afford to lose.Dont go into certain lengths which it isnt really that ideal anymore because you would really be losing money if you do stick with those false hopes and beliefs.Slight chance of losing could still count as chance on losing your money which is the very basic concept of gambling.",
