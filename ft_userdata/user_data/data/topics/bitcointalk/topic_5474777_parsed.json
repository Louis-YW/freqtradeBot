  "content": "In case you haven't been following, only a few days ago, OpenAI's board fired Sam Altman from the position of CEO. The reason's behind this are unclear to the public, but the board members stated that Altman was withholding information from the board. However this evidence wasn't presented publicly and many of Altman's fans have been very vocal with their disappointment. I've been following many online discussions on this matter and can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of Deja vu... People praise Altman the same way they praised Sam Bankman Fried. And it's hard to dismiss how many similarities exist between Altman and BankmanBoth created their own cryptocurrency. Both claimed to be \"effective altruists\"... Both claimed to be leveraging technology for the greater good of humanity... And in Mr. Bankman's case, people fucking ate it up. The evidence speaks for itself though. The result of Mr bankman's doing was one of the biggest bankruptcies in crypto. His actions affected hundreds of thousands of people, if not millions, negatively. Nobody was a winner from his \"altruism\" except for a few insiders that jumped ship early. So please, take this precedent as a warning. Humanity will not find its saviour in the tech industry sector. Just as Enron failed everyone after a glamorous run, just as Nortel bankrupted so many Canadian pension funds and stole from its own employees after being considered the #1 tech company, it's not a matter of who leads a company. Because every company's goal is maximizing profits. Solving humanity's problems for good doesn't pay well, and especially when compared to creating a need to people, there's no company that will want to make the world perfect, because then, it'll have no reason to exist.  Be it Altman leading OpenAI or anyone else, a tech company CEO will not save us.Only the people can save the people.",

But i have to say i believed his act for a long time and i wasn't alone. Unconventional living style, or opinions were just underlining that easy to buy concept of autistic tech genius and self made millionaire; Because we want something like that to be true.I wouldn't have even dreamed that they had been using FTT as collateral. Why would i? I didn't see behind the curtain and SBH was adored by many. I dont know if Altman have been using worldcoin in similar way, but i doubt it. I frankly don't care.Worldcoin has a scam written on it from the start. While it didn't have a token sale to lose money to, people sure gave lots of valuable information for it for peanuts.And it was marketed fully knowing that it won't fly wth EU privacy laws, nor it won't be adopted by any legit company because no one wants that legal battle nightmare even near them. They must have known it because any other reason for this would be total incompetence, and i don't think altman is ignorant when it comes to huge differences between laws of different regions.",

      "body": "Seems like these 'tech geniuses' tend to be selected for their positions in much the same as are our politicians (at least here in the 'democratic' systems of the West.)  Chiefly, they tend to be of or associated with a certain authorized tribe, and tending to have some pretty ugly dirt on them.  Being prone to diddling one's 4-year-old sister, if it happened, would be classic, and I would not be surprised at all if Altman or anyone else would be less than generous with the details if quizzed by the board of directors.Playing to the simpleton's senses of social justice with 'altruism' scams, 'climate change' sustainability tobacco-science, etc is also classic for your garden-variety psychopath.Maybe Altman's interest in AI was to create a Winston Smith bot which could effectively write some of his past out of reality.",

      "body": "I heard that Sam Altman diddled his sister, but I cannot confirm this. Well, that may be a good enough reason to oust him.Hmmm. The entire cryptocurrency sector gobbled Sam Bankman Fried's garbage up but they for some reason have a very hard time using cryptocurrency mining to solve the most important scientific problem. This tells me that there is something a bit disturbing about the entire cryptocurrency sector.I wrote a post of AI safety on this site where I said that safe fitness functions are related to subharmonic or plurisubharmonic functions, generalizable to complex or quaternionic values, have a unique or nearly unique local optimum, have a Hessian at the local maximum that cannot be easily approximated by a singular matrix, etc and at the very least AI companies should use matrix-valued word embeddings for their language models. I should have also said there that we would have safer AI if the AI CEOs did not diddle their sisters. This is how the interview for CEO position for an AI company should go?Board of directors-Did you diddle your sister like Uncle Sam did?CEO candidate-I most certainly did not diddle my sister.Board of directors-Just to be safe, we decided to hire a female CEO. I mean, we don't care about diversity at all. We just don't want anyone like Uncle Sam leading our company.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

      "body": "Some interesting developments. It seems like Altman was re-hired back to OpenAI and the entire board that had taken the decision to fire him was sacked and replaced. The replacements seem much, much worse though. Larry Summers ex US treasury that almost became secretary in Israel under netanyahu's criminal government too... Just look up the Summer Memo debacle and you'll be getting goosebumps about how inhumane this dude is. This dude is now in the board of OpenAI... He's going to be responsible for ethics about one of the most influential companies in the up and coming industry of AI. What's crazy is that Sam Altman's sister, Annie Altman, has been speaking very publicly with allegations of serious abuse and molestation. But this became viral on the news ONLY AFTER Sam was re-hired at OpenAI. https://www.themarysue.com/annie-altmans-abuse-allegations-against-openais-sam-altman-highlight-the-need-to-prioritize-humanity-over-tech/Honestly the tech world is crazy. In the end it seems like it was all about profit in the first place. I have no idea why anyone defended Altman in the first place.",

      "body": "It's possible to build a company that works for everyone without compromising on your good principles. Lots of issues with modern companies boil down on greed & love for money. The god of riches aka Mammon shows up in the owners workshops, dangles couple carrots in their faces and they dump the lttle principle they have in the garbage bin, hastily grab the carrots, sell off the projects (with their patents)  to later buy some mansions in islands. It's sometimes abit difficult to believe that people would sell off something they claim to love for money. Can money buy back the kind of happiness and satisfaction they get from the projects? This could actually serve as proof that this people may not be the original owners of the ideas/things they sold. They were probably stolen in hopes that they would make hugh money out of them. Whereas the real creators are busy trying to make it work for everyone and never interested in selling.",
