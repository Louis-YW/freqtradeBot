  "content": "I have been dealing with an apparent nice guy on Insta. He initially posted ona mutual picture that if anyone responded to him in a particular way he would clear their debt for them. I agree, too good to believe. For the hell of it, I decided to reply and he agreed to transfer the required funds to me via crypto. He and I have been in contact and I have transferred 2 amounts to him. Fortunately not overly high. I have received this latest communication from him and wanted to know if this was a genuine thing and I am ok to proceed or I should stop now, block his thieving and lying self and move on with my life. “We are contacting you based on your pending  request of your total sum of $18000.Your payment of $300 has been confirmed. We have to bring to your notice a policy that is of utmost priority should a withdrawal request be ensued.The trading firm has sworn an oath with the United State Council to abide by the law of the government that every trusted investor will have to pay a tax fee of $900 which is 5% of the total withdrawal amount before the withdrawal process can be completed with your withdrawal code E09556 to pay the stipulated fee. Once the payment is done a slot will be available on where you can insert your wallet address on your platform. You have a maximum limit of seven(7) working days to make this payment.“What are peoples thoughts here?  Genuine or genuine scam?",

Take note that anyone can easily create a watch-only wallet using others addresses and since a watch-only wallet doesn't have any private key, it's not possible to spend fund from that.

We have to bring to your notice a policy to scam as much from you as possible before you pullback, but we’ll rephrase it in a more luring way.The fake trading firm has sworn an oath to scam the hell out of you and anyone else who believes our ridiculous scheme. Every gullible investor will have to pay a scam fee of $xxx which is 5% of the total withdrawal amount you believe you’re going to get with your withdrawal code E09556. Once the payment is done, we’ll see if we can still milk the cow a bit more and harass you for yet another contribution to our wellbeing. You have a maximum limit of seven(7) working days to make this payment (please hurry, we need to go down to the whorehouse to celebrate and party all night long at your expense).Their line of though is more or less along this line. The same type of scam is commonly carried out with different pretexts, but all bear a common backbone of putting money/crypto dangling in front of your eyes, asking for some transfer beforehand to cover this or that.",

Honestly, for many years in scamming people that those scanmers even find a way to scam people of their money either through a project like ICO which most of it are scam that's why it is no longer a trend for years. Most of the scam attempt is that you must pay/send money to a wallet address before you will get what you wanted and if it's not then they will explain their so called investment like you will earn x amount of BTC within 24 hours and to avail in that so called investment then you must deposit first. As you have said that you already sent funds to them then you should stop right now before you lose more of your money. It's likely a SCAM.",

Blockchain is public and open to anyone. There's nothing stopping you from making a wallet that others can see, except for the fact that it's not your wallet (you can't spend funds from it) if you don't have the private key. For example, I can show you Binance's wallet (probably the largest cryptocurrency exchange), but that does not mean I have access to the billions of dollars worth of money there.",

I'm sorry for your loss, I believe you have been scammed, it's just better you block the scammer to avoid further damages. As the scammer requested for the first payment and you paid, he will definitely give more excuses and request for more money, the more you keep sending the money, he will keep on increasing amount he will be requesting for and he will be giving excuses, so just block the scammer and accept your faith, I know how painful it is to be scammed, but this will serve as a lesson to you and everyone else reading this thread not to trust anybody you meet on social media, and you should know their is no free way to make money.",

Out of curiosity what does it take to make a view only wallet accessible to a third party?I haven't seen such a scam before, possibly due to regional differences, but I've had similar ones. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. No easy money can be made. However, from your way of writing, you're implying that you've transferred $300; did I understand correctly? If so, why? Always trust your instincts; if it sounded fishy, why would you send money and then proceed to ask questions here? I don't mean to offend you, but $300 is still a pretty decent sum to lose to a scammer. I'd be furious.Anyway, in such cases, this forum and Reddit can be incredible sources to seek information.",

Therefore, you must exercise extreme caution when dealing with anyone you encounter online who brings up financial matters.
