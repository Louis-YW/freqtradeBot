  "content": "ChipMixer was among the best (if not the best) crypto mixers in the world. It was shut down by the authorities easily because of its centralized design. I've stumbled across Tornado.Cash, but it got sanctioned by the US. I know there are \"clones\" of this mixer, but I'm not sure how trustworthy they are. Things change quite fast in the crypto space, so I was wondering if there are any new mixers that are worth the shot (either centralized or decentralized). Any suggestions and/or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",

They're becoming a rarity these days ever since mainstream governments began shutting them down for good. We need more non-custodial (decentralized) mixers for Bitcoin if we want people to enjoy privacy on their utmost sensitive transactions. There was a project called Tumblebit, but it was abandoned by developers. Maybe they'll bring something similar to the community in the future?Quote from: Stalker22 on May 23, 2023, 09:35:18 PMWhen it comes to finding the best Bitcoin mixer, it really depends on what you prioritize.

Thanks for sharing the list, mate. In times where governments are increasing their surveillance techniques, you can never go wrong by using a mixer to help protect your privacy and financial freedom. I prefer mixing my BTC than switching to a privacy-oriented altcoin which has very little merchant support. It's likely centralized mixers will die as governments take them down for good. Only non-custodial (decentralized) mixers will survive. Who knows how the future will look like for the crypto industry as a whole?",
