Wich one is safe?It is better to use a non-custodial wallet than the exchange centralized platform upon storing your crypto.Honestly --if you don't have money to purchase a hardware wallet which is considered a very safe and secure wallet, there is an Electrum wallet which is very easy to download and very easy to use. You can watch different tutorials on Youtube if you don't know how to use them. Keeping safeguard our wallet sometimes depend on us, we should have diligence on it in keeping our private key safe and as long as we have full control of it --your crypto is safe in that wallet. By the way --have you heard the FTX and Binance drama recently? they are both centralized exchange which is not safe to store your crypto.",

Wich one is safe?Many people use exchange wallets as BTC wallets. But I would never call it safe. Currently we see Jaljant for example from FTX. So how can we think this exchange is very safe. But the most secure is the hardware wallet.Â  Although you have to buy there with money it is still very safe. Also there is electrum wallet you can use it. It will not require any money. But whatever wallet you currently use, use it very carefully.",

Wich one is safe?Exchanges are still popular because people are still more into speculating with digital assets than hodling. For this reason, the bitcoin maximalists (people who will not sell no matter what happens on the market) make up a very small percentage of all cryptocurrency users, who are mostly gambling with their digital money. Also, some people erroneously believe that those who work on exchanges are more technically literate in matters of cryptocurrency management: funds are safer when on \"hosted\" wallets managed by centralized entities. Of course, this is a total misconception. Decentralized custody of many owners of independent wallets is the key to security. As for the difficulty of use, I can say that setting up your personal wallet requires much fewer steps and interactions than setting up your exchange account and undergoing different verification procedures to make your account \"work.\"",

Wich one is safe?Actually, using a non-custodial wallet or an exchange wallet has nothing to do with difficulty or ease of use, the difference lies in the purpose of use. People who leave their bitcoins or cryptocurrencies on centralized exchanges are mostly traders, very few holders will leave bitcoins on the exchange. Nowadays, people not only invest in bitcoin, many also invest in altcoins and the fact that each stored coin needs a separate wallet makes it very difficult to control the asset. So people tend to have them all on a centralized exchange, which is convenient for trading as well as managing them. I have also used blockchain.info wallet, coinbase...but if for storing bitcoins Electrum wallet is the best and easiest to use I found, and for those with higher security needs, they will tend to choose hardware wallets for themselves.",

Be aware choosing the best one, don't buy from any unofficial source.BTC wallets is actually very easy to use, but many people have trouble with it. This is easily fixed. You just need to use it for a while, having studied slowly and sequentially all the functions. Having mastered and got used to wallet, it will no longer seem like something difficult. The simplest and most reliable is electrum. In conjunction with hardware wallet, reliability increases, but it will take a little effort to master HW too. Nothing complicated, but the first time there may be a hitch. There is nothing wrong with that, and with cryptocurrencies one way or another you will need to learn new things, because the industry is new and rapidly changing.Blockchain.com I wouldn't use. Despite its apparent simplicity, this website can cause more headaches for beginners than electrum. Also consider less reliability and the fact that Blockchain.com limits and stops serving certain regions. This doesn't fit in with the idea of ââfreedom, which is cultivated in the world of cryptocurrencies.",
