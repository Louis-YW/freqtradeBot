Even you use Monero, you will not be anonymous too since you think giving your banks number (trade via P2P) or meet in person (F2F) are still exposes your identity.So yeah, there's no way except you use someone else banks account/identity.",

Essentially, they are seeking a practical privacy solution.you sound like ai mate, is this ai written? i have tried to check this but it is too short to analyze by platforms even if this is not ai we do not need you to explain what op is saying when it is very clear especially you did not even contribute any actual answersQuote from: rando2939 on January 25, 2025, 04:57:17 AMSo, how does one stack privately?anyway for op there is no way to be completely anonymous because there will always be traces in the blockchain but you can move your coins from one account to another just so that the transactions are not easily identified when i say not completely anonymous i am just talking about the traces but as long as you do not comply with kyc platforms and keep your internet profiles lowkey and discreet you will be fine",

      "body": "Maybe you can find an offer on this forum as long as you're okay with escrow since nobody is going to sell you stuff when you can't guarantee they will get their money in the first place. What's your bottom line for this btw? If you're not okay with KYC, escrow, private bank account, trading your alts for your Bitcoin, etc, I don't think you'll find an option that satisfies you. Btw are you referring to transaction size when you mentioned \"unwieldy\"? Are you afraid that the fees will be expensive because of that?",

If you are clean you have nothing to worry about.Yes I agree, especially with Bitcoin if it isnt illegal in your country there is no needto get hung up too much on 100% privacy/anonymity.Obviously we all have to exercise a degree of privacy but being able to limit it to only giving your name away is ok IMO.",
