I'll leave my simple technique here and I'll hope you guys can leave some more!I often use the stake doubling technique to several games. I normally do this with dice games and if it played correctly its profitable. What you have to do is simply start with a small stake and every time you lose you double your steak until you win. Once you win, you will recover all the amount you lost. This works if you have enough money to keep doubling your bet, so you should do your math and check with how much you should start.

Most of the time I bet on 2 of these option including the option that has the value of 14x. Once that 14x hit, I will continue to bet on it for 3 more rounds (at most). After that, I'll refrain on betting with the 14x and just place a single bet. After at least 6 rounds, I'll add the 14x again to my bets. It works for me, however it is not alwayrs reliable.",

So do it at your own risk.",

There will be a point where you will lose many times in a row and the casino has much deeper pockets than you. If it was such a extra useful technique, then what are you doing posting here? Surely you should be on your own private island, drinking cocktails and relaxing in the sun all day. Oh right, that's because it doesn't work. If you want to learn something useful, dedicate thousands of hours to playing online poker and learning your own strategy for profitably grinding tables - but beware there are equally intelligent people who will be grinding in other countries with a much lower cost of living, who have greater incentive to play for pennies.",

I may use some gambling strategies mostly martingale but I don't really depend on these techniques but rather depends on my gut on what to do. It is true that no matter how many techniques you use the result is always the same. I have tried martingale strategy which I double the bet amount until I win and double again for next bet which the next result might be a win. After using the martingale strategy, I did earn some profit during those times which I double the funds I have two times (different day) but also lose all of my funds (the same amount) more than once.",

And when there is excess luck (read: five-figure multipliers) that exceeds my betting limits, I withdraw money.I think there is not a lot of rocket science with the Slots, the other(s) strategy(s) is have fun!, don't spend money you can't afford to lose!, which is one of the main things that will happen most of the time, you should understand it, so there is no 100% winning strategy. Well! at least of course you bet once, win and never again in your life make a bet.",

Chances are in the ball fall around that group of numbers, you might have a good chance to win. Also I only play single 0's. not a fan of 00 because the changes to his is smaller.Bacarrat, probably just double up until 3 consecutive hits for me. Not looking for more wins, of course the more the better but you can get busted. So it's better to have just like 3 wins in a row in a double up bet, that is huge money already.Slots, if I have the capital to begin with, I will do max bet, if not, maybe try x2 or x3 multiplier first.",
