I honestly never bothered with altcoins too much, except one time I used to mine with my PC. I only felt safe with Bitcoin. However, I don't believe that all altcoins are poor; some have a specific purpose while others have characteristics that Bitcoin doesn't cover, such as anonymity (Monero) or Ripple, which was meant to be a payment system using a unique consensus mechanism, the XRP Ledger Consensus Protocol, for consensus and validation.",

Though I don’t advise to hold only Bitcoin, there are good altcoins that you can also add on your wallet.",

Having Bitcoin in your wallet is good, its cheap and its getting cheaper you might want to wait for another down trend before buying, timing is the key to have a good profit in the future.

To some degree, I agree with your statement. With the current atate of the industry it may seem as if bitcoin is the only crypto that is trustworthy enough to HODL. I would just like to point out that ij your attempt to stray from including centralized exchange coins like BUSD, you chose Tether which is inarguably the sketchiest of all currently active stablecoins out there. At least with BUSD, there is a guaranteed 1:1 reserve which is not confirmed for Tether. Then again at the end of the day, altcoins are there to prove themselves to us, if they couldn't do that, it's best to just spot-trade them and not hold for too long.",

They're made to make their devs money and that's it. Out of that 10% legit coins most will fail and die because projects fail, get hacked, devs argue, teams break, some fail to gain traction, some choose a wrong promotion... Think about it before you buy an altcoin. Most are scams and a few legit ones can fail, get delisted or crash because of manipulation.Every few years there's a new big thing in crypto. ICO, NFT, Exchange tokens... All of these are shit. They're wash traded, pumped and dumped, they're worth as much as the company invests in them to make it look like they're valuable. When dust settles you can't even wipe your ass with your picture of an ape or a crypto punk. You bought something that nobody wants to buy from you, like that tweet of Jack Dorsey. Every year an exchange gets hacked and every year a number of crypto businesses go bankrupt. The only constant is bitcoin. It is here and it's going to be here next year. If you own it, you own it. There's no company, no CEO, nobody to tell you what to do, so do what's good for you, do what you feel is right.",

I agree that Bitcoin is essentially different from the others, but precisely Tether which is a stablecoin that raises many flags is not understood. In my case I only have Bitcoin and I do not see bad to have a small percentage of some alt, as I believe that in the future the Bitcoin will coexist with them, but the question is which ones will survive.",

If you hate all other cryptocurrencies because they are all scam, then you should perhaps hate Tether more. At least with some crypto projects, their developers and issuers are not actively intervening and controlling their coins.Anyway, first and foremost, Tether's USDT is not 1:1 backed by USD reserves as claimed. USDT's circulating supply is around 66 billion but they don't have $66 billion to back it. So, much of the USDT that are circulating in the market right now are minted out of thin air.And speaking of FTX, the issuer of the token FTT that nosedived after the former figured into severe financial mismanagement, Tether once again showed why you should hate it during the FTX fiasco. Following FTX's bankruptcy, Tether froze $46 million of USDT owned by FTX. Not only is Tether controlling other people's money in their token, they also did it upon the request of law enforcement authorities.",
