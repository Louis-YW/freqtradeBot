Secondly, you need to know the different board and stick with the ones that suit you the most.  Apart from this board (beginners and help), there are other boards that are specially created for specific kind of discussions ranging from the general discussion, economy, politics and society and also some others. The local board is where bitcoin discussions relating to your country is posted. Ensure you join your local board as it's mostly the most comfortable board that will help you blend into the forum easily. Also note that as a beginner with little or no experience in the forum, stick to boards that you can relate easily with what's happening there while you gradually check other boards and with time you can contribute in those boards.3.  Always abide by the rules and regulations in the forum . As simple as this sounds, this is one of the most important guide in the forum, always read the rules that guides you on how to create quality threads and replies that won't be Tagged as shit/spam post. remember that replies like, thank you, you are correct, you just spoke my mind and comments of these sort are regarded as spam so you try to avoid them as much as possible. You can decide that every contribution you will make in the forum won't be less than 4 lines. One of the most famous guide on how to do this is repeatedly posted in this board, you can still go through it.

Many people come here and register accounts solely for this purpose, while the primary function of the forum is to provide a free space for discussions and exchange of information and experiences. No one should be convinced that the only way to make money is by investing in skills of all kinds.In order to be correct, it must be admitted that using the forum has never been an easy matter for newcomers. For this reason, many of them fall easy prey to mistakes that quickly lead to their accounts being banned or red tagged.",

When it comes to security of one's account, I think this is a major area that needs to be looked into because many have lost their accounts to hackers and scammers who committ crimes with their details leaving the account owners in problem. It will be nice account holders take the issue of account security very seriously to avoid being hacked.It is not normal that a newbie account would just all of a sudden start spamming ones inbox with unsolicited messages. It is uncalled for and against the forum policies and at such should be reported. Doing that alone already show's their I'll intentions and one must be careful dealing with such account so as not to fall prey of their sinister motive.",

If you want to do something good, you need to know first. In global boards and local boards there are always various discussions about Bitcoin and all other types of cryptocurrencies where anyone can get a lot of support as a newbie. A trend among newbies is that they rush too much after joining the forum which should not be at all. Expecting to get something quickly will have a higher chance of reverses. Another important thing is to be regular in the forum. If one stays on the forum regularly then he will surely be able to acquire a lot of knowledge which will play an important role in his crypto life.",

I have a similar opinion. Over the course of a few days, we see guidance from senior ranks on how newcomers should behave on the forum. Although all three topics carry the same advice. We criticize newcomers for the same topics, but what can we say when senior members do the same thing. Why didn't all the advice come together in one topic?Strange, is this the influence of magnetic storms?",

What Op explained above is not only for beginners, but also for everyone. Indeed, beginners must prioritize tips like those above because they have just joined and don't know many of the rules. However, unfortunately I also see that many old members often make mistakes which have been discussed many times in every thread, but quite a few of them also violate standard forum rules, this is a bit sad indeed.Sometimes trivial things have to be repeated over and over again, which makes us keep guarding them so we don't make mistakes so that our account doesn't last long.

Sometimes they give up and show a good amount of their best knowledge on a topic, but sometimes they have a lack of comments due to limitations in their knowledge on those topics. But let me tell you one thing: you may not have understood the meaning of professional in the right way. I think the OP's statement above meant to advise the newbie, as a point, to pay attention to this forum. It is not like social media, where you can do whatever your heart desires, but here you have to follow the rules and take action by making these rules the subject; otherwise, you may face a hurdle in staying here.And if you said that this is a discussion forum, then you are right; everyone has the right to discuss here, but the meaning here is that it was what I explained. It is not what you took out that professional means that you do not have the right to participate in the matter in which your knowledge is less. I hope you understand.

You could make reference to informations already shared here while adding your point of view to it and it will be better than sharing false information to increase your number of post and activities, put while sharing your point of view make it as organized, and informative or educative as possible, sounding vague may not be really good and may not get you merited.",
