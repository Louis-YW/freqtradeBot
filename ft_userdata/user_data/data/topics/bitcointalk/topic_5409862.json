The monetary unit of Nigeria, in my opinion, has never been successful in the foreign exchange market, but only in the country itself. As for Wazirx didn’t like the functionality of the exchange at all and it will never be compared with Binance.",

      "body": "Well the two companies have been finger pointing as to who is the real owner Wazirx. There were news years ago that Binance was in the process of acquiring this exchange and of course their wallet. And now that Wazirx is under investigation by India’s Directorate of Enforcement (ED) froze the bank assets of Wazirx as part of its money laundering investigation.So how can the investigation if they even don't know who is the real owner? So there is a back and forth verbal tussle in social media between CZ and Wazirx founder Nischal Shetty to the point that CZ threaten to to disable Wazirx wallet, thus advising investors to transfer their funds to Binance.",
