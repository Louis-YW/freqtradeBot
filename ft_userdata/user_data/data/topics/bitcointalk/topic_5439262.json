  "content": "Everyone is talking about Salvador but there is almost no interest here from the other country that has adopted Bitcoin, little news coming from the Central African Republic, and I was quite surprised when visiting a topic I happened to come across this piece of news:https://cointelegraph.com/news/central-african-republic-eyes-legal-framework-for-crypto-adoptionQuoteA 15-member committee is tasked with working on a legal framework that will allow cryptocurrencies to operate in Central African Republic and expedite the development of the national economy.All nice and so on but, wasn't Bitcoin already legal tender here, so what kind of \"framework\" do you need to approve?And then, this thing :https://african.business/2022/07/technology-information/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-central-african-republics-adoption-of-bitcoin/QuoteOn 26 July the Central African Republic (CAR) froze the application of its law adopting bitcoin as an official currency alongside its local currency, the Central African CFA franc, until the the Bank of Central African States (BEAC) issues regulations for cryptocurrency throughout the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).https://www.theafricareport.com/226880/car-backs-down-from-implementing-cryptocurrency-law-in-exchange-for-beac-engagement/QuoteBangui agreed not to implement its cryptocurrency law in exchange for BEAC regulating crypto assets. This common ground was reached in Cameroon’s economic capital Douala on 20 and 21 July. While the worst was expected, the CAR came out of it relatively well.No implementing decree“Bangui has undertaken not to publish the decree implementing the 22 April law. This is equivalent to freezing its implementation. In return, it will have to wait until the BEAC develops a regional regulation on crypto assets to comply with it,” says our interviewee.There is a complete gap in news from July and I really can't find anything about the current situation, so what is from a legal point of view the situation right now there? I know we have quite a few users from Nigeria and other countries in the area but do we have members from CAR around? Would be interesting to hear from somebody who lives there!",

A 15 person task force sounds small but perhaps making suggestions that get them in the media might make people know they exist.I think a CBDC that comes out of CAR would be very corrupt and highly centrally controlled and manipulated for what they want. El Salvador and CAR should probably both have made their own tokens to attract investors as well as recognising bitcoin as legal tender (they can easily do both of those and actually look like they're getting somewhere).",

      "body": "One would expect that Africa has quite a lot to gain from early Bitcoin adoption since Africa suffered hard from European colonies (and it'll take even more time to recover for them). Even then, there's still climate change which will hit Africa directly because droughts are already a big problem. If Africa's food production would suffer from this (which is likely), Africa will be forced to import more food. And early Adoption of Bitcoin (yes, it's still early  ) could help here, but no surprise, many local leaders are more interested to create benefits for their own bags. Which is really sad for all African people. However, it's stil possible, that a large number of Africans will learn about Bitcoin and start to accept it due to bad local alternatives. At least here on Bitcointalk, the African community is growing.",

      "body": "I think we should know if Central African Republic is one of the poorest country in the world, since the minimum salary in this country is just $60/month [1], not to mention there are a lot people are get paid smaller than that. So my assumptions not a lot people have access to electricity and afford to buy cellphone with the internet connection. That's might the problem why we're not hearing any usage Bitcoin from Central African Republic.From the quoted below, it seems the government doesn't force every business to accept Bitcoin payment. Also they're trying to create their own token named Sango coin. It's ridiculous the government don't want to buy Bitcoin using their fiat money, but they're trying to buy Bitcoin using their own centralized token which the funds will come from foreigner's funds. More or less, Central African Republic's president didn't really trust and willing to take risk to buy Bitcoin.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-sango-coin-and-the-central-african-republic“There was no not even a single business that accepted Bitcoin. I gave my guide a tip in Bitcoin. I paid my host in Bitcoin.”Ly explained that Sango is a “government project.” Money raised through the sale of Sango Coin will be used to buy Bitcoin, which can then be used to acquire the materials necessary for development projects, as well as to pay for labor and other expenses.In the CAR, “e-residency can be obtained [...] by locking a fixed collateral of SANGO Coins in the amount of 6000$ for a period of 3 years.” Plus, foreign investors can directly access the country’s strategic resources through the use of the crypto token, Ly explained.[1] https://wagecentre.com/salary/africa/central-african-republic",

Either way, Sango is a failure.Quote from: 348Judah on February 10, 2023, 11:27:01 AMEverything has been working alright This is what I'm asking, what was working alright since we had no news after the law made it legal tender but we had those two articles which I quoted above where it seems they've backtracked on that issue. Well, I do understand the lack of information, with the current situation as they are more interested in war and disputes than building something is no surprise the number of tourists is probably abysmal.",
