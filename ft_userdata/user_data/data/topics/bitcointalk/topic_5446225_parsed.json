D tin sweet my belly well well, when I heard the information because d way POS operator are charging people in different location made people tired of living in this country because of low money circulation. I guess, their network too will be stable for their customers to deposit and also withdraw from their account easily as usual.",

      "body": "I also got the same notification from 2 of my banks, which I kind of overlooked until I saw the one from the bank closer to my residence. I finished up what I was doing for the day and headed down to the bank, but their was really nothing serious. I was given a number by the security, which was 176, and I spent about 4 hours there already waiting for my turn. When my phone battery was running low, I decided to visit my house and power my phone. When I got back around 3 p.m., the place was already kind of empty, but the security told me they were closed for the day already. I asked how by this time it was just some minutes after 3, but they insisted I go back home and come back tomorrow if I am ready to get cash or deposit which ever one I need... I was kind of angry, but when I saw a few people coming out of the bank and I asked, If they successfully withdraw any cash and the lady told me that is kind of wasted energy, that how can she spend transportation costs of #1200 from his place to the bank and what they ended up giving her was only #5,000 that she can't withdraw more than that? I just laughed and went back home in peace, deciding not to even try it again tomorrow.",

Baba the matter na one of the worst failure of Mefiele and his team in the CBN, because the cashless policy hasfailed woefully due to it inability to reach its a desired goal, because of bad timing and lack of implementation ideas which make the CBN become a tool in the hand of the corrupt bankers and pos to make life hard for the ordinary Nigerians and cashing out massively through currency trading and what have you. -I believe that Buhari and the CBN governor have no idea of what a cashless society is and how to operate it effectively like other countries by providing 100% alternatives to cash to ease the impact of a cashless society.",

FG and CBN failed to get one basic knowledge that alot of Nigerians don't know how to use e-banking while some don't even have an account especially those Market Women. This shows that there is no proper Statistics about those using banks and citizens in the country because before any country can go into digital world they need good Data structures.",

In as much as I agree with you on the inability of the retail shops and market women to make e-transactions and also receive payments through internet banking,  the fact that those so-called market sellers have cooperated with pos to dupe Nigerians in this period of cash scarcity. -In my local market even if you want to buy something of ₦‎100 or ₦‎200 you are forced to pay a pos charge of ₦‎100 flat, and this is something that has really affected most Nigerians like myself who have the basic knowledge of banks charges because I will feel cheated each time I pay with my cards since the transfer is not going. -Poor network and delay in inter-bank settlement opened the door to corrupt individuals to manipulate the policy thereby forcing it to a crash but in due time the policy will pick up and will have its full impact on the citizens.",
