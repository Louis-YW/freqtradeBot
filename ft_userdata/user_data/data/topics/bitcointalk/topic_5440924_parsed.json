Â If that Jr Member had done any research at all they would have seen larrylegend33, erifubirugen and burky156 who all use the wallet address 158Z8VQo97ikFA2C6wWgkuhaeeqYBqbmcc are banned already. Definitely a time waster. Â (this is why Jr Members and newbies are banned from posting in the Known Alts thread.",
