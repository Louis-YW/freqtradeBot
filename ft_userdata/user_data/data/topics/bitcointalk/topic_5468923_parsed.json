Anyone from China able to chime in with info would be awesome! https://en.pingwest.com/a/8347(@mods hope this is okay to post here. Not btc related but I feel like it’s a cool insight to another side of hardware wallets )",

In the case of fiat currency in general and digital yuan in particular, one can assume with certainty that the only entity that really owns it is the government or central bank, to be more precise. This entity can censor all your digital transactions and all your accounts, regardless of where these things are located. If you keep it under the mattress on something called a 'hardware wallet' - good for you, but in this case, you are not a real owner: you just have been given a temporary permit to transact with it.",

New devices like Passport and ColdCard MK4 / Q1 appear , making obsolete the old ones, like Ledger, which brought discredit upon themself.It appears you are mixing hardware wallets with ordinary bank cards that are  bound to either fiat or digital currencies. They are not the same things.",

Wait, this data will probably be collected when issuing/purchasing a yuan wallet-card, because the developer is Postal Savings Bank of China. From a technical point of view, what is inside these wallets? But who cares?

I personally wouldn't waste any money on this and support this terrible idea of having fake hardware wallets for CBDC junk  Even if this is only meant to be a collectible item, this is indirectly supporting digital fiat currencies, CBDC and China, and I don't want to do that.Now there was one interesting old card with screen that worked in western world few decades ago, this could be considered similar like hardware wallet, but I can't remember exact name for this card right now.EDIT:Found it!It was Mondex smart card electronic cash system, that was later purchased by Mastercard.Now this would be interesting collectibles item Familiar logo?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MondexTime travel Mondex related videos:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLOZAk4mKTkhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cySU2vwQiKo",

That fact doesn't change regardless of the mechanism of transacting with such coins.I was not even expecting to see the Chinese Government issuing any new hardware for their citizens to hold their centralized currency. To me it does not make sense for other reasons: if someone is a extremely good boy in China then it is logical that person would like to secure their Yuans using hardware, because hackers exist everywhere so do scams. But the digital Yuan does not use a decentralized Ledger, which means people in reality are not the sole holder of their private cryptographic keys, obviously the bank of China has a master key or a copy of all keys in existence, unlike actual decentralized coins.If a Chinese citizen loses their keys, would not be able to just request a new copy from the bank or go through a recovery process?",

Why is this needed for digital Yyuan?

This CBDC has already tested such “curious” functions as a “timer for using” the digital yuan, for example. Will there be a digital yuan hardware wallet capable of protecting against the Chinese government?

I am absolutely sure that the recovery function will be “sewn into” the digital yuan, which will once again confirm the centralization of this entire new-fangled financial system.",

A confirmed bitcoin transaction can't be reverted or cancelled. CBDCs, just like traditional fiat, will come with a chargeback option that financial institutions can use in case of problems. So, if you get hacked, lose access, or misplace your cards, a call to the bank will fix that.",

The word hardware wallet is misused here imo, like what has been mentioned above. They'll just issue a new one and block the old one if that is necessary. There will be no seeds or keys, just a PIN or something similar to remember. If anything, I think it will just replace traditional credit cards so people can manage their fiat and digital yuan or whatever currency they have. CMIIW.",
