The bias against Bitcoin stemmed from the fact that Nigerian internet fraudsters used it to falsely boast about their income. However, it's important to recognize that Bitcoin doesn't consistently generate profits for traders throughout the year. While some victims of MMM did use Bitcoin, it gained a negative reputation even before the MMM Ponzi scheme, perhaps because it isn't as visible and is often associated with the same internet spaces where many fraudsters operate",
