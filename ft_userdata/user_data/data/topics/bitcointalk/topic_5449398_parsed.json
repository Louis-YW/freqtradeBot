Investing high capital does not have an automatic effect, it has the possibility of influencing the value but depends on the process of purchase, the amount involved and the influence of the buyer, if known.Quote from: Greggry on April 19, 2023, 07:21:48 AMbut is there some kind regulators like human agents or electronic technology who always do the regulatory price actions especially when trading bitcoin?

Sell and buy pressure is also a factor.- Jay -",

I would advise you not to bother yourself much with the accuracy of the price gauge, but the factor that decides the price is what is setting the price of Bitcoin and the currency paired with it.What happens to either of them (BTC/USD for example) could be technical (market sentiment in which the technical chart would dictate the prevailing price) or fundamental (economical factors in which the news and events surrounding or linked to Bitcoin and the paired currency, including the country spending the paired currency).Either of this or both could be detrimental or appraisal to the price of the coin as you see it moving up and down at the slightest influence.",

There are a lot of factors that could be about why they chose to sell, but it's not easy to quantify. As long as people buy and Sell the crypto, it will change in price depending on the demand.",

The driving factor for bitcoin price is the demand and supply of investors, just like what we are witnessing now that many banks are having trouble you see many people moving into bitcoin and this has increased the price. Also the bad news from either exchanges collapsing or either a threat to bitcoin or cryptocurrency by the government which prompts people to withdraw from it which leads to it dropping in price. Another factor is the mining equipment, if the mining equipment gets expensive like the ASIC tools it gets hard to have more miners and the less people mining the more fees they earn and this Also affects the bitcoin price. This ability of bitcoin not be controlled by a central body makes it an hedge against inflation because thereâ€™s no central body to regulate the interest rate like banks or governments do to our fiats",

They can do it to consider exchange wallet as their wallet to store their bitcoins.

If, all of a sudden all countries decide to ridiculously increase price of electricity, price of bitcoin can also raise because it becomes more expensive to mine new Bitcoins.",

The price of Bitcoin is primarily based on demand, but it's important to note that not all demands are organic. Whales can manipulate the market by causing it to pump and dump when they play. If you're interested in short-term trading, it's crucial to be aware of this information. However, if you plan to invest in Bitcoin for the long-term, it's sufficient to understand the basics and trust in the future of Bitcoin, which will be driven by real demand.",

Only your views please.Up to now, there are only speculations on whether there really is someone, an organization or whatever group of people behind the movement of crypto prices. While it has a possibility, we are yet to find any proof about this. On small cap coins though, there can be manipulation but on huge coins specially bitcoin it would be really difficult if the person or the group of people don't have a huge amount of capital to use in manipulating prices. Hence, we can only conclude for now that the holders and traders are the ones responsible for the price movements of the price of bitcoin.",

But in my opinion, with what is going on, we have no central authority managing and controlling the price of bitcoin. But the price of bitcoin is still manipulated by the big players instead of depending on supply and demand. The bitcoin market is still very small and without regulation, so it is more susceptible to manipulation than any other financial market.",

Even in dex projects when you have spread in the LP there are bots that take care of it as well and make some profit.This is why I have to say that it is important to keep that in mind when you are making this difference, I would highly suggest that anyone who tries to make this should be able to realize how difficult it is. Even if you want to create a new bot for it, that would be start hard, because there are ones who have been doing this and fixing every little issue for many years now.",
