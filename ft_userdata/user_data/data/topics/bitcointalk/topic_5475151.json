  "content": "Robert Kiyosaki Says Prepare for Hyperinflation — Sees Bitcoin as the 'Best Protection'Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has urged investors to prepare for hyperinflation, emphasizing that bitcoin is “your best protection.” He perceives the cryptocurrency as “people’s money,” the value of which cannot be controlled by governments.Robert Kiyosaki: Bitcoin Is Your Best ProtectionThe author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, Robert Kiyosaki, is advising investors to prepare for hyperinflation, emphasizing that he views bitcoin as the best protection. Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.In a post on social media platform X on Sunday, Kiyosaki shared that he was “just in Germany to celebrate 100 years since 1923, the hyperinflation that brought Adolf Hitler to power.” He added: “Are we about to celebrate hyperinflation too? I hope not. Yet our government leaders are the most incompetent ever.”The renowned author proceeded to recommend: “Study Germany and Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation and prepare.” Noting that “Food will always be valuable as will guns, gold, and silver,” he stressed:QuoteYet I believe bitcoin is your best protection because bitcoin is people’s money which means people control the value of bitcoin not our leaders.This was not the first time the famous author has warned about hyperinflation. In September, he explained on X: “Many people think hyperinflation means prices are going up. It means the exact opposite. Hyperinflation means the purchasing power of your money is going going. Don’t be a loser. Buy gold, silver, & bitcoin and be a winner not a loser.”Kiyosaki has been recommending gold, silver, and bitcoin for quite some time. He previously said that the three investments are the best for “unstable times.” He believes that they provide “lifelong financial security and freedom.” In April, Kiyosaki said “America is dying,” warning of the demise of the U.S. dollar.The famous author is not alone in expressing concerns about hyperinflation. Former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey predicted in 2021 that hyperinflation will soon happen in the U.S. and the world. Venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan said in March that hyperinflation is happening now. Economist Peter Schiff has also sounded the alarm on the matter, stating last year that major Fed rate hikes risk hyperinflation.Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/robert-kiyosaki-says-prepare-for-hyperinflation-sees-bitcoin-as-the-best-protection/",

It's really a tricky situation if it's about people's financial standing. It's still best that you have to work on the fundamentals to be safe, like the emergency funds and insurance things to be secured. If people would accept BTC as it is, then it would be a great asset to collect. I hope that majority of people would because I know a lot of people who doesn't want to be involved in BTC.",

It will probably also be largely affected by how all other countries percieve the USD at the time inflation occurs, most likely it will be accompanied by a devastating blow to the US economy or presidential adminiistration makes a collasel mistake etc. etc. I hope it doesn't happen anytime soon but it is very important to start preparing today!",

It's the rest of the world that should be preparing. US has all its edge to make it, they have the USD and the military power compared to the rest of the world which has no technology or industrialized economy. If I had to prepare, I would do the same, stack up BTC and Gold. I think these are just the 2 that you will need for hyperinflation. More people are talking about depression though which is more alarming.",
