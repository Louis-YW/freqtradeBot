Trading is not the same as investment, both are risky but trading is riskier. For anyone that wants to be a trader, my advice is to never depend on it, start small and use the amount of money that is lower than the amount of money that you can afford to lose to trade. If you continue to trade, you will know which step to take depending on how trading favours you. But just like gambling, never rely on trading, although trading is not gambling.",

      "body": "Does the person want to trade or he wants to invest? Investing, whilst not as complicated and risky as trading also has its own risk. You can invest while having just the basic knowledge of what you're investing in. The same cannot be said about trading. As a trader, you have to have in-depth knowledge of whatever you're trading, in this case, Crypto. Like I always say to folks on here, don't just become a trader because you just need to do something or because others are making money from it (you have no idea how much they've lost). You have to develop a liking for it. This will help you be able to take your time and learn.So my advice is, wanting to be a trader as a beginner is not a bad idea but you have to take it slow and learn. Since you are a beginner, learn like a beginner; from the scratch. assume you know nothing and start from the very beginning.",

I want to hear your opinions if it right or wrong despite it risk,so what your opinion or advise .While someone can actually invest his money in what he does not control, perhaps what he cannot control and yet he expects a reward from it. That is called investment and in the cryptocurrency industry it could be done passively.While in trading you need to understand what the market is talking about and as such be knowledgeable of the fundamental and technical analysis before you can trade.As a newbie, I'll advice that you should take out some percentage of what you want to invest with and use it to learn how to trade. If possible have a mentor, thereafter you can start trading proficiently. Also remember that you need time for this, because you might find it difficult to handle it together with your real time job if you have any.",

You should also specify if you want to trade or just be a capitalist?    Because entering this business industry is not that easy to understand, although it is easy to invest, but you must first know if the coin you choose will really have potential? Because if you don't have knowledge here, you should find out and learn first, don't make a hasty decision. It's good that it's slow, but there's sure to be a profit in the end.",

Some people who step into cryptocurrencies will just pick one. Either investing or just trading, it's to avoid confusion and also jeopardize the asset if you are doing both. Getting rekt in trading will mean pulling out the investment to continue the trade, which is not advisable to do especially if the plan for that asset is for long-term holding. Well, as long as you can handle the discipline then I do think you can manage it.",

This anticipates that investors do not panic when high fluctuations occur. many people see market movements and in the end they experience panic due to lack of knowledge, and end up selling in panic and losing money",

Others are more likely get loss with trading than get profit.It is precisely true for newbies who need to experience the cryptocurrency market first, and no way is better than try to experience it with investment and holding. By this, they can understand how this market is volatile and is sensitive with news, fud, regulations (real and proposal) and control their emotion. If they feel like they can understand it enough after few months, they can jump to trading.",

The mistake will be when you invest only on emotion without any understanding of the market. There is never an end to knowing. You must know to be successful. It is not only about studying that you need to understand about the work you will be involved in.  Suppose you don't know anything about investment but another person knows everything about investment then who's money will be at risk if you invest or the person who has enough knowledge about investment. Of course your money will be at risk. So before engaging in investment it is necessary to acquire adequate understanding and knowledge about investment.",

I want to hear your opinions if it right or wrong despite it risk,so what your opinion or advise .Trading and being an investor are different paths. but since you've mentioned that you're starting up, it's best for you to try these two and see if one works for you very well. My advice for people starting out is to avoid trading first, you need to check and see how it works properly, and initiating through investing and buying bitcoin is the best first step that you can do. It's right that you want to start and you need somewhere to start. Don't jump quickly to being a trader without knowing how risky it is which is the same also as an investor that it has got risks. But the difference is that being an investor, you can be passive and learn the market as you watch it. Eventually, when you're able to see how the market works then you'll have the idea how to trade but to give you some tip, most traders are losing.",

Trading does not guarantee that you must make profit, so taking loans to trade is not a wise thing to do even if this loan can come from family members and friends. Before you decide to want to trade, you should have the money at least to be able to trade with and the money should be the one you can loose too because losses in trading can be faster than losses when you invest in bitcoins. If you know that you cannot really bare to make losses yet, then the best thing to do is to just invest in bitcoins instead of trading for the now.",

If they're the best, it means that they're full time traders and won't manage to have time for other things like editing videos and having some time to sell those courses. Because the reality is that they're selling courses for them to earn more and not to trade and earn more. That's their other source of income because it's easier to sell course than to win trades in the market because it's difficult to have more wins in the actuality of the market. So, that's why avoid those seller gurus that sells trading courses because most of their resources can be found online for free.",
