  "content": "Coldkey Raffle â€” 1st EditionWe are proud to announce to you today the 1st Coldkey Raffle.We wanted to make a fun Collectible with a quirk and this one comes with an event. There is 256 Tickets, each one has a unique Private Key.Sales will remain open until the 15th of December 2022â€” OR â€”Until the 256 tickets have been sold.Each Ticket requires a 0.0025BTC funding.100% of the funding goes to a Prize Pool.When sales are over, we will organize a good old fashioned Bitcointalk raffle.Usually tickets go from 0 to F (hex) which represents 16 different tickets,we will go from 00 to FF and this represents the set of 256 physical tickets.I will pick a block that will come up around 2 weeks after the sales ended.This will let enough time for last shipments to arrive.Random tickets will be picked using the last two digits of a Bitcoin block to be generated.A list of all the addresses associated with 2 hex digits will soon be available.100% of the Prize pool is redistributed.It will be held at the following address : >> bc1qr88xt0jurmpvv93l66zquk5srkqntpva9ug5m4 <<The Prize structure is as follows :Winner Payout \\\\ Number of tickets playing0-4041-8081-120121-160161-2561st50%40%40%33%30%2nd25%25%23%21%18%3rd12.5%13%13%12%11%4th12.5%10%8%8%8%5thX6%6%6%6%6thX6%4%4.5%4.5%7thXX3%3.5%3.5%8thXX2%2.5%2.5%9thXX1%2.5%2.5%10thXXX2%2%11th - 15thXXX1%1%16th - 24thXXXX0.875%A few precisions :How does this release works : Each Ticket has only an ID.No serial number, and it doesn't display a public address.We will hold a Raffle event and the ghost of Satoshi will pick the winning ticket.The addresses will be funded accordingly.You will need to peel the ticket and redeem it to check if it holds a prize.Each ticket can win only once.I keep track of which Ticket ID is assigned to which order.That way and for transparency purposes only, I'm able to tell which customer got winning tickets. I will not be releasing this information.About the Physical Coldkey :We are not fully satisfied by the quality of these Tickets.Our laminate layer is too strong and doesn't allow to easily break the card into individual parts.We have some loose ones, but unfortunately some of these might have some minor imperfections.Like a rough edge, having a straight cut but at an angle, etc â€¦We will experiment with more physical cards and different laminate layers before releasing any more Coldkey that splits. Orders for multiple tickets will contain uncut \"tri-cards\".(If you get 8 tickets, you will get 2 full uncut cards and 2 loose tickets)Price :- 25 â‚¬ per Coldkey Raffle Ticket.

I will not be releasing this information.what I do not get yet (maybe I'm misunderstanding the rules): how is the respective hex assigned to each ticket-ID?I understand and appreciate that you will not release the information; however, also for transparency purposes only (  ): in the unlikely case that not all tickets are sold, will you disclose in advance which IDs are not taken and will not be assigned to a hex-spot?Hey haloxon ! Let me explain a bit more in depth.There is no association between hex and ticket IDs.A different hex will be assigned randomly to each public address.Only I know which address is on which ticket ID.I'll update the thread very soon with the list of 256 addresses, with hex and status (\"In play\" // \"Inactive\").Hopefully this will make things more straightforward. When a ticket is sold, I will update the list and change the address from \"Inactive\" to \"In play\".Unsold tickets will remain \"Inactive\" and will be destroyed.The status of the event will be updated regularly. I absolutely understand your concern. This is for this exact reason I chose to keep track of what ticket IDs are shipped in individual orders.",

      "body": "Quote from: haloxon on October 25, 2022, 11:02:59 AMthanks for the further explanation. so this means, just by knowing the own ticket-ID and the blockchain-picked hex, one will still not know if s/he has won or not, but only by peeling the ticket, meaning every ticket-holder has to peel its coldkey - is my understanding correct? Yes, that is correct. :-)This was the desired outcome.This also implies that if the big prize doesn't move from it's address, it means the winning ticket most likely hasn't been peeled yet. What are your thoughts about it ?Wow Â  Already 36 tickets sold !We now have 0.09BTC in the Prize Pool escrow address Lots of players means bigger prizes.Come join the fun. Â  All that is required to win is to hold one ticket.",
