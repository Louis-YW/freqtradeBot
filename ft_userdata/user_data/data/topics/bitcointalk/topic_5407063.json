  "content": "Singapore will not want to be left behind in the bid to becoming a world class Bitcoin hub and I feel it would be a bit difficult because although they are a Bitcoin friendly country, they have been ravaged by the deadly coronavirus and has affected the growth of their economy.The country has been like an umbrella to companies who have been hiding under regulatory barriers in their state.The Monetary Authority of Singapore have stated their intentions of making the State worthy of being called a hub for crypto investors and make it safe for trader to function without them being scared of losing their coins.A move to releasing a new regulatory plan by MAS against crypto firms are set to begin next month and although there have been stricter regulations prior, the country seemed to have recorded a massive 82 deals with a combined worth at $1.48 billion dollars in 2021.According to TripleA, 82% of the country's 5,230,000 that own BTC hold it, while 39% see it as an investment assets, 25% see it as a store of value and a small 12% see it as money. triple a linkWith a highly developed economy, ranked as the most open in the world and amongst the least corrupt. With all this positives going for them, can they attain the status of being a BTC hub and even becoming a BTC like El Salvador? https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/singapores-central-bank-to-release-bitcoin-crypto-regulation",

One bitcoin hub that hasn't fully adopted bitcoin as legal tender and showing its potential right now and being liked by these companies is Dubai. Well, I'm sure Singapore is a go-to country for most companies but they have to adopt as well and change some ruling for them to be friendly to these companies.",

A country with a great economy can be a big factor in cryptomarket, if they are considering this to accept and make legal, probably many will adopt.",

What they plan to do next month is:Quote“We will explain our position on cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, blockchains, tokenization, smart contracts, digital assets, etc. – their risks and opportunities; shortcomings and potential,” Menon continued. “We will set out how our developmental and regulatory approaches will work in harmony to achieve the vision of Singapore as an innovative and responsible digital asset hub.”We would have to wait for Singapore to explain what their position is on all that, the news says the regulations will make Singapore a 'digital asset hub', we can't believe that when we haven't seen the regulations; and even when they are out one thing that is constant is that regulations might be good and work for centralized cryptocurrencies and services, but not for bitcoin that is decentralized, and i do not know how it will make them a 'bitcoin hub'.",

El Salvador though not economically rich, it officially recognized bitcoin as a legal tender making it a very healthy nation for bitcoin investors and believers.",

While the claim to fame for nation's like china is a deregulated economic environment.Singapore has a better and more developed tech sector, in contrast to el salvador. They could do a better job with crypto mass adoption and bitcoin incentives if the state were inclined to take that path. I would be interested to see what happens if a country like singapore forked dash or another token and adopted it as their CBDC under centralized control. In a way that implemented significant technical obstacles to prevent their CBDC crypto token from being devalued or hyperinflated. That type of arrangement could engender trust and widespread adoption. As it would combine the best elements of fiat with the best elements of crypto. Hybridization.",

All that's left to be done is to make things a reality and a few touches to their regulation and they're golden. Singapore, being the advanced country they are, can easily achieve this especially if their citizens are also in the said plan. I just hope that they do not go down a path wherein they would want total control over cryptocurrencies within their borders, much like what China is doing right now.",

They must match their words with actions. Although Singapore is a friendly Bitcoin nation but there are reports of clamping down on crypto companies by the government of Singapore. There are also indications that the government is mulling strict regulatory demands that might force companies in the crypto space to lose their privacy and decentralization.",

Even El Salvador which is a lot smaller than Singapore, knows what they can't do something right now about this, but they are on their way to build a \"bitcoin city\" which would basically host all the big crypto nations in the world.If you offer them zero taxes, and you give them all the crypto availability you can, then there is no reason why they shouldn't have an office there at least. Would be like wall street but only for crypto instead of stocks. This means that every nation will go after that title, it means more business for them and their people and they will do their best, but not everyone can win.",

As far as i know there are plenty of altcoin projects who have been choosing singapore as their headquarters caused by the regulation was not so strict like another country. This country is very friendly as long as you can comply with its regulation. That's why singapore has become one of favourite place for the new startup to build their office.
