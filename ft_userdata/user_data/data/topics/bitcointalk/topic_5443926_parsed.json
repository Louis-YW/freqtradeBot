  "content": "So it all started with me sharing a photo of the Bitcoin logo with a friend of mine.The conversation went like this:Him: Bitcoin is old stuff, try ETHMe: Old but Gold, Eth is centralized shit.Him: Ethereum is better now in terms of sustainability.Me: (Sent him a voice mail that says): POS AKA proof of stake is centralized, so they know your information and your holdings. On the other hand, POW AKA proof of work is decentralized, as proven by Bitcoin. And it depends on people working on it to earn something. So no one will ever have control over it. But as for ETH, if the government or any developers choose to, they can control it at any time. Because the information about the developers are public information. But till to this day, no one knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. That makes it safe from being getting centralized. So as long as you keep holding BTC you are safe, your privacy is safe and also your assets. Him: Still in POW, you can't earn/mine more of it if you don't have enough horsepower, most Bitcoin is mined by big farms, and it is energy hungry.Me: Mining is not the only way to acquire Bitcoin, you can buy it with fiat and trade to make profits. And one thing to keep in mind that 1 BTC = 1 BTCHim: Yet you need energy to mine that in the first place. And proof of stake is much more energy efficient. Almost 98%. And when all the BTC is being mined, no one will have an incentive to use so much to run a mining farm to write the blockchain then, how would the transaction be recorded? Each transaction in ETH blockchain is less energy hungry. Me: People are competing in order to mine BTC for themselves. But when the competition is over, it won't be that much complicated and energy hungry. And development of technology will come up with a solution to tackle that problem. Maybe one automated service powerful enough to write all the records on the blockchain.So the arguments went on for a long time. I would like to summarize that in some short words. After that, I told him that even it is very useful and could be use with less energy, you need to think about the centralized matter. No matter how good it is, if it's centralized, anything could happen to it at any time. So I gave him the scam regarding FTX exchange and how bad centralized could get. Also the involvement of governments and the probability of getting hacked. We went back and forth about many things. I guess I was able to give him enough information and was able to explain in a way so that he could understand. The fact about high energy consumption  and how it will end someday. So in the end he told me that, the word side of crypto is that it's whole existence is fully based on human trust. So i told him that BTC is only pegged to USD in order to trade and make money. But the value will always be 1 BTC = 1 BTC. As long as you hold BTC, you owe that much BTC. So now he thinks that BTC is an asset like house/ land. So I told him that, yes, you can think it that way. As people always says BTC if for future investment. And people only hate BTC because they didn't have the chance to use it in order to know its importance. But at the end he said, \"I am still not convinced BTC is perfect.\"So I said nothing is perfect, but if you have to choose from one, you should go for BTC.So that's the whole story. Please point out anything that maybe I am wrong about here, as I don't fully know about BTC myself. And yes, I asked him if I could share this personal conversation and he agreed. And one more thing, I would like to ask the seniors, what kind of examples or information I should provide him in order for him to fully understand it? Share your knowledge here so that I can show him.",

In a PoS network worth $100 billion where 10% of tokens are staked, the $100 billion network can be taken over by any party able to allocate $10 billion. All the attacker would have to do is send $10 billion in tokens to a staking contract.In a Proof-of-Work network, capital, labor, and efficient allocation of both are required to execute an attack on the network. Attacking a network with $10 billion of security would require purchasing ASICs, acquiring space and energy contracts to mine at a larger scale than the entire network, and acquiring and deploying the labor to execute the attack. If such an attack were underway, the entire network would likely be made aware ahead of time by the immense demand for ASICs and electricity.[1] https://river.com/learn/proof-of-work-pow-vs-pos-proof-of-stake/",

I think mining companies will try to make their device more efficient and we can finally counter the slander that makes it look like Bitcoin is inefficient.

      "body": "Seems like your friend doesn't know how mining works.The typical lack of education view on Bitcoin is \"a ton of energy is required for each transaction\" but of course that isn't at all how it works. Transactions and amount of energy from mining don't have anything to do with one another.Your friend seems to think if less energy is used once there are no more block rewards beyond tx fees that will mean transactions won't get processed anymore haha. Sadly this is probably what most people think.You could also point out the huge benefits for society that Bitcoin mining has, which Ethereum PoS doesn't have because there is no mining anymore on Ethereum. Specifically,1. Bitcoin allows society to use stranded energy which naturally will be renewable energy which will increase the production of renewables which will help lower their cost.2. Also bitcoin mining the past few years has started to take place at the actual power plants. This is the HUGE benefit to society that Bitcoin mining provides. The world wastes something like 30% of the energy that is produced just because to keep power available power plants need to produce far in excess of what is needed because power consumption of society changes on any given day or depending on the time of day or depending on the weather or events or whatever. There is MASSIVE power waste built into the system to keep it running. It is very likely in the future most Bitcoin mining will be done directly at power plants consuming the excess completely wasted energy, and these miners will get it very cheap because the power plant wouldn't make any money on it otherwise, which will mitigate a lot of the worry over something bad happening to bitcoin when block rewards are gone because mining should be a lot cheaper in the future. It also makes energy production far more lucrative, meaning the world can build out more energy production which is beneficial for society. Also if many Bitcoin mining companies choose to only operate on renewable energy this will make producing renewable energy far more lucrative than fossil fuels so this, much more than the first point mentioned above, will be a driving factor for spreading renewable energy in the world. And whenever more energy is being consumed from these power plants they can shut off the mining machines so miners don't get in the way of energy being sent to society. Most people think Bitcoin mining is bad and is wasteful and is bad for the environment, if everyone just understood this one paragraph here everyone would be praising how amazing Bitcoin mining is not just for Bitcoin but for the world.Also note that in a world in which much of mining uses all that wasted energy that means extra energy isn't even being used for mining, its just already produced wasted energy. So if most of bitcoin mining ends up being at renewable power plants and stranded renewables that means Bitcoin mining will be running off otherwise-wasted clean energy so the idea that Bitcoin would be using too much energy or that PoS is better because it uses less energy would be a completely nonsensical statement because Bitcoin wouldn't be using any 'extra' power.NOT using energy is actually a negative because PoS provides nothing valuable to society while Bitcoin mining has huge benefits to society precisely because it does run on energy.You could also point out how the energy use is always balanced out because mining creates an economy in bitcoin for miners so there is never too much energy used for bitcoin mining because by definition it would then be unprofitable. Energy use always stays in the range of profitability meaning it is always in balance to the economic value that is being created.You could also point how Ethereum is centralized by PoS rewarding those who already have the most Ether - very similar to how rich people keep getting richer in world because the system is geared toward more opportunities being given to the rich. And if you're already rich you're likely going to be less likely to need to sell your staked/earned Ether whereas the average person will need to sell as a source of income so the Eth rich get richer through Ethereum. Whereas in Bitcoin there is no staking, the only way to get more Bitcoin is to put in the resources to mine or to put in the resources to buy more Bitcoin. Rich or poor are just as able to hold on to their Bitcoin if they are investing excess money in it.You could point out the centralization of Ethereum's pre-mine versus Bitcoin's mining that distributed Bitcoin over many years, whereas like half of the current Ethereum supply was sold on day 1 in its pre-mine.You could point out how Ethereum is essentially controlled by Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation which is very centralizing while Bitcoin is an open source project and always has been since Satoshi left the community within a couple years of creating it.I actually don't know if Eth2 changed how nodes work on Ethereum but if they work the same way then there are a much smaller number of expensive and hard to operate archival nodes on Ethereum whereas Bitcoin as many more full nodes, and this is because Ethereum has to handle so much data so it is much more centralized, and in fact at least once when AWS went down something like 30% of the Ethereum network was down because many nodes just run on AWS because they are too hard to run oneself, meaning much of the network relies on Amazon lol.",

The consensus mechanism's efficiency is based on validating transactions...not energy consumption per transaction. It's still a stupid argument to make to this day anyway.

Everything is open source and the things can be openly discussed and criticized. The typical CEO role that you are referring to is also non-existent in Ethereum in my opinion. If Satoshi showed up tomorrow, verifying he still has the wallets' keys and proposes a change to the protocol, I wonder how much resistance there would be against proposed changes (depends on the change of course, but let's assume it's controversial).",
