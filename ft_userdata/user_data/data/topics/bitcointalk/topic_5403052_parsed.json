  "content": "As the projects are in presale and have not officially been launched, token prices are low as the project uses this opportunity to raise funds and build a community. This is just as beneficial to investors as they only need to pay a small amount for tokens, which is likely to increase after launch, allowing an opportunity to profit over time.

Token issuers are making use of launchpad platforms to reach ready-made markets of decentralized exchange users. For their part, IDO participants are keen to buy up tokens of the most promising-looking projects while they’re still available at the lowest prices.One such platform is AdLunam aims to transform this whole industry with their unique Engage to Earn model that benefits both investors and project team.Learn more: adlunam.cc",
