  "content": "Does this happen to anyone else? You're trying to explain to someone, perhaps a close relative, what crypto actually is? And they come up with all of these strange/sill ideas? These are my top 3, I would love to hear everyone else's.1. You can only buy whole bitcoins. I guess this one makes sense, if you never knew anything about crypto. After all, one usually buys whole stocks and bonds, and whole other things. But I have had many conversations where the person says something like \"yeah I would love to get bitcoin but I don't have (insert whatever the current price is).2. It's a ponzi scheme/ tulip bubble/ some other kind of scam or shenanigans. I think this one comes straight from the msm. Even prominent financial news outlets regularly print erroneous, or purposely false and misleading information. But, if you actually know what crypto is, the idea that it is the same thing as a ponzi scheme or the tulip bubble is just silly. It's like the exact opposite of those things.3. I would love to buy some Bitcoin, but (whatever the current price is) is just too expensive for magic internet money. This one I think is due to people feeling like they missed out at being an early adopter. These are the types that tend to say things like \"gee I wish I had bought amazon when it was a few pennies a share\". But whatever the current price, it's too much. It could literally be $5 a Bitcoin and they would say it was too much. I get it, they don't really understand what crypto is, but it's still a bit silly if you ask me.What are your favorites?",

Yes it was in 2018, but I didn't think much of it despite the doubts about how this currency has such a high value. I never thought this bitcoin was a ponzi scheme because I never found a single word about guaranteed return x within a certain timeframe.I don't know what the dumbest mistake I thought about bitcoin was, but maybe I'm just a little hesitant to spend a lot of money in 2018-2020 buying bitcoin.",

I get it, they don't really understand what crypto is, but it's still a bit silly if you ask me.What are your favorites?I don't think, everybody can get it right at the same time to buy Bitcoin and hold for future purpose, because there are some people in the community waiting for the price of Bitcoin to decrease to $5k before they can buy and hold, while there are some people are using this bear market to buy Bitcoin and hold, because they believed that the price will not decrease more than $15k before it will increase higher to a level were those that invested in Bitcoin some months ago to start earning from their investment. Crypto is different from centralized currency, because crypto is unpredictable, it can pump higher to enable people to make a good profits and it can also dump to make people to purchase for future purpose in the community. I believe, this is the best opportunity for you to buy Bitcoin and hold so that you will be part of those that will smile when the price of Bitcoin increase higher in the market.",

Not realizing that there are more risks investing in altcoins particularly if you chose those new altcoins in the market as they mostly end up as big scams. But if you go for established altcoins, yes you can be profitable but not as huge as bitcoin.",

To benefit properly from bitcoin and the market fluctuations you need to have a substantial amount of bitcoin to properly gain from the market when the value of bitcoin goes up. If you have very little fractions and you are holding on to them without planning on how to get more I'm sorry to say but that bitcoin cannot make you rich or wealthy in that case.",

And after all these years there are still people who aren't into Bitcoin despite the fact that the market showed what is the price in bearish today. Saying they missed the boat but this price in bear market today was the ATH price where they complain it's too expensive. They really missed their chances to buy because they think owning 1 BTC is thing and having sats is not or they just don't know what is sats.",

Yes, I think the news has made too many stories about bitcoin for crime. I think probably it is not very anonymous for governments who know how to find the right info. Regular money is better, because the block chain is public and permanent, there is no way to track dollars sitting somewhere hidden in a basement.",
