Since Merit is not limited to prevent spammers from joining Bounty Campaigns, Merit was also introduced to encourage more interesting content and Merit Sources are advised to facilitate and reward good content, while discouraging bad, uninteresting or flawed posts such like Shitposts. I’ve tried to incentivize a good posting quality in our German local board by my 1miau Merit criteria, where I’ve outlined points resulting in Merits and points making it much less likely to receive some Merits. Some examples: Merit Contributions (translated) Quote from: 1miau on September 12, 2020, 08:53:06 PM You can get massively (more) Merit by following simple rules: For new topics: Presentation of guides / tutorials / insightful topics where many people could be interested in Innovative giveaways Comments in existing topics: Is your comment helpful for OP? Contributing interesting content and providing insights instead of just rehashing what’s already been said / uninteresting fluff / guessing needlessly For new and existing topics: Dividing your article / topic into meaningful sections, using sub-headlines, highlighting important parts. Nobody wants to read a text block of 10-15 consecutive lines Exposing and removing spam and scam [1]Using pictures / tables / lists, to visualize complex content [3]Good Memes. Anti-Merit-Offenses (translated)Quote from: 1miau on September 12, 2020, 08:53:06 PMAnti-Merit-Offenses will reduce your chance for Merit massively: Unnecessary use of \"Denglish\"*. Spreading fake news or badly researched content Spreading unserious stuff Spamming text blocks Pronouncing nonsense gibberish like \"Dachbereich\" (\"Roof area\"), use appropriate wording instead. Excessive advertising for dangerous (centralized / scammy) Shitcoins, such like Ripple, Tron or Libra (Facebook) Flawed identification of sources (plagiarism) for your quoted content. Please use at least Bitcointalk’s \"quote\" function and add a link, where the text is copied from. If your article is (almost) entirely copied or translated, add a link and hint above (not below) your topic or it might be considered as „Merit fishing“ (because you’ve just copied / translated the content and it’s not yours.  [2]Shitposts (according to Relnarien)Begging for Merit for shitposts (according to Relnarien)Begging for MeritBad / unnecessary Memes or GIFs (we are not in Las Vegas)*\"Unnecessary Denglish\" is an unnecessary and excessive mixing of English + our native language or even laziness where the whole word is not translated in our native language, even if there's a common translation available. So, to avoid \"unnecessary Denglish\", we should always evaluate if there's a common and (relatively widely accepted) native word available in our language. When there's no common word available in our language (like \"Blockchain\" (probably, it's different for each language)), then it's not \"unnecessary Denglish\" (due to a lack of common word for that in our native language). If there's a common native word available in our native language, this native word should be applied instead of \"Denglish\", if not applied it's \"unnecessary Denglish\". But, since it’s unfortunately not enough to increase posting quality in a meaningful way in our local board, because some people are extremely lazy and saturated from their weekly shitposts rewards, I’m planning a new campaign where I’ll be trying to improve posting quality a lot more. By doing so, we are planning to increase self-awareness of how a good post should be composed / what should be avoided. We are targeting several points: Presenting interesting and well researched contentPresenting your content in a way that people can read it easilyAvoiding meaningless shitpostsAvoiding illiterate gibberish, write in a proper and good local languageAvoiding useless „Denglish“ / „Romglish“, where English and local languages (German (Deutsch) and Romanian) are unnecessarily mixed. When there’s a certain word existing in your local language, please use your local language for this word, not EnglishAvoiding pyramid-quotesAvoiding off-topic / trolling / derailing threads…Most points are very easy to follow but still some people are far too lazy…….Commonly recognized rulesFor any self-moderated topic, where a decent posting quality is desirable, we have established the commonly recognized rules, which are a good standard for self-moderated posts. When a reference is made to the commonly recognized rules, the following rules are meant: The commonly recognized rules apply in this topic:No off-topicNo pyramid quotes No unnecessary Denglish / RomglishNo posts of superficial quality (shitposts) No defamations No unnecessary memes / GIFsNo spreading of lies No trolling Please pay attention to good and correct German / Romanian and correct spellingIf a reference is made to the commonly recognized rules, the topic will be moderated according to these rules. The commonly recognized rules are common property. Translations to local boardsSince our campaign is dedicated to local boards, I would be happy if you can bring our campaign to your local board and add your own points, relevant for your local board. Important: Part of the task is to review our German and Romanian topics and create your own topic dedicated to your local board, not a translation of the Meta announcement. As a reference, your topic should be unique and customized for your local board. German: link will follow in late October / early SeptemberRomanian: link will follow in late October / early SeptemberOur topics are not written yet but will be up in a few weeks. You can already apply below by reserving your language, just submit a post: Code:I would like to reserve my local language and post a translation in my [name local board here]. I hereby confirm to have read this post about uniqueness of each translation to be customized for each local board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409763.msg63121802#msg63121802I noticed the following issues inside this local board, which can be improved by translating this topic: [issue 1, issue 2, issue 3 etc.]I have the following resources which I'll include in the translation and which address the problems from my local board: [resource 1, resource 2, resource 3 etc.](-- last sentence can look also like this: I did not find any existent topics which address the issues from my local board, but I will write a topic addressing these problems -- in this case the new topic should be ready before the translation is done.)#Proof of JOINLanguage: Bitcointalk Account:Reserved TranslationsTranslationsRomanian - GazetaBitcoinGerman - 1miauRussian - zasad@Pakistan - HONDACD125Nigeria (Naija) - Hatchyবাংলা (Bengali) - Learn BitcoinPolski - cyganEspañol (Spanish) - PorfiriiTürkçe (Turkish) - Pulsar77Community supportOur campaign is intended to be a very broad and international campaign, so it would be useful if we can present it at our local boards as a campaign supported by many community members.

      "body": "It is a great honor for me to collaborate with 1miau on this matter -- improving posting quality for local boards.I noticed that, as time passes, more and more people have poor knowledge about their own language. For various reasons (people read less, educate themselves less, teachers are not so good or passionate as they were in the past, lack of possibility of attending school, apparition of Generation McDonald's -- followed soon by Generation FaceBook etc. etc. etc.) many don't give 2 cents anymore on speaking and writing correctly in their own language. Many can't even correctly associate verbs with the subject of the sentence (e.g. using a plural form for verb and a singular form for the subject).No matter the reason for this, it's something terribly wrong! Nobody asks you to know a foreign language as a native but, at least, everybody should correctly use the native language.I am a perfectionist myself. Besides trying to spell and speak correctly in my own language (which is Romanian) I also pay a lot of attention to punctuation. To the order of words inside a sentence. Sometimes, a comma may change entirely the meaning of a sentence. Same about a missing comma. Also, in many times, I noticed people which do not use the question mark when needed and, as a consequence, what they say sounds like an affirmation and not as a question. Example: when someone wants to ask you to go out with him and he says \"Come with me\", instead of \"Come with me?\". It's a huge difference, as in the first form it sounds like an order.However, I understand that not all can master their own language. But, at least, they should speak and spell correctly.Mixing words from the native language with English words also became a big problem. In Romanian, we call this as Romglish. It is also what 1miau names as \"Denglish\". At first, people started this outrageous method of tormenting their native language as it seemed something \"cool\". In Romania, at least. They believed they were cool for mixing Romanian words with English ones. But they were not cool at all, only ridiculous. Yet, this trend continued and, in time, it became more and more adopted, until it became a vice.I have to admit myself that even I, although I struggle a lot to avoid it, have this sin. I try hard to avoid Romglish yet, sometimes, without even realizing this, I am mixing Romanian words with English ones. It happens rarely, but it happens. It's so hard to quit a bad habit, a vice. But it's always important to try, to improve yourself.All the above mentioned facts occur also inside the forum and people use their poor skills of their language for writing posts with poor or zero value, just for reaching the quota for the campaign they are part of. In some occasions they also received merits for such posts. This should change.This is the purpose of this action initiated by 1miau and I second him. I encourage DT users, Merit Sources, Campaign Managers, moderators and all other users to not support this behavior anymore. It is a vouch for having a better forum!",

But, As LoyceV already pointed out, I don't think DefaultTrust has anything to do with this campaign. Or Do you offer Positive feedback to those people who participate and do good? If I am not wrong, You already offer to merit their posts if they improve the post quality and follow the other things you pointed out. I am confused; why are you seeking for support of DT members? It would make sense if you sought Support from Merit sources because they can help evaluate the posts if they understand the language.By asking DT Support, I see two points here;1. Offer Positive feedback who follow this Campaign (This will be inaccurate)2. Get Trust Inclusion who follow this Campaign. (This is too)I hope I am wrong.",

It is and that's a very sad thing.  But how can we try to improve posting quality in addition? I've tried to come up with various ideas and the one presented here is what should achieve the most impact, in addition to my 1miau Merit criteria. Even if we can improve posting quality only a little bit, it would be beneficial for everyone.  Quote from: LoyceV on August 13, 2022, 05:52:55 PMQuoteDT supportDefaultTrust has nothing to do with post quality:Quote from: theymos on January 30, 2020, 09:13:15 PMThe system is for handling trade risk, not for flagging people for good/bad posts/personalities/ideas.That's true, DT has nothing to do with posting quality and it was not intended like that from my site, so maybe you got my intention a little but wrong but how do you measure support from (quality posters / established accounts) for an idea? Merit? (I don't know if Merit should be used for \"supporting\" something and a Merit coming from someone like you has more weight that a Merit coming from a scammer)Established accounts? (how to measure that)So, I was going for DT as a general set of established accounts, nominated from a decentralized way of determining \"good judgement for leaving trust\". That was what I saw coming closest to \"measuring support\". If you have a better idea, how to measure \"support\", feel free to share it here.  Quote from: AnotherAlt on August 13, 2022, 06:31:19 PMBy asking DT Support, I see two points here;1.

I'm not asking for positive feedbacks or inclusions, I'm asking if people are supporting our campaign (\"this is a good campaign\"), nothing more. So when you are \"supporting\" our campaign, you are just saying \"it's a good campaign, I agree to the goals of the campaign because it's beneficial for the forum\". Doesn't involve any feedbacks or inclusions. So, for our campaign, people can either - support (it's a good campaign)- oppose (it's a bad campaign)- be neutral (it's not useful)",

They were always around to recommend their useless shitcoin bags to newcomers without going too deep into it, why these coins should be bought. But even with going deep, why Tron or EOS are good coins it would be a violation of my Merit criteria. There are simply no reasons why such crap coins should be bought. Tron is just marketing hype, EOS is centralized an dead, Solana is frequently not working and BCH and BSV are fraud coins. But in Altcoin Discussion / Altcoin Speculation, the most annoying shitposters are very quick to recommend a random centralized shitcoin or defend useless shitcoins when these flawed coins are being called out.  Quote from: The Pharmacist on August 15, 2022, 03:24:16 AMI'm glad you defined \"Denglisch\", because I had no idea what that is, and the link to the wiki page is all in German (which I can't read).Oh, sorry. I've missed to remove the German link, when it was copied from our local board. Here it is: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denglisch\"Denglish\" is, when people are too lazy to translate properly and are using English words instead, even when there's a known German translation for. QuoteDenglisch is a term describing the increased use of anglicisms and pseudo-anglicisms in the German language. It is a portmanteau of the German words Deutsch (German) and Englisch. The term is first recorded from 1965.Same for \"Romglish\" but native language is Romanian. Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 15, 2022, 08:31:06 AMI've started seeing too many guides/tutorials made by people who don't know the matter deep enough, hence they're full of mistakes misguiding newbies into making errors.So I strongly advise those who are unsure about their new topics, add at least a \"please tell about the errors so I can update the first post\" disclaimer, to avoid harsh replies.Very good point, I'l add it soon and try to include it into a single point- researching properly- correcting errors when detected by other Forum members / via proofreadingI'm not sure if someone would add a disclaimer, some members are even forgetting to link their sources properly or hide them to receive more Merit (when Merit sources are tricked to think all the text is written by OP itself)Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 15, 2022, 08:31:06 AMSo:Code:I’m in support of improving posting quality as suggested by 1miau and GazetaBitcoin.but I say this not as DT, but as user of bitcointalk.Quote from: AnotherAlt on August 15, 2022, 05:47:52 AMWell, If this is the case. You may want to ask for support from every forum member and not only from the DT network. When someone supports your initiative means he has to improve his posts as well. I support your initiative. Quote from: Pmalek on August 15, 2022, 08:53:10 AMI have to admit that I am guilty of the occasional CROnglish here and there as well. But that's just because I have gotten used to the English terminology so much that certain native words feel like they have been butchered. It sounds like someone forced you to come up with a local translation no matter how ridiculous it sounds. I support any initiative that makes the forum a better place and improves the posting quality. But I am also afraid that the forum culture is slowly dying and the new generations are all about posting short, grammatically incorrect, meme-filled responses. Many simply don't care.  I've changed my OP from \"DT member support\" to \"community member support\". Should be easier to understand now and cause fewer misunderstandings.  We appreciate your support.  But for formal reasons, we need to have you posting our code.  Too many have said \"I generally support\" or similar, which is hard to know if it's just a statement or a real \"support\". I don't want to cause misunderstandings here.  So, if you are in support plz use code, Sir.  Code:I’m in support of improving posting quality as suggested by 1miau and GazetaBitcoin.I've only added NeuroticFish so far. Quote from: Pmalek on August 15, 2022, 08:53:10 AMI have to admit that I am guilty of the occasional CROnglish here and there as well. Well, time for improvements.  Quote from: Pmalek on August 15, 2022, 08:53:10 AMBut I am also afraid that the forum culture is slowly dying and the new generations are all about posting short, grammatically incorrect, meme-filled responses. Many simply don't care.  Very true, my impression is especially when some people are saturated in their current signature campaign and are getting their payments week after week, the posting quality is slowly degrading because payments are still coming safely. And when everyone is posting a bit shittier every week, it doesn't even affect your position negatively. Because every second invested for a more detailed reply is a wasted second. Proofreading? - No time for that...I have noticed that trend in our local board and hopefully our campaign can remind everyone to review their posting style.",

      "body": "There's generally a pattern to a users posts. Of course, this is a generalisation, and therefore this isn't concrete. However, users start off with slightly less quality posts when they sign up, and over time they'll learn the standards of the forum, and get sucked in to the community, and therefore want to actually contribute. Now, guides, campaigns, and all of this is all well, and good. However, there's a difference between a user that wants to learn, and those that don't. Take the altcoin section as an example; there's plenty of users there that don't care about learning, and no matter how much you push what's acceptable, and isn't acceptable on the forum, they aren't going to listen. Even moderation doesn't cure it, they'll just register a new account. theymos has put evil points associated with IP addresses to try, and avoid this issue, but there's ways around it, and the spammers know it. Most of these types of users only care about money, they seem to join every bounty available, and in some instances have setup bots to reply to them. These users aren't teachable, no matter how good the campaign is. Then there's the users which are new, maybe to the forum or the language, and we can't discriminate against them for using poor structuring of sentences, because eventually these types of users might actually become some of the most valuable to the community. I for one don't have perfect English, for anyone that's from the UK, you might be familiar with the term \"Wenglish\". Also, my grammar definitely isn't perfect. So, my point is we can put all the information we want out there, and I do believe it's already out there to some degree, but the audience matters. Those that read, and take into consideration those threads, are probably going to become good quality users anyhow. Whereas, those that aren't interested, and therefore more likely to be a spamming kind, aren't. Therefore, much of the effort is lost on the types of users you're talking about. Obviously, translations, and all of that is a little different. However, I don't think we should be expecting perfect native language either. Since, depending on where you're in that country, depends on how you structure, and use the language. North Welsh for example, is a lot different to Welsh in the South, and I mean different words for the same thing, kind of different, and not just the way they speak.So, while I definitely do appreciate any proactive way of increasing the quality of the forum, don't expect miracles. A campaign is only going to help those that are interested in the first place. Moderation is still the best thing we have for dealing with spam, even if that isn't always efficient, due to the reasons mentioned above. There's also the issue of signature campaigns, and local sections. A lot of the time it appears that the signature campaign manager doesn't understand the languages (almost certain with the amount they accept) that are being posted, but still accepting that for payment. So, we either need a better review process or multiple managers that are natives of that language for it to be accepting in a signature campaign, if that makes sense.Also, worth noting; if you find a lot of spam in your local section, report it. If it doesn't get handled then that shows theymos that a moderator is needed in that section. Just because it doesn't get handled this time around, doesn't mean its meaningless, since it does indicate there's a need for either a dedicated moderator or an additional moderator depending on the workload.",

      "body": "I support this campaign, it is a good campaign. One of my reasons of supporting this campaign is that I read an article somewhere outside this forum and understood that some people had to quit this forum due to high level of shit post and spamming that had happend in the forum. I couldn't justify their action of quiting the forum because it got messy by shitposters not until I was involved in a 5 aside football in my new neighbourhood. Football that I enjoy playing became a nightmare because my team mates were not anything close to good. They could not trap the ball, they give away 80% possession, poor position to recieve passes. Within 15 minutes, I became frustrated and left the pitch. It was after the football incident that I understood how other people's activities could make you to even quit or hate what you are passionate of doing.Though, I wasn't around when there was no merit system, but I understood that things were worse than it is now. Meanwhile, this good campaign can only affect positively those who are sincerely interested in becoming good users of the forum. Those users who are poised in posting shits and getting paid would not benefit from this.Code:I’m in support of improving posting quality as suggested by 1miau and GazetaBitcoin.",

But please make sure you express your suppprt in the format mentioned by 1miau in OP.Quote from: Pmalek on August 15, 2022, 08:53:10 AM@GazetaBitcoin Every time I see your username, I associate it with Italy and think that you are Italian. Although \"Gazeta\" isn't spelled correctly and it should be \"Gazzeta\", like Gazzetta Dello Sport, it still doesn't make me think of Romania. I have to keep reminding myself that Romanian is a Latin language and that \"Gazeta\" probably has the same meaning as \"Gazzeta\".  It's correct, Gazeta is the Romanian term for the Italian Gazzeta (and for the French Gazette). Romanians' ancestors were Dacians, which lived in Dacia -- a part of Tracians. After year 100 A.D. Romans conquered them (by emperor Traian) and, afterwards, Romans settled in these places -- what will become, 1700 years later, Romania. Romans married local Dacians and, being settled here, their language mixed with locals' language. This is how Romanian was born. And, as far as I know, Romanian is the Latin language most close to actual Italian.Quote from: Pmalek on August 16, 2022, 08:05:51 AMSupporting the campaign is not the equivalent of applying to translate the threads and customizing them in the local section, right?Yes, this is correct.
