Thank you.If people are buying product A at a certain price, and you just go to the market and want to sell it at a lower price, will they buy it and leave those people that want to sell it at the normal price and higher price? Yes.If the sell limit order is at lower price, the order would be filled immediately at market price.",

Thank you.If you sell lower to the market price then you order will be filled immediately based on the current sell price until you reach the price level that you set or at the price which the liquidity is enough to absorb your sell order whichever comes first. The only time your order will be open and place on the order book is if you sell above the current sell price since your order will be place under the buy order list.",

And in your second query its not the limit order that will move to the market price but its the market price which when reach to the point where you have set the limit order then your sell limit order will hit and will sell the assets.For example you bought BTC at the price of 30000$ and you wanted to sell them at the price of 29000$ so you set a sell limit order and when the price of that BTC will reach to 29000 then the sell limit order will be executed till then it will wait for the price to drop to 29000$.Which mean you could also cancel the sell limit order if you want",

Because the OP is asking about limit sell order here and not buy order. You can sell lower immediately when the price set is lower on the market price because there’s an existing order higher than the sell price set. I think you you are describing a buy order because you can set a lower price to buy and wait for the market price hits it. Probably you are looking on the orderbook of exchange as reference here since buy and sell order their is reverse because that's the PoV of the exchange. They will sell your buy order and vice versa.",

Let say this is what happened when the whales decides to sell their coin.",

Hmm, before answering you, let me share what i answered before. I said, if you (op) mistakenly placed a sell limit order mean he had some BTC and placed a sell order by entering a limit of lesser amount then the amount op bought those BTC. I first said in my example that if you (op) have bought some BTC then you wanted to sell them and used sell limit order but make one with lower price while the sell limit order are set for higher prices (in spot trading). So, i answered him (op) according to his questions. I think your misunderstood my example here.",

If a security is trading above your buy order or below your sell order, it will likely not fill until there is price action on your security. A limit order can only fill if a security has liquidity.another explanation:QuoteWhat Is a Limit Order?A limit order in the financial markets is a direction to purchase or sell a stock or other security at a specified price or better. This stipulation allows traders to better control the prices at which they trade. A limit can be placed on either a buy or a sell order:A buy limit order will be executed only at the limit price or a lower price.A sell limit order will be executed only at the limit price or a higher one.In @OP's case, since he set the sell limit lower than the current market price, it will automatically filled since the trigger is already there being the market price higher than his sell limit.Read more about limit orders here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp",

You are telling here that his BTC that purchased on 30k can be placed on 29K order when he use limit sell order and not his remaining balance. I get what you are trying to point here but you should use limit buy order instead of sell limit order if you want the OP place a buy order using his remaining at 29k level.Because your example shows that OP will sell his Bitcoin(purchased on 30K level) on 29K level and it will just be pending order until the price reach that level while in reality it will just be considered as a market sell since his set price is lowered to the currency price. I think you should read again your statement before you start defending yourself. I'm not trying to have an argument with you.",

Thank you.Sell Limit order: \"The order will be triggered only when the price of the crypto is equal to the minimum price or higher.\"And since you mentioned your price is below the actual market price which I assume Lowered price than most of the orders in the trade book then in that case the order will be filled immediately as long as there is enough liquidity.So you are supposed to check your price before listing the order to avoid loss.",

Thank you.It does not sells at the moment, the order will still be pending since you've chosen to give a command on that in such manners, they system obey your command abd don't want to know of you are making mistakes or not, it's same if you place a sell on limit order when you put in higher market price.OP but why is it that you made a huge content on your poll than what's on your thread post, you can as well move the discussion to the trading discussion board for more informations on this.",
