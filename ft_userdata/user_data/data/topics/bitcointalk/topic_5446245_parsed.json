  "content": "In this forum we all want to contribute and want to make good quality posts so that we can get our ranks up but many of us don't know how to post which is meaningful and unique. Otherwise you will be considered as a Shitposter.To make good posts first we need to follow some tips : 1. Spend times in this Forum: When you spend lot of times in this forum you will be able to learn a lot from other members. Then you may see someone is posting for help. You should help them if you are expert about that. How much you will be active in this forum that much you will be able to help others with proper information.2. Follow Senior Forum Members: Some may thought users only give merits to the higher rankers because if they post any information gets a lot of merits. But you should remember most of the cases they post firstly with proper information as they are the most active in this forum. Again they share crypto resources which is very helpful to all. So it's a very helpful trick to follow Higher rankers and grow yourself like them.3. Try To Catch Scammers and Bounty Cheaters: If you make yourself expert about catching scammers and bounty Cheaters you may get attention from the higher rankers and may grow up yourself in this forum too fast. This is a very tricky way and also very contributive. 4. Post Less but not the Shitposts: If you are too much new in this forum you should post less posts instead of posting Shitposts. And you must post something which is related to topics and must be of the related board. Plagiarism is fully prohibited so never try to do this if you think you will share resources by gathering from out the of the forum by doing copy paste.I tried to share my opinions and I also try to follow these rules and hope these will be helpful who is serious about this forum and want to rank up in a proper way.Edit: 1. When you spend times in this forum you will have a lot of spaces to show your helping nature and share what you have learnt. 2. Following senior members don't mean that you should follow their character in this forum. It means you have many ways to learn from them how can be made quality posts like them. It is very helpful and it's appropriated to make posts like your own way.3. Catching scammers is a very talented work. If you do so you may have a good reputation and this is just a way to contribute in this forum. There are many ways to make your posts useful.4. Post less doesn't mean that you are being discouraged. It means if you are a beginner then it's better to learn first and then share your experiences. You can post much more with a brand new account if you are qualified.These are just my opinions and tips from a beginner. Higher rankers are welcome to share more effective information with us.",

You will be helping the forum to get rid of scammers and cheaters, but on the other hand, it will become distracting to you and can derail you from learning, which is really what should be your aim, goal and primary focus in the forum. Learn and provide valuable contributions in form of information, tips, guide etc. The forum always need people that other forum users can learn from, and if you mold yourself into one of these person's, you will always get merited for your actions even without you seeking for it.",

Follow Senior Forum Members:There are many senior or even legendary rank members without a single earned merit after they were airdropped merits when the system was implemented.So your advice is to follow all high rank members on forum? You should look for quality threads through which you can gain knowledge and learn with time.As you said follow senior members I would say there are many low rank members with lot of merits also and slowly with activity points they are getting higher rank but their merits are still more then rank so it's more about how much knowledge you have on forum.You can see members such as n0nce  and PowerGlove who have won Discovery of the year award as well so your contributions will determine how much your grow.",

That seems like a superficial goal, and it doesn't necessarily equate to making meaningful contributions to the forum. We should be focusing on adding value to the discussions, not just trying to boost our own ranks. And while catching scammers and bounty cheaters may be a helpful contribution, I don't think we should be encouraging people to solely focus on that as a way to grow their reputation on the forum.

If we can implement your thoughts and share them on the forum, it will also be a lot of people's attention to discuss things in a reasonable way.General tips on forums: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5364418.msg58120919#msg58120919",

This is a very tricky way and also very contributive. I won't classify this as a form of quality post instead a genuine act that helps keep the form clean/safe so it doesn't fit into tips for quality posts. Infact there isn't no tip for quality post since there's no standard outline by the forum administrative for we the members to follow and that's because theymos knows quality is subjective. Quality shoudn't be limited to this or any tips. We have people from different geographical location and educational background on the forum therefore there shoudn't be a standard for quality since what might seem quality to you mightn't be to me.For newbies readying this, just be yourself. Keep writing how you do provided you aren't spamming, you don't have to change you style to suit anybody. This is a open forum and all knowledge are welcomed here. Don't be in a rush to rank up, take your time and enjoy the journey. Practice makes perfect and for members who are consistent, you would be rewarded at the end. Be consistent with what you're doing that's adding value to the forum.",

It is easy to spot members who are only in it for the quick merits and earnings, but the community is quick to recognize those who are truly committed to providing valuable insights and engaging in meaningful discussions. Of course, everything worth doing takes time and effort, but the rewards are well worth it. While it is good to contribute quality posts and information to the community, we also need to recognize that not everyone is going to be an expert on every topic. It is okay for newbies to stick to what they know and feel comfortable discussing, rather than trying too hard to provide a content that may not be their area of expertise.In fact, I think it is better to have a variety of perspectives and experiences on the forum, rather than everyone trying to sound like an expert on every topic. This way, we can all learn from each other and engage in meaningful discussions that showcase our individual strengths and knowledge.So if you are new to the forum and feeling a bit intimidated, do not worry! Stick to what you know and feel comfortable discussing, and the rest will come with time and experience. As long as you approach the forum with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and engage with the community, you will find that your efforts are always appreciated.",

Posting should not be an end in itself. Of course, you need to improve the quality of posts in terms of information and content, but chasing this alone is not the most reasonable strategy. lovesmayfamilis correctly said that you need to improve the quality of yourself as a person. (although she put it differently, but the essence is close ). Develop yourself in those areas that are close and interesting to you. Sooner or later, you will have something to say to the community, which is sure to appreciate them.To make good posts, you need to have some kind of background, and if not, then create it.P.S. I’m not just writing under lovesmayfamilis’s post, but because once again her comments stand out and catch the eye. She seems to be writing exactly what I wanted to say, that is, she resonates with me. This is exactly what beginners should do (although it's not easy). Not in the sense of copying lovesmayfamilis, but trying to express your thoughts. Try to reflect on the posts.",
