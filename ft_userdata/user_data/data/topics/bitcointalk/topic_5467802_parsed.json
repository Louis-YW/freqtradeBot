Yes, that is true. I didn't use it for more than 1 year because at that time I was busy with offline work, I didn't have the time or thought to access my wallet.

And I also thought the same, as why the OP would test it on TW while Charles-Tim suggested using an \"Unstoppable\" wallet. Maybe, he (OP) trusts TW and has been using it for a long time and that's why he thought to give it a try, or maybe he doesn't have that much money and he can bear the risk of opening the HW in TW. PS: I am quite shocked to see, how and why these hardware wallets are going dead, I mean, ok I get that the updates keep them up to date and working according to new infrastructure, but why is the screen going dead? That's not supposed to happen. It indicates that hardware wallets are still evolving and they have still not reached to a point where they will not make such issues. I think the issue has been resolved as OP has recovered the funds in TW so this thread has done its work, or we are now talking about the issue of going dead!",

Are there cases where the display fails on its own, without even using the device?After reading about @lombokâ€™s problem, I had a question: it turns out that periodically hardware wallet (namely trezor) need to be connected to a PC/laptop (power source), otherwise this could lead to the device failure? Could this be related to the memory of this device, which stops working due to a long lack of power? I've heard that something similar happens with USB flash drives. Otherwise, I donâ€™t understand how the device failed. This case requires detailed analysis, as it may affect many trezor device users. OP, how about contacting trezor's support and describing your problem. It would be nice to know what they have to say about this. And also, if possible, provide the trezor HW for diagnostics from the service center or specialist. Of course, under your close supervision and only with complete trust in them.",

I know the consequences, that's why I chose Trezor or the previous hardware wallet to store crypto. However, due to this unexpected incident I had to take action.So from this incident, is the hardware wallet safe? or is something like this normal in a hardware wallet? and can it be fixed?Quote from: BitMaxz on September 23, 2023, 04:26:57 PMI think you can still repair this no backlight issue.If you don't know how to disassemble the unit there is a guide on YouTube on how to tear down Trezor If you have a soldering iron you can resolder the LCD terminals it might be just cold solder joints it always happens to any electrical board or if not then you have to replace the LCD.Thank you for your useful tips.
