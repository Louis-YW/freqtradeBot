Personally, I denounce the actions taken by the moral police in Iran which persecute young women just for allegedly disobeying the country's hijab regulations.This is very sad.",

As everyone has a right to live in his own way, I don't call it protest.QuoteMahsa Amini's entourage was suddenly confronted by the moral police, as reported by Sky News, Sunday (25/9/2022). “When they saw Mahsa and the others, they called her hijab incorrect. Ashkan tries to explain to them that they are not in their hometown, and are foreigners in Tehran, so please consider that and beg not to be taken away,\" said Mortezaei. “Police officers sprayed pepper on Ashkan's face and forced Mahsa into the van and took him to the moral police station.” Arriving at the police station, Mahsa Amini started to lose her sight and fainted. He was then rushed to the hospital. “There are reports from Kasra hospital (in Tehran) saying effectively by the time he reached the hospital he was already dead from a medical point of view. He suffered a concussion from a blow to the head.\"Reportedly the victims of this demonstration have more than 35 people, international participation is really needed in the struggle of women there. things related to women are often not given much attention because the concept of patriarchy is still the mindset of the majority, especially those who come from the middle east.their struggle is very noble imo because they fight for freedom, not food.",

They just need to use other arguments to justify oppression towards minorities and old gender stereotypes. Like USA did with banning different drugs probably just to have more control on various groups of people. Extreme enough religion doesn't even need to act like they care. But as we were talking about Patriarchy (in Iran), it doesn't really surprise me that women get to be in the bottom when you look at USA and realize that women in usa got voting rights in 1920 while african americans got them in 1870. So even the people they just while ago slaved got rights faster.Quote from: Ultegra134 on October 03, 2022, 09:59:07 PMEven if it wasn't mandatory, I still wouldn't get why women would want to wear such a thing under the scorching sun.
