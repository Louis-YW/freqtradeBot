'don't trust, verify!' is not a common credo of the Bitcoin community for nothing! but in any case we could already see a small foretaste of the price movement when it really and officially comes to all the etf approvals",

Below is an excerpt from the Wall Street Journal, and I've read a similar story elsewhere too:Wall Street JournalQuoteThe price of bitcoin surged to nearly $30,000 Monday morning after a false rumor that the Securities and Exchange Commission approved BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF application started circulating on the social media platform X.No wonder the price of BTC hit $30,000 very fast and immediately drew back so fast in the form of a whipsaw. It's such a manipulative attempt from miscreants trying to artificially pump the market. They would have gained by this, but it's not the best.",

But even so, that seems to be an indication that the chances of blackrock actually being approved are high.When that actually happens, many bitcoin communities will celebrate that for sure, because it will be clear that somehow Bitcoin will achieve $100,000 more than each other by next year during the bull run.",

One possibility is that as a result of this news, it could be a complete loss of investment funds and it is better for users not to base their hopes and speculation on the future and assess the market with objectivity.Looks like yes.

However, if this ETF is approved, the price of Bitcoin is sure to increase drastically. As new capital is added to the market, the price of Bitcoin will increase rapidly. BlackRock said its ETFs are still under review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and have yet to receive approval. But there is a rumor on social media that Blackrock has already got ETF approval which is completely baseless. SEC has not approved any spot bitcoin ETF so everyone should be careful not to listen to rumors.",

Maybe there is something up in the background that makes them break such rumours out as news. I know the credibility of their source is sometimes questionable, but this kind of big news is a mistake, and I really doubt it is. But not withstanding this just shows us what will become of the market when Bitcoin ETF finally gets the approval and it's made official.
