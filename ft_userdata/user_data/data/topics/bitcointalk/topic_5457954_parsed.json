The northerners are better than people in the East because their state government support and care for them. They provide them social amenities, mechanized tools for farming and loans. Fighting in the East and stopping people from working will not stop a country of 36 state and FCT. The problem in the East are there leaders. If they can establish and partner with",

Projects such goods road, constant electricity, and structural development, as the bad condition of \"East-West\" road in Port Harcourt, is an example to give of Fed govt negligence in this area, which was one of the reasons why Nnamdi Kanu spoke against before his arrest.Secondly, when it comes to the case of Nnamdi Kanu, I think it's high time Fed. Govt. set that man free, as I'm sure he must have learned his lessons that the Federal government is the worst set of people to ever dream of fighting with, because by leaving him there they are only giving his boys reasons to create riot and keep protesting.",

Engaged the world community very tight, fight the Nigerian government with an idealist and realist warfare and not gorilla warfare. All these ones they are doing is a childish game they are playing. It is the innocent people that suffer the most. Let them spend money to engage UN and other organizations in the world. Call for world emergency meeting every month then the Nigerian government will know that they are serious. But this one wey Dem dey play gbangbangolo game, they are injuring themselves.Leave those people they are not ready. They are out to suffer innocent people.",

He was very mean and wicked to the region, a very retaliating president because he felt the region did not vote for him. Thank God his administration has ended and he is back to his private life. But if we check about the states weh be APC for east like Imo State, nothing weh Buhari do for there. Rochas Okorocha na APC governor but no federal presence, instead na Rochas spend state money to do federal projects. Abi na the current government of Hope Uzodinma weh still be APC but we still never see anything from the federal government. This leaders them bad gah.",
