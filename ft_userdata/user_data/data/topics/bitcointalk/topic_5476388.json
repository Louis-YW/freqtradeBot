So any tips on how to reduce the fees by consolidating the inputs will help a lot of people. That's simple.Make a transaction sending all your coins to your own address when fees are low. Take note that the more inputs/outputs your transaction includes, the more fee you have to pay. Assume that you have received bitcoin in 50 different transactions. Now you have 50 UTXOs and if you want to spend your fund, your transaction would include 50 inputs.If you make a transaction sending all these 50 inputs to your own address when the fees are low, you can decrease number of your UTXOs to 1 with a low cost.The transaction I linked to above could be made with around 4.5 dollars worth of bitcoin around 40 days ago. If the sender had consolidated the inputs in that time, he/she wouldn't have to pay fee for a transaction including 53 inputs today. I think the topic created by LoyceV should be very helpful to you. [Nov 2023] Fees are high, wait for opportunity to Consolidate your small inputsThe other mistake made by the sender was that he/she didn't use coin control.Although the sender hadn't consolidated the inputs before, the transaction could be made with much lower fee.

In the linked thread there are many reasons why not to use this token scheme and not invest in them.The current fee increase is mainly caused by a second bubble of BRC-20 tokens after the first bubble about 5-6 months ago. ORDI for example just yesterday reached a new all time high, although it is struggling to hold it. ORDI is a token which was conceived as a test token but now seems to be some kind of \"popularity thermometer\" of the Ordinals/BRC-20 space. There are other BRC-20 tokens like SATS that yesterday spiked too but already have lost some value. Most of these tokens are purely speculative, just like meme coins, they're not utility tokens, and also not really NFTs because they're not unique but fungible.Of course if people see these spikes, they try to jump the train, and create their own worthless BRC-20 tokens only to try to find a greater fool to sell them to. As each BRC-20 mint takes two transactions (it's a particularly senseless use of Taproot Ordinal inscriptions) if many people mint these tokens the blockchain gets congested and fees rise. That's the reason.",

So any tips on how to reduce the fees by consolidating the inputs will help a lot of people. I have to assume you control all the inputs and it's your own non-custodial wallet. Multi-sig inputs are simply more expensive because they use up more space, but as a previous poster already said you could've chosen fewer inputs that just add up to slightly more than 0.05BTC using Coin Control to choose the minimum amount of your largest UTXOs in your wallet, if your wallet supports Coin Control and you know how to use it.The used fee rate is optimal, the problem is that your transaction is rather large in size due to the number of multi-sig inputs.Consolidation means you make fewer larger UTXOs from many smaller UTXOs. This is done when Mempool is emptier and fee rate is lower.Or if you know that you have to make a transaction this weekend, you prepare a consolidation several days or weeks before, if that is possible. It depends very much how predictable the need for some sort of transaction is. I can't judge that for your situation.If you knew maybe two weeks in advance that you will have to send 0.05BTC, you could've consolidated the minimum amount of available (largest) UTXOs in your wallet that add up to ~0.051BTC and send them to a non-multi-sig address (optional) until the time comes for your transfer of 0.05BTC. This consolidation transfer could've been done with a relaxed lower fee rate that might take some time to be confirmed because you're not in such a hurry (use RBF enabled to always be able to bump the fee in case you mispredicted the fee level in mempool).There's no easy rule that fits all needs. Right now transaction fee is rather high, atm ~90-100 sat/vB to get a transaction confirmed within a few blocks. In the last week about 50-60 sat/vB were possible. It really depends how urgent you need a confirmation and within what time frame.",
