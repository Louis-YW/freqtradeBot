  "content": "Trump was a businessman. So is Musk. Musk as President has a better chance, because he is dynamic, and understands all the Swamp problems Trump went through much better. I mean, look at the Swamp activities Musk is revealing from twitter alone!From Dollar's Collapse To Musk As US President:https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/dollars-collapse-musk-us-president-russias-medvedev-makes-absurd-2023-predictionsFormer Russian president and current deputy chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev took to Twitter and Telegram Monday night to post his own predictions for 2023, in an unusual move from a former head of state, especially given a number of them are not just bizarre but most readers will receive them as incredibly unlikely - at least given the mere one year timeline.Describing that \"many practice futuristic hypotheses,\" he said he would add his insight into the mix while \"competing in the proposal of the most unexpected and even absurd\" predictions. \"On New Year's Eve, everybody's into making predictions,\" he began of his top ten predictions thread for 2023 which includes a coming civil war in the United States, the disintegration of the dollar, the crash of the IMF and World Bank, and the total collapse of the European Union, following a major war among competing powers in Western Europe - including war between Germany and France.Medvedev's thread caught the attention of Twitter and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, as among the predictions is that after a devastating internal US conflict, Musk would emerge as the new American president, to which Musk responded sarcastically \"Epic thread!!\"...And to be expected, a number of MSM pundits who happen to have large followings took Musk's reaction literally, missing that it was clearly said in mockery.----------Garry Kasparov@Kasparov63·When I wondered where Musk would find “his Medvedev”—a sycophantic nobody—to be Twitter CEO, I should have included Medvedev himself. Although who is more the sycophant here is unclear.Sergio Olmos@MrOlmosAmong the “epic”predictions in this thread are a civil war in the U.S., the collapse of Europe, a war between a fourth reich in Germany and France, the election of Elon musk as president after the end of the civil war(in which the GOP is in control)",

That won't happen, I think.  QuoteArticle 2, Section 1 of the United States Constitution states that only natural-born citizens may serve as president. While the clause prevents immigrants who become U.S. citizens through naturalization from becoming president, it does not affect those with dual citizenship. Naturalization is the process through which a citizen of another country who moves the U.S. permanently can acquire citizenship.https://classroom.synonym.com/can-dual-citizenship-holder-president-us-15680.html",

I could be wrong since I do not live there in the USA, however, from the things I have read on your previous presidents, I think I can recall an important percentage of lawyers.Elon would run for president if he could, he seems to enjoy the attention and it will likely be good for his business and other's, because the tax cuts.",

He tried to back out of the twitter deal because he knew how much flack it would get him, of course, along with its inability to financial stand without FBI funding.The Constitution is a piece of paper. It does nothing until it is activated in human form by people taking office. They do what they want. If nobody forces them to obey their oath of office, they do whatever they want. Right now there is a lawsuit in the Supreme Court regarding punishing a lot of major government people for not obeying their oath - https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-380/243739/20221027152243533_20221027-152110-95757954-00007015.pdf.Quote from: Zlantann on December 29, 2022, 10:31:41 AMI read these predictions and it was indeed laughable.
