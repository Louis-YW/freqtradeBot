The law enforcement is mostly targeting those mixers that they believe have been used to launder Bitcoins from “Terrorists” or Hackers they think are state controlled, such as the Lazarus group.Once a mixer comes in their radar to have been used to launder such Bitcoin, then next thing you that would be likely to happen is a seizure after investigations. So it's a process. If all mixers were to be shutdown at an instant, we wouldn't have many today, especially on the Clearnet. Take an example of a mixer from 2016, it's still there to this date.As of now, we don't know which mixer could be heavily used by the enemies of the Government next.",

If you are to receive fund from a mixer or interact with it in any way, it's better to do so in an address where you control the private key to, otherwise they might be seized from services contacted by the authorities. Already users in the sinbad thread reported that they had this happen to them. It's risky business. Ironically, you need to mix funds from mixers again before you can actually use them... Maybe BTC mixers will have to start paying in Monero.",

In the case of Sinbad . io, there are no measures in place to implement and enforce a Know Your Customer (KYC) or Know Your Transaction (KYT) policy.Without seizing the servers, and having the customers’ data recorded and then ensuring that the percentage is higher than 50% and then arresting them, this was determined in advance when they tracked the servers and tried to shut down the service.I think that the government's policy towards the mixers will be to force them to provide and record data and close every large mixer that does not cooperate.If you want to know the second mixer that will be closed, look for a mixer that has become large, or whose name has begun to be mentioned with every hacker case, or that has been linked to the addresses of a hacker group such as the Lazarus group, and then it will be on the list, which may mean that they will track the servers of that mixer and try to stop it.Laws have already begun that try to collect more information about blenders or make them illegal, for example Proposal of Special Measure Regarding Convertible Virtual Currency Mixing, as a Class of Transactions of Primary Money Laundering Concern AGENCY: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), TreasuryUntil then and these laws are passed, mixers are not necessarily illegal and are used to enhance privacy (Which is necessary.)",

We are heading towards societies where the public authorities will have total information about the population in real time with tools such as CBDCs and digital identity.

Then poker player has a good point as well mentioning legislation to put laws in place against them. Whenever a government is not getting what they think is their fair share, the service, website, company, or whatever will always be deemed illegal. Why do they think they're entitled to a piece of every dollar we have? Basically, cause we are dumb enough to let it happen. American revolution comes to mind. I though they revolted due to all the taxation, but nope more and more taxes. I could go on and on here, but it's pointless. Another concern, will they ever pursue legal action (criminal or civil) against those who promote the mixers? I've seen stories about ronaldo promoting Banince, Tom Brady and FTX, Shaq and FTX, and so on. Gotta be a reason theymos isn't allowing staff to join the mixers as well. Think about it folks.

Linking to illegal services is not allowed. As mentioned in the law-enforcement press release, \"a cryptocurrency mixing service is not necessarily illegal.\" But a seized mixer is rather different from just any old mixer. Sinbad, if still operating, is now clearly a darknet site, and therefore not allowed on bitcointalk.org.The OP is banned. This topic is archived.

I really wish it was a simple situation, but the truth is, no mixer or exchange is completely safe.Guessing which mixer might be shut down next is hard if not impossible. The sindbad.io case shows that even places that seem secure can become targets because of criminals. These bad actors can use mixers and exchanges to hide who they are, even with KYC rules.The cryptocurrency world is always changing, so any mixer service or exchange could potentially face shutdown. This shows why it's so important to always be watchful and have rules in place to stop criminals from misusing these platforms.",

I think decentralized hosting service is one of the solution for mixers to avoid getting shutdown by the authorities, but there are still chances though especially if authorities force and threaten the hosting service. Mixers should block known hacker address or those labeled address to avoid authorities finding its way to shut these mixers. Because it risks their business even though mixers are pro privacy but if they are pro criminals too then they deserve to get shut.",
