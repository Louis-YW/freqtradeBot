As they are based in different countries, what do you think will be your biggest challenge when it comes to the implementation of your network?A sharp question!We firmly believe that the diversity of nations within the team is the strength of this project.In addition to having different approaches, for different lifestyles, to cryptocurrencies, our team is a set of local experiences that have merged into a single entity.This has made it possible to create a bond that transcends our nationalities. The result is a series of useful tools for each EVM blockchain and its users, which are easy to use and with a light but versatile interface, adaptable to any culture in any part of the world.That said, it is clear that the team sees more of the opportunities than challenges for the future from this .To top it off, this international team has been working together for almost 3 years now, and has been able to work together very well!We thank you for giving us the opportunity to deepen this point!Don't hesitate to ask for more information!",

The team initially registered the domain name oho.network (created on 2019-11-19) and later changed it to oho.ai (created on 2021-10-31) for better brand recognition.2) Later in early 2021, the OHO Blockchain team helped created and revived Hertz Network which was an abandoned community project with no funding. The goal has always been to help start Hertz Network, and then to return the project to the community once key developments are completed. Hertz Network has benefited from the technology and support from the OHO Blockchain project from the beginning until recently. 3) The OHO Blockchain finalized its EVM-compatible chain development in March 2022, and has provided the same solution to Hertz Network. The genesis block of OHO blockchain was mined on March 7, 2022 (https://ohoscan.com/block/0/transactions), about 2 weeks prior to the genesis block of Hertz Network chain.4) For OHO Swap and Hertz Swap, both are a fork of UniSwap like many other swap projects including PancakeSwap. It’s not unusual that multiple projects utilize the same code base or platform. For example, BSCscan and FTMscan look similar to ETHscan.5) As mentioned in No. 2 above, the OHO Blockchain development team has helped start Hertz network with the goal to return the project back to the community. The OHO team has fully focused on growing the OHO Blockchain project, and has gradually returned Hertz Network to the community. To continue a long-term relationship between both projects, a couple of Hertz Team were invited to join the OHO team. Other Hertz Network team members don’t have any connection to the OHO Blockchain project.6) The development team at the OHO Blockchain project will focus on developing Universal EVM tools of which many will be released in Q4 2022. These tools will provide ease of use to many EVM-compatible communities including Hertz Network. A universal tool that has been released recently was the OHO Free Token Creator, and it supports all EVM-compatible networks including Hertz. 7) Please see OHO Roadmap here https://oho.ai/docs/road-map to see the plan for Q4 2022 and beyond.

What is said is not targeting OHO specifically.The issue remains the same whatever the story you bring. Both projects are the exact same, it doesn't matter which one came first, and at the end, one of them will necessarily suffer.First of all, Hertz Network wasn't an abandoned project. Hertz Network has been created by some members of Ondori community after the owner left.Hertz Network had a vision from the beginning and the entire project and tools (token creation, wallet, NFT marketplace, cross-chain swaps...) have been first developed on EOSIO chain. OHO never been in the picture.It's a bit hard to believe that OHO project, in a spirit of great generosity, has suddenly stopped the development of its own project which has its own vision, to come and help Hertz Network with no funding to start/restart/continue its development and then took back for its own project the same products. What's the point of reusing the same tools that has been developed specifically for Hertz Network to help them with their project or giving them the same tools that were originally supposed to belong to the OHO ecosystem?The results is that we ended with the same duplicate projects with no unique vision or tools as promised.Plus, its a confession that Hertz Network is unable to develop its own products or have the capability to continue alone this project. Was Hertz Network the test project for the main project OHO? Will Hertz Network continue to exist or everything will be abandoned and deleted like the youtube channel?And as some of the team members are in both team, how is it possible to develop both project in their own way without being influenced by the other project? Or maybe any new product developed will be shared among both projects? How can it be sustainable when both projects are competitors with their own chain?Quote from: Blockchain Pandit on September 28, 2022, 04:28:20 PMThank you for the clarification.

      "body": "I had some worthless Ondori back in 2021 after it had been abandoned for 2 years, and I'm grateful that someone helped pick it up and turn it into Hertz. I'm pretty sure the person had some Ondori too, and that's why the person/team helped revive the project. That seems pretty logical I think.If someone who helped create Hertz will move on to do his own project, then I'm all for it and thank you for making my worthless Ondori became valuable. The links and evidence above do support OHO team, so the facts seem to be pretty clear. I think the main question will be whether HTZ will survive. As a HTZ holder, I'm feeling more comfortable with some HTZ team joining OHO at least during the transition period. I hope the transition will last at least until HTZ is strong enough to be on its own. I believe HTZ has also got a good foundation with its own EVM chain and Defi tools. We just need to get people to use it. I really hope that HTZ will continue to be alive and well.I notice that HTZ team seems to make a move and getting more people to join the team, and mentioned that a staff who left HTZ team deleted the YouTube videos. Here's the message from their telegram group.\"With regard to the removal of Hertz Network YouTube videos, the current Hertz Network team does not have access to the old Hertz YouTube channel. A previous Hertz team member has access to the channel, and didn’t return it to the community when he left. The videos were deleted, but fortunately they were all outdated and were about the old Hertz Network chain prior to the migration to EVM-compatible chain.\"Sorry OHO team for rambling about HTZ on your forum, but I suppose there's nowhere else more suitable to post this at the moment.Anyway, I had a look at OHO websites and their roadmap. I think OHO road map is really unique, and not like any projects that I have seen. I don't understand why someone thinks both OHO and HTZ are similar because their roadmaps are very different. The statement that both projects (OHO and HTZ) are \"the exact same\" is definite not true by any standards. People can have a look at oho websites and judge by themselves. Btw, is it possible that the above FUD was created to lure people to check out OHO websites ? If it is, I want to know who is doing your marketing lol. That's genius!",

So you just created your account few hours ago to post the magic word \"fud\" 4 min after the previous message? Yes, I created this account after a week you created yours. I have been with this project for a long time and am proud to be an investor in their token. I was told they had cleaned their telegram groups by kicking out some fudders only to find them here. Stop spitting venom about the project. You won't find a gem like this out there. BTW, are you getting paid for their publicity or are you doing it for free? They must hire more people like you .",
