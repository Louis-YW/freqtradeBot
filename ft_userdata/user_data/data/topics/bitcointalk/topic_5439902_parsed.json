  "content": "E be like say as the election dey near, d country dey hard. No food, no money, no light, no fuel. Security nko? Employmeny nko? Cata - cata just full everywhere. If with all these things wey they happen you never question why dem born you for Nigeria, omo you be strong person. Somebody talk say if them born you for Naija, life don dey win 1 - 0 or in gambling terms, the odds nor dey in your favour. If you look am sef na true in a way because why e be say the basic necessities of life or Â like dem call am for civic education, the basic social amenities or infrastructure still dey lacking for Naija?Anyways, I nor come to rant, I sabi say na very hard times wey we dey experience for the country and I want to chip in some tips on how to move on and remain mentally strong despite as everi where jaga - jaga.1. Focus on wetin you fit control - The truth be say you fit nor control fuel price wey don be N350 - N400 plus, you fit no control weder money dey ATM or not but wetin you go fit control na your emotions, how you take react. You fit control mindset and thought patterns. If you fit do this, most of our worries go away and we go dey mentally strong.2. Try dey exercise - We sabi say exercise dey very important because dokitors don talk say e dey relieve stress and make us relax. E also good for the body too. Just 15 to 20 minutes of mild to moderate exercise go help your mental health wella especially now, wey e be say everi man fo country dey vex.3. Try maintain strong relationships - Â We nor fit do without people. As people wey go school talk am say we be social animals. We need person or persons at the end of the dey to talk even if the person nor get solution to the problem but the feeling say \"we are in this together\" dey help well well. So find and maintain that strong relationships. 4. If you be religious person try maintain your spirituality - Religion get him own way of making people dey okay. Like when you go church and pastor talk say God know wetin dey sup with you and make you nor worry everytin go dey alright. Even if you dey depressed and anxious, you fit dey alright just by hearing those words. Plenty researchers don already talk say religion fit promote mental health. Abeg make una no vex. I sabi say this one nor be Bitcoin topic but my naija people dey go through a lot especially now, I say make I just put one or two words of encouragementNo matter wetin sup, abeg make we nor give up because na who give up fuck up. I hope day una grab one or two things here. Una doh",

      "body": "Baba you try for this reminder of waiten we done already know, as the entire atmosphere is intense due to political activities as we are few days to go into the general election accomoanied with the implementation of the CBN monetary policy that has resulted in a scarcity of the naira note and other banks wahala. -It is there for important for everyone to maintain a positive mindset knowing within themselves that las las everybody goes dey ok, building a high mental state is one of the qualities we should build so that our motivation level will surpass any environmental and other external factors that influence our mood and behaviour. -The ball is in our court and no one will do that for you and just as ops have mentioned a few points and habits that will sustain our mental well-being as Nigerains and the world at large. -Make we dey try to be the driver of our actions even though we are not in control of some things, but we are in charge of how we choose to react to them and maintain a balanced character is a big win in this period of aggression and high temperament in the country.",

The way you deliver this post, na at the right moment, because for real, watin Nigerians dey see this period no funny o. I sincerely don ask myself more than once how I take find myself for this country because of the way hardship dey celebrated and some people dey call am power or control or whatever it is wey make them merger profit. The average Nigerian right now dey interested in ripping off his neighbour because of money. Every form of betterment is sabotaged yet the thought of being innovative both in exploring opportunity in cryptocurrency is even overlooked and if it were possible, taxed.Your post is on point, inner peace reflects outwardly, so is any unholy emotion that is not checked with a proper mindset.",
