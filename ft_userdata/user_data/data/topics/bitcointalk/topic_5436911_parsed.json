  "content": "Bitcoin consolidation is going to complete soon.Next target appears at $25,000 soon.Cryptocurrency market appears stable in terms of higher price fluctuation. On the other hand, global markets are losing nowadays. Short-tempered speculators are getting confused for now and waiting for the same directional momentum of all markers. https://in.tradingview.com/chart/bF9MG0OF/ Largest cryptocurrency Bitcoin is going to expand the current value rapidly over the barriers investors are looking forwards to $24K before achieving the 6 months top of $25K. This is the time to explore the upwards journey after a plunge. Typically, after the new year journey, Bitcoin valuation increases along with consolidation phase in a box pattern (below the chart). On a hourly graph, price action made consolidation phase twice in past few days before significant bullish spike.At the time, Bitcoin BTC price is close to the upper range of the box, which means get ready for another hike towards $24K (immediate resistance) and next 6 month’s vital barrier of $25K. Volume is emerging gradually and here bullish scope exists as liquidity is sufficient to take a bullish call. What is the first priority? You can be stuck in consolidation if you buy Bitcoin at the time, but little wait can make use of your money effectively. Wait for the right time to take any bullish position. Range breakout likely to push BTC price towards $24K and $25k.",

Volume is emerging gradually and here bullish scope exists as liquidity is sufficient to take a bullish call. I don't think that 25k is that strong resistance to hold for 6 months. We dumped from 69k to 15k. >600 days in bear market. We are going almost only south for last 400+ days. Recent push did not even hit a 0.236 FIB level from top to bottom of current bear market, its not even close (>28k).I think that strong short term recovery is what we are about to see now. 2-3 months of going up only. Maybe 30k will stop us, maybe 35. Even 40k is possible. Fear/greed index is in neutral right now ... after a year of extreme fear and few days of fear. there is a lot of power that waits. there are a lot of people that were waiting for first sign of reversal. there are many people that wanted to buy but were waiting for another leg down below 15k. Most of them will fomo in above 25k. Market needs to see a greed now. I predict something like in 2019 when trend reversed for the first time. 4 months of epic push to north. First month is just about to end. 2-3 behind us.",

When people see constant red on their charts they tend to predict red, when the y see a lot of green, they predict green and there's always a small period of denial in between. When the price was at 16k they were predicting 12 even 10k. When it broke up to 20k they were in denial for some time saying that it must be a fakeout and we're going back to 17k, but now many analysts change into bulls saying that 25k is next. Sometimes I read them for fun, but 99% of them suck at predicting the price. IMO 25k is not really a resistance. It was never a significant level both on the way up and down. It was never defended for a long time and it didn't have a lot of volume. 29-30k is much more important. Everything below 30k should be considered a depression and undervaluation.",

Most users here ride the waves, and get a little bit too emotional. I can't blame them, I mean there was a time where I was obsessed with the price of Bitcoin, and now I rarely check it. I like speculation, and talking about why x happens, but more on the political side rather than looking at charts.

Users think they're missing out on the bottom once things start to improve, and try to cut their losses. Unfortunately, this sort of reaction is how users tend to lose money.
