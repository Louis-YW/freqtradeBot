  "content": "Lack of purchasing power which is caused by inflation is encouraging economic uncertainty, and this is because many nations has been found wanting in production capacity, instead they encourage importation of consumable goods from other countries, the country involved will therefore put up a policy, that will compel the consumer country to exchange there currency to the currency of the country, they are purchasing from, this will further weaken and stagnate there currency to trigger high inflation rate.The causes of high inflation can be attributed to the following:1. Excessive Government borrowing2. Unwanted and unstable domestic policy3. Unsatisfiable or lack of domestic production1. Excessive Government borrowing: the government of many nations has seen borrowing as a norm, there accumulated debts requires generation to come, to service, this is common in African countries where the government borrow funds not for establishing an asset or building an institution that can generate generate revenue, for them to either service existing debts and build more infrastructures, they prefer borrowing funds for either embezzling it or using it for things that are not accounted for.They do this without minding the consequences that may be accompanied with this act, at the end countries like this dips in high level of inflation and valueless currency.2. Unwanted and unstable government policy: the government policy most times are unfriendly and it is repeatedly done, just for example allowing the importation of already existing good to there country, instead of boosting the production of such goods to meet it's citizens consumption.3.lack of domestic production: government of many countries practically don't have anything to offer, the keep on wasting the little resources available to their reach, failing to encourage local production, the government should look into locally made goods, this will avail them the opportunity to do business with countries that are interested in the product and services, as the case may be, they should make it their priority to lure local investor, reach a compromise with them, allow them to produce at a minimal taxing rate, this will enhance the domestic needs of the country, No doubt we need each to survive but not in everything.",

You are right Poker Player,the high cost of gasoline and electricity will have a big role on inflation and the price of other commodity will be affected too,even the rich will also be affected indirectly when this happens. Take example of my country Nigeria, the new administrative have opened the door of hyper inflation on the citizens by removing fuel subsidy. Ever since that time everything in the country price has shoot up rapidly and the hardship has increased by the poor can no longer fend for themselves neither can they go out to look for their daily bread because of high cost of transport and high cost of living. This has made the Nigeria Labour Congress to embark on a protest to make sure that the new administrative does something to ease the suffering that the removal of fuel subsidy has caused in the country. Inflation is bound to be part of any economy because fiat currency depreciates as time passes on. Hyper inflation is caused by some actions taken by the government.",

It could be real state, currency, stocks, or highly volatile BTC.If you accumulate assets that have appreciating value then you can catch up with the inflation rate going higher.

Consequently, the country will suffer.In short, we need to elect people who are capable of running the country and who are not corrupt.

It's also possible that with the economy on the rise, the growth rate here is still a pretty good thing, compared to a few years ago. And moreover, some of the currencies that I use or rather the national fiat have always been seen as surprises in the international market, but it is clear that the current economic development policy is still at a sufficient level maintenance and more. But the general context story at present, the world is facing different problems, and it seems that they are all related to each other, perhaps we still need a lot of different solutions to go through this phase present.",

Bad leaders can also cause inflation in a country because once they have access to loot the government money, it will cause massive inflation that will take the government many years to recover. Borrowing is not a bad economic policy because almost every nation borrows. But the most important issue is how the borrowed fund is used. Borrowing to fund capital projects like infrastructures is a viable economic direction. Infrastructural development will improve the local production of goods and services. A country that has good infrastructure will encourage local investments and attract foreign investors. An increase in business activities in a country will lead to the creation of more employment opportunities. But borrowing will cause inflation when funds are used to finance recurrent expenditures. My country used borrowed funds to pay workers' salaries and service former debt. This type of borrowing will cause inflation and destroy the economy of the country. The most wicked kind of debt is when politicians borrow to steal. Most of these lending organizations sometimes ask nations to devalue their currency as a criterion to access loans. The poor will suffer the consequences of inflation, while politicians will transfer these borrowed funds to their private accounts through diverse fraudulent means.",

Rich don't hoard fiat money for long time periods. Most of their wealth are tied to land, stocks and other valuables. Some assets are more illiquid than others. Every rich person knows that it wouldn't make sense to hold majority of it as in fiat money.Because, while you are correct that it loses value and is inflationary by design, it hasn't designed to hold value in a same way other assets like gold. There's a reason why US moved out of gold standard... Because it was easier to control the economy during crisis when they have buffer to do it. However fiat money is excellent tool for commerce and economy. It's highly liquid and people can use it to transfer or hold it from large to small sums for a medium period of time and the value of it stays rather stable no matter how much you are dumping it. Even if you liquidate all your holdings to fiat money. Same can't be said about stocks or other assets. If you dump large amounts of them, it affects the value instantly.IMHO fiat money is a misunderstood tool and if you would get rid of it, it would be way harder to run economies of any country.",

If a country borrows a lot but never defaults on the foreign debt and keeps using the money to invest into its own economy, it can go fine.
