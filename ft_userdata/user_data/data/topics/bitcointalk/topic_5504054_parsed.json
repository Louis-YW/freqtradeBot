What this translates into is increasing clients base and increase in revenue.Ferrari is a business that wants to increase and satisfy it's client base and they observed that adopting crypto payment will assist them in doing that. From the quoted post there is an increase in the demand of Ferrari by the tech-savvy population and the company needs to take advantage of it. Maybe after researching these new targets, the company deduced that having a crypto payment option would increase sales. The majority of these tech-savvy individuals are young workers and many of them might want to pay for Ferrari in cryptos.

Seeing Bitcoin being accepted as money by major organizations is a good thing since it promotes Bitcoin as a legal tender. Nevertheless, Ferrari wants to accept cryptocurrencies for their selfish interest and not to promote the coin.",

Not just another strategy towards running a business as it was the case with Tesla. Ferrari remains some of the giants in the F1 racing, hope they would reflect if not already, the whole Bitcoin or cryptocurrency idea in the sport.",

This might not have any impact on the market, but it shows how the demand for the use of cryptocurrency is increasing on a regular basis.As they are seeing that the adoption of crypto payment is getting wider, they don't want to be left behind. This is just another payment method added to their list so as to cover potential clients who are into crypto. Merchants and other companies are already trying to integrate crypto payment, so we will see more of them up until it is just a normal move for any business owner to do.Microsoft, Amazon and Starbucks are just few known companies that are already deploying crypto payment in their system. And there's a lot more on this list. Paypal created a noise when they announced the integration of crypto. The following currencies are currently supported by this platform. Consider their number of users, and somehow some of them will be interested in exploring their crypto services.https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/paypal-cryptocurrency-faqs-help565",

In that sense, switching to fiat and paying with Bitcoin create the same taxable event before the tax authorities. But surely they save fees and a lot of time. If you have to change $0.5M of Bitcoin to Euros, and then transfer it, it will cost you much more time than the average ten minutes it will cost you if you send it directly using the blockchain.",

So that doesn't lead to active use of cryptos by European or US car dealers, but it does allow customers to pay with cryptos if they want. It is not a bad option, even though it's not full-on adoption. It's also nice to see that Ferrari has further plans on international adoption of crypto payments for their cars in other countries where cryptos are legal.I'm still not sure how such transactions work tax-wise in countries where cryptos are considered assets, property, or something similar. Do customers have to pay taxes for selling their cryptos for fiat in this scenario?",

This news will not have an immediate impact on bitcoin but it is good for bitcoin's popularity in the long term . Ferrari is making bitcoin more popular as a payment method and this also proves that bitcoin is not just an investment as many people think . Ferrari will be able to attract customers who are bitcoin investors and bitcoin will become more popular with this type of news .",
