The only thing is, I'm not sure this is the right section for this thread. Maybe the goods one would be better but I think in general there people sell goods P2P and not through third parties. Anyway. welcome to the community and if you want to promote your work, stay on it and make positive contributions.",

I don't think it's an impudent. I find nothing wrong in some bringing up a book that's crypto-currency related for the community to see, infact I am eager to read the book and gain from it if there are things there for me to gain, I think his approach is very honest, he claimed ownership of the book, he would have easily said here is a book he is expecting and give us an intro to it and you won't be saying he was promoting his book.Knowledge of Bitcoin and trying to help expose us to helpful stuffs like in this case his book should go beyond ranks, time on the forum or level so long as the OP sticks to the rules, my personal suggestions is for the op to read the rules and other helpful beginners post first.",

Haven't you heard anything about bitcointalk all this time and didn't you have a desire to look here? If these figures are accurate, then you have been addicted to cryptocurrencies since the age of 17?Thank you for the kind feedback, I appreciate it  Correct, I first bought Bitcoin in 2015 on Coinjar, when I was 17 years old and have been involved since then.I have known about this forum since 2015, I just never felt compelled to join (mostly because I didn't feel like I had a lot to offer as a 17/18 year old). Then, as the Twitter Bitcoin community began growing - I found my place within the community there.QuoteI like the title of your book, referring to the famous pills from \"The Matrix\" and the color of the BTC logo. Indeed, a very good analogy. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have spent any merit on you.Now closer to the point. How did you manage to find out these 250 stories about bitcoiners from around the world? I mean how did you know about it? Did you know them personally? It would be instructive to know a little about the history of writing your book.So, to gather these Orange Pilled stories, I posted on Twitter in April asking people to submit their Orange Pill story via an online submission form & they would be rewarded 1,000 Sats for doing so. I did not mention it was directly for a book (I just said it was for an upcoming project), the reason for this was to keep the stories genuine and to avoid anyone submitting an exaggerated story because they knew it would be published in a book. Then, over the course of 3 weeks, I received 538 submissions. I then organised them into categories and constructed a collection of 250.Here is the original tweet - https://twitter.com/BaileyJakob1/status/1647628162732531714QuoteAnd I also found information about a giveaway with a prize fund of $3000. I don't know why you kept silent about it. I'll also add a picture from your website.Glad you mentioned this! The reason I did not originally mention this in my post is because I knew if I just info dumped everything at once and was promoting something, encouraging purchasing, and then also mentioning giving away $3,000 - it would quickly be flagged as scammy or not genuine. So, I left out the giveaway, for somebody to find and mention and then I would discuss it (like now) haha.Not much more to dive in for the giveaway as the image says it all - but yes, 3 people who pre-order my book will each win $1,000 USD (paid via LN). I personally give away Sats regularly on Twitter, and my business Mr. Satoshi also has a monthly 1.5m Sats giveaway + instant Sats back on all orders via LNURLw - so, the giveaway is very much legit and a common practice for me and my various projects.QuoteAlso worth mentioning is the payment method with bitcoin for your book. I'm sure this community will approve and appreciate it. It would be very strange if this payment option did not exist. So, I wish you all the best and successful sales.Exactly right - You can checkout via Bitcoin & the Lightning Network.Thank you very much",
