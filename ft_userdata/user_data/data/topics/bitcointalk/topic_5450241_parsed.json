I have read multiple times this website https://mynodebtc.github.io/intro/introduction.html but I don't understand if MyNode is a software like Bitcoin Core which can be run on Windows.Sorry if the question is too simple. I am thinking of running MyNode on a windows machine, in order to be more feature rich than running simple bitcoin core",

I have used multiple distros (primarily ubuntu & debian) and of course I am used to using and developing FOSS. However, currently, I have restricted my coding time to my work schedule.My personal computer is mainly used to chill out and play games. So I have moved to Windows at home.But! I am gonna have to go back I guess. Thanks to bitcoin, I will have to re-visit my past.",

Depends on the architecture... I know there are precompiled bitcoin core binaries for x86_64 (linux + windows) and arm (linux), and there are probably some other precompiled binaries for other common \"combinations\" of os and architecture. If you plan to run it on a different architecture and/or OS that the ones that have precompiled binaries, you might have to compile everything yourself... If it were just bitcoin core it'd be doable, but if it's a whole range of tools, it might not be worth your effort...I know there are a lot of stores that sell second hand, revised mini computers that are dirt cheap, these might be a better alternative if you don't want to end up spending weeks to get things compiled and running.Here's an example: https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Fujitsu-Esprimo-Business-Computer-Refurbished/dp/B0854LM164/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3J55WATHIU45A&keywords=general%C3%BCberholter+mini+computer&qid=1682518983&sprefix=refurbished+mini+computer%2Caps%2C80&sr=8-3(i'm not affiliated with amazon, nor this store!!! use at your own risk!!). BTW: this particular example's HDD is to small to run an unpruned node, but a pruned node would do just fine on this hardware, 115€ delivered to your door (in the EU), just slap a linux distro on there, configure your node to be pruned and you're done ...",

It's all the other features that I want to enable.The computer that you have presented above looks good. Thanks, I will try to find one.on your machine... yes... if i had to take a guess, i'd say odds are >90% you're using an x86_64 architecture with either windows, linux or mac OS... And for those combinations, a precompiled binary is available.An raspberry pi has an arm architecture and runs linux (usually), this combo also has a precompiled binary available...But when you try to switch to more \"exotic\" alternatives, you just have to double check... IIRC, arduino (for example) uses a different cpu architecture. I've also heared about single board computers using PowerPC, RISC-V, PIC, SPARC,... architectures. I guess most rPi alternatives will have a precompiled binary available (usually they'll have an ARM architecture), it's just something you have to double check beforehand. You don't want to buy an SBC having a PowerPC cpu architecture and then be surprised it's not that easy to install your favorite linux distro, and even harder to manually compile all the (bitcoin related) tools you need.Now, the link i posted before has a disk that's to small for the full blockchain, but it has an x86_64 architecture. If you find one with an 1Tb disk, you're golden... It might cost you 10 or 20 bucks more, but you'll have a silent, small, reasonably power efficient device that should be very easy to slap the disk image provided by mynode onto by just following their walktroughs (disclaimer: i don't run mynode, so i have not tested this claim!!!)",

(or a VM as people have already said)Yes, but it does not have to be that powerful. A 6th gen i5 with 8GB ram and a 1TB SSD are overkill.I don't know where in the world you are, but in the US that is well under $200 in a retail setup and $150 if you get it thought a Craigslist / local ad.You can go lower, it still works just slower. Once the initial sync is done you probably would never notice a difference.If you don't mind used mechanical drives instead of SSD, 1TB are just about scrap value now (once again here in the US) I do lots of 10 for $75 on Craigslist and usually wind up taking $50 or less. YMMVI would go for a VM to start to see if it really is something you want to do. And if it works for you then you can always spin up a dedicated device.-Dave",
