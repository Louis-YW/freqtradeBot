How is it possible that someone can provide you with signals that are accurate enough that when you trade it, you would have profits of 3000% monthly, I mean common bro that's just bogus, it's the height of unreal and only a dumb person would fall and pay for something like trading signals that are not certain enough to actually earn you major profits.For the case of some random dude showing up in my dm on telegram or Whatsapp showing me his past successful trade luring me to believe him that he can make me that successful is no common thing again and I usually just ignore such messages because almost all of them are mostly scam related.",

Dedicate your time to learn, study and be a good trader yourself, you just arrived to the crypto environment why not  learn to acquire the trading skills you lack rather than depending on signals from random people on social media who you might be better than.",

They don't predict the price of crypto, they just play the price by pumping small altcoins to rise significantly in a limited time. It's just a conspiracy between them and their group members to buy in bulk, if they sell the altcoin too late then the price will quickly fall again. I don't recommend you to do something like that at all",

But if you think that by investing $300 you can gain 3000% monthly, then you need to buy a properly functioning brain first. I mean it.Even if it were true, if I had a foolproof plan to profit that much, I wouldn't even share the secret. Just forget $300. I'd invest $5,000 if that were true. 300$ investment with 3000% gain, doesn't add up, the margin won't even match. If a reputed trusted member of BitcoinTalk said that, I might have believed him. But telegram? It is the paradise of scammers. Don't you know that? One message, and you'll get hundreds of promotional messages every day. Most of them are fake. They will message you today, and the next day you'll see the user doesn't exist. Meaning the scammer deleted the account.My advice would be to avoid anyone who says anything about investigation, profit, or anything like that. Just block them and be with your life.",

If someone has personally contacted you on Telegram and asked to give you a signal for $300, I think you should be careful with such people. Earning money is easy but not as much as you think and 3000% per month, where did you find it so easy?Such people can show you many formulas and signals to trap new people like you. You only have a doubt and I am sure that he cannot give you any benefit. Anyway I like that you thought to consult on this platform and it's always good to get advice. Always try to learn and gain experience on your own instead of depending on others. It may take time but it will be a better decision for your future.",
