For trades going either way if possible I try to meet there for a F2F. Good cell service so for the trade and lots of machines to pick some random bills from the stack to put in to verify they are good.For larger trades, where I am buying if I REALLY want to avoid KYC there are plenty of people on the services listed here that have a good reputation: https://kycnot.me/ Could any of them go evil and start taking your money yes. For larger trades where I am selling, it depends. Over the years I have built up a list of phone numbers of local people I trust, and there are some people here I trust too.-Dave",

I see this claim repeated frequently on these forums, often by people who have clearly never actually traded bitcoin peer to peer, but I have never seen any evidence to support this claim. I have never used a centralized exchange and have always traded bitcoin exclusively peer to peer, and have never once been scammed, because I take basic security precautions. However, I have lost count of the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost money from centralized exchanges scamming them, locking their account, seizing their coins, going bankrupt, etc.People trade goods and services in a peer to peer manner (i.e. paying anything in cash) billions of times every single day around the world.Quote from: Abiky on November 09, 2022, 10:40:20 AMWhat would be the safest way to sell your BTC without KYC? Please feel free the share your methods here for the benefit of all. Thanks.Use a reputable peer to peer platform which implements an escrow. Bisq is the best choice. Others include AgoraDesk and RoboSats.If the platform has a ranking system, choose highly rated trading partners.Choose a payment system which does not support easy chargebacks (i.e. not PayPal or similar). If you want real privacy, then opt for cash.If opting for cash, then meet your trading partner in a public place during the day, where there will be plenty of other people around. To eliminate the risk of counterfeit cash, meet at a bank or ATM and either immediately withdraw the cash prior to trading, or immediately deposit it after a trade.",

I do trade my bitcoin with a car dealer down the road using p2p decentralized system and if he is not available, i go to the supermarket in the next community not to far from ours with a bicycle.

Thanks. Recently one of the no KYC platform called localcryptos closed their service which is a sign that people are not really concerned about KYC anymore but still there is a way which is Bisq where no KYC needed and have to be careful with the mode of payment because chargebacks or funds from the stolen Bank accounts are the most two common scams happen with no KYC trades. Maybe in future the better way will be doing face to face transactions or using the bitcointalk like platform along with the help of escrow the trade can be done.",

It's best to trade with more than one person to help diversify the risks of loss as much as possible. I've tried AgoraDesk, but I was about the get scammed by someone who had positive feedback. The person wanted me to wire him the money to a bank account, even though the listing stated \"Bitcoin to PayPal\". It could've been that his account on AgoraDesk was hacked or something else (that was quite a few months ago, btw).I've read a lot about Bisq, so I'm going to give that platform a shot to see what happens. It's my best bet to sell BTC for cash without leaving any trace. With ever-increasing regulations on the crypto industry, it's better to be safe than sorry by avoiding centralized exchanges altogether. Can you imagine if someday the government uses info about your trades performed in a CEX against your own will? Staying anonymous (under the radar), would prevent many headaches in the long run.",

I opened a thread about it here: Recent events should make everyone withdraw all their coins to their own wallets. There are multiple examples around the world of governments using data gathered from centralized exchanges to spy on their citizens, as well as using those same centralized exchanges to censor those citizens and prevent them from spending their coins.Just because you (plural you, not you specifically) haven't been censored yet, doesn't mean that any and all data centralized exchanges have relating to you is not already in the hands of your government and other governments around the world.",

There is a thread here which gives tips on how to avoid being scammed on p2p exchanges. That should be a big help for those who love to trade anonymously.Even if there is a big risk on them, many people choose them over the centralized one because they value their privacy more and I think those people can afford to lose their money. Don't be too confident and say that binance is trusted because we don't know what is happening in the background. What if they are leaking our data secretly? If not then what if they got hacked and our data is going to be stolen?",

If there were some protective mechanisms that would prevent hacking or the conscious sharing of such data, then I could still accept that KYC makes sense because it works to prevent money laundering and the financing of ever-present terrorism - but that data very often ends up in the wrong hands, which could be and life-threatening for anyone who made such a verification.Anyone who can bypass KYC should do so, because it is not just about taxes and fees, but about the protection of personal data, and this should be a very sensitive issue for anyone who cares about their security and privacy.",
