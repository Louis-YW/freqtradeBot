Osmosis pumped from around $0.6 to $1.25.Evmos was bigger on apy compared to osmo, but you are right, they didnt ride the pumping during the last wave of bullish. I am doing staking of evmos and I could say that they are still in good shape and lots of upcoming progress and development update from the team. Ive got my tokens from airdrop so I am just staking it freely on their platform through metamask. I believe they are still a low cap gem that need to watch out in the future. They only need more exposure and additional dapps to have gain more activities on their network.",

But if we check the volatility, they are both very risky. You may be correct, but not applicable to all coins. If I see a coin with more than 30% APY, probably your statement is true about those ones. See Zilliqa too with with 15% APY, it is still one of the good coins too.",

You could maybe make the argument that Solana might not be a bad choice either but they’re all bad to be honest. Your best bet is to stack sats and stop thinking there’s a free ride to endless income.",

Are these coins reliable?Thank you.Osmosis is a pretty big project already in my opinion and therefore i would say, that this coin is definitely a reliable one. By reliable i obviously mean that the chances of going out of service or even doing a rug pull or some other kind of scam are very low in comparison to shitcoins. Of course that does not mean that the price of Osmosis will always be at the current level or even rise, because you don't know this about any token out there.Cosmos is also a pretty good project in my opinion that is also offering nice rewards for stakers. I was also thinking about buying some NEAR and also staking them, but then they did a x2 within a few days and now i hesitate to buy them obviously, but there are quite a few good and established projects out there that are offering nice staking APY's.",

In my opinion, BNB offers a relatively safe investment and can be used in combination with other coins or even stablecoins, rendering it a safer investment, especially if a stablecoin such as USDT or BUSD is used. However, don't expect miracles in terms of yield; the greater the risk, the higher the APY.",

Are these coins reliable?Thank you.Personally, I really like staking coins. I have half of the above in my portfolio. However, I am cautious about projects that offer a relatively high staking reward, i.e. >20%. It must be remembered that such a % causes high inflation and then it is difficult to count on an increase in price over time. For the price to increase, it must be a really promising project in the long term. A good example of such a coin seems to be the aforementioned Cosmos(ATOM), which offers staking of about 20-22%, the price is quite stable, and the project is constantly developing.",

High APY is just a marketing strategy to attract long term holders, but as soon as the first holders receive their initial interest payments, they are going to dump the coin or token's price by selling the generated interest. At some point there won't be enough demand on the market to keep the supply under control, so we see prices crashing and never recovering again to previous levels.",
