  "content": "To explain better, how crypto works, for less-technical and less-digital people, there is a need to explain hash functions mechanically, without involving any electricity. I think it should be technically possible to make a mechanical device, where any user could set any Initialization Vector for SHA-256, set any 512-bit message, and see the result of hashing this block once by SHA-256. That could be used to better explain, how mining works. If someone will make something like that, I will buy it for Bitcoin. I saw some interesting projects here, maybe this idea could inspire someone to make something like that for some hash functions, for example SHA-256.",

After few hours, I could add hexadecimal numbers as well as decimal ones. Constructing similar tables for rotations is also possible, but it is harder. So yes, I know how to do it by hand, and I can reach a bit better hashrate than on this video, but it is still not sufficient. I think about something similar to a mechanical calculator, but it should work on SHA-256 (or even better: should also allow hashing things multiple times), should use hexadecimal (or binary, or other power-of-two-based system) keyboard, and allow quite fast calculation, by setting IV, setting data, and then it should turn Initialization Vector into Exit Hash. It could work on-the-fly, and modify w-values on-the-fly, then going backwards could be possible by rotating it mechanically in the opposite direction.",

For example:Code:a=badc0dedb=c0deba5ec=a+b=(badc0ded+c0deba5e)=7bbac84bc=7bbac84bb=c0deba5ea=c-b=(7bbac84b-c0deba5e)=badc0deda=badc0dedSee? Addition modulo 2^32 is perfectly reversible. It is like a clock, you can use modulo 60 to represent the current second. You can add seconds, you will get them modulo 60. But you can also subtract them, then you will get it backwards. So, addition modulo 2^32 can be reversed by using subtraction modulo 2^32, it's that simple. The same with many other bijective operations: if you have xor, you can xor it again by the same value. If you have rotation, you can rotate it back. And if you can compute Addition, Rotation and Xor backwards, then you can implement the whole ARX model backwards.Quoteit also use some compound operations involving \"xor\" and \"and\". those are not reversible either most likelyWhen it comes to \"and\", it is irreversible, but only partially (if you have \"true\" as your result, you know that all values were also \"true\"). Because it is used only internally, and is not a main operation to combine things, it can be reversed. Hash functions like SHA-1 and SHA-256 use Addition, Rotation, Xor, as their main core, functions like \"and\" or \"or\" are used only internally. Also, even if you think that \"xor\" alone is irreversible, then you are wrong, because having all 16 w-values is enough to xor and rotate them in any needed way, to recover all other w-values forward and backward.Quoteit would have to store alot of information. think a computer. with memoryI don't think hash functions need more memory than a few kilobytes at most. The bare minimum for SHA-256 is eight 32-bit values for IV, eight 32-bit values for Exit Hash, and 16 32-bit values for the message. Then, maybe a few more 32-bit values will be needed to make it convenient, so the total memory cost could be, I don't know, 256 bytes? Maybe 512 bytes? Hash functions are not that complex to require a lot of memory, I think it is possible to do below 1 kB.Quotei honestly didn't understand any of that. but sha-256 is a pretty complex thingWhy do you think that SHA-256 is much more complex than SHA-1 in my examples? It has different k-values, and some different internal functions here and there, but the core of the whole hashing is pretty much identical. Also, when it comes to preimage attacks, it is also pretty much the same way of doing things, only some functions has to be changed here and there.Quotei don't think a mechanical device could reverse it in any meaningful wayWhy not? Do you think that having a mechanical device that will perform 32-bit modulo addition is also impossible? Why? It is less complex than you think, you can write some simple code in any language, or even in some mathematical tool to see, that implementing hash functions is quite easy, much easier than implementing for example ECDSA. And then, if you have some hash function, executing all of my described attacks is pretty much straightforward, you just take one formula and transform it, for example:Code:w[i]=rol(w[i-16]^w[i-14]^w[i-8]^w[i-3])   //rotate both sides by 31 bitsrol31(w[i])=w[i-16]^w[i-14]^w[i-8]^w[i-3] //xor both sides by w[i-14]^w[i-8]^w[i-3]rol31(w[i])^w[i-14]^w[i-8]^w[i-3]=w[i-16] //swap sidesw[i-16]=rol31(w[i])^w[i-14]^w[i-8]^w[i-3] //here we go, now we know, how to reverse w-valuesQuotebut it's not really reversing it mathematically it's just spitting out stored data in a certain orderIt actually is \"reversing\": if you have \"a xor b = c\", then you can mechanically xor \"a\" and \"b\", get your result in \"c\", and later use \"c xor b = a\" to restore \"a\". The same with addition modulo 2^32 that can be reversed by using subtraction modulo 2^32, and the same with rotations, that could be reversed by rotating it further: if you have rol5, you can reverse it by doing rol27, because 5+27=32, and rol32 means nothing will be changed.",

And that's all needed to make a physical device for it. I can imagine starting from Initialization Vector and w-values from w[0] to w[15], then by rotating it mechanically, like in a mechanical calculator, next rounds could be computed, round by round, that would tweak w-values one-by-one, and finally there will be Exit Hash, and the last 16 w-values, for example from w[48] to w[63], in case of SHA-256 and 64 rounds. Then, it could be possible to reverse everything, just by mechanically rotating it backwards, it would be an equivalent of starting with some fixed last round, taking the last 16 w-values, and computing it backwards, to get Initialization Vector again.

If there is power outage, that device should still work. Someone proposed chemical hashing, I thought more about mechanical hashing, because it seems to be easier to compute than using paper and pencil, and it should be easier to learn, how to operate that. I thought about something simple, like constructing some tables for basic operations, like addition, rotation, xor, then it could be possible to compute hash functions manually, just by rotating a crank, or providing needed energy to the system in other simple ways. For example, it could be possible to paint squares in different colours to represent zeroes and ones, then negating the whole number could be done by simply rotating some wheels inside it by 180 degrees.I thought about many different ways of doing that, but it seems some mechanical engineer is needed to make it real. It could use some buttons, some magnets, some rotating wheels with hex digits from \"0\" to \"f\", there are many options. Each state can be represented in many different ways, you could also place something here, like a marble (when it is present, it could represent \"logical one\", and when it is empty, it could represent \"logical zero\"). It could use gravity to implement logical gates. I don't know exactly how to make it, because I didn't find anything like that anywhere, maybe just nobody needed it yet.To put it simply, it should be better than paper and pencil, and should work in cases, where no electricity is available, or if there is power outage, that's the general idea behind it. And I think making it in a mechanical way would be the simplest solution to that, but maybe there is something better available, I don't know (but I am not convinced for example to the chemical solution, that could be hard to do in a typical home, I think building a physical machine, or passing a ready-to-assemble project for some manufacturer, would be easier).Edit: some visualization, how it could look like: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/44/Grant_mechanical_calculating_machine_1877.jpgOf course it is just an example, because hash functions are more complex than that.",

I don't know exactly how to make it, because I didn't find anything like that anywhere, maybe just nobody needed it yet.the thing about using marbles and gravity well it's an interesting idea but if you want it to be robust, then it can't make errors. it has to compute things correctly 100% of the time especially if it was used in some type of device that computed a bitcoin address. a mechanical device using marbles and gravity sounds like it might not be at that level. yes you could redo the same computation multiple times but that just adds to the complexity of the situation and unfortunately if the machine was somehow damaged and some marble wasn't falling correctly because of that then it would just be duplicating the same error and you would be none the wiser. you could run a test vector through it every time first to make sure it was working correctly though. but still, a mechanical device seems like it could have some type of error rate. i'd say the error rate would need to be less than 1 in 1 million. maybe less than 1 in 1 billion. ideally even less than that.",

You have two marbles in a row. You release all gates, all marbles fall down, because of the gravity, and you collect the lowest row, if you want \"logical or\", or you collect the second row, if you want \"logical and\". It is that simple. Logical \"or\" means that there is at least one marble, logical \"and\" means that there are two of them, so they could be physically grabbed just by taking the second row, if they have the same size, then you will get one above the other if (and only if) both of them are present.Quoteif the machine was somehow damaged and some marble wasn't falling correctly because of that then it would just be duplicating the same error and you would be none the wiserI think it is just a matter of using the right materials, the right proportions, things like that. The whole world is physical, why using electricity is that important to make things tick? Another thing is that as long as we can use computers, it is just some interesting project that could be done \"for fun\", or maybe \"for demonstration\", it could be serious only if the whole world would be forced to abandon electricity altogether, because of some nuclear war, or other serious world-scale problems, but then, Bitcoin will be less important than having something to eat. I think crypto adoption is still too low to allow surviving in hard times, we are not there yet.",
