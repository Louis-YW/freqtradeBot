Altcoin as an Alternative Coin is ok for me because it that becomes common among all of the people in the cryptocurrency market. And even if we will say there will be a change of name but they are still have the same function, no sense at all in changing it.Even me, I can consider me as not early adopters but hearing and being involved with \"altcoins\", I don't find any issue about its name.",

But honestly, changing it won't change matter from what it was already established. It not really a big problem to change the actual call and meaning of altcoin.",

I do not think so, as we know the majority of those coins are released with only one intention behind them, and that is to make money for the developers of such coins.",
