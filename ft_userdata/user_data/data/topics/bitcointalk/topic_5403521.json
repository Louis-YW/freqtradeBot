  "content": "Hello All,I've just launched a new Lightning Powered Auction Site https://plebeian.market/This is the very first auction can be seen here:https://plebeian.market/auctions/JYIt's just a fun piece to get the market started.  Anyone can sell anything though and the platform is based on a value4value model.This means that it doesn't cost you anything to use it but the seller can chose to donate up to 5% of the sale to us.All sats donated go to supporting ourselves and other Bitcoin Free Open Source Software projects.I will be auctioning 1 item each day this week.  All small fun things.If you would like to auction something, feel free",
