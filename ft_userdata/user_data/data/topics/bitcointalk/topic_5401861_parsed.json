  "content": "Good eveningA little bit about the project to give you an overview.I have decided to finance my project with an ICO. In my specific case, the ICO is only the vehicle for financing. the purchased tokens have a real equivalent value, which you become the owner of. The incentive to purchase the token is that by buying the token you participate in a real asset, which results from the investment. This means that the entrepreneurial profit margin, from which every company we interact with lives, is shared between the owners of the tokens and the company, since the sum invested in the ico guarantees the real value. The returns are paid quarterly. this return is not based on price gains on the stock exchange but on a real, tangible asset. the profit is shared 50% with the company and 50% with the investors, resulting in the return.Thank you if you have read this far.Now to my question. How do I make people aware of my ICO? I am entrepreneurially savvy and have many years of experience. for 2 months i have been dealing intensively with the crypto and the ico market. However, I lack the know-how on how to technically attract attention for my ico marketing.

But hey, if you're project is solid and you guys are legit and will not do a rug pull or scam investors out of their hard earn money, then by all means do the ICO.",

It's about the trust that you need to get and not just all about marketing.Thanks for your reply @Blockman.I continue to see on icoholder, ico drops and other websites that ico's are still raking in large amounts of money for their projects. In any case, your answer confirms that it is important for future investors to be able to read a detailed white paper. During my research, I kept coming across ico's, which received more than 200,000 dollars in funds and presented a poorly detailed white paper. that's why i think that if you are open with people and don't hide any details, it should still be possible to get nice amounts from ico's.Quote from: zooboomafoo1234 on June 08, 2022, 10:53:14 PMTelegram is a strong avenue -- there are still tons of Telegram groups dedicated to token launches/ICOs/IEOs.

Thanks for your reply @zooboomafoo1234.What do you mean by a strong one paper?Exactly as you describe it are my ideas, that's how I want to do it. Should I, if I post my ico on different ico-publishing websites in the calendar, generate organic attention on my own?

Anything higher reward means something shady cause how could you earn from it if the rewards are too high. Too good to be true offer end up nowhere.Thank you for your reply @cryptoaddictchie50% of the investment sum is not paid out quarterly as a return, that would be utopian. instead, the profit generated is paid out equally between the company and the investors, this corresponds to a profit sharing of 50% for the investors and 50% for the company. There are enough companies that have cheated amounts with ico. but that doesn't make sense to me if you can achieve more together in the long term and can still fall back on the ico tool for future projects.Quote from: Maus0728 on June 09, 2022, 04:57:07 AMEven if the marketing is done properly, I don't believe that crypto enthusiasts will devote their time in a newly launched ICO.

It maybe slow, but it surely is organic.Many thanks @mouse0728basically it's a brick and mortar business. I see it the same way you do, physical work is less risky than programmed, high-tech work. The ico should only be the vehicle for financing. The winnings are generated in the real world and are physically present.Quote from: noorman0 on June 09, 2022, 05:15:13 AMI learned a few things about the NFT hype and Memecoin especially how to market these kinds of projects by recruiting influencers as a marketing strategy.

I have hardly dealt with nfts and am not well versed in the subject areaQuote from: S3300 on June 09, 2022, 05:29:05 AMAs a investor I always walk away from any project that use ICO because its certain that the sale isn't going to happen on popular platforms like Binance exchange or Daomaker, people won't invest in your project you need to use IEO at least mate, ICO has been long forgotten and people have moved on.Thank you for your input @s3300Of course, a project on binance or daomaker is more trustworthy. I noticed that myself on the ico's websites. I often ask myself how people get money for projects that are poorly described, hardly provide any information about the people and are pursuing a project that can only possibly bring added value. so i think i can stand out from the shady crowd with my well designed project for which a swiss company is founded. i think it is extremely difficult to get listed on binance or daomaker.Thank you for your input @dwminer1Quote from: dwminer1 on June 09, 2022, 09:05:35 AMI don't think the bear market is a good time to launch an ICO.

And I advise you to follow the current market trends, such as DeFi or NFT in recent years.I will read up on the topics you mentioned and if I may ask questions about them. if i understand it correctly, i can sell ''nfts of the project'' instead of ico-tokens, which represent the value you invest in the project. is that correct?greetings from switzerland",
