  "content": "As a fan of Elon’s companies who loves everything they’re doing to get ready for life on Mars, I never miss an opportunity to show my support. This product supporting the Boring Company, which is no doubt preparing to build underground on the red planet to shield from radiation. The product being burnt hair. It smells as described, but it’s oddly a good smell. Anybody else grab one of these?",

Price on e-bay is 239$ and there’s no guarantee that it’s legit. @OG does the smell is really like same as charred barbecue. I knew burnt hair smell is disgusting. I wonder how they make this perfume good.",

I knew burnt hair smell is disgusting. I wonder how they make this perfume good.I bought it because as stated I like to support Elon, but I sort of knew I’d be reselling it at some point. Just waiting until an offer I can’t refuse finds its way to me. I missed out on the Not A Flamethrower so I’m on the buying nonsense train now. My SpaceX torch shaped like the Starship being my latest purchase. It’s weird to describe, but you can definitely smell burnt hair. However, I think all the chemicals they put in it makes you think it actually smells good.",

I never had to spray any either. I just opened the box to check it out rather quickly and my house still has a little burnt hair smell lingering around. It does have a fancy smell to it. I could see a grandma wearing it in some elegant atmosphere. I’ve seen online that people are saying it smells like a campfire. Some unboxing videos are pretty funny…",
