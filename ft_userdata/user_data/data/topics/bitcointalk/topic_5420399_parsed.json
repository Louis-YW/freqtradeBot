Send the coin you want to use for the property to a mixer, and use it for the transaction.",

      "body": "Are your solicitors not acting as an intermediary too? Surely the buyer can't trace it easily if it goes through a payment processor the solicitors deal with.Mixers and multisig are the best ways to do these sorts of things depending on your level of safety and saleability. If you want to sell them soon, a mixer might not be a good option but using one for a longer term situation (especially if you can make it harder to detect - such as by using exchanges). I wouldn't move the entire funds at once either, just a few % at a time (maybe 3) - there's unlikely a problem but if there is you're not risking much.Moving onto a multisig I think you'd be best making something like a 2 of 3 one (as an example) and securely storing 2 hardware devices somewhere (they could be with you and just well hidden or they could be stored in secured storage but these might carry their own security risks). If you're in a country that might have a corrupted policing system, putting both hardware wallets in other more secure countries might be the best alternative too.",

      "body": "Based on what I understand, you sold a property and received the payment through Bitcoin, which means the one who sent you knows that you own BTC. The only best suggestion here is to use a mixer if you want to cut the traces. Take note that multisig transaction fees are slightly higher than a standard wallet. Or simply, if you want to protect your Bitcoin from someone who sends you, then why not send it to exchange and withdraw it in your new bitcoin address or wallet? Or trade your bitcoin to any privacy coin like XMR?",

If you are worried about a \"physical attack\" it could happen even if you receive the funds in fiat form. For example they could physically force you to transfer the money to their offshore account!You protect yourself the same way too. You do the deal in a public place like the real estate agency and don't go alone. The rest depends on where you live and how much crime is going on there, in which case you may want to relocate to a safer place.",

The undertaking usually is a written statement that they should be held responsible if within a certain period you are attacked for your bitcoins etc. The undertaking that they have signed will discourage them from making an attempt to get your bitcoins by attacking you or getting people to make an attempt for it.",

For example they could physically force you to transfer the money to their offshore account![snip]Well you are right and you have a point --even though if that is a fiat form there is always a danger on your side, but if you compare fiat vs bitcoin, I prefer to use bitcoin because you can hide it without seeing personally because that is a digital currency. My advice is if that is a big amount, you can hire goons, police to escort you --or a personal bodyguard that is highly trained if you were really worried about your security. Even a man that has a million dollars in his bank account could be in danger too forcing him to transfer his fund, if you feel this way, just hire your own men that can protect you. A p2p exchanger or bitcoin mixer will cut the tract that is linked to your wallet that is publicly seen upon transferring the bitcoin as a payment.",

In the meantime,  I will advise you split the BTC into 3-4 different wallets.Technically, don't receive the payment direct to the Ledger wallet you bought because it will be easy for an attack to know your wallet and like others have said the only way to keep your transaction is through a crypto mixer site but you can also make use of privacy coin like Monero.Quote from: sima_sara on November 10, 2022, 02:00:26 PMtransfer the bitcoin to another wallet, letting others believe that I am not the holder of those bitcoins anymore?Yes, this is the best option and you can move the BTC little by little with the use of a reputable crypto mixing site.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on November 10, 2022, 03:08:10 PM[snip]For more information and read up on how mixers works, visit the link below.https://learn.bybit.com/investing/cryptocurrency-mixer/ to comfortably trade or transact your business without hitches.Be careful about the crypto tumbler you recommend there has been an issue where a good crypto mixing site turns out to be scam years after but Chipmixer seems to keep a good record than other mixing sites.",
