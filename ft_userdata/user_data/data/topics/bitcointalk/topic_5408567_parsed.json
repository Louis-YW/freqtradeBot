Right now I use bybit and when I want to see the chart and enter operations the background is black, I think for me it would be better white background...is there any way to change that? and the box to enter the orders is very small...is there any way to make that box bigger...in fact I do not look at the bybit chart...I look directly at the tradingview....",

There's no special setup on it as I've seen from the others. I'm not a day trader so I don't have that setup but with what I've seen for the day traders, usually, two or three setups are enough for them. This is only when you get serious in trading.",

I know there are a lot of features you may find by simply clicking the settings found in the corner. It is better to familiarize the site (ByBit) or directly ask their support system if you have some queries or concerns I know they are happy to help you.",

At the early stages of your trading career you will have to accept a less efficient setup to trade the market as you need to save all the money you can so you can add it to your capital, so even if you think the monitor that you are using is on the small side that is fine, after all there are people which are trading the markets from their smartphones, which most likely have a screen which is way smaller than any monitor you can find in the market.",

Did I understand what you said correctly? When I'm the one doing the trading spot trade, I don't do anything else because, with this method, I'm sure I'll experience a profit here as long as my analysis of the graph is correct.Then when I do the trading here, there is only one way that is always done and used and that is the spot trading, actually, in the future I will also try to use the Future trading, I just need some few times before I get unto it.

You don't need some fancy setups to trade properly. As long as you're comfortable with what you have and able to earn from trading then a 24 inch single monitor is already enough. I only have one monitor with that size but I use 2 windows when trading, half screen for charts and the other half for placing trades.",

After getting used to it you can then use bots and whatnot, but early on I don't think you need to stress yourself out of looking for them. As for monitors, I don't think you need a big one or multiple ones early on, though it might help later on (I never really tried it even though I had multiple). I don't use Bybit but a quick lookup announces that they \"announced\" night mode so I think it's safe to assume they also have a day/light mode with the white background you want.",

Don't trade as many coins as you can because that will only confuse you that could lead to a mistake in decision making. Just like what they've said, 1 monitor is enough since you're just starting. Multiple monitors are for those who are professional already in trading. Risk management is important, don't put too much leverage per trade and always put stop loss. Take your time perfecting your technical analysis. Don't be afraid to be left out by your friends in trading because there'll be always an entry for you. Patient is the key.",

It even allows multi screen function so you can keep multiple screens for different utilities like one for seeing the chart other one for the order book one for entering the order for execution. This way you can be quick and effective. Eventually all the charting providers just take trading view charts to add their own flavour on it. So it's best just to go with tradingview premium itself.",

We can set up this stop loss to decrease the loss risk. not to panic, but to anticipate having many losses.Btw for another strategy, well, have you tried hedging mode? If there is a hedge mode in your exchange, you can also use this as one of the strategies. Some traders may use it and some don't, like the stop loss. But, for me, this is also helpful enough. You can learn about this right here or others:https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/360041515312https://capital.com/what-is-hedging-mode-and-how-to-use-it-in-trading",

Our wisdom helps us analyze market conditions to make decisions that will benefit us or minimize risks. We can use whatever we want but also have to adjust to what we have to stay focused and develop something we can use to continue trading. Indeed this is not easy because, in trading, we want to make profits with makeshift tools so that when we can make a profit, we can start buying things that can give us more support.",
