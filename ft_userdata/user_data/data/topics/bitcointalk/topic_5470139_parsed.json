  "content": "I'd like to share my experience with you all. Even though I'm not currently employed, I went through a phase of gambling while I was working in the past, and the outcome wasn't positive. It affected my job performance because, as you may know, when you lose, you tend to dwell on your losses and constantly think about strategies to win. When we talk about work, it usually means we're not particularly wealthy, and imagine what happens when we gamble money we can't afford to lose, especially when we're not earning much.Let me tell you, the feeling is far from pleasant. It leads to a decline in your work performance, which can have significant consequences since that's your primary source of income. It might be manageable if you're winning, but the harsh reality is often quite the opposite. Even when we do win, we tend to spend most of our winnings, so we don't treat it as business money. This leaves us in a precarious situation when we lose because the money we initially budgeted for our families gets diverted to cover unexpected gambling-related expenses.I'd like to hear from those of you who have experienced this or are still dealing with it. Please share your testimonies.",

Please share your testimonies.I think at least in the life of the gambler, we have experienced this kind of phase in our lives. For me when I was working still in a office environment, there were one casino that is close to us, newly built that time. So me and my friends will try to sneak out and then go to that casino and play. In the beginning it was fun, but when you start to lose big money, then the problem arises. Specially when it's payday, you received your paycheck and the first thing you do is go and play and everything you work for that 2 weeks is gone in an instant. And then you are mentally not stable, your performances are affected in the office. And then there are days that I will call in sick after a big lost. So not really healthy financially and emotionally. However, that was before, I already learn to prioritized things like putting food in the table for my family. Although I still play in land based casinos and online, it's not like before when I was really that addicted and out of control.",

You don't pay attention to the tasks you have to execute, because you are concerned about your gambling game which ends occupying your priorities. Also, if your boss or someone tells you boss you are gambling during your duty, it's possible he fires you from the company and you are labeled with a very negative reputation on the market, even difficulting you find another job.It's important to separate job from leisure to not create issues in our professional field. Remember that reputation takes a long time to be built, but a single mistake can make it all ruin suddenly.",

But if you look closely, you are the one that put yourself into this predicament and no one to blame except you.

Most people always think gambler will give a bad effect at work, so you might be ostracized by other employees or kicked from the company.It's best for employers to implement the rules effectively. They should ensure that they impose heavy penalties on employees caught gambling in the workplace. Not only does gambling have a personal negative effect on employees, but it also amounts to stealing time for which they are paid by the company which would affect the company financially as well.",

I only gamble at home, not doing anything busy, and have much free time.I realize that gambling at work will affect our performance at work. Many people have experienced this. Even my friend who works in another office once told me he gambled at the office. But instead of winning, he lost and when he lost, he couldn't focus on doing his work. His concentration was disturbed because he was still thinking about his previous defeat. Luckily, he could think clearly that this was the office, not a gambling place.Problems may arise if we gamble at the office. If we lose, we may still think about the loss and want to play but we are at the office. That's why if you want to gamble, you should gamble when you are not doing anything.",

Better to manage our gambling time, gamble when we have free time only, time when we have nothing to do at all. Time is priceless especially when it comes with our family, job, or relationship. I totally agree with you. Sometimes, we cannot deny that we get tempted to do gambling during our work, which is of course not a good idea because it will negatively affect our performance in work. Even if we say that we engage with gambling during our break, it is still a bad idea because that is still during your working hours. I think the best way to avoid such is to better manage your time, and only set a time for gambling so that your work will not be compromised. On my case, I set weekends as my gambling day to make sure that I am free and nothing will be affected from it. Take note that gambling at work might affect your performance, and as well as the people around you and the company you are working with.",

Indeed, sometimes when I have a long free time at work, sometimes I feel like gambling, but I overcome this desire by doing other work or helping my co-workers' work which makes me forget.

Some companies have a disclaimer in their company that you should have a sound mind and you are not involved in gambling activities, these are sensitive positions that involve handling finances, you can still gamble but do it in the privacy of your own home if you're playing online or when you're in a vacation or day off if you're playing offline.You are free to gamble but prioritize where you get your bread and butter.",

We generally discuss possible results of weekend matches when we are out on break time for like 15 minutes. Its something fun to do on break time. Many people go out to smoke anyways. Its generally far better experience to discuss gambling than do something unhealthy. I believe gambling/betting at working hours is not something cool tho.",

Based on my experience, it's best if we can avoid gambling, discipline ourselves, and only gamble after work – but, of course, with limitations. We shouldn't let it affect our job.Have you seen the movie \"The Gambler\"? He was a teacher in the morning, gambled at night, and became addicted, which eventually made him quit teaching and even put his life in danger due to big loans from loan sharks.

But as a gamblers, we supposed know that gambling is not for children but for adults and like minded people so that when you lose you will have that thick skin and move on. This feeling is not only in your working place but also at home and other places. Whenever you lose your bets which you thought, you would win to settle some pressing issues. It makes someone weak but as a mature person you don't allow it to over shadow your spirit at work in that day. And one thing we have to know is that gambling is not something we win  and lose always but the losses are always surpassing the winning so you have to put that one in your mind when gambling. Though it is not everytime I have that experienced but in specific occasions and in most time when I was planning to use the winning money to do something important things and I don't have anything in my pocket again. But even at that the loss will not come back again so I always tried to console myself and move on. Gambling is for the thick skin and not for the weak skin.",

Employees are vital tools in a company's operations, and if even one employee is distracted by gambling, it can significantly impact the company's overall performance. Each task contributes to the company's success, and if these tasks aren't done well, it's a problem.We shouldn't justify gambling during work hours just because we think we can manage it alongside our job. That's not how it works. Employers implement preventive measures rather than seeking a cure. This is especially risky when you're responsible for handling financial matters.I have to admit that I'm somewhat guilty of gambling at work too, but I've been lucky that our company isn't overly strict about enforcing these rules.",

Because even if you lose your money in gambling at least you still have a work to compensate those losses. But in my previous company, once you get caught doing other activities on your computer or cellphone deliberately during office hours, there will be a huge possibility that you'll get fired immediately. Gambling was a big no no for that company, pretty sure if you get caught you'll gonna lose the very source of your income. So, what's worst? Lol. I was surprised your company allows it? Or you're hiding away while doing it? If so, it's not gonna be enjoyable that way.",

It's quite the contrary because if you can gamble at your work and you can still do your work, that can only mean that you have the ability to multitask which also means that you have a way or a system where you can do multiple task at a time. But I'm not saying that my opinion is right as there's always other that don't have the ability to focus on stuff at multiple angles. Regarding respecting your working time, I think that it's a matter of perspective, if you're paid below minimum in your work, I don't think that it's in your best interest to waste all of it working, there's going to down times in your work and if your loyalty doesn't equate to a higher pay, why put a lot of effort? But I digress, we should still respect that we are doing something outside of our normal working duties so when you're gambling during work, it's always important to remember to prioritize work before gambling.Quote from: Pierre 2 on October 13, 2023, 05:32:24 AMI have many friends at workplace betting on football matches at workplace.

It might be manageable if you're winning, but the harsh reality is often quite the opposite. Even when we do win, we tend to spend most of our winnings, so we don't treat it as business money. This leaves us in a precarious situation when we lose because the money we initially budgeted for our families gets diverted to cover unexpected gambling-related expenses.I'd like to hear from those of you who have experienced this or are still dealing with it. Please share your testimonies.There is a need to place boundaries in our life activities to avoid misuse of our time. But sometimes you will be tempted to check your phone to check your games in sports bets. In some cases, I have seen some of my colleagues secretly go to the restroom where there are no CCTV cameras to place bets which is against work ethics. But l I have seen cases when an employee unconsciously screamed in the banking hall while performing his duties because he lost a bet. It was quite embarrassing and I know he would be sanctioned for that.  Some employees can be sacked because they use work time for gambling and it affects their job performance.I work in an organisation where you are not permitted to use your phones at the workplace not even during breaks. So I have been spared the temptation of placing bets in my office. But I prefer gambling during weekends when I am in a comfortable and relaxed mood.  This will increase concentration and reduce hasty bets. The best way to deal with such abnormal behaviour is to stay away from phones and plan your gambling time.",
