  "content": "One of the major security issues affecting permissionless proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains is long-range attacks (LRA), also called posterior corruption attacks. An attack based on the inability of a user who disconnects from the system at time t1 and reconnects at a later time to tell that validators who were legitimate at time t1 and left the system (for example, by transferring their stake to another validator or by assuming a different identity) are no longer trustworthy. Since PoS systems do not require physical resources like energy for the creation of blocks (i.e., are not time-limited), these validators could create forks that start from t1, and run up until the present. It differs sharply from proof-of-work (PoW) systems, in which creating blocks involves time (for instance, Bitcoin difficulty adjustment) as well as physical resources (for example, energy for computation itself) rather than just cryptographic keys. Because clients of a PoS blockchain are presented with a “valid” chain fork, they will not be able to identify the attack.  In order to prevent this attack on a PoS chain, these researchers proposed a protocol that checkpoints the chain's state to a proof-of-work blockchain, such as Bitcoin. With Schnorr signatures and Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade, they were able to create a constant-size checkpointing transaction. The checkpoints becomes constant in the size of PoS validators and indistinguishable from any other Taproot’s transaction. Although, there is still work to be done but this is the only checkpointing protocol that is not dependent on any central authority.",

      "body": "That's putting lipsticks on a pig.The PoS protocol is fundamentally flawed, finding workarounds for little issues that keep popping up is not going to solve the real issue. The protocol itself has to be replaced by something else. Not to mention that this proposal sounds like it would be spamming bitcoin blockchain!It also didn't need to use Taproot, it could have been done using OP_RETURN so that the spam doesn't also spam the node's chainstate.",

It is amazing how clueless PoW supporters are.If I create a segmented network PoS or PoW with a greater block height, and isolate your node when you try and reconnect , PoS or PoW your node will follow the wrong chain, no matter what.The absolutely simple solution for PoS or PoW, is whenever you re-sync a chain after a long time on your node, is to verify the block height on a running block explorer.1. Don't be a dumbass and let your IP address get isolated.2. Always Verify the Blockheight 1st after syncing,  if you have been offline for months. You should do that anyway. @pooya87So what are your plans after the US & Europe ban PoW mining?",

ERCOT manages the Texas electricity grid, which operates independently from the rest of the country.\"Crypto mining is adding significant demand to an already unreliable grid [and] contributing to the global climate crisis,\" claim the lawmakers, who further assert miners are benefitting at the expense of consumers from \"huge ERCOT subsidies in the form of demand response agreements.\"The Democratic lawmakers see things differently: \"In simple terms, the bitcoin miners make money from mining that produces major strains on the electric grid' and during peak demand when the profitability of continuing to mine decreases, they then collect subsidies in the form of demand response payments when they shut off their mining operations and do nothing.\"It's but the latest salvo from Warren against bitcoin and the miners over environmental and other concerns. Last year, she spoke out against Greenidge Generation, a natural gas-powered bitcoin miner in New York state, which eventually saw its air permits denied in July.",
