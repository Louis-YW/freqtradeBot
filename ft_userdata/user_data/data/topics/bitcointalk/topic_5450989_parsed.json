It absolutely clearly shows that it was worth $8 on April 26, and now it's worth 62 cents. Are you checking the information you are providing?Thank you for your professionalism, you provided accurate information.But at the same time, I'm not wrong. I rechecked the link I put up and it was correct, Also Chart I put up was correct as well, so I figured there was a problem somewhere.After a bit of research, I found the problem with PancakeSwap's chart. I'll put two pictures to show the confusion that occurred between you and me:This is a weekly chart (PALM/USDT) showing the high of $4.24 on April 28th and the current price of $1.48.                                      While when you click on the two reciprocal arrows shown in the image, you get another weekly chart (USDT/PALM) but there is a difference as the highest price is $8.77 on April 26th and the price is now $0.6:                                      And here the problem occurred because the price is different, I do not know why, but there is a difference between the first and second charts, but these are Pancake Swap charts.Look at the clear difference between the two charts of the same coin on the same platform, and here the problem occurred between you and me because the price is different. I do not know why, but there is a difference between the first and second charts, but these are PancakeSwap charts.But for me, the first Chart is correct, because I have been following the Token for a long time, and I know that the highest price was about 5$ and the lowest price was about 0.1$.In the end, I would like to say thank you very much.If there is something wrong with my words, please correct me.my regards",

I have came across few threads and post across the forum so anyone investing in this project is liable for their lost.",
