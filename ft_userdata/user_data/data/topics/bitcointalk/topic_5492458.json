There is a big change after block halving because the supply will be reduced by half. If demand remains constant and supply drops, expect a price increase.To me, I have a small BTC that I still holding but I already exchanged a few to take a profit and to use it for trading. I hold only a small amount but I still want to add more BTC, my source should be on my trading skills I'm not an expert I am trying my luck and maybe I can multiply my Bitcoin by trading.",

Most persons can't hold enough because they lack patience, and often shaking when they see a drop in price this causes them to sell out of fear early. The only way is not give room for emotions and stick to your plan, regardless of any market situation. This will help and save you alot. The market transfers money from the impatient to patient. Once you build this qualities you will have the inner strength you need to hold in a long run. Invest, Plan and execute.",

      "body": "For a person to have held bitcoin for two to three years and we are just few years away to the next bull run, they should be able to exercise more patience to get the best profit out of their investment having that inner mindset to bear with all market tribulations and changes that occur during all of that process of holding. The control of the inner self to hold bitcoin for this long doesn’t have to do with the amount you’re holding. The amount of bitcoin holding differs irrespective of the amount you’re able to sacrifice and invest into bitcoin and if you’ve made up your mind to invest that amount, you shouldn’t feel troubled when market begins to go against you while having in mind deep inside that it will come back in your favour if you keep holding.",

Now let's talk about long term investors as they study the market and take entry wherein most of their stuffs are pre-planned and they don't rush up to buy or sell, they keep holding for years until their personal target is achieved and some just plan to leave it for years without any price target.

So just imagine doing something and that thing kept on progressing and growing, you Will be encouraged and motivated keep on ( which is holding). And I believe after this bull run. Some those would only withdraw some profit while they keep on holding , because we all believe that $100k and above ain't going to be bitcoin peak bitcoin have alot of break through to undergo in the nearest future.",

However, we are just getting started this bull market cycle.

Since everyone wants to make money from the market, there is no need to sell the token rather it is better to hold so that this bull market is going to attract more profits to the hold that is already available. For those that has been holding their Bitcoin for years neo would understand the benefit of buying and holding because it has been very rewarding for holders. If anyone sell now, that might be as a result of something impromptu that came up allowing holders to sell their tokens but on a normal, no one is going to sell because we all need to make profits from the market.",

To me it was an obvious choice after the first bull market that I've been through. Before the 2017 bull market I was unsure of bitcoin's future, ready to sell if anything goes wrong, but in 2017 I saw my investment go up by more than 20x and this gave me confidence. Even when it went down in 2018 and 2019 it was nothing to me because the lowest it got was at least 5x more than I paid for my coins, so I said to myself that I'll keep holding for as long as I'm in profit. Currently I'm over 100x in profit. I don't think it's ever going down below $1k, so I'm a hodler 4 life. That doesn't mean I won't sell anything. I even sold a bit this year when it went over $70k for the first time, but I'm never going to sell all of it.",

Well, it won’t make you less of yourself if you decide to sell your coins now, but it would be more suitable to sell and reap huge profits when you decide to sell when bitcoin halving is already happening.",

If the purchase is made now, perhaps the expected time period for making a profit will not be too long because it is estimated that the price will reach ATH before long.Hold before the target is reached and sell when Bitcoin reaches a new ATH which is far from the current price.

You are the only one that can answer that question so for you to realize what's the best action that you should do, look at the situation that you're having right now. Do you need the cash? do you have to sell your bitcoin? If not, there's no reason for you to sell and if you're in profit then keep on holding because no one's going to hold it for you but you. You go with the flock that has been holding for so long and everyone will motivate you to hold. Go with the flock of those altcoins investors and they'd tell you to sell those bitcoin of yours for altcoins. Easy? no, but it all takes a lot of time before you make a good decision. So for you to have something good to be done, check yourself out if holding makes sense to you. Otherwise, sell.",

I have a target to sell at the price of $80k–$120,000, and until then, I might not be forced by any other circumstances to sell off my bitcoin. @OP, what can make people hold their Bitcoin for a long time is when they only invest the amount they can hold for a very long time and when they understand the Bitcoin investment so well to know that volatility is a character of Bitcoin and no matter how bearish the market may seem, they should not be in a hast to sell because the market will definitely become bullish again to give them a better profit.",
