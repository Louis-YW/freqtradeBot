Always avoid overtrade or do some trade if you are confident to predict the possible move. If you are spot trading of course youll entry on a good pullback and might have a good reentry. While if future or margin trading, must be vigilant of possible market movement.",

How about not your keys, not your coin, what happened to FTX recently is clear evidence that we should not keep our coins in exchanges, and yet many people still fall for this, custodial is the last wallet that you should store your coin and you must have a good reason why you choose a custodial wallet, I hope those FTX traders can still withdraw their money there's a lot of complaints about their coins stuck to this exchange.",

To be honest i have not really learned anything from the happenings of the last few days, to be honest i don't really know what can be learned from it. Maybe that a hefty dump of the whole crypto space can come pretty much out of nowhere at any given time, as for me that whole stuff happened completely unexpected. In general i agree that you should always take some profit with you once your investments are in the profit zone and that you should never be to greedy. That being said i am not sure if that advice or principle can be applied to the current situation. I mean we were in a bear market even before that dump.",

One lesson that i have learned from so many incidents that happened during the week was never try to believe your money to the cex anymore. There are so many scumbag in the internal of cex itself. FTX must have told you a lot about this. Storing money in cex was the worst thing that has ever done by so many people. The most important lesson that already shown by cex about how bad centralized exchange site is. they can ban your account and steal your money through freeze it anytime as they want. it must the main thing to avoid centralized exchange site.",

The lesson we learned from the sudden collapse of LUNA and FTX is that, your funds are always at risk in Centralized exchange wallets & they are not reliable, no matter how big the exchange is. This is the reason Investors are switching their funds to Decentralized exchanges (DEX) which is evident from price increase of native tokens of UNI, TWT, DYDX, DOD & SFP.https://www.coingecko.com/en/crypto-gainers-losers?time=h24",

Yeah aside from just taking profits, I learned to stay away from social media if you were reading cryptos too much. A lot would surely shill the crap out of their shitcoin just to take advantage of the market we got right now.Twitter is one of the sites I would really avoid right now. Considering the trending of \"#cryptocrash\" yesterday from my feed, I know there would be surge of millions of \"experts\" in crypto so sudden.",

Someone even said bitcoin will go down to $10,000. That will be bad if it happens.

Provide stablecoins to hold more when the price drops drastically and becomes a discount price, because that's a good time to enter bigger profitsThe lesson we learn is that though crypto industry is developing very fast but still far from maturity so stay away from centralized exchanges until they are properly regulated and scrutinized to protect investor's fund.This incident has massively damaged the reputation of all centralized exchanges and people to think twice/thrice before they transfer their funds in any exchange including Binance which is top rated exchange. People didn't like the role CZ (Founder & CEO of Binance) played; in the beginning he came up with rescue plan but later he backed out. Conclusion: Though this fallout is a pain for the short term for the whole crypto industry, but I think it is good for the long term because more regulation will definitely come out now to scrutinize the crypto holding companies.",

You should learn it in the first place, when you first bought your coin, it always been buy low sell high, or HODL until you are in a profit, we are always talking about profit, whether we are in a bear or a bull market, but on top of that invest on something worth investing you will never realize profit until you learn how to choose the right coin to invest and how to build a good portfolio, there's money to be made on a bear and in bull, timing is everything.",

Bitcoin has also experienced a significant drop in price. The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has suffered from the collapse of several lenders and hedge funds.This week's big trouble in the crypto industry has left some wondering if there is a bubble in the industry. Several crypto exchanges have failed, including the main one is FTX, which filed for bankruptcy.There is also significant pressure on the crypto market from rising interest rates prompting investors to sell risky assets. Indeed, nothing is safe in crypto, at least now it can be an experience not to store all your assets in CEX or DEX.",

I think if bitcoin drops to 10k is a good thing and not a bad thing, you can buy bitcoin for very cheap, well worth the wait. There are no lessons in the past days because these things have happened before, you should have learned that lesson a long time ago not now. Knowledge of taking profits or not leaving money on centralized exchanges is the basic knowledge you need to know when entering the market.",
