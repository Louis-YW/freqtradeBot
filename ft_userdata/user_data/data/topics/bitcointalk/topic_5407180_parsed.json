      "body": "Maybe.One has to remember that the only reason TSMC produced so frickin' many fairly low cost 5nm chips for Bitmain is that as I've repeatedly said before in other threads -- the uber-simple mining chips are great for fine tuning production processes before said tech is good enough to be used for more valuable and far more complex chips. Mining ASIC's are very tolerant of defects so even imperfect production processes still produce enough salable chips per-wafer to be worthwhile and that makes them perfect testbeds.Once the processes have decent yields one can then expect any Foundry to:a. shift the majority of their production capacity to more valuable chipsb. raise the price for mining ASIC's",

      "body": "Maybe we can see something like the testing process for 3nm also. But a real production of mining ASICS is very unlikely in 3nm since the prices of bitcoin are low and there is just not a big market at the moment. There are many more lucrative markets since everybody needs chips so they will not use it for ASICS that are not so sought after at the moment,",

To be fair, they have a short lifespan that is limited to whatever appliance you put it inside. So of course all mobile devices will gobble these chips up like a swarm before a single batch ever gets to the likes of Bitmain.",
