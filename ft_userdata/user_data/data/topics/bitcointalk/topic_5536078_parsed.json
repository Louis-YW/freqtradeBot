  "content": "Ever since bitcoin's early days most people didn't show appreciation. While acknowledgment of bitcoin has increased and demand has risen a lot, it's not necessary that those criticizing bitcoin were wrong. What has bitcoin achieved recently? Getting in more exchanges, getting in ETFs and wider access to traditional markets? Sure. Mining becoming an industry? Ok, let's count that too. Does that mean bitcoin is being appreciated for its values of decentralization and immutability? Probably not. While all this is happening bitcoin fees reached historic lows, which is a sign that there's very little demand to actually transact bitcoin. BTC/USD is near ATH levels and yet we're still here, many people want to trade BTC than ever but almost no one wants to transact with it. We spent so much time talking about lightning and layer two solutions while on-chain transactions can now even be send with a cost of close to nothing and decently fast confirmation. People know that if we all started transacting in bitcoin tomorrow fees would go crazy though. The lightning network is far from usable and even for it acceptance is even lower than bitcoin.But people still don't want to use bitcoin for everyday transactions. El Salvador wanted to pivot to bitcoin to save money on predatory remittance fees and boost its ailing economy that was based on two currencies, a national one and the USD. Still people don't bother to adopt the technology and El Salvador still nearly went bankrupt and had to scrap nearly all bitcoin related plans to receive a small IMF loan. Bitcoin remains hard to use, mining continues to be environmentally damaging to a very large extent while it also becomes more centralized and scalability remains an issue. This price boom changes nothing in terms of fundamentals. Bitcoin's price went up mostly due to external factors but that doesn't solve the issues related to adoption. Maybe though in the end, adoption doesn't matter? What are your thoughts?",

The thing is people still trust the banks and the government with their funds Bitcoin came about and grew because people saw the flaw of a system I think many now have forgotten and only care about it as a speculative asset. But in the flaws you mentioned on sacalabity, Bitcoin is still relatively young And still has room to grow.If the government really want to show support Let them fund project on boosting scalabilty (wishful thinking). Quoteadoption doesn't matter? What are your thoughts? my two cents is well We are not ready yet for mass adoption Buying Bitcoin via ETF or keeping in CEX isn't adoption Just crowd We need scalabilty before the world is forced to recall why Bitcoin was created. Quote from: SquirrelJulietGarden on March 23, 2025, 09:50:20 AMBitcoin is not too hard to use for people who can use Internet, computers and smart phones. But how many people do make use of it for transaction.My take from OP post is the fact that despite all the investors and noise How many still care about what Bitcoin truly isBut now on it as a speculative asset Price growth is a side effect of its utility not the other way around but many don't see it that way anymore.",

Whether it's about those who do it professionally, or those who are just jealous that they didn't invest on time and want the whole thing to fail, it doesn't matter at all - it's important not to pay too much attention to such things. I wouldn't say that those critics were completely right, because you have to remember that many of them said that BTC would disappear in a few years, and it's strange that some stick to that same story even today.Of course, BTC as a currency is not something we can say has succeeded yet, but I think many people are under the misconception that BTC was supposed to replace fiat currencies, when in fact it was supposed to be an alternative to the existing financial system - and I think that for the minority that has accepted it in that way, it is doing an excellent job. The fact is that anyone can make a transaction at any time without depending on a bank, an agency, or seeking permission from anyone, and that is actually a great success.Quote from: alani123 on March 23, 2025, 09:33:03 AM~snip~Bitcoin remains hard to use, mining continues to be environmentally damaging to a very large extent while it also becomes more centralized and scalability remains an issue. This price boom changes nothing in terms of fundamentals. Bitcoin's price went up mostly due to external factors but that doesn't solve the issues related to adoption. Maybe though in the end, adoption doesn't matter? What are your thoughts? I would disagree that the difficulty of use is a problem that prevents people from using BTC in everyday life, because anyone can install a BTC wallet on their smartphone in a few steps, buy BTC on CEX/DEX or some third-party method, and then send it to a BTC address - is it that hard to choose the amount, copy the address, and click send? Maybe for some people it's difficult, but realistically it's something that an average intelligent person can master in 5-10 minutes.What surprises me is that you, as a senior member of this forum, think that BTC mining is a process that harms the environment, while it has been proven countless times that this impact is minimal and that more than 50% of the energy used by mining farms comes from renewable sources. 5-6 years ago, BTC consumed about 0.2% of the total consumption of electricity, which was somewhere around 200 TWh, while the losses in the electricity network were around 50 000 TWh globally.As for centralization, once the problem was China, today it might be the USD - but I think we can never achieve perfect hash rate distribution around the world, because miners always go where the conditions are more favorable for them. In addition, in about 5 years (a little more) the amount of BTC that will remain for mining will approach 1%, so this current fever will probably stop. In my opinion, fewer miners in the future could be a much bigger problem than the fact that today 35%+ of them are stationed in one country.",

Maybe though in the end, adoption doesn't matter? What are your thoughts? According to my logic, that adoption accelerated Bitcoin's development. Does it matter? I think I'm happy that more and more people are believing. So more and more people are using Bitcoin. This means that more and more people are in favor of using bitcoin. Indeed, the current condition is a little deviated from Sathosi's goal. Currently, many use it to make a profit, not as a P2P transaction tool. But we see how the current state is trying to create a system inspired by Bitcoin. For example, CBDC, several countries have begun to develop this system. They believe in the security system of Blockchain and hope to develop a centralized system of the government's financial system. So far, I think the development of adoption is important because we have a positive effect. But I also know there are negative effects. IMO",

One example is using BTC and other cryptocurrencies to pay for stuff online without worrying about government interference. Also, its fees going to extremely low levels is a good thing making it easier to use for day to day transactions. To pay for what kind of stuff online? The fees are lower for a reason, the number of transactions have gone down a lot, mostly because people aren't actually using Bitcoin, but holding it. Check the following photo to see for yourself, this chart shows the number of transactions for the past 5 years, we're not that far from the lowest point in this time period.As much as I'd like to disagree, the OP is making valid points. El Salvador's plan to convert Bitcoin into a daily currency instead of the U.S. dollar was quite a flop. Yes, El Salvador still holds a significant amount of Bitcoin, and their purchase price is lower than the current one; it's still failed to work in conjunction with the country's currency.I don't agree with all points though. Bitcoin mining is a strenuous and consuming procedure, but just like any other operation, I doubt it's as damaging as a factory in China, etc. With that being said, just as any other operation can function with environmentally friendly ways (such as wind farms, solar panels, etc.), so can Bitcoin. Thus, it's an issue that could easily be solved, while I also believe that Bitcoin mining is the least of our worries for the environment as we speak.",

We are in a transitional period where it is being adopted but not highly transacted. If traditional businesses start to accept and transact Bitcoin, the network will generate both fees and demand that will continue to appreciate it. At the moment it seems infrastructure is being put into place to make this a reality. As time goes on, it becomes a longer term play.

This price boom changes nothing in terms of fundamentals. Not entirely true about environmental damage...at least, it's something that has not been as bad as made out to be and is continually improving. There are a lot of solutions now that are much better for the environment, and as it has been the entire time, there are much worse things that are effecting the environment than mining Bitcoin. Centralization might seem like an issue however I don't think it will be an issue given how many nations are now seeking to make it a part of their critical infrastructure due to benefits it has on e.g. grid regulation.
