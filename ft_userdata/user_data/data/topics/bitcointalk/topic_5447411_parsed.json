  "content": "The war against USD dominance!Let's look into the current situation. If you are someone who needs to know in detail. Please use the keyword Dedollarisation on Google and you will find many articles on this issue. Some of those articles might date back to 3 or 10 years. Getting back to what has happened this month.One of the biggest allies of the USA in the middle east is Saudi Arabia. They are in the process to dit h USD and accept Yuan. This transaction will happen as of now with China. China has already convinced France with an LNG trade using Yuan. I am sure the USA never expected such a transaction to happen. The country with whom the USA is fighting a proxy war has already or is in the process to agree to trade in Yuan.Brazil has already agreed in using Yuan for trade with China.BRICS countries have already announced that they are in the process of developing a new currency for trading. I am hoping it will be Yuan]Considering such development and seeing USD getting hammered in the international market. It is now the right time to announce that USD can now be officially called a shit coin. Can we call USD a shitcoin from now on?Edit 1: Japan is will purchase oil from Russia. Do you think they will ditch USD for purchase or they will use their Yen? What do you think?Edit 2: Now the statement from French President might become the nail in the coffin for USD.",

It would be also naive to believe the United States will remain still as China expands her influence in the middle east, Africa and Latin America, specially if the next president of the United States ends up being a Republican willing to challenge Chinese dominance.",

Meaning that they've got an agreement but it's not yet happening until it does.Â  I remember that I watched a video recently explaining how this has come into reality it has been there for several years ago and it's just waiting to happen. So, with all of these agreements and papers works, they've come all united to have some considerations on what they are up to and that's to detach from the pair of using USD with their trades. Yes, the Chinese Yuan will be their main currency of trade and that's why it's looking to be a threat to the US economy especially if other countries rich in oil will join this global treaty. We will wait and let's see how things going to work for BRICS and the USA.",

Can we call USD a shitcoin from now on?Â Personally, I call it dirty currency from a long time ago!!!The United States had to know that its policy of dominating the world through force and through the dollar would fail one day. They are now reaping the result of their policy now, this policy that has generated hatred among many peoples.Not only the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but there are many countries that are now seriously considering abandoning the dollar. Even here in the field of crypto, they are starting to think about using a fiat currency other than the dollar.",

President Xi said to Putin recently, â€˜changes are coming, not seen for 100 years.â€™ Buckle up.I honestly find it funny that people still consider Putin as a politician/war strategist and president of the Russian Federation.Not longer than yesterday he doubled the boarders with NATO as Finland officially joined the Western Alliance while he claimed as the objective of the \"special military operation\" is less NATO on Russian borders.I think yesterday all the world saw this failing miserably.Xi from China is no different than him but of course much smarter as Xi has not made his country an isolated one full of sanctions like Putin did,but these two are failed politicians in my view.As for US bullying other countries I find it difficult for some people to say US is bullying other countries while Russia is committing horrific war crimes every day and all the world has seen,things which have led to a arrest warrant for Putin,so dollar is still going strong despite being down now for different reasons and calling it a shitcoin or hoping for a new alpha has no meaning at all.",

But they should rejoin the International Court of Justice, abide by the Rome Statute, and send those Americans responsible for these senseless wars to the Hague for them to be tried for various crimes against humanity. Russia has not apologized, maybe they will do theirs in the future.

And thinking about the aftereffects it may have on the whole world economically (if it really does fail even more and become a shitcoin), is making a lot of people panic already. While the level varies from person to person, it is an undeniable fact that anyone that is aware cannot easily ignore this. Which is why some people are already preparing themselves for the possibilities. Which in my opinion is a good thing whether we reach that point or not.Right now, when everyone is busy pointing fingers, it doesn't really matter that much anymore whose fault it is or whose sins are heavier than the other. What's important right now would be for the leaders to set aside their own greed, egos or whatever selfish reasons they may have for refusing to unite. The leaders must take the first step and for the first time focus on putting the well-being of the people above anything else. Because if not, things will only get worse from this point on, and I guarantee that regardless of the winner, it is the whole world that would suffer, and no one will be safe from the result of all these foolishness.",
