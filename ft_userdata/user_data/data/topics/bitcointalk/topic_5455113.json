People who set a goal in life try to do something to fulfill that goal in life but those who have no goal in life do not even try to fulfill their goal. Suppose a person earns $5 a day and has no set goal in life. He earns $5 a day and spends $5 and lives like that. But another person earns $5 a day but has a goal in life. Earning five dollars a day, he invests in a place without spending five dollars to fulfill his goal. That is, even if the second person suffers for a short period of time, he is more likely to succeed later.Â  So each of us should have a specific goal in life.",

Hence they lost private keys of their coins.Quote2. How much will involved?Non sense question.Quote3. How long do I want this?Only you can answer this. It will depend on your plan to reuse the capital you use to buy bitcoin or if you don't have other saving to use for emergency, you will have to sell your bitcoins anytime, even tomorrow.Quote4. What is my target in the next five years?Depends on your knowledge about bitcoin cycles and your greed.Quote5. Is it futuristic or gambling or daily income?Answer it by yourself, I don't know.Quote6.

So it's quite wrong to say that many people have no purpose in buying Bitcoin, because their goal is just those two. Moreover, it's quite stupid if someone buys bitcoins without a purpose, especially if they just go along with people without knowing the purpose of buying bitcoins.",

It all depends on the motives of a particular person. There are some who sees Bitcoin as an investment alone, and there are some who sees it as an asset. At the end of the day, what's important is you achieved your goal. If you see Bitcoin as an asset where you can get profit from investing into it then there's no problem there. Now if you sees Bitcoin as a currency that can be used as an alternative mode of payment then there's nothing wrong there. Bitcoin was created as a currency at first, but over the years, people are seeing it as either an asset or both a currency, and an asset. As for me, I only have 2 reasons on why I'm purchasing Bitcoin. One is I want to have access to my own money, and the other one is that I want profit.",
