Meme coin has no utility and people that buying doesn’t intend to hold long term because the project itself has no long term goal. You are just competing to other investors to sell in profit short term when you buy this coin. Simply you are putting money on a sinking both even from the start.Quote from: Jocuserious on July 16, 2023, 04:45:28 PMwhat effect do you think this could have for the bull market!Meme coin is negligible and only has a very low marketcap. The liquidity on this token is just temporary. They are nothing to be considered.",

Do you think it is really risky? what effect do you think this could have for the bull market!It isn't really risky at all.It is very, very, very risky.Meme coins come, and go. Though I believe that there will be a time in the future where Meme coins will be on hype again, most of them will not last for years because most if not all of them are just being created for the sake of scamming people. If you are thinking of investing into these meme coins, there is one word that I will say to you. \"DON'T\". If you are risking your money investing into something, at least not into meme coins FFS. I tried investing on a random meme coin, and lost all of it. F*ck MEME COINS!!!!!I believe that there will be a next meme coin hype in the future, but I think that it will not be the same as what it was at first. For sure, only few investors will try to invest into these meme coins again once they got hyped because they've learned from the past 2 meme coin hypes. Those who invested, and lost money investing into it will not touch them anymore, and those who learned from the experience from somebody will also not invest into them. As for me, I will not touch them at all.",

There's nothing special about meme coins anymore. Do you think that there's something special still with them? Because I think that even if the bull run comes, some may emerge and becomes a hype again to the market. But then, that won't last long as the typical market will drop a bomb to all of these altcoins when the dump comes which is going to start by the whales that are playing on these alts like meme coins.",

Maybe there are some meme coins but they're not hyped which is why they just ignored. And asking if it was risky. Well, we have all know ever since that investing in altcoins is risky and much more than investing in hyped projects and those projects that don't have a use case. Yet, they are possible to rally during the bull season but as an investor, you should have to take extra caution from buying these coins as they are not known for their market sustainability, they will drop fast.",

PEPE is quite interesting because it attracts attention and it pumps and there is no top influencer behind it to trade PEPE, but yes in terms of meme coins we have to really invest according to the money we can afford to lose, there is no utility in making excuses, they just a mere entertainment coin at first for the community.That's right, and we have to understand the moment where we have to buy and sell quickly, otherwise people will be ahead of you.",

The bullish trend is what pushed them to come out, otherwise they would be shy coming in the bear market because then their agenda would not be fullfilled. These coins are created by pure evil minds and stepping into one is like applying an axe on your own feet. The hype is what sells these coins ton naive investors who think the coin is going to go up, it will be that will be capitalized by the owners and not the investors.Indeed a high risk operation but some people will make money from it the cunning ones.

The fact that only a few of them are legit while almost all of meme tokens in the market are scam token. Can you still able to call it as a non risky token? Meme token posses the biggest risk in the crypto. There's no roadmap, anon team, scam function being placed in the smartcontract and many more. The only stupid people who are gonna try to buy it from the market once there are so many legit tokens in the market. Meme token has no impact to the bull market. Otherwise meme token is just only a pleague for the bullish trend. So many scam tokens being created for the scamming purpose. That was only giving bad image to the crypto.I think that if you are trying to analyze it carefully and you will know if meme token will never give good impact to the crypto ecosystem. It's only ruining people's life.",
