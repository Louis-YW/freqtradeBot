The launch of a Bitcoin ETF could definitely be a contributing factor, but it's important to consider other influences like traditional market trends and investor confidence.",

In this cycle, they pumped hard only after Bitcoin but I see it as a tool for market makers to attract newbies to this market. Newbies come mean new capital will appear in this market and after earning big from memecoins, they will rotate capital to other categories or lose what they earned easily.Bitcoin, Layer 1 and Layer 2 will be my choices.",

But sincerely speaking your absolutely right, Bitcoin has a strong influence on the market and that has made all other alternatives to Bitcoin excel. This tweet is definetly frustrating if you read it more often. The impact of the rise of Bitcoin and how it affected the cryptocurrency market should have had a clear explanation in this tweet. I guess something can be done about it. Maybe we should reply to the tweet in a polite manner, we could just ask them a question like; Great news! for all crypto enthusiast but didn't Bitcoins rise after the approval of the ETF play a vital role in the success of the market?",

      "body": "Well, technically, some altcoins occasionally grow by a lot without relying on Bitcoin in any way. Sometimes the market overall is not doing well, but some altcoins are. That can be observed by sorting the coins on a website like Coingecko by growth over 24 hours or over 7 days. People are not necessarily interested in the cause if they're after profits, you know. For example, if Memecoin grew by a lot more than Bitcoin, some might not care about the causes and focus on potential profits of whatever's growing for whichever reason.That being said, considering that their list includes items with fairly modest growth (39%, 64%), I agree that it seems unfair that Bitcoin isn't on this list.",

If not then tell me the reason why and if yes you agree with me tell me why we cannot force them with collective efforts to disclose the reason behind the narrative.I wouldn’t be pissed as a bitcoiner because you know bitcoin isn’t even supposed to be in same narrative as this, bitcoin is the head of the pack and it spare head the bull run, no need of conviction from any researcher. Now to how that list was compiled, it is definitely based on the total return a category of coins makes over a time. We can’t deny the fact that the number which is memecoins has definitely been on the raise due to the number of airdrop tokens lunching and also some other tokens getting developed. The second which is RWA which has just flipped AI tokens to go second due to the recent increase of attention of entities into building of their own tokenized coins like blackrock and this has caused FOMO into the RWA sector. The AI tokens follows due to the increased use of AI tools over the past two years. Now if you look at this categories you can simply see something In common which is volatility which comes with it. This volatility over a short period of time makes their price grow ridiculously high which is the reason for them having such a higher returns to rank them higher than the likes o fb bitcoin. To be honest I don’t see bitcoin going up In this kind of list because it’s volatility isn’t like this shit coins even though they say it’s volatile. For Altcoins lovers who are looking to get rich quick then this is the narratives they need to look into. Bitcoin isn’t in their pack, it is an asset and not a get rich quick coin. So it is definitely ok that it is exempted from the list",

We all know that even though bitcoin will not be giving you 10x your money in a short amount of time, it is the best investment you can make right now. Although of course patience is the key.Only people who aren’t that familiar with bitcoin will think that it might not be performing that good.
