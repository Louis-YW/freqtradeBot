  "content": "Many major and minor conferences occur worldwide for people to gather and discuss blockchain development and the crypto industry. Everyone can find a lot of helpful information and make the necessary acquaintances during such events. According to our research, the list of cities hosting the most events in 2022-2023 is topped off by:London - 26 events;New York - 25 events;Rome - 20 events;Dubai - 16 events;San Francisco - 13 events;Miami - 13 events;Singapore - 10 events.Looking at the data, London emerges as the world's blockchain capital, with New York falling just a tiny bit short of taking the lead in this competition. However, it is not only the number of events that matters, but also the number of people they attract, and how many valuable decisions they inspire.Hundreds if not thousands of blockchain events take place worldwide, promising visitors the opportunity to interact with leading experts in the field and familiarize with the latest innovations. Still, only a few of them are truly worth the visitors' time and money.In 2018, before the pandemic, New York exploded with closed parties arranged by crypto investors and millionaires participating in one of the most famous blockchain conferences in the world — Consensus 2018. Aston Martin sport car raffles, whose cost starts at $150 000, rental Lamborghinis, long viewed as the necessary attribute of dolce vita, and nightclubs with extravagantly clothed waitresses—despite the fall of Bitcoin in the first half of 2018, the industry continued to live a life in which Bitcoin traded at $20,000.Holding blockchain conferences at the time was almost more profitable than trading, especially given the significantly lower risks. CoinDesk, the organizing company, earned about $8 million on tickets to the Consensus 2018 blockchain conference alone.The prolonged recession in the cryptocurrency market has also affected conferences. The main complaint against blockchain event organizers was sloppy speaker selection: employees of dubious cryptocurrency companies or total newcomers with little knowledge of technology would at the time often make the list anyway. Now that the world of cryptocurrencies has more or less stabilized, the public's awareness of the field has grown, and people have grown much more picky when it comes to event speakers, especially considering ticket prices and the distance one has to travel.From this, it can be deduced that the number and quality of blockchain events held in certain cities may vary depending on the speakers, organizers, and the number of people locally engaged in the industry.Relevant minor events are often held in the same city a day or two before and after a significant conference, increasing their visibility. For example, Facebook and meetup.com turn out to be well-suited for finding such events in Bangkok. Here you can immediately find a discussion held by blockchain enthusiasts with the unusual name of Satoshi Square. Upon joining, you will see how everything in the local blockchain community works and find access to local investors, partners, and resources. Meetups like Satoshi Square take place in venues such as bars and cafés, where one can meet the leaders of the local Google Developers Network. Minor events are a starting point of entry into the local hangout and an opportunity to make new acquaintances. Such events are often free or relatively inexpensive.There are several ways to go about finding the most successful blockchain events — you can, for example, follow a noteworthy speaker to the place where a significant event is set to take place or go through our list and choose the city with the most blockchain events and try to visit as many of them as possible. It all depends on the goals that you want to achieve visiting such conferences in the first place.It is worth remembering that the situation can change at a moment's notice. Some experts believe that every region may have its own center. For Europe, that would be London. In North and South America, most crypto enthusiasts congregate in New York. For Asia, Singapore plays the role of crypto Mecca, while in Africa and the Middle East people are drawn to Dubai.",

There are many reasons a city can host an even one is its popularity, how advanced is the city, tourist attractions and hospitality. All this reasons and more can make events get hosted in those cities. So I won't say your list and reasons for it solely qualifies those cities to be the blockchain capital.I think we should look at which cities uses crypto more, how are laws and restrictions on crypto in them, government and institutions acceptances for crypto-currency, how is the crypto education especially to the next generation like.",

If there is a capital they might merit the distinction.Given the history of the internet I wouldn't be surprised if someone tried to establish a capital somewhere in international waters. There is unclaimed land near the mojave desert and far south not far from antarctica. Perhaps cryptocurrency capitals could be established there. Or perhaps one might eventually be established on mars or the moon. All of the motivation for such things appears to have waned. Local governments have shown that they will not tolerate such positions to be established in international waters near their borders. Which could have put a damper on things.People have flocked to find sympathetic representatives. There are a few US states who are sympathetic or even supportive of crypto. While other US states have adopted the opposite approach. I don't think its too hard to tell which direction the wind is blowing. But you can never tell.",
