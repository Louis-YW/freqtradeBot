      "body": "Hey dozers. Very interesting bar. Not really familiar with clay cast's products, so I tried to look it up. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5222206 - Were only 5 bars actually produced or are the other 5 bars sold unfunded? I wonder, because the weight is missing for #6 to #10, so probably there are only 5 of this run of bars in existence?",
