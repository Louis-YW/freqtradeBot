  "content": "According to this report, the The National Police of Ukraine (NPU) takes down a cyber crime group that targets victims of crypto fraud and appearance that they are going to be help by this people. Take note that this is group is like a call center, they phone their potential victims and then they spoof the phone numbers of Banks so it look genuine outside.And then they will ask those people to send money in account where the groups have control of. And so obviously, there will be no \"commissions\"s for this victims, except that it's a double whammy for them.QuoteInvestigators of the Main Investigative Department of the National Police of Ukraine together with the SBU blocked a criminal scheme of misappropriation of funds of citizens of Ukraine and European Union countries under the guise of exchange trading in cryptocurrency, securities, gold and oil.For the operation of the cross-border fraudulent mechanism of misappropriation of funds, the organizers used high-tech equipment and software, which allows to change the phone numbers of the attackers to the numbers of state banking institutions.In addition, the members of the group, using the contact databases of foreign citizens, against whom similar fraudulent actions were previously committed, on behalf of the so-called \"Community of cryptocurrency brokers\" offered victims to return the stolen cryptocurrency for a \"commission\".After receiving consent to return the lost money, people were sent details for transferring the \"commission\" to the accounts of the participants in the criminal scheme. After receiving the funds, communication with the \"brokers\" was interrupted and payments were not made.https://www.npu.gov.ua/news/kiberzlochini/naczpolicziya-vikrila-merezhu-call-czentriv-figuranti-speczializuvalisya-na-finansovix-aferax/",

Probably just part of a smaller group of cyber criminals in Europe targeting everyone from cryptocurrencies to oil and gold people. I guess it is the proverbial \"all is fair in love and war\".And it's the typical call center that we known of, maybe they are 24x7 on rotation and their family thinks that they have a regular job. Yeah, instead of putting them on jail, bring them in the front line and fight for their motherland like the rest of the Ukrainians.",

We should expect an increase in cybercrime in Ukraine. The war has destroyed the economy of the nation and many people are now unemployed. The government is now spending so much more on protecting lives and property than the welfare of the citizens. In order to survive in a country that has few opportunities, crime is the closest option for many. But it is quite amazing that the in the face of chaos and uncertainties the Ukrainian cyberpolice is still effective.It is very disheartening to see these unpatriotic Ukrainian robbing people that are going through a lot of pain and suffering. It is possible they might have scammed people that have lost loved ones because of the war, thereby causing them more anguish and heartbreak.",
