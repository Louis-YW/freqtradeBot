I saw most people are spending 3000$+ in gas fees on their main net by expecting 10000$+ airdrop. But all forget about the Zetachain ecosystem. They are planning to release their Main net in q3 2023. ZetaChain ecosystem is something, also their funding and partners are also cool. So what are your thoughts about this? I'm following Zetachain since 2021. Is anyone here trying their testnet and getting all the Galaxy nfts? They released some new tasks from layer 3 and also introduce a guide pin. Since it's layer 1 I think they will give an airdrop for users who are with them since the start. Did you try their testnet? How about your thoughts here?",

I am using the zeta chain testnet as well. Because the zeta chain is a layer one project. If any layer one project launches a main net, then they will release a token as well for the gas fees. Currently, we have collected points based on the number of swaps. My assumption is they will take those points to whitelist for a sale or an airdrop.",

How about your thoughts here?I am swapping at least once to earn 7,000 ZPs on Zetachain Labsâ€™ platform every week and other Zetachain related tasks. Also I am farming in other testnets like Scroll Alpha, Fuel, Taiko and Shardeum. Any testnet that is legitimately backed by Binance Labs and other big venture capitalists. But I am also farming on mainnets like LayerZero, zkSync Era, Linea, Polygon zkEVM, etc. Regardless if it may cost me gas fees, NFT minting and passes, I am betting on the chances as an early adopter like what Arbitrum and Optimism have done last time.",

My strategy to wait until the launch of main net instead of wasting my time to working on all of testnet tasks. The fact that if i rarely saw project dropping their coin for the test net users. I expect nothing from testnet. That's pretty much the same as when linea was only giving NFT as a reward for all of test net participants. I expect main net is always become the key point to be qualified for airdrop.",

Remember APTOS gave 1500 coins to their testnet users who minted just only one NFT. Also, SUI gives a chance to those who joined their discord channel long ago. But we must admit that they gave a chance to their friends and family members first. Then exchanges like Bybit, OKX and Kucoin did the same thing.",

Actually mainnet is important for them but sometimes they also reward people who do testnet. Like the sei its not yet announcing an airdrop but from what Ive see they will give some rewards to some people who did their series of testnets. But like you said, some of these testnets are not giving off airdrop and focusing on mainnet alone. The difference is they incurred funds and of course free task are also good thing but we shouldnt expect really since its a 50% chance only.",

If an project has attracted a lot of money as an investment, then it is already under the close attention of the entire crypto community and, accordingly, they are in no hurry to make statements that early users will be rewarded.",
