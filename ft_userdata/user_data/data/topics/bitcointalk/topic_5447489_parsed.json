You should learn how to choose a topic for your thread because this write-up is inconsistent with the subject. Your topic is talking about the importance and the hatred for money, while the body and the link are talking about the hypocrisy of some anti-bitcoin politicians. I will recommend you go through this thread 7 Rules for Writing a Good Post Title and read some of the comments there, they will be helpful.I don't think anybody hates money because without money you can't buy anything which means you might not survive. But if you mean, why do people hate bitcoin and attack it? The government wants to always control, supervise and determine the financial lives of its citizens. They don't like bitcoin because it promotes freedom and privacy which limits their aim of totally overseeing people's finance. To achieve their aim they pretend to love the environment and claim to be protecting it. They accuse bitcoin mining of contributing to global warming, while they are the major contributors.",

It has no connection with the topic, at times I wonder if the reads what he wrote down.However, money is unsatisfied want, no one hate itz but at times the means for getting it became worrisome, some people are deadly to get the money, they indulge in all kind of inhuman sacrifice for the money. That's what people hate, no one hate a genuine money maker, even the Government admire such people. Money is a scarce resource and we have to go smart to get it.",
