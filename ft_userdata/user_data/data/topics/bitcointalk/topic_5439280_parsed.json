  "content": "Hey everyone,I own a gambling site that is currently doing around $15,000-$25,000/day in wagers and netting around $1-2k/day. I was new to the gambling space when I first started out and since then have learnt a tremendous amount. The first few months of running the site were very rough because we didn't have the right developers at the time. In addition to that I was very eager to get started on marketing and had spent a ton on marketing when the site simply wasn't ready.Since then we've found new developers and worked on the site non stop to the point where it has gotten 10,000s of sign ups and where we're making profit every day. Because of the steep learning curve and all of the hurdles we went through the site has sadly ran out of budget other than the few thousand dollars it makes a day. It's nice money but it's not enough to scale fast to the level where I want to be at. If I were to reinvest all the money it makes daily would also take a while to grow.I'm looking for an investor to join me in taking the site to the next level. I'm looking for approx. $100k-$200k. If anyone is interested they can comment their Telegram or other preferred way of communication. I hope that this is the right section to post this,Thanks!",

Moreover I would suggest you to reinvest the profits that you making in a day towards the site and have some cash burn at the initial stage. This will be better and help you to grow your business at the later time. If you still need investment, I would suggest you to go to Shark Tank, and pitch your gambling business idea in front of them. For a smaller equity of the site, they might invest the desired amount by seeing the daily profits you are generating.",

This is a good question. There's a few reasons:1. I cannot take out a business loan as I would get rejected as the business hasn't been around long enough2. Getting a loan from banks for online gambling is very hard as underwriters don't really touch this niche3. Can't take out a personal loan as I do not have credit nor do I have a \"normal\" job which banks like to see if they give personal loans.These are just some of the reasons, hope it helps you understand.",

How are you able to afford paying if someone wins? $100-200k should be the budget you have now IMO if you're making $1-2k a day. How can money be running out if you're making that much a day?

We're profitable but we're not making the amount of money where we can aggressively scale ad campaigns. Regarding your question on why we're making money currently it's because we've done a decent chunk of marketing in the past and players tend to stick around and they keep coming pack. Regarding your question about bankroll we have max bet limits which allow us to have a lower than average bank roll. We don't have any issue with bankroll. The only *issue* we have is that I want to scale the business because with our current daily profit it will take us a long time. An influx of cash would allow us to grow a lot faster. If you have any more questions I'm more than happy to explain.",

So I'm not really looking for a loan although I am open to it if the conditions are correct. I can understand your skepticism but I'm more than happy to walk through the whole business with whom ever is serious. Also I explained it earlier but maybe you didn't see... banks don't really touch gambling sites and don't give loans for such things. And even if I found a bank to give a loan for it they'd ask for at least 1 year of bank statements and other documents that I simply don't have as we haven't been around for that long.",
