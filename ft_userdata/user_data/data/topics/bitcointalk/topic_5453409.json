It would be better if you could provide the complete screenshot while blacking out any private information. That way, we'll have a clearer view of the content.If some Ethereum wallet decides not to show the 0x prefix. Then it should not also show prefix 1 at the start.Note: that the below wallet address is just an example taken for explaining.If we explore below wallet address at any online blockchain platform like blockchain.com or etherscan.io0x71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976Fand we get the existence of this wallet address with details, then we agree that it's a true wallet address of Ethereum.If we explore without 0x prefix 71C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976Fand we still get the existence of this wallet address with details, then here also we agree that this is a true wallet address of Ethereum.But If we explore with prefix 1171C7656EC7ab88b098defB751B7401B5f6d8976FAnd still if it shows the existence of such wallet address as Ethereum wallet with details, then will we agree that this true wallet? Im sure, we will not because we agree that Ethereum wallet address starts with 0x prefix. This is what is happening with wallet address, I've shown in the screenshot.I don't know whether it's bug or not. But it clearly shows something is wrong with Ethereum blockchain.We cannot blame source like blockchain.com because it works on integration with Ethereum blockchain and shows the results from it and not of their own. So, when I explorer the whole given wallet address ( as shown at screenshot) at blockchain.com, it gives the result of existence of such wallet address with prefix 1, from blockchain and not from somewhere else or any manipulated result. If sometime sooner or later, if someone try to get a new wallet address of Ethereum from any popular wallet like MetaMask, Exodus and they start getting this type of wallet addresses with 1 prefix. Then this will be a serious issue with the blockchain.As I said those who is serious on finding the bug or any technical issue about this matter and need to know the wallet address then, contact me personally. Or ask Ethereum community to contact me.Also one can forward this issue to Ethereum community, so that they can at least know what's going on with Ethereum.  Same screen shot of wallet address:https://www.dropbox.com/s/wdmtapdje8jrcac/IMG_20230520_222740.JPG?dl=0",

Im sure, we will not because we agree that Ethereum wallet address starts with 0x prefix.Stop assuming things. ETH has not undergone any significant change in regard to its address generation. We/community did not agree on wether the current ETH prefixed is 1 or 0x, it is a technical fact that ETH addresses start with 0x.Quote from: olvin on May 21, 2023, 05:29:47 AMI don't know whether it's bug or not.

For sure blockchain.com is possible to blame.

Just got something interesting to present. So I did. I don't have to do anything thing with Ethereum or it's community. Even if I find such thing with Bitcoin, I will post it here, just to inform crypto users. Here is the another issue.\"On Ethereum and other networks compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), public addresses all share the same format: they begin with 0x, and are followed by 40 alphanumeric characters (numerals and letters), adding up to 42 characters in total\".It says that the Eth wallet address must consist of alphanumeric characters.Now check this link https://etherscan.io/address/0x1234567891011121354156117981940232723242Or go to https://etherscan.io/And explore the below wallet address made of prefix 0x and only 40 numbers.0x1234567891011121314151617181920212223242This wallet address shows up as existence at etherscan.io having only numbers, with zero balance.

It doesn't exist because the whole set are made up of only numbers and the fact is bitcoin wallet address is made of alphanumeric characters.This proves Bitcoin blockchain search result at blockchain.com is correct.Whereas Ethereum search result at  etherscan.io is incorrect.This proves Ethereum wallet address at blockchain has something wrong in it.After all I have nothing to do with bugs and those technical faults.Just wanted to inform you guys and all those Ethereum users, that's why I posted this topic.",
