  "content": "I welcome all participants of the crypto community!I took this idea from the members of the forum: tvplus006 and RatimovI thought for a long time whether to write this post or not, and took a break to make this post as useful as possible for beginners and for other forum participants.These 100 days on the forum took me more than 4 years.During this time I became DT1 and received a number of other meritsAll my works: translations, articles, guides, observations can be found in this topic:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5235612I am also an active member of The Alliance Of Bitcointalk Translators community, which helps disseminate useful content on the forum:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5442314.0There are a lot of useful topics on the forum where you can learn. Never, and 100 times more, never stop gaining knowledge. Technologies in this area are developing very quickly, and if you want to be a successful investor, you need to participate in discussions and exchange experiences with other members of the crypto community.I began to be interested in cryptocurrencies much earlier than I registered on the forum and I saw many stories where people quickly earned a lot of money and just as easily lost it, because they did not have enough knowledge to properly manage cryptocurrencies and invest them correctly.Don't be afraid to ask questions on the forum, I have seen situations many times when people are interested in a topic only after they have lost money.\"History teaches us that history teaches us nothing\" (C)I am ready to confirm these words both from my own experience, when I lost part of my investments, and from the experience of my other colleagues.There are a lot of experienced specialists on the forum who will help you not make a lot of mistakes.I wish you success in your endeavors. If you take risks, then do it correctly, maintaining your risk management. And don't forget about this community if you become very rich.Best regards!",

Most times when I come across profile like this I kept asking myself questions that why didn't I discovered here earlier than this or why someone didn't hint me about this forum maybe I could have became more knowledgeable than this or probably be among those who bought some popular coin that are well known in the cmc today. Well lemme not go further into detail because no time is too late rather it's better to start than not starting at all. Congratulations on your stayed over here and I wish you long lasting towards your adventures. I know all your good works are greatly valued in one way or the other.",

You have been very active on many bitcoin boards and altcoin boards and I think on Russian local board. You are a good poster that newbies can emulate. Happy 100 days on Bitcointalk.",
