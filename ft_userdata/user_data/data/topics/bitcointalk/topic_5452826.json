  "content": "It's that time of year to talk about our plans for BPD 2023!Unfortunately, I haven't made any yet... but kicking around a couple options for Cleveland, Ohio, USA:Juice Lab, Brecksville, Ohio - 9am-11am... would love to teach someone how to pay using the lightning network... I say someone, cuz my guess is that I will be lucky if I get ONE person to attend, haha.I've had to switch from BlueWallet to Muun, and fees were never low on BlueWallet lightning wallet, and now they seem higher for the couple transactions I've done so far... not sure how much energy I have to set up my own node to save a quarter on transaction fees, but this is increasing the pressure... will it happen in 2023??? ... the years's almost half over... don't hold your breath.Hofbräuhaus in Cleveland, Ohio - 11am-1pm. There has been a monthly meetup here with successful turnout. I've only made it twice in the past 12 months, but I may piggy back off their event in meetup group to try a lunch crowd on a Monday.My 3 restaurants accepting lightning network is down to 2 (one closed), but I've added a barber who accepts the lightning network! We'll see if I get back to this in the fall after summer break with the kiddos.I hope to be back with my final Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023 plans, but in the meantime, others can share theirs!  Cheers!",

I went last year and it was a lot of fun, even though the pizza is expensive here.This year I can't go because we fly to Hong Kong on the 22nd. Maybe there we can find something.  Was looking in the forum if somebody would make a btc pizza contest this year. The pie making contest was such a big success, a few months back, I guess that would be a fun thing.",

It's not a big company like Pizza Hut or Domino Pizza, but a Small and Medium Enterprise (MSMEs), one of my friends is building a pizza shop also, Lucky him, he is enough familiar with crypto so that case several times I saw him making custom pizzas with crypto design. I think I will suggest him to join us here.In my country, Pizza is not stapled food like rice, but quite interesting to eat because perfect with a combination of flavors, so liked by all people, like children, parents, and youngest. The price is quite cheap also when buy it on MSME shop, we can get a very small pizza for only $1 and we can buy 1/2 pizza also for $0.5, so many fans what else if we sell it in the school canteen.",

Now there are different threads on pizza that littering the forum and the board.  I guess you know about [Bitcointalk Party - Discord sv]. This thread was created back in 2020 Just to organize the Pizza baking contest. So, this is the official Bitcointalk Pizza Content thread and also the Official BitcoinTalk Discord server thread. The last three contest was organized within this thread, and I hope this year it will remain within this thread. You may see a different thread in the Games and Round sections or Cyrus may choose to bump the old one. For now, Cyrus Preparing the contest and you may see the announcement very soon. Creating a new thread every year for same contest is not mandatory. If he choose not to create another one, I don't see any problem. About other threads created in different boards, this is a historic event and people might want to share their excitement. Maybe they are not familiar with different boards so they end up creating topic without knowing that similar threads were created.",

It might have never been this high. Previously we used to have more promotion and events connected with the day. This time we weren't able to see much of it. Laszlo Hanyecz, the guy who is the prime reason behind the incident enjoyed two Papa John's pizzas. Remembering the incident we were able to see more promotions availed on this day and cryptocurrency users remember it doing their own pizza's.",

So let's enjoy your pizza together and have a great Bitcoin Pizza Day 2023.I remember it like it was yesterday, 13 years ago, 1 pizza for 10,000 BTC. In today's market, 1BTC for 10,000 pizza is regarded as excellent news. It's a memorable day for bitcoin, and I'm more delighted to see Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao dressed up for free pizza delivery. During its early years in the space, bitcoin was worth nothing and those who bagged it tended to exchange it with pizza, one of their unforgettable regrets, they swiped their chances of making multiple dollars away, at the blink of an eye. On the other hand, they are not to blame; we are all humans, and no one knows what the future contains, the possible outcome of bitcoin was underrated, no one believes it will be more valuable today.",
