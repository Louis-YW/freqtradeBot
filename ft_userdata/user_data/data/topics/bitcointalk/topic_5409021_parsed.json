People will be hacked less when we can catch more Blockchain fraudsters.First step is avoid phishing links. Second avoid clicking links sent to you by unknown user or emails sent to you from unrecognised services. Brute forcing has been a big threat to the Blockchain industry for a long while and since the chains are linked anonymously it is  semi-impossible to track where an attack was launched from and where it is going self protection is always the only way to stay off fraudsters",

People will be hacked less when we can catch more Blockchain fraudsters.First, you need to ask yourself how do people or firm get hacked. Centralized platforms are the most targeted and they easily get hacked due of some sort of error or loopholes in their coding system which Hackers exploits, they can also get hacked of other reasons ~ So in this regard, avoid using centralized platforms incase you are really really scared of being hacked.In a decentralized eco-system, you are your security, you getting hacked or not depends solely on your actions, you get hacked if you loose your guide ~ So in this regard, in order not to be hacked, you have to - Never loose your guide - be guided always, and always adhere to security protocols. Keep yourself always updated with the latest security updates, you are your own system, the more outdated you are, the more prone you are to being attacked/hacked.And on the topic of how to catch the blockchain fraudsters-In a decentralized and anonymous community, you are a spirit, likewise the fraudsters, they don't know your true identity and you also likely not to ever know the true identity of the fraudsters too, governments can not help much in a decentralized system because they have access to nothing that do not belong to them, they have more power and control in a centralized environment ~ this brings me to what ive said before that, you are your security, if it is difficult to catch hackers and fraudsters in a decentralized system, make yourself also difficult to be hacked/be victim to a fraud in the same system.",

Buy bitcoin instead of scam coins that are never even yet existing but leading lead to scam, or you can buy existing coins that you can see valuable with high marketcap on Coinmarketcap. As long as people still think they can make it from new projects, this may continue. Very effective solution would be if government create a regulatory organisation against new projects and other projects seen as securities. But for now, it is better to just avoid such projects instead, when there is no solid law against crypto regulation.",

And no way to limit the activity of the fraudsters, they will always do their activities to scam/trap people as long as there is an opportunity to steal people's assets/money. Crypto world is a very high risk, including the risk of being scammed by fraudsters. Only people who don't know crypto world who said crypto is a safe place, experienced people must understand the danger of fraudsters.

I don't even understand the meaning of this sentence. Blockchain applications? What do you mean by blockchain applications? Do you mean DAPs in the ethereum blockchain or DeFi projects? The crypto exchanges and crypto wallets aren't exactly blockchain applications.I hear the term \"blockchain fraudster\" for the first time.  How do you define that term, OP? A guy who uses the blockchain for conducting fraud? This doesn't sound correct to me. Can't you just call these guys \"scammers\" or \"hackers\" instead of \"blockchain fraudsters\"?The only way to reduce or prevent fraud, scams and hacks is to be cautious with our own browsing activities and staying away from things that sound too good to be true.",
