      "body": "As for you, dude, you went through the back and forth words; there were mentions of breakup relationships, and then in the end, you just said that you only invest in what you can afford to lose. There is nothing wrong with this; the only thing I don't understand is: what does a broken relationship have to do with Bitcoin or crypto investment?Maybe what you want to convey is that \"investing what you can afford to lose is the same as a break-up relationship, right? That's what you want to emphasize on this topic that you did here. That's how it is in the business industry that you must be ready for all the decisions you invest in. You can't do anything you don't know, or if you don't know anything, study and learn the things you should know.",

There are cases where people got so excited to extent that they sell there houses or bought loan to invest in Bitcoin. Such strategies must always avoided as Bitcoin may go bear for indefinite period of time and you have to wait to get your investment back. I have reserved some weekly amount for Bitcoin that is sulphurous for me.",

Invest those money or assets that you are willing to lose without regrets like spare money only so you don't get depressed when you lose this. Also, avoid borrowing money with no assurance investments.",

      "body": "Some people feel that since Bitcoin is nearing it's halving event, it's best to invest with a huge amount of money, putting the huge amount of gain they stand to profit, forgetting it's penchant for volatility. While others believe that why start with small when I can actually put in a large amount and of in the event that things go south, they join those who regard it as an unwise investment; a waste of time.Bitcoin investment should be considered only if you have a high risk tolerance, or you are in a strong financial position. It's important to maintain a diversified portfolio that includes different types of small investments so this can help lessen the risk exposure. According to experts, it's best to invest 10% into risky assets like Bitcoin.",

Another helpful tip if you want to invest in multiple projects or symbols.For example, If you buy a coin XYZ for $100, when it goes $200 (Double) just take out your initial investment out and let your profits continue invested.This way, you will be able to invest in multiple projects without losing your initial.If it starts going downwards, always cut the loss at 10%. Save your 90%. Many fail to do this.",

But truth be told are their is no amount of money which is genuinely earned that one will lose that they are not going to give a little taught about it, no matter how small the amount appears to be. But this is just one of few advice which is used to discourage people from putting huge amounts of money or their entire fortune over an assets that’s highly volatile.  I doubt how many people actually do take such advise as lot of people turns out to be too greedy and want to invest heavily in other for them to take a huge profit if their investment turns out positive.",

Study, gain more knowledge and if you think you can't still afford to invest the money you have to provide your needs, then take your time. But remember that if you're planning to stay in this industry, loss is a part of your development as you gain more experience. It would only depends on you if your loss keeps continuing. This kind of words are already been spread in the forum for people to be aware, if you're planning to sell some of your properties and take a loan just to hop on the market, just don't. They would not guarantee you profit due to it's volatile risk just take your time to manage your money first. Don't let FOMO affects you cause not all in this industry have the same pace.",

If you greed for more and invest more than your capabilities, then definitely you will end up losing all the money. Trading requires skills and some percentage of luck. If you don’t do proper research and calculations and invest on a random coin out of nowhere, then definitely you will make losses. So always do proper research and invest amount which you can afford to lose.",

      "body": "with any investment. the best advice is not \"invest what you can lose\" because no one likes to lose anything even if its a $10 bank note falling out of their pocket they dont like losing it.if your the type of person that checks under sofa cushions for pocket change. then no amount is a \"what you can lose\" amountthe actual term should be \"only invest what you can live without\"by investing disposable income that does not affect your living situation such as bills, means you are not intent on grabbing at that investment in an emergency. this way you are not thinking about the money or needing it. thus you can just let it sit and wait for the next cycle of value increase which then causes market speculation above that.",

Practically it means if you lose what you invested, your life will still be fine and won't be affected to serious level like you will have to suicide because of your investment failure.It is not the same with people who borrow money to buy something and say they are investing. No, they are not investing anything but are completely gambling. Because they don't have their own money, own capital to invest. Borrowing money to buy something with hope that they will get rich is gambling, not investing. Do this only if they can afford to die.",

Because I think everyone wants to get a high profit and to do that we need to invest a lot of money in it, maybe more than we can lose. But I know no one will admit it because no one wants to be embarrassed. I am also investing more than I can afford to lose, and I still fear that investment will be lost. But I'm sure it won't crash me and I can start over if it really fails. For me, success requires risks and trade-offs.",

Investing in Bitcoin should be done with only spare money but some individual still won't listen and they'll think they're smarter than others and go to use loans to invest.Investing with the amount that you can afford to lose doesn't mean that when you invest, you'll lose it but it helps you in a situation when you don't get the results that you expected from the investment to stay calm and rethink on your next investment instead of panicking.",

Since it is someone else's money, not your own, you cannot afford to lose the money, hence most firms started with borrowed money typically expand without confidence, if the business grows, and with the stress of not losing the capital.The recommendations to \"invest the amount you can afford to lose\" and \"do not take a loan to invest in bitcoin\" are vital, and if adhered to properly, we won't experience troubles with feelings around bitcoin investment.",
