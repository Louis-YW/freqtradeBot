      "body": "How's the regional rep going to promote the Utopia P2P project to inter-regional and international markets. What's the intended platform you'll ask them to use. You didn't say the payments or hours expected to work. You'll have to increase the job descriptions or else it won't be possible to apply for vacancies. It isn't fair applying for jobs with out knowing what's involved.
