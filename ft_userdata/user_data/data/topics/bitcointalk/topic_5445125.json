I guess this the famous bitcoin wallet by schildbach[1] and this should be moved to that board.

You can backup the wallet file, I guess, but the seed phrase backup is never easy.I will advice you to use Bluewallet or Electrum on your Android. They both support RBF too. I am not Bitcoin Android wallet user and I do not know if this would work, if it does not work, wait for the people that are using it, to post. On the wallet, you will see the transaction in the transaction history or so, click on it and see if you are able to see where you can pump or increase the fee.If you are able to get your seed phrase, import it on Electrum to pump the fee.

Where can I see the seed phrase of this wallet?All I noticed as I downloaded the wallet just now was that you can only backup the wallet file and it does not give the unencrypted option, assuming it gives the unencrypted option, you would have been able to see the seed phrase or master private key which you will be able to import on another wallet. You can not see the seed phrase on the wallet directly too, one of the reason I can not recommend anyone to use the wallet.Wait for other people's reply.",

On the other wallet I have the options to broadcast (that doesnt work) or to remove the tx. If I click on \"remove\", will the tx be rejected and coins appear again in the original wallet? or just it is removed from the tx list?Thx for ur answer!",

Yes, you can see the unconfirmed transaction because it is active in the mempool and self-custodial wallets generally show them to you (unlike exchanges who only show your balance after few confirmations).Quote from: PX-Z on March 16, 2023, 01:44:52 PMIf there's a \"remove\" or cancel feature then that would be much better to cancel it as the sent coins will return to the original wallet and you can send it again with higher tx fees for faster confirmation.I don't think there's any feature that can \"cancel\" your bitcoin transaction once sent. Maybe that option will just remove the tx from his wallet but it will be still active in the network and will show back again into his wallet after it is confirmed.Quote from: PX-Z on March 16, 2023, 01:44:52 PMAlso, i will also recommend like mentioned above to use electrum or mycelium if you are a regular android user for security and safety reasons than this wallet you currently using.Electrum is not a mobile friendly wallet. I wouldn't suggest that. Mycelium is okay. And you are forgetting the most popular one of these days which is bluewallet.",

Btw, can you tell for how long your tx is pending ? An unconfirmed transaction can remain on the mempool for 14days before getting dropped back (meaning sent back to the original sender's wallet). And how much fee size in sats per vByte did you pay? That can give us an idea to help you with the rough estimate.",

Currently the mempool says, the network is purging transactions under 2.2 sats/vB, so your transaction is likely to get dropped off later on rather than get confirmed. 2.2 sats/vB is not so distant from 1.2 sats/vB though if its the case. But checking mempool.space its low priority is already at 17 sats/vB so if OP's transaction is still unconfirmed i'm afraid it will get confirmed too soon. Unless pending transactions fall down, though waiting at least 2 days might be better. But if still not get confirmation, drop it, then create a new transaction with higher fee, at least the recommended fee.",
