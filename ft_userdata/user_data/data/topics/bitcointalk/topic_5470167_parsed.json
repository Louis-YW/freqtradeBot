  "content": "I have to write this now because of the current crisis between the two, so that people will know why it's really happening and how things are going to end up in the future.First of all, it's important to note that the Land of Israel is a special place set apart from other lands to be Holy always. It's where the +CREATOR will rule the World from. The right to the Land is typically taken away from the inhabitants when they turn it into an unholy or morally corrupt place, it's made desolate or given to another people who will take better care of it. The land was given to the twelve sons of Jacob (or Isreal) for this reason and was taken away from them occasionally when they corrupt it or stopped serving GOD the way they were commanded to serve HIM. And they were always brought back to the land when they change for good. So the land of Isreal belongs to the twelve sons of Jacob. If you are not part of the children of Jacob, you should atleast be part of them through adoption; by getting baptized or via circumcision (which is really the circumcision of the heart) and you are bonded by the covenants GOD had with the sons of Jacob, and start living life like a true Israelite.  This is what makes you entitled to the land of Isreal not by merely claiming it's your ancestral land or that you are Jew. By the way, whenever the twelve sons of Jacob or twelve tribes of Israel stop serving GOD, they are scattered around the world and automatically become part of the world in serving satan. Once they become part of the World's System (or the World's Matrix) they are usually the least and the weakess in the system. They are cursed, oppressed, enslaved, neglected, hated, the poorest etc. This is how you could easily identify them around the world when you start looking for the twelve sons/tribes. There are exceptions though, those who turn back to GOD where they live in the world are saved from the power of those who hate them and are blessed.  It's important to note that we now have a new Isreal, they are true followers of JESUS CHRIST.  GOD gave the old Israelites CHRIST, who is their KING, to follow. If they reject HIM they have rejected the new Isreal. The true followers of CHRIST are the new Isrealites and a time will come when they will be brought back to a beautiful Israel. But for now, the current people will remain in Israel until removed for rejecting CHRIST.  The current crisis is actually prophesy being fulfilled and it won't end well for those who reject CHRIST.",
