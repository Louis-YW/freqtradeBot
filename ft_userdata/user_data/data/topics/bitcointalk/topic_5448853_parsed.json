  "content": "LONDON/SINGAPORE: Bitcoin climbed above $40,000 on Monday, after yet another weekend of price swings following tweets from Tesla boss Elon Musk, who fended off criticism over his market influence and said Tesla sold bitcoin but may resume transactions using it.Bitcoin has gyrated to Musk's views for months since Tesla announced a $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase in February and said it would take the cryptocurrency in payment. He later said the electric car maker would not accept bitcoin due to concerns over how mining the currency requires high energy use and contributes to climate change.\"When there's confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend, Tesla will resume allowing Bitcoin transactions,\" Musk said on Twitter on Sunday.Bitcoin, which jumped nearly 10% on Sunday, breaking above its 20-day moving average, was up 4.3% on Monday at 40,692.27, its first foray above $40,000 in more than two weeks.https://m.economictimes.com/markets/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-climbs-above-40000-after-musk-says-tesla-could-use-it-again/amp_articleshow/83512463.cms#appDwnldBanner",

Good thing that I didn't know that Tesla hasn't been using bitcoin as payment for their products and services so in a way, I was still informed.",

It's strategic for him to do it. He has Tesla Stocks to manipulate and he also has Doge to play around with. It is highly unlikely he will be manipulating the Tesla stocks after SEC was after him and now the heat will be much higher if he does anything with the stock market after he purchased Twitter. In the cryptocurrency space he might be doing that indirectly like the recent logo change in Twitter with Doge and so on but he will be doing them at the right moment rather than random manipulation  .",

I feel you bro, that was exactly what caught my atttention, the topic of the thread, i actually taught that bitcoin has reached or even break past the 40k mark. But to my suprised its just an misunderstood title and the whole information on the thread is just an old information that has already been past and something that the case with most information past here although atleast i can relate to what others might have felt when they actually came across this thread. But on the bright of it bitcoin is actually climbing gradually to 40k and it has breach 31k today and looking more promising everyday.",

I thought maybe it was a wick on a 5 minute candle that retraced as quick as it appeared & I had missed it. Dumb me for falling for it though.The good thing is that we will 100% see bitcoin at 40k & it could be this year, hey it could even be this quarter. Bitcoin is the apex predator swallowing up investors money.I’m not too bothered about Elon Musk accepting bitcoin with TESLA, that’s kind of irrelevant now.",

And this article won't have any influence on us investors knowing that Elon Musk is not a supporter of Bitcoin but an enemy. In fact, he is just doing this to gain interest and support his company but in the end, he promotes Dogecoin and it booms. I'm not quite sure about accepting Bitcoin because if it is already on his mind, he started accepting it 5 years ago or 2 years ago but he did not.",

Well, this is how Elon works with crypto since then, purely manipulation and a hype. What we are seeing right now is a good price trend which backs up from a good volume, there’s no big hype yet the market pumps, this is a good sign for Bitcoin.",

Well let's be positive about bitcoin price and its progression.",
