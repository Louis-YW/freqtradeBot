  "content": "It seems that a new addition was implemented by theymos, which is very useful for reporters: the age of a post.As far as I see, this messageOld post: We generally do not moderate posts this old for on-topicness, substantiveness, multi-posting, and other \"cleanliness\" issues.is displayed when attempting to report a post made more than 6 months ago.When reporting posts made within past 6 months the message is not displayed.Practically, this message is supposed to help both reporters and mods: reporters don't risk having their reports flagged as bad for reporting old posts (even though the respective posts needed to be reported) and mods don't have to moderate reports for posts older than 6 months, which reduces dramatically their workload.For those unaware, those which used to report old posts risked to have their reports marked as bad. If I remember well, in 2021 or so, you could report posts from 2018 without risking having your reports flagged as bad, yet reporting posts from 2017 would lead to have your reports marked as bad.So now this risk is mitigated. However, I believe that the 6 months is a very short life span for a post to be eligible to be reported. Maybe allowing reports from 2-3 years back would be more useful. For a long time now mods are not overwhelmed by the number of reports, therefore limiting the reports to only 6 months seems too short...Nevertheless, the message is a great addition, especially for those aiming to reach / keep a high ratio of good reports. Thank you, theymos, for this implementation!In the end, I have a small question about this part: We generally do not moderate posts this old for on-topicness -- shouldn't it be off-topicness instead of \"on-topicness\"?",

It might not seem like a short time but, 6 months is still a long enough time for information on a thread to have attained the much publicity it needs on the forum and should it be something worth reporting, one might have noted and done that. Its half a year of we dont really realise that. Still, I don't think it's something that won't be acted upon if looked up. Its very much up to the moderators on that as we all know.Still, the rule might not directly ask moderators to act on it but, its not justification that you've escaped some adversities that could come by the message you passed.

Thank you, theymos, for this implementation!I have realize it after I read this topic since mid-April, and of course the policies taken by the admin according to the expected standards are worth the time.For me 6 months is not a short amount of time, so it should be long enough to mark an old post that may not be worth reporting even if it's only for the purpose of reducing forum spam. Something dangerous is still expected to be reported even though it was made years ago and only recently discovered, and I think the moderators will handle it well.",

What happened a couple of weeks ago is usually old already and what happened several months ago is ancient. If a topic is not some kind of educational or containing rules, likely mostly no one will read anything that old as a half of a year. So necroreporting is only making moderators work too hard but has little sense. It's much more important to keep clean most actual topics.",

The only maths is that six months is a good time to catch a spammer, any spammer not caught within 6 months should escape.
