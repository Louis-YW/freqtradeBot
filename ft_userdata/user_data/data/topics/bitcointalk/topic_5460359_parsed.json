      "body": "Well, it's not really as if most crypto investors are selling off and abandoning their crypto and channelling their funds to AI and robotics, but many crypto investors still have their assets intact but probably want to take a shift to something trending, which is not really a bad endeavour. Perhaps there's one law of investment that says that we should not only put our investments in one place.There was a news story I read where one man was talking about an investment offer that was suggested to him about ten years ago. He said if he had invested just $1k back then, it would have been more than $100 million today. So, I just agree that we can give some new trending technology a try, perhaps not investing every fund we have in it, but just some. One can never tell; it might be worth a fortune in the future too.",

Because as it stands now, you can't talk about A.I without making reference to ChatGPT which was the first A.I that went viral and blew our minds.

It is quite difficult to figure that out at the beginning of anything.

Why waste time choosing between two when we can just use both? I like your idea. You never know until your try, right? If you have the ability to invest, then why stop?",

And let's not even mention the fact that the article said AI and robotics!, and that's something that basically exists in every single line of production right now!",

The truth of the matter is that (and I know everyone knows this) just cause it's not being talked about more doesn't mean that people jumped ship already. Bloomberg right here's making us think that crypto is gone for in favor of other more recent technological advancements without providing proper context. The industry's still pretty much running strong with no signs of stopping. Why are they not talking about that? Pretty sure they're doing all of this to sell more clicks and have people subscribe to their newsletter lol. Sure, investors are setting their sights on AI, but that's not to say they don't pay attention to crypto too! Web3.0 is almost afoot, with multiple enterprises within and outside this industry adopting blockchain technology to make it happen, does it look like crypto is dead?",

These are the most popular and on the top trend right now. I guess this really proves my point. As long as there are hypes about something, people will only focus on that. But even if AI is from the '80s, it had its prime time before and recent hypes are making it pop up again in people's eyes. I am not talking about those who already knew or were interested. I am talking about every average guy who is looking for an investment plan. It has become quite popular NGL. Old, new does not matter as long as both are giving you profits, right?

What I mean is this, in movies mostly, we have been led to believe how A.I is represented and I must say I am among those who was bewildered when I tried using chat GPT for the first time.   Is is about robots? I have seen movies by Will Smith and some great actors in sci-fi technological movies that is dated for 2045ish. The future was already imagined and humans used such movies to map out the future advancement that is now becoming a reality.Am still to understand what ETF is all about, but one thing I can say in summary is that,  the success of cryptocurrency made the advancement and development of A.I, Robotics and ETFs possible. We humans, believe we could and we did it.",

Which i myself see as one of the most overhyped and pointless tokens ever that came from ico frenzy era.But wait, that's not the craziest part. Before chatgpt AI buzz Deep brain chain raised lot more and peaked with 5170% gains if someone managed to sell that peak. So i totally get why some people invest to dead coins just because of the hype. it can be insanely profitable if you don't hodl for a very long time.And no this is not a sleek advert for Deep Brain Chain, i want to underline to everyone that i think it's total garbage.",
