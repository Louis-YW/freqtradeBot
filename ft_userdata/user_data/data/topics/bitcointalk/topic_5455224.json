If it is the issue of a transaction not showing on the history page but the coin showing on the balance, the transaction can no more appear on history page but he can be able to transfer the coin.I just do not like to advice people to do it that way because Trustwallet is a close source wallet. If that is not the issue, Trustwallet seed phrase import on Electrum will be the solution too. But I will advice him to create another Electrum wallet in which he will generate the seed phrase from Electrum wallet and send the coins to the new Electrum wallet which he generate its seed phrase directly from Electrum.",

As you can see from this thread and some others that have popped up on the forum, Trust Wallet is not that convenient now when people have started experiencing connection problems, missing transactions, balance updates, no history of transactions, etc. For DeFi, ETH tokens, or other altcoins, sure, go ahead and use Trust Wallet. It's not like the competition is any better because almost all multi-coin wallets are closed-source and not the best security-wise. E.g., Atomic Wallet had a huge breach (apparently) not that long ago. But you have better options for bitcoin hot wallets and I fell like you should use them.",

Hope the hardware wallet you bought is not the S1 but why is all wallet backed or acquired by Binance are the close source.About the Atomic wallet, it is a vulnerable wallet right from launch and you'll see that another attack will happen right after the current if the dev team dont stop their shady service because the wallet was not create with good security.",

It's also closed-source, but at least it's a hardware wallet and beats the Trust Wallet in that regard.Quote from: suzanne5223 on June 10, 2023, 07:30:23 PMYou did make a wrong because apart from SafePal being a close source a vulnerability was once detected in their wallet, the S1 to be precise. Hope the hardware wallet you bought is not the S1... I think the S1 is the only one Safepal has, so I am pretty sure that's the one dansus021 bought. I remember there was some talk about security vulnerabilities with the S1 a few years ago. I couldn't remember the specifics, but a quick search led me to this thread: Safepal S1 wallet have serious flaws! Apparently, the device is equipped with an unknown secure element chip and not the one Safepal claims it uses.The second issue is that Kraken managed to install alternative firmware software on the device easily. They didn't extract any keys though. The last issue is not directly related to the security of your funds but to license violations. There were signs that Safepal used open-source code that they later closed for the public and claimed it was their own creation.",

I wonder why people don't do some research before they buy a hardware wallet. With such a flaw history I wouldn't have considered to buy a Safepal at all even if it were almost for free. Buyers shouldn't encourage companies to create and sell such crap. You can vote with your wallet, don't throw money at such companies!",
