  "content": "did loan under shasan's termsop:Amount:  0.0168 BTC ($429 value at time of this post)Purpose:  PersonalRepayment amount: $472 worth of BTC (spot price at time of repayment).Repayment date: By November 7 (8 weeks, can be up to 2 weeks sooner.BTC address: bc1qs4f4q7cvs80cfdw46wukcflm9h3n4qky3xngpaNote: I can make repayment in other blockchains if preferred (at spot price of repayment amount on repayment date). The lender should know that there is a level of volatility with this loan which applies to both parties since the loan is in BTC, and the repayment is in USD. If the BTC price drops 50%, the borrower pays double the amount of BTC lent. If the BTC price rises 100%, the lender receives 50% less BTC than lent. I am happy with this volatility and have factored it into my budget. It is assumed the lender is too if they go ahead with the loan More details:Quote from: BenCodie on September 14, 2023, 09:42:15 AMAll of these posts have bullish bias. Obviously if you are not happy with the volatility because you think price will go up, then you won't take the deal. Though if one is happy with the volatility and sees that in a bearish scenario, you can make more than just the interest in BTC, then that's when this loan would be filled. Anyone who is:- Bullish in the 8 week period will not want to do this due to the \"higher risk\" of losing BTC value. - Bullish long-term but are bearish in an 8 week period will see the benefit for us both in a scenario where price falls further. - Bearish mid-long term is irrelevant to the matter (and probably wrong). ... and blindly bullish (think that downside is certainly not possible on an 8-week term) look exactly like this:Quote from: DireWolfM14 on September 11, 2023, 02:54:00 PMBecause he expects BTC to pump, and he wants to pocket some at the lender's expense.  Are you really so certain about BTC's 8-week performance that you can't see the other side of the coin or are you assuming that is my goal? I guess you're a \"glass half empty\" kind of person. Or is something else the matter?You should leave me with a negative trust rating if really believe that \"pocketing btc at the lenders expense\" is the only possible outcome in this deal.Personally, I am not bullish. I am bearish - on the 8 week outlook. Of course, I am bullish on Bitcoin in the mid to long term. Any lender who shared this view will understand the benefits for us both (I get the loan, he gets more coins + interest) - Thus the risk; if the price rises, he loses out on some coins (he does get the interest to potentially make up for that though) and my loss is capped at 10% in usd value.

I have not seen a lender to lend their money this way before and doubt anyone will do. You are not offering them anything interesting. BTC price is down already which means giving your BTC means they will lose their stash after 8 weeks. Who cares the USD value especially the lenders in Bitcointalk.",

I don't believe it's greed. I believe intentional greed would be not highlighting the volatility as detailed as I have. I think that it's 50/50 on an 8 week outlook for bearish/bullish outcome. I think anyone considering all factors for that time frame would see the opportunity and risks with the deal...especially after the explanation. I personally feel more bullish however I also take into account my own unseen factors.As for trolling....I remember when trolling actually had comedy in it.

When trolling someone, it's best to wait for an opportunity when you aren't trying to defend you're own shady actions (this thread is a perfect example,) otherwise it comes off as deflection or projection.2. When the troller is choosing an insult, it helps if the insult is accurate.  Otherwise it won't have the desired affect of pushing the trollee's buttons.  It also helps if the troller hasn't demonstrated the same behavior suggested by the insult.  For example; if you're going to call someone \"thin-skinned\" it helps if you haven't been whining about trust list exclusions since the dawn of time.3. Humor can often be incorporated into tolling, but it's not as essential as many would think.  Subtlety is far more important.  Subtlety alone can be humorous, and often necessary.  Many on-line forums have rules against trolling so keeping it subtle, such as hiding it as a part of a normal discussion, or labeling it as a tutorial (just some examples,) will help deliver the message, and may even lend some humor.  This is the most underachieved factor of successful trolling, and it's no surprise because it requires intelligence.4. Coherence!  In order to be an effective troll you need to be coherent.  If the trollee doesn't even know he's being trolled, you're not doing it right.  You can't make snide comments that are so passive-aggressive that no body even knows what you're talking about.I hope that helps.  Quote from: Poker Player on September 15, 2023, 02:25:22 PMThis section is fed by people who live in poor countries (and have low incomes as well as poor access to credit if at all) or gamblers, and you don't seem to be either of the two cases.Gambling is exactly what he's trying to do here.  He's gambling on the price of bitcoin, only he want's a lender to take all the risk.",

This section is fed by people who live in poor countries (and have low incomes as well as poor access to credit if at all) or gamblers, and you don't seem to be either of the two cases.Need is the incorrect word. I don't need this loan to survive. It would just allow me to go ahead with take alternative path to my financial plan, which involves a bit more risk. I've been considering another loan with shasan except with some collateral and different purpose over a personal loan anyway. I'm leaving this one open til tomorrow if someone does want to take it.Good financial management geared toward growth has to have an element of risk. I balance risk just fine personally and in business. If the loan was executed, I'd be able to alleviate some personal things while creating an opportunity for myself and the lender that will allow me to pay less interest, while he gets more coins (this is based on my belief that the 8 week outlook for btc is bearish). If there is upside for BTC, I believe I bear most of the cost and the lender does not come off any weaker in USD, and not much worse off in BTC when interest is factored in. Gamblers and poor people - that's two sides of the spectrum. One is by circumstance, one is by choice. Gamblers on the left, financially poor on the right. I am in between. I don't gamble, I'm not rich, I'm not poor, I'm just a person going along. Without insight into my finances and the way I do things, you wouldn't be able to say for sure if I manage my finances terribly or not. I believe that I do okay for myself and that I measure risks appropriately. I believe that I am fair and that the loan risk for the lender and borrower are also fair - opportunity and risk are balanced depending on the outcome. If you add bullish bias (as everyone has) then it seems like greed, but I don't see anyone actually responding to:Do you really think that the 8 week sentiment is 100% upward?Or providing a percentage of that belief to at least create some odds.

When the troller is choosing an insult, it helps if the insult is accurate.  Otherwise it won't have the desired affect of pushing the trollee's buttons.  It also helps if the troller hasn't demonstrated the same behavior suggested by the insult.  For example; if you're going to call someone \"thin-skinned\" it helps if you haven't been whining about trust list exclusions since the dawn of time.3. Humor can often be incorporated into tolling, but it's not as essential as many would think.  Subtlety is far more important.  Subtlety alone can be humorous, and often necessary.  Many on-line forums have rules against trolling so keeping it subtle, such as hiding it as a part of a normal discussion, or labeling it as a tutorial (just some examples,) will help deliver the message, and may even lend some humor.  This is the most underachieved factor of successful trolling, and it's no surprise because it requires intelligence.4. Coherence!  In order to be an effective troll you need to be coherent.  If the trollee doesn't even know he's being trolled, you're not doing it right.  You can't make snide comments that are so passive-aggressive that no body even knows what you're talking about.I hope that helps.  What you give is what you get. I don't troll. I am fully understanding of point 1 which is why I definitely wouldn't troll in a situation like now, where you are pretty much accusing me of trying to rip off the community (far from the case, as explained earlier). Point 2/3/4 I guess I'll save for reference but if there's something worth saying - that is way too much thinking/theory for something that is ultimately so pointless. I understand trolling, obviously not to the standard of your apparent PhD in it over there, but I don't care for it. As for who is trolling in this thread - I still don't even know. Either someone is doing a great job at it or we are just extremely bad at communicating with each other.Quote from: DireWolfM14 on September 15, 2023, 03:11:06 PMQuote from: Poker Player on September 15, 2023, 02:25:22 PMThis section is fed by people who live in poor countries (and have low incomes as well as poor access to credit if at all) or gamblers, and you don't seem to be either of the two cases.Gambling is exactly what he's trying to do here.  He's gambling on the price of bitcoin, only he want's a lender to take all the risk.   I'm adding risk to a loan which adds upside and downside for the lender and for myself as the borrower. The lender does not take all of the risk. Please seem my previous explanation and refer to that if you have any questions or comments about who has what risk in what scenario.The offer is open until sept 17 00:00 server time (about 23 hours) - after more thinking, I have got an idea for a collateral loan which I'll probably post a thread to detail, or talk to shasan, after this offer expires.",

Reasonable post up until the cybersecurity forum statement. I had spent a lot of time and added a lot of my own knowledge to that thread. it's evident if you actually read it.on the topic:I was prepared for the risk in the event that a lender who was bearish on the 8 week outlook was willing to take on the loan. The risk of upside (risk for me as btc would be sold) is something that I was prepared for, as this is not a \"I have $0 and need $429 to live\" kind of loan but rather something of convenience. So, if it went the other way, I would take the loss of rebuying and the interest, the lender would take less btc (maybe still more btc including interest, depending on spot rate at time of repayment) but the same fiat value (plus interest).The offer expired on Sep 17 in any case. I've taken another route and covered the personal expenses normally.",
