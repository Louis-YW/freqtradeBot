They have roughly 392,000 BTC, and invested very early and held on to it.Any advice or recommendations would be very much appreciated.If this goes against any rules on here please let me know and I will remove it. Thank you.",

But 392k BTC,",

Either a kid writing from his mom's basement because he's bored, making up a story like that, or an attempt at a scam, and you have to be very stupid for someone to fall for a scam like that, so you also have to be very stupid to make it up; so I'm going for the first option.",

One of these exchanges is \"Coinbase Institutional\" which also offers its services to customers in the USA. So you could contact them first, maybe they can help you.",

How did you find this guy? Through freelance platforms? Do you know him personally? Because IIRC in some freelance groups, there have been clients that have also tried to offer almost the same thing but in relation with money laundering and promised also some commission.If this is for real, load it up on the exchanges that's supported on that client's country or USA then sell those, no need to find any buyer on that because surely in any exchange, they can easily be sold but it won't be a big sale just like 392k on one sell order. You need to do it gradually.",

I have no experience with selling bulks and how the process go but for small sales that I have made, the fees aren't really a problem at all.",

The advice I will give is: sell those coins in small fractions, and while you do so, don't deposit in an exchange that requires you to pass KYC. You can deposit small fraction in a non-KYC exchange, convert to Fiat, and withdraw to your faith wallet. Then you can deposit the Fiat in another exchange where you can trade it to your bank account.",

Thank you.You are trolling us or you are the one being played, there is no other way around it, no one with the exception of Satoshi and maybe a few whales have that amount of bitcoin, and if they wanted to sell some of those coins you can be sure they will be able to hire the best lawyers, accountants and any other services they may like or need for a fee way cheaper than the 10% you were promised, so if you are not trying to scam us then you are the one that could be scammed.",
