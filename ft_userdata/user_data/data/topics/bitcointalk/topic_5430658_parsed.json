  "content": "TrueUSD has launched a new stablecoin TCHN in collaboration with TRON DAO - the token is pegged 1:1 to offshore Chinese yuan.Long-term GetBlock partner TRON is a fast-growing public blockchain of Chinese origin, where users can obtain and trade TCHN.Issued by TrueUSD, TCNH is a sister product of TUSD - listed on 100+ platforms. TCHN is believed to enable more options for digitizing fiat currencies. Offshore Chinese yuan is not subject to China financial regulations, therefore it can be more appealing when using foreign exchanges or other international financial platforms.Justin Suntron states: “I believe that TCNH is a model for compliant and robust offshore stablecoins”.What does it mean for Tron?

      "body": "What does it mean for Tron? Probably nothing. Tron will remain the same. Tron is just being itself, creating something that does not really contribute anything significant. This is another creation that does not address a real world problem. This is just about Justin Sun showing his love for his native currency the Chinese yuan. Other than that, I can't think of any. In the first place, is there even a demand for a Chinese yuan-pegged stablecoin? Crypto trading is not even allowed in China.",

Share your thoughts in replies Justin Suntron Justin has been having trouble with stablecoins lately because they are losing their price pegging to the real exchange rate. I don't have information about the collateral for this stablecoin, but the market doesn't need as many stablecoins as there have been lately.",
