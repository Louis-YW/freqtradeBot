But I am imagining how small the reward will be and how long it will take anyone to accumulate something that is withdrawable.I know that faucets were common in the early days of cryptocurrency, but now I do no think that it is a nice way to promote any site. Especially gambling sites rather utilize different types of bonuses instead of faucets as was mentioned.",

You can buy btc worth of at least $100 value if that is what you can afford and you can hodl it for something until the halving come. You can be lucky to have 100%, 200 or 300% increase on it. So imagine if you invested $1,000 or $2,000 worth of btc with such ROI. This is not an investment guide anyway but it is most reasonable thing to do with btc before halving.Quote from: Radek4921 on August 16, 2023, 11:55:52 AMIn fact, once you could easily draw quite good amounts from the faucets, let me tell you that now I would have a few or a dozen bitcoins if I collected them - but they were much cheaper then and I didn't expect bitcoin to become so expensive.I'm sure you never thought bitcoin will get such to that value now. Or if you knew about it then, you may not have invested like those who also said bitcoin was a bubble and those who used their bitcoin to pay for just pizza",

I know there is freebitcoin that gives you free btc every hour, duckdice is also a faucet There’s no such like you are asking for. Casino is a business and they earn profit through the losses of players in exchange for being entertained to their games and a chance to win.Some casino indeed offers fauce but it’s reward is too small for a user to grow up to the amount which is withdrawable. Also the casino will surely ban or restrict your account once you manage to consistently withdraw balance from them without any deposit.Quote from: Radek4921 on August 16, 2023, 11:32:37 AM do you know any other sites you can recommend?I’ll recommend to use an actual faucet instead of a casino with faucet but you can use Blackjack.fun casino since they have a consistent daily airdrop for players by just claiming the code on the chatbox. The amount is really small but you can withdraw it if you manage to meet the requirement wager or minimum withdraw amount.",

Duckdice is pure a casino site with faucet, I'm not sure how can you say it is also a faucet site. Basically it is possible to withdraw money without deposit in casinos with faucet without making deposits unless there is specific rule that it is not allowed. In the early stage of crypto gambling industry, most casinos provide faucet and I heard that there are some people who were lucky enough to turn faucet into hundred or even thousands buck.",
