So moving onto what Op is saying, I don't think for everyone the learnings should be the same as we can classify the categories of people entering the Bitcoin community some are Investors, Some are Holders and some of them want to enter as miners (An exception) and everyone have their own mindset while entering we can just quote some of them general things.Everyone needs to know what a is Public ledger. (Blockchain).What is Digital currency and how does it work? (Sending & Receiving)How to secure your digital assets. (Wallets).These can be baseline education requirements for everyone who's entering Bitcoin further he can learn according to his requirement of the role he wants to have in the community.",

      "body": "hmm, Op the way you are explaining Bitcoin is not a good explanation of Bitcoin I hope you also need to educate yourself about Bitcoin. In my honest opinion, if we come into the crypto space bitcoin has very less risk to our funds well if I see it from my view I am holding it for long-term investment and will fetch my amount when I reach/hit my goals and on the other hand, as you are saying the risk is too high in Bitcoin asset is not a good definition of it please do some good research on its ecosystem then you will come to know what actually it is. well, let's talk about \"volatile\" Dear it is a digital asset so it is obvious it is a volatile asset. Mention me any digital asset that is not volatile haha. The thing it is less risky to invest in Bitcoin if you want to enter in crypto space my suggestion will be Bitcoin DYRO. Tell me one thing haha if you consider it too risky while entering in the crypto space then what kind of shit alt projects you would prefer to invest in/buy? just asking okay? if you feel good then answer this question. Bitcoin is the king here alone which has been increasing its value since the day it was born what do you think the time when everyone comes to know about it and want to invest in it then you can't imagine where the price will go because there still many people who do not about what bitcoin actually is just like you.Just wait for the time when everyone desires to own it or buy it and that time may be late for them because I think the price will be too high due to demand only those people who had bought it for the long term and still buying will be in good advantage becaure of their strong belive in it. At the end i would like to suggest you that dear do research on it that may help you to understand it. Many Thanks!",

Firstly, they should that Bitcoin operates as a digital cryptocurrency, independent of governmental control. This means its value isn't tied to any specific nation's economy or regulations. Secondly, it's vital to understand Bitcoin's volatility, implying its price fluctuations can be significant and rapid. This volatility can lead to substantial gains or losses in short periods, necessitating caution and strategic decision-making.Moreover, newbies must prioritize securing their Bitcoin holdings by comprehending proper wallet management. Without adequate knowledge of secure storage methods, such as hardware wallets or encrypted software solutions, investors risk losing their assets to theft or technical mishaps. Therefore, educating oneself on these fundamental principles ensures a safer and more informed entry into the world of Bitcoin investment, mitigating potential risks and maximizing opportunities for financial growth.",
