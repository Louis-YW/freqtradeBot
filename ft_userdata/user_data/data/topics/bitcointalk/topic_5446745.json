I'm always glad to see a new poker place...I like old-school design, I registered and checked the tables (unfortunately they are all empty), maybe just bad hours (it's still morning where I am).

      "body": "I am glad you made it to this platform. Welcome onboard. Your poker game is a nice one but your user interface is very poor and not catchy to attract traffic. I had to go through the site and upon registration, my real name was requested why? Unlike other participants who would object that, will it not be nice you use only user ID so as to cover the identity of players on your platform.As I checked your website, there are no FAQ, no terms and conditions, no policy, no customer support on the front page. All these you have written here should be on your front page of your website so that prospective participants visiting your website could see for themselves and have something to know about your poker game site.As you may know, your popularity here is not as strong as you just got onboard which means you will have others to contend with so I will advise you to do a good marketing and promotional campaign so as to gain audience and awareness of your poker game here. You can seek the expertise of a good campaign manager to aid in advertising your project and have it in mind that the minimum period should be atleast 2months so as to create a good awareness of your project here.Lastly, I will suggest to you that you use this thread as your Announcement thread and I believe that you are the representative of your project here and in that case you will have to be active so as to respond to questions and inquiries about your project as participants here are very sensitive to that aspect of customer care service because that determine how they would be attended to when onboard your platform.All the very best as you enjoy your stay here.",

Meet a manager to do the work for you in a campaign for more expansion. I checked the website link and other links provided by you. And you ANN thread is more comprehensive than even the site. You have to add more features on the site to attract visitors. And one thing I will advise you is that, in this days online casino is a competitive business and your service will determine how you are going to pull crowd to the site. I don't know who you are, whether you are here for good. But do well to pay gamblers their wins without giving them stress. Them one gambler will bring 100s of gamblers to the site.

No FAQ, no explanation of which currency is supported or how I can contact the operator in case of a problem. That doesn't inspire confidence. I would definitely add things like that to the site.And as it stands, you don't support BTC. So this whole thread should be presented under altcoins and not here on the board.Either way I wish you a lot of success and maybe I will register in the next few days and test the site more.",

As a friendly recommendation, You should make your casino environment visible without the need to login so that user can check immediately your games offered.

Their threads are not also active. I guess people in the forum are more addicted in other games (dice, slots). They find it more fun but that is what gambling is supposed to be.In a poker game, one might get bored or stressed out because you need to think deeply on here to be able to win the game but the advantage is that you can make more profit on here especially if you face a weak opponent. Poker is still a popular game outside and on a non crypto casinos so poker fans here in the forum shouldn't worry a lot thinking that their favorite game is getting irrelevant anymore.",
