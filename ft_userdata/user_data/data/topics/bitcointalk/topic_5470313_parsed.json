  "content": "Hi guys, Let me start by saying that i am not a newbie, so i am very away that some users engage themselves in merit trade, that is buying and selling merits, but recently, while going through the Scam and Accusation board, i came across this thread, which lead me to this one, where i then saw this User's comment claiming that he or she bought 550 merits from the op of the thread he or she commented on.The comment was made on April 14th, 2023 which means this transaction happened this year, while going through this user's profile data on bpip.org, the record there showed that this user only has received 50 merits one time from this user, who also has 501 merits with just 193 posts and 126 activity.Kda2018 has 550 merits with just 4 posts and 4 activities, and like i mentioned before, bpip data showed that he only received 50 merits ones from Ajpa94, how come about the other 500 merits, where did it came from.I sure know that there must be something i am missing here, but i just can't figure this whole stuff out, the user said he bought 550 merits, but bpip data has no record of when he received the supposed 550 merit from the user who sold it, but rather, showed he only received 50 merits from another user, who also have the same type of data.Can someone with better understanding of how this works please look into this and help make my dull head understand.Thank you in anticipation.",

      "body": "The only perfect explanation for this is that, as stated by Solosanz, the user only earned 50 merits once, according to . Bpip  and the rest was from airdropped merit, and the user happens to be an old member of the forum who benefited from the airdropped merit. And about the activities, it's obvious they were all deleted by the same user, but I can't fine the record of the activities from Ninjastick. So for this user to claim there was about 500 merit purchases from the seller, it only means that the same seller is in control of the other account, which claims there was a trade of merit; the account with 500+ merit was just used as testimony to convince people that it's real and they will fall victim to their fraud.",

Besides whom do you think would accept to sell his account at a very cheap price whereby if they succeeded working into signature they could earn higher than that so anyone giving attention to that thread could likely get scammed by them.",

I once read a case on a reputation board where a member deleted most of his posts so his activity returned to almost 0. But I forgot what his account name was.So in my opinion if he said he bought 550 merit from the OP in that thread then that's a lie. Maybe he is an alt account who deliberately posted there to convince other members",

Users that cannot dig deep and see that it was airdropped will believe it and possibly pay for merits too.It can also be done after a user buys an account and want to delete evidence if the previous owner's posting habits.- Jay -",

I knew that when you delete posts, your activity goes down, which is understandable. However, I didn't realize that it could affect your earned rank as well.
