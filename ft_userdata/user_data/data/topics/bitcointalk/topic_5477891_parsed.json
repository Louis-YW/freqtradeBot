They were complaining about the long block download time. Here is what I wrote in another topic.Quote from: tranthidung on December 14, 2023, 02:02:15 PMDo you see it is a legendary thinking style?Most of us start to be interested in something when there are good news about it but years ago, theymos started to interested in Bitcoin when he saw someone complained about it.Now, two questions for you.How did you know about Bitcoin? From good news or from bad news?How did you know about Bitcointalk?Previously, I thought of a discussion about the first question but later I thought about the second question and it's possible to combine them in one topic.

Collecting 5 BTC in 2016 seems very easy, and of course the price at that time is also cheaper.",

I probably first heard about Bitcoin from YouTubers in my local language and naturally, initially based on their description, I thought Bitcoin was something illegal that was only used by hackers and bad people. QuoteHow did you know about Bitcointalk?No, I didn't know about Bitcoin talk forum on any other forum or website, I get to know about Bitcointalk forum mainly from one of my friends. I would like to thank that friend of mine from the bottom of my heart for introducing me to the bitcointalk forum otherwise, it might have taken me a long time to clear my misconceptions about Bitcoin. The interesting thing though is that before I got to know Bitcoin and Bitcointalk, I got to know TRX coin and made a small investment there.",

      "body": "I think I first came across the term Bitcoin from an IT magazine I used to read.  There were these mixed messages. Like some stories talked it up as this total gamechanger for finance.  But then others focused on how volatile it was, and the risks tied up with it.  Kinda typical media stuff - building something up just to tear it down again.   Anyway, I wanted to dig deeper into this Bitcoin thing so I Googled around and  stumbled on Bitcointalk as one of the bigger forums on it.  Lotta hype and arguing from what I saw but there was some decent info in there too.  Felt like an online version of those magazine stories - some believers yelling about revolution, others yelling about scams, your usual Internet drama.  But it got me reading and learning more at least.",

Then I decided to make this thread in Meta than in Bitcoin Discussion board.Knowing Bitcoin and Bitcointalk has been a good experience for me, and if you ask questions about the two as you contemplated, you are still fine with them. They are such lovely experiences that people can recount over and over again. First, I have been in the world of investment and trading for about 2 decades, so to know Bitcoin was very easy. I don't think it would be more than 3 years of introducing it that I know about it but I never gave it a thought to buy and keep it. However, it got to a point where I was regularly using it for payments and even trading it on the regular brokers, but never owned my coin until I joined BTCt.As for the Bitcointalk itself, my brother introduced it to me. He did that almost about 4 years ago but I never gave it much thought. I just viewed its review on YouTube, and then, when I was searching about it, I only saw just two posts there. The one with a somewhat detailed review was just saying how people were sentimental here, which made me abandon the forum for about 2 years. This happened until my brother encouraged me to open it again, which I eventually did last year.",

      "body": "The first time I heard about Bitcoin was in 2011 on an NPR podcast I used to listen to. They didn't do a great job of describing what it was, but the hosts did a test investment and saw their investment rise over 100% in a few months. It sounded like real nerd money. Was not something I was interested in at the time.Then I heard Andreas Antonopoulos talking about it on the Joe Rogan Experience a few years later. The way he explained it, it sounded like it was going to be the next big thing and revolutionize money. And indeed it was, and it did. I bought my first BTC in early 2014, unaware of what was happening at MtGOX. I didn't understand what you were supposed to do with it as it wasn't really accepted for anything anywhere, and it was getting boring just watching the value go down.That's when I discovered altcoins, and then I found this forum. My first questions on the forum were all about altcoins. Super glad to have discovered Counterparty back in those first few months. Since then, Bitcoin has transformed my life. While somewhat scary being detached from the old ways, Bitcoin offers a great deal of freedom over the traditional financial system, and I have completely embraced it.",

I'm not sure if anyone else has learnt about Bitcoin by joining this forum but I'm the one who learnt about Bitcoin and crypto-currencies from this forum. Basically I was searching for ways to sell some digital goods and when I made a Google search I got a thread in this forum. I was not aware about Bitcoin or crypto-currencies but once I started reading some threads in this forum and then started reading some books I learned that what Bitcoin is and why it was created.I'm very thankful to that guy who posted that digital goods thread on this forum because of that thread my life changed. This forum and Bitcoin has given me a lot in my life and I'm very thankful to Bitcoin and to this forum. I was basically active on digital goods board in start but overtime I started browsing various boards of the forum. Now, I rarely visit the digital good board but it was my pathway to learn about Bitcoin and this forum.",

Every day, for about three years, I visited that forum, and one day I could not access it because, for reasons unknown, the forum was not working. This lasted for five days. However, during this time, I managed to see a video on YouTube about this forum and moved to this forum.I learned about Bitcoin a long time ago, but I was also not interested in it since I was paid on the Internet with other digital money. I will say more: I was offered payment in bitcoins, but since I did not understand it, I did not take such a proposal into account.Once on the forum, I was united by the desire to learn about Bitcoin and the entire climate of the forum, after which all other places became uninteresting to me.",

Had no idea what is signature campaign,, I thought that it can be someone paying money for signups or signing petition . I saw that many members here are wearing colourful signatures, but I couldn't relate it with signature campaign, I thought that people just promote their own projects or affiliate links.",
