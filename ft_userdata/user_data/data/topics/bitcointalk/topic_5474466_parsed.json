They just vary when your account is subject to investigation due to potential violation of the ToS that’s why you should only play on reliable trusted casino which is my number pick for criteria on choosing betting site.Next is the frequency of bonus promotion and the requirements because many betting site has a bonus requirements that is too hard to claim that is almost impossible to achieve without losing huge part of your money.",

I do believe that in the gambling industry reputation is everything it determines all others and should be what every gambler should watch out for before using a gambling site.",

      "body": "The most important thing in an online casino is Provably fair. It's crucial to check that a casino's provably fair is enabled, so that you'd know the house is not taking a complete advantage on the results you get. Although, I've read that some of the casinos still have ways of manipulating the provably fair system. Yet a casino that doesn't have one, isn't a good casino for anybody. Other secondary things like customer services and online reputation are great too, as it'll help to know what kind of casino we are staking games. The casino's time duration; how long they've been in the gambling system is important. As going for a fresh established casino isn't a good idea. Since the reports and reviews about them isn't yet good enough to trust or make them reliable. I'll hardly recommend a new casino to anyone. Payment methods are good too, having different means of depositing and withdrawing our funds are great too, as not everyone would prefer to go with cards or paypal. So, having everyone in mind is an important part of a nice casino to patronize. On the player's end, the need to make these research ourselves is great. Reading their TOS works just fine, not to be a victim in future.",

Third, I think UI/UX makes me trust the site, if they are putting effort on what they built that means they're serious on it.",

The kinds of games they offer also matter, as having a good deposit system and withdrawal without good games can't keep me in a casino as I can't see what I will be using to have fun or the reason for me to proceed with my deposit, so good games also matter a lot to me too.",

Gambling is a financial risk we take just to make profits for ourselves so that we can solve our immediate problems. When we can not get what we want or inspire to get from a gambling platform and we still get to suffer a long way trying to make withdrawal or reach out to the customer care of the casino, this is a big obstacle anyone is ready to handle at all.",

Good customer care as well is also very vital. I will not like to send a message to report an issue and make a complaints and have to wait for days to get a response. Quick customer response is proof that a casino or gambling platform is interested in the satisfaction of their customers. Good reputation is also very important, I would not want to gamble in a casino or betting platform that have many issues challenging their reputation.",

I want to bet with a casino that has a variety of payment options. They should have options to pay in both fiat and reliable cryptocurrencies. A betting site that has an active live chat support system will always attract me. Having difficulties with your casino account could be frustrating but an active support system will help reduce the tension and also assist in rectifying any issue of concern.I also appreciate casinos that are reliable and abide strictly by their term of service. Casinos asking for advanced KYC after promising never to ask for it can be discouraging. The crypto space is very volatile so casinos that allow for fast and easy withdrawal will be highly appreciated. Another important factor is the variety of games the casino can boast of. Casinos or betting sites that have diverse games will always attract more gamblers including me.",
