It seems like their last update was last October, I'm just not sure. Though, it looks like it's okay to buy him even if it's just a little bit.That's why we still need to use dianamondapp to access the Deso ecosystem, based on what I read on their Twitter page https://twitter.com/search?q=Deso%20ecosystem&src=typed_query",

Twitter will be better to use than the new one. Some project offered a tip for a blog post and vlog, but the mechanism is not decentralized as the concept of blockchain. Not to underestimating a project, but with this concept, will be hard to get attentions.",

Did you thing twitter cannot add a tip button ?There has some third service you can use for tip, in my opinion is not really needed.",

But, I think that I've seen sort of this type of project before.And you know what? It's not that successful at all. It is because the people before doesn't really care whether you use centralized or decentralized social media. Just avoid it being tokenized with its own platform.",

Not saying that they are bad, but perhaps since everyone is on Twitter I doubt that we need another one in the market that will really turn things around, just saying.So for this is a risk, you can used it but who's going to used or read it?",

In the last few weeks there were a lot of news about big companies stopping to advertise on twitter now that Elon Musk has bought it. To be honest i find that kind of ridiculous of those companies, the only thing that Musk wants to do is to ensure that everyone can express his opinion on twitter, if it is not against the law of course, and now where Twitter might become a place for real free speech for everyone and not only for the woke left those companies already are afraid because they always want to be 100% politically correct.I heard of Mastodon as a twitter alternative.",

I am looking into DeSo Ecosystem where your recovery seed is all you need to sign into the network and you get paid for all good contents you create on the platform .I don't even think if that's a good idea. We don't need everything to be decentralized. I have seen bunch of projects dead and these projects were introducing themselves as decentralized social platform. No reason to use these kind of social media platforms as centralized platforms gives enough users for you. The problem is when you are not even having so many demands in your platforms and you will be alone.

There's no need for people to use new platform like that. It's only gimmick i guess. It means nothing rather than a new project that became money grabber only.",

As long as you need to sign in with a wallet or buy eth or whatever to do that it would drive most people away. And people attract more people to join so if it's a ghost town, no-one enjoys spending their time with there.This has happened even with working platforms. Google+ was a good idea and it has a change to challenge major platforms, but everyone was expecting everyone else to write content. There wasnt enough people using it and rest of them left. And that was EASY to use. And we might think that some decentralized places are easier to use now then they were few years ago but that doesn't really help when we are talking about people who aren't diginatives.",
