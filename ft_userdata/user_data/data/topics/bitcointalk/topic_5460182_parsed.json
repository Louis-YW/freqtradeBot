There can be some phishing site these days. I went to that site through search engine and it looks original but there can be fake ones too which is the reason I ask the question on this forum. Which means that is a correct Sparrow wallet site not a fake site.",

It has done it to one my applications, which I had written Visual Studio, and involved Bitcoin libraries (which I suppose are used in lots of malwares).

If you're already using W10 or any other version of that OS, at least buy yourself some respectable protection when it comes to AV or firewall.",

I have seen this with work-related apps I run on my end - no issues with them.What you should concentrate on is downloading, verifying, and only then installing crypto-related software from official websites. In that order. Don't trust Google to point you in the right direction because they couldn't care less about you.",

Even the best anti-virus and firewall software won't be of help if you don't know what you are doing and you are gullible to fall for various social engineering tricks. It's better to be cautious and look at everything as a possible threat than to click, download, and accept everything without thinking about it. Or simply get a cheap device for some of your more dangerous online habits, and don't use your main computer for such things.",
