Bank is robbed, but I do not think my money is lost, but if the exchange i am using is hacked while mu trading funds are there, i will panic. But fiat is not an investment means, which is the reason I prefer bitcoin.For bitcoin and crypto generally, the best and safest is to control your coins by having your private key, you have to use noncustodial wallet to do that. There is nothing safe as noncustodial wallet which I can be able to have complete control over my coins.",

Opening a long term position on any exchange, like on Binance, my mind will always be there because I know my coin is no with me, but with the exchange, they have control over it, unlike when it is in my wallet which is the safest and best.If you want to make fast payment and withdraw is suspended, you will sleep well? Or your friend sent you money and it was freezed and the exchange said it is tainted, will you sleep well if not solved before you want to sleep? Do not make false statement that will let newbies to go to wrong direction. If you are not trading, or you have your coins not active on an exchange, move it to a noncustodial wallet where you have complete control. Cold storage for big amount.",

There have been dozens (hundreds?) of times when exchanges got hacked and people lost their coins and got nothing back.There are countless times when people got their user info hacked and lost their coins and got nothing back.There are dozens (hundreds?) of times when exchanges just closed their doors and took everyone's coins and they got nothing back.And so on. Get a hardware wallet, learn how to use it and keep your coins in your control. Anything else is just asking to loose them.-Dave",

And even if they do it will take a very long time and obviously getting the exact worth of the coin left in their exchange is impossible.Hardware wallet gives full control and decentralisation it gives this peace one gets when they know their funds is in safe hands. When seeking a wallet to save coin never trust CEXs they can disappear at any time even Binance is not too big to abscond. Imagine if multiple users get their account hacked in one day picture how long it will take to get a refund....",
