  "content": "So at the New Global Financing Pact in French, president William Ruto of Kenya was afterwards hosted by Macron (France president), Ruto was asking and suggesting for a global financial transaction regime where the procede would be in the care of a new financial organisation different from IMF, World Bank or any other financial institution but a brand new financial architecture of equals where power and governance is not in the hands of few people. I have miss the video but I'm sure the outcome of the submit is in the public space likewise the videos of them.My question therefore is, with the call of Ruto, do you think IMF and World Bank as the global financial institutions have not performed very well in Africa economy to support in different ways or why do you think he is making that call ?",

So, I think it will be a good idea if you could ask this question in you local board if you have.Otherwise, I am not an African and I do not know which type of progress in which IMF has helped you out but if I talk about them in general way, they never intend to help countries without any backup aim. For example, they always try to lure into borrow more money with more interest rate and then at some point, it becomes hard for that country to repay the debt.Then, IMF will represent you some possible way to meet this situation and believe me no one like those options, like if you are an atomic power then they will ask to get control of them or at least will make some situations for your country that will left you no choice other than accepting the deal. Overall, point is they are not good even they helped you in difficult time but they will also become a cause of your havoc.",

All the governments have had set the architecture they want and upgraded it as and when they thought so. We are in such fast moving world that if any major update is to be done in the global system would disturb the entire workflow. Somehow it does not sound good too. IMF and world bank are working with agreed upon protocols. It’s not something that have happened overnight. It’s work of years and decades man. The counter question is, what type of architecture Ruto actually wants?",

If the Kenyan President made a proposal for a little change in the financial system, there could be a few possible reasons for that.1. Either Kenya as a country has not been able to benefit from the system settings since he was elected. Or there was a decline in the said world financial power when the country might have needed some help.2. There might have been some oppression detected from the settings, where just a few individuals selected from a few countries are the overheard spokesman of the system. What ever they say stands and what others say does not really matter or change anything in any ongoing discussion.3. Maybe the African countries as a whole might have used the Kenyan President as their representative to speak to them about what they really want and how they have been oppressed over the past years.Whichever the case, maybe I don't think such a proposal is ever going to have massive support since it's just a proposal voiced out by one person. If something needs to be changed and those systems are being restructured, I believe such a thing should be available in their constitution, which is being used to govern the system.Quote from: Faisal2202 on June 26, 2023, 04:35:00 PMWell, not trying to be rude but I think this question is not asked at the right place because you specifically asked this question from Africans.

It is a topic that is based on economy of the world after they discussed climate change financing. So it is just a thread to talk on the issues arising from the New Global Finantial Pact Summit.",

There could also be from his economic team and consultants that has suggested this to him and he approves so he is proposing it. If we're going to analyze what he's proposing, this is all for the decentralization and I don't think that those countries or the summit where he suggested this would agree on him. They're the government and they should be the one to promote centralization but just on this case, he's not benefiting from these two global institutions that would send them debts and debts. And there's probably the idea that he wants his country to get out of that.",

The answer is almost none.All they have are unending debts that they must pay by milking the hell out of the already improvised citizens through unfriendly taxes and selling off parts of the countries through shady deals with the so-called allies.This very thing is happening to Most of the South America countries and parts of Asia. Until they wake up, nothing is going to change.",

He alleged that developing nations pay more interest for loans they receive from these organizations than developed nations. He frowned at the situation where developing nations almost spend most of their revenue on debt servicing. So his general view was that these world lending bodies can not be trusted because they are not fair to developing nations. So when the world agreed to set up a green bank that will be financed by levies on ships and other industrial activities that contributes to greenhouse gases, Ruto quickly suggested that a separate bank should be founded to collect, keep and administer the funds, showing his distrust for IMF and World bank. He wants a new green bank that will be void of Western influence. It has been estimated that this green bank could generate up to $60bn from levies and other sources of revenue and Ruto wants this new bank to be fair in the distribution of loans to nations to enable them to tackle climate change. Looking closely at these accusations against World Bank and IMF, it is wrong for poor nations to be paying higher debt than financially prosperous nations. African nations get these strangling loans because these lending organizations are controlled by richer nations. This strategy is designed to make these nations poorer and make them slaves to developed nations. If IMF and World Bank want developing nations to become financially stable, then interest on loans should be fair or even lower.But I have a question for Ruto and other African leaders. Can they account for the loans they collect from these international banks? It has been alleged that most of the funds they borrow end up in the private pocket of these presidents and their cronies. African leaders should be sincere to their citizens. Instead of investing these funds in infrastructure, the borrowed money will be siphoned through overblown budgets and fake or substandard projects. IMF and others might have treated developing nations badly but African leaders also have to be blamed.",

But when i already submitted the post and checked whether it has not, and found out that, they have no thread or board which also puts me in the confusion of maybe i am wrong as i did not check the threads in the local section one by one. But now you have assured this doubt of me that they have no board so Thanks for the correction, I will edit my statement.Quote from: Gozie51 on June 26, 2023, 09:20:52 PMThank you but it is just an open discussion that ensued from the financial.....Ok dear op, my bad, I did not realize that even didn't realize that there is no local board/thread for Africans there.",

So it makes complete sense to create a new financial structure to support the nations in Africa. The way China set up a bank called BRICS which offers loans to the BRICS countries, similarly if a financial institution is created to serve the need of Africa, that's a positive. The world needs to come out of western influence. The world has been governed for the benefit of these western countries for far to long and this structure needs to chance to serve humanity in a better way.",
