  "content": "QuoteWhat is sybil?When you use a platform with more than 1 crypto walletWhen you interchange transactions between multiple wallets and use such wallets simultaneously on a platformWhen you send tokens from different wallet address to a particular address (probably exchange address or main address).When you operate multiple addresses under a single IP AddressQuoteWhat is retroactive airdrop?These is when a platform reward addresses that has interacted with their platform. It started from Uniswap; and then more and more and more platforms implement the same strategy.QuoteHow does Sybil affect your retroactive airdrop chances?If your wallet is caught in sybil web then;Your wallet address is blacklisted alongside the other wallets as sybil; therefore your wallet address will not receive reward in the present or in the future.You have wasted efforts, time, and funds in that multiple attempt quest for retroactive funds.QuoteWhats the way forward?If you are unsure whether you have gotten into sybil traps or not; the following helps you;Get a new wallet addressFund it from an exchange platformDyor, and select platforms you want to choose (there are many of them). Then repeat transactions on the said platform; could be daily, weekly or monthly (having in mind that high volume in $ is an added advantage).So the bigger questions; whats your opinion about Sybil and Retroactive airdrop ??",

Another cheap option to get tokens to your wallet without compromising sybil laws is to  withdraw directly from exchange platforms, with Binance, Kucoin, Bybit, and Okex (that i know of); you can withdraw almost all kinds of new chains tokens (eth) that is neccessary to fight for retroactive airdrop chances.",

      "body": "In order to avoid Sybil checks, one should use less software and more manual registrations and other manual ways of doing things. Crypto users are to blame for being scanned, because they want to do all the routine as quickly as possible and without their own labor costs, and then get a lot of tokens. This happens only to the most experienced sybil who know the ins and outs of automation and blockchain. In other cases it gives you away rather than helps you, so it is better to do everything yourself, without scripts.",

      "body": "There are things that have been recorded that checking sybil is very good to know who is actually interacting, but there are many ways to overcome the rules. Retroactive will have many more complicated criteria to eliminate. Most recently I read an article about an individual who created nearly 22000 wallets on Zksync, and indeed, if not professional enough, I think it would be difficult to detect this user, the trick is quite sophisticated. There are also cases that I heard of where some people have committed bad behavior by randomly sending low value tokens to many different addresses to eliminate participants, it is like a competition. The hunt for airdrops, bounty, testnet, retroactive,... is becoming more and more attractive to many people in the current market context, so there will be many criteria that are constantly updated, anyway if the projects will still pay handsomely, it's still worth a try.",

One wallet can have many addresses and if you use many addresses in a same wallet for your retroactive airdrop, it can affect your chance to be eligible for claiming airdrop reward from the team distribution.There would be special pattern to detect it. Any blockchain analyzation has different patterns in detecting the sybil attack. I remember when someone posted if he has detected someone who owned more than 21k wallet used for zksync retro. How can we identify person to person transcation as a sybil attack? It's caused by the main purpose of blockchain is to sending your money to others. This is why specific criterias are needed in determining the sybil attack. Quote from: PostAppocalypse on September 12, 2023, 11:00:50 AMIP address does not make sense.That's true.",
