  "content": "Trade with insurance.How it works ? We provide you the trading insurance we only cover you If you use our signals.The funding plaan: For example you use 1000$ per trade by using our signals.You pay monthly fee to be member of our insurance scheme based project. Monthly fee: 70$ Now let's say you have 1000$ per trade you put down the insurance fee wich is 10% from the ammount you use per trade. If trade goes bad and you get payed by insurance then you get payed back 100$ wich is 10%. And after 3 months you get tax return kind of payment back. You get back 80% of the total money what you have been payed for insurance so far. The project are good becouse many people want to trade but there is no insurance so we provide insurance so you trade without worry about.We cover you with insurance If stop loss what we give you for signal but its rare case that our signal will hit stop loss.And funds what you can make with this project Will give you financial freedom and with insurance traders been asking for insurance many times becouse trading should be no risk activity and give us Nice income.Our signals Will make you minimum of 50 % per trade by using the futures leverage.Off course If we pump we spread about dmdmp news like some shop started to accept coin.Or If we dump we spread some bad news about coin off course we Will do maximum efforts to make sure our signals work becouse better quality we provide then less we have to pay out insurance money.Also we need secret influencers marketers who need to do secret work in order to move coin prices the way we want.We take as a team money outside same like all BIG wall st guys do it and we use funds to grow even bigger and gain more power. \" I care not what puppet is placed upon the throne. The man who controls the money supply controls the Empire, and I control the money supply\" This is serious business and If you want to get in this you need to be serious too.Let's see here how many people we can get on the board.",

Some indicators in tradingview with enough knowledge will give a good signal without paying for a service.I don't know why some people offer their signal to others if they are great at analyzing the market and you want to earn money in trading why don't you apply your knowledge in trading to make a profit and earn?",

      "body": "I hope anyone will not be a victim of this type of convincing but deceiving means of scamming people. It is even double scam and can even be triple. First is the money paid for providing signals. Second is the money paid for insurance in percentage of the amount to be used for trading. This is what we know yet. The third can be in form of total scam, in a way the whole $1000 he used in the OP can be demanded for in a way they will be helping the victim to trade, which means the their scam can be the collection of the total trading money. I hope only foolish people can be scammed this way.",

You could do more engaging community at your back and who knows, youll get ecommerce deal by means of ads instead a very suspicious insurance cover like that.People will doubt your purpose and likely get scared that it will result to a scam or rug.",

The field is different, the target is different, the nature of agreement and risk are different, etc. On top of that, your last sentences sound like you're trying to build a PnD group instead.

There's no proof if your signal is 100% work and never missed from your prediction, you need to build your reputation about your signal service first. You should create a new thread about your signal and offer it for free, post it everyday and everyone will know how much the percentage of your signal. If you don't follow my advice, any users should avoid your signal since it's 100% scam signal created by newbie.",
