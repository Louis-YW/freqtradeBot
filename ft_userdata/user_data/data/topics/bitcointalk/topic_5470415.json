But dealing with other issues why? It's not a difficult thing to update. And, if you don't you are going to have problems later.Am I missing something?-Dave",

However using wallet versions that are 2 or 4 years ago is non-understandable. Yes, did I miss something like you.",

Could just be me, but the 1st thing I do when that happens is look to see if there are newer versions of the software. Not just in the crypto world but in any sort of computer issue. -Dave",

Upgrading directly from 0.7.x and earlier without redownloading the blockchain is not supported.which nobody likes tbh. but since the Bitcoin Core 0.17.0 version there is no change in the format of wallet files so users having versions of the latter have no issues like downloading the data and can use their existing wallet files to sync with the new version.",

Not just in the crypto world but in any sort of computer issue. I can't comment on the reasons each individual has for not upgrading but I can tell you that it has always been a pain for developers that they fix a bug and release a new version but users keep complaining about the same bug that they had already fixed because they never updated or checked that there is an update.The best example I can think of is the network change in Electrum that prevented old clients from connecting to servers. The issue tracker is filled with people complaining about not being able to connect because they hadn't upgraded.Example: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/5260Some even from 2 years later: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/6992",

If they are not important to me, there is no need to update unless a vulnerability is found that needs updating.

Backwards compatibility is maintained for as long as possible, with background upgrading and/or explicit migration available for several versions. Even when something is eventually removed, it is possible to upgrade to a version in between that support old and new versions, do the database upgrade (which may just happen in the background), and then upgrade again. Additionally, removing support for older things rarely happens so upgrading rarely breaks compatibility with prior versions.The people who think they need to redownload the entire blockchain if they want to upgrade to any version are simply wrong.For a while, bitcoin.org (which is not controlled by anyone who works on Bitcoin Core) hosted old and outdated versions. They were telling people the latest version was 22.0 when 23.0, 24.0, and 25.0 had already been released. Only recently have they updated to hosting 25.0.",

      "body": "My approach to updates of Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Sparrow or my Lightning node is: when a new version is released I quickly read the release notes of the new version. Is there a security or other important fix that makes a quick update necessary? If this isn't the case or no other new feature makes me want to update as soon as possible, I wait a few days or weeks and don't rush it.Are there issues with the new version, are there permanent features which I don't like, how is the reception of the user base? I try to take all of this into consideration before I decide to update finally which may take me from a few days to a few weeks usually.When it comes to wallet software I'm no update junkie, ie. no update asap. Bitcoin Core and Electrum are quite stable, severe security or stability fixes are rare, no need to rush the update. Sparrow is younger, maybe gets more features and whatnot, an update could bring more nice changes to it, so I'd likely update this more quickly. LND or Core Lightning has even more new stuff, work in progress or security and stability fixes where sometimes an update is beneficial as soon as possible. It all depends...",

Probably I haven't updated Electrum since 2020, after this accident but I know that won't trick you if you take security seriously and that's what I do. Also, I think that when it comes to updates, it's best to be late unless update targets the correction of available dangerous bugs. My approach is, let others test new software for a while and if there are no bugs, problems and they run it smoothly, then feel free to update. There is no need to hurry if current version works well and there is not some mindblowing feature added.Quote from: pooya87 on October 15, 2023, 01:20:15 PMYou have to actually go to the core website, download the binaries then verify the signatures before you install the new version.I have always downloaded without verifying signatures.

You lose absolutely nothing by enabling RBF and the transaction stuck problems would easily be solved if RBF was enabled since 2017. I can't find a single reason why you should hesitate update because of enabled RBF, probably companies which offer bitcoin transaction accelerate services will be the only ones who will protest RBF.",

Or is it a good approach to save signature right now and check if they match the next time you download/update bitcoin core? Not the signatures but the public keys, the signatures change each time based on the binary. Like transactions that each time you create a different tx (eg. spending from the same address), the signature is different even though your key is the same.The security comes down to a concept called Web of Trust. You basically have to find a way to find and acquire the correct public keys used in signing the binaries. Then you can download the binaries and its corresponding signature from anywhere in the future and verify it with the public key you already have. So even if the websites were compromised and the attacker signs the binaries with their own public key, you still wouldn't fall for it because the signature won't verify against the correct public key you already have and trust.",

Quote from: pooya87 on October 17, 2023, 04:30:37 AMYou basically have to find a way to find and acquire the correct public keys used in signing the binaries.This is what I do:- Download builders' keys: git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-core/guix.sigs.git- Go to the builders-key directory and run: find . -type f -name \"*.gpg\" -print0 | xargs -0 gpg --import- Verify the binaries.- Anonymously use a search engine to find results for a couple of public keys just to check they have been archived (so they are legitimate).",

Recently I am only able to get 1 or 2 outgoing connections. Does Windows 10 Firewall or Windows Defender prevent outgoing connections? It still syncs but much, much slower. I was always able to get 8 outgoing connections previously.Maybe some Windows updates screwed something up? You could have a look at the Windows Defebder settings. Go to Allow an app or feature through... and make sure that Bitcoin Core is checked for both networks, public and private. You could have a look at the configuration file of Bitcoin Core aswell (bitcoin.conf) for a change that could limit outgoing connections. One more thing that comes into mind is that the port '8333' should be opened.",
