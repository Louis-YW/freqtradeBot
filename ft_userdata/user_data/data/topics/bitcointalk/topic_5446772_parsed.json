If I understood this correctly, those Chinese banks are using Hong Kong as a hub to expand their business, effectively doing oversea business that serves crypto customers in Hong Kong due to its friendly nature toward crypto. Things might change if their government decides to fine or even make that business illegal, but even if that is true Hong Kong would probably welcome other banks to do their business there.So yeah, nothing changes that much for Crypto in China, just that their business is trying to get a share of the crypto market through other means.

Though America and china relations hood in terms of mass production and import-export stuff. Since China has better relations with Russia, they would obviously welcome crypto or any business that can put America in jeopardy. This will put huge impact on American business and other crypto projects. They would not think about it a bit and move their offices towards China land. On the other hand, we should ask what are you doing America? Stop drinking that old wine and start accepting the new technology otherwise it would take finger snap to vanish the businesses.",

It's not fully integrated into mainland China's system and certainly a place of more liberty and opportunities. Perhaps China is making its own little experiment, trying to suggest the banks to be more crypto-friendly, but only on a small scale in a specific distinct region. It doesn't mean that the model will be adopted throughout China, even if it proves financially successful. Who knows, perhaps the US will simply respond by making a special region of its own with laxed crypto policies that don't apply to the rest of the country. It's harder to do it in a centralized way in the US, but one of the states could try to assume such a role themselves.",

To me this is purely a political move, both China and the US have had a complicated relationship with bitcoin, when one side rejects it the other tries to use it for their benefit, but at the same time a tool which brings such freedom to their citizens scares them both, so neither of them can fully commit to bitcoin.Now that the US is showing signs of going against this market, China is willing to soften their posture a little bit, but make no mistake in a few years we will get another ‘China banned bitcoin’ FUD and then the US will react to it and change their tune again.",
