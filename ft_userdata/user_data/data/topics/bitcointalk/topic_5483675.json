To receive Bitcoin, all you need is your wallet address, which you will send to whoever is sending you the Bitcoin. Every other information apart from your wallet address is your sensitive information that you should keep within yourself and never disclose to anyone. Of course, your wallet address can be public, and that will not be an issue.",

Because ideally it is the public key that actually receives the coin, the address is just a hash plus checksum of the public key.  With the checksum it is easier if the address is correct or not. Nonetheless i don’t think wallets allow the sending of bitcoin to public key just like how sending to ip addresses were ban. But it is not that it’s not possible.",

So if I get you correctly, the better the right channel through which you can send BTC to your wallet is through your wallet address.",

But previously such payment was common - “Pay to public key” or P2PK. Right now I don't even know of any Bitcoin wallets that would allow me to do this. And even if you manage to somehow send funds to a public key, this will become a big problem for the recipient of the funds. After all, almost no modern Bitcoin wallet explicitly operates with such functions. You know, there are currently 7 types of addresses in Bitcoin. P2PK is the most outdated of them. Even a legacy address is no longer used much due to high fees. The most used one now is native segwit (bc1...). There are also taprut addresses that have not yet become widespread.",

The only thing I don't understand about what you said in this op is that it's not clear what you really want to know. Maybe you mean that from your bitcoin address you want to transfer it to another bitcoin address as well or to another exchange, right?Because it seems to me that you want to send it to a hardware wallet or software wallet like Exodus or other wallets that can hide Bitcoin.",

Quote from: joe1234 on January 31, 2024, 04:20:24 PMdoes it make a difference if the sender tranfers BTC funds to my Wallet address or to my Public Key?In the past, the standard was to send bitcoin to a public key but now, the standard is to use your wallet address because it is more user-friendly and the most preferred method for receiving bitcoin. Stick with what the majority of the community is doing. I think in terms of convenience of transactions, sharing a wallet address is better than a public key. In terms of security and privacy, since the wallet address are produced by hashing the public key twice, you can be sure that you are provided with an extra layer of security of your bitcoin assets that is not availed to you when you share your public key.",

I think it's much more convenient to be get used to send your bitcoins through wallet addresses. As its explained here by hosseinimr9, sending bitcoin through public address is now very uncommon option that exist around wallet software etc. Most exchanges would directly hand you bech32 address nowadays (I think taproot is still not very common) so you can send or deposit through that. Wallet addresses are not that too long to be checked in my opinion, I think its not hard method at all.",
