  "content": "Education is always key when doing a detailed research about Crypto Currencies. We really need to find a good coin to invest in. But sometimes, misconceptions are very common, where misinformation is spread and it's difficult to find out, what's true. Debunk misconceptions! It is up to us to debunk misconceptions about Crypto Currencies because education is very important to research tech and basics.When doing research about a Coin, people need to do a good DYOR.Sometimes, people fail to do a basic research. We really need to do a good research and also share our knowledge.So, I shared mine! I have created recently some new topics, where I debunked a misconception: Misconceptions about Avalanche - Avalanche is a Coin, not a TokenVery important to do our research: Avalanche [AVAX] is a capped assetProbably, you know about more Crypto Currency misconceptions and in my opinion, it's very important to create educational content and debunk misconceptions. Because some people use wrong information to spead lies about a Crypto Currencies as a marketing offensive to damage competitor coins. People need to do more research here to spot misconceptions about Crypto Currencies and we need to write good education to debunk misconceptions about Crypto Currencies!Writing a good education is up to us! Which misconceptions do you know and what are you doing to debunk it?",

Best example would be my parents, they don't believe on the concept of money on the internet. They told me it was a scam when I invested some of my money on it. They said that where is the money coming that I used to withdraw when I do trading or get it as payment from freelancing. Their generation is really hard to educate because they are born with no many technology existing yet. They don't really know how it works so what I just do is correct them sometimes when I hear them telling other people that these crypto are scam.",

Bitcoin for example, most of them would have the same misconceptions. \"naku padadamahin ka lang nyan sa simula pero pag malaki na pinasok mo tatakbo na yan\"Translation:It will just trick you by making you comfortable then when you invest a larger amount, they will run.I just replied to them, I did not convert any cash I've earned outside of cryptocurrency to Bitcoin. Instead I use bitcoin that I earned outside of crypto, paying bills for example. I told them that they can choose to invest cash to crypto but again the volatility is very high, or he can look for ways to earn crypto without investing money. Just some elbow grease and time of course.Then I gave them this linkhow to earn bitcoinsMaybe they changed their view if they really paid some time to read more here on the forum.",

Until they experienced bankruptcy and scams due to rampant Ponzi schemes back then. So they think crypto is a scam, especially Bitcoin, but they don’t know that it’s just being used by developers or site owners for committing fraud. They don’t study first before they enter or seize an opportunity, all that matters to them is to earn. So when I see people offering things that are too good to be true, I criticize them to be avoided.",

This is true and would be helpful to those who are interested for which there would be a significant number; however, the number dwarfs and can't even compare those those who don't care.  In the beginning, it seems most were true believers as they were being ridiculed by the masses, but when proven to be true, now many of these same masses are just on the bandwagon with the main motivation of profit, even if the coin isn't shit, is a scam or highly centralized, no cares as long as it pumps.",

Good education and its consistent learning in crypto is the key to simply debunk all the misconceptions we had when we are still in the process of crypto learning. Unfortunately, some people just ignore it and continue to believe that their own concepts are right which i think the reason why they often lose in crypto. Debunking misconceptions will always create positive changes, but we should always know that anyone can do it not to create superioriy but because one is more knowledgeable and more experienced than the other.",

Both are a wrong perception because even the number two that believe bitcoin will give a big return but that is like thinking bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, therefore it's automatic wrong because there's a risk in investing and you could also lose. Big return is not guaranteed, and bitcoin as a scam is not also true because exchanges are regulated by the government, and no government would regulate a scam.",

I am not against sharing it with others but when people who made articles are just telling lies it becomes chaos. They make stories and people believed in them and they think they can do the same by investing in newly found gems without even doing the proper research. After they get rekt, they blame cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin which truthfully is from their own mistake. There's no \"get rich quick\" in any invesments. Some just got lucky.",
