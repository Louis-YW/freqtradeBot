Ideally, they should spend some time reading the rules (especially if its their first time on a forum) but this is just a discussion forum, there are no rules what you have to do. Quote from: Sarah Azhari on February 28, 2023, 09:13:41 AMAs I feel, many members here don't know anything about bitcoin, they don't know how to create a bitcoin wallet, but very experienced with metamask and trust wallet, which I think is a very strange person in the world.That's probably because vast majority of people that are new to crypto are altcoiners. They often (wrongly) think that its too late to invest in bitcoin so that makes them turn to altcoins instead.",

A newbie doesn't need to go to Beginners & Help section, he can learn from any board which he interested.It's not strange if they not know about Bitcoin wallet, because Trust wallet support Bitcoin, so they think why they need to have a specific wallet for Bitcoin? but if they've learn from read few threads in this forum, they will know how important is Bitcoin wallet that offer to verify signature and open source.",

How many you think? (Not that important anyway). Creating trustwallet can create bitcoin wallet though. If you're referring the wallet like electrum, well, this depends on what wallet they are used to use because electrum has different vibe and look than the other good UI and UX wallets especially in mobile wallets where most newbies are using.",

It's turned to a very business minded culture, which a lot of new users just want to ask their questions, and not necessarily continue posting from there on out, and that's fine. It's what brought a lot of us here, to just ask a simple question, and then we likely started reading a little more on the forum, and it hooked us.Not every new user is here to go join a signature campaign, and earn money, but it seems we're very suspicious from the get go, which turns into hostility, and new users are less likely to stay. Staking a address isn't needed for most new users, and when they do come to doing it, they should probably do it with a securely generated address, which I imagine a lot of new users haven't got when first joining.",

No one has to do a in-depth Bitcoin research if they don't want to.However, there is some common sense: When you sign up for a new website, you usually familiarize yourself with the rules and read the relevant threads with the basic instructions.And since Bitcointalk is a Bitcoin forum, it wouldn't be bad if you could get a basic understanding of Bitcoin afterwards. Although, if a user doesn't want to do that, that's their right and we shouldn't force them.",

A lot of newbies will have been lingering on the forum for a month or a quarter before making their posts so will know more about what's expected of them. I think the lingering before making an account or a post might be more \"ideal\" but it might be unnecessary too (similar to reading the rules here - even though both would give them a better understanding of what and how to write).",
