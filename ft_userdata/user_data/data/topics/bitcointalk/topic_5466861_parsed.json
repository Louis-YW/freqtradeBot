  "content": "There is a popular saying that \"when the purpose of a thing is not known, then abuse is inevitable\". This statement is true even in this forum as understanding your purpose and motivation for join this forum will, to a great extent, determine your approach, commitment, contribution and how long you will stay here (a lot of people disappear after few weeks... I don't mean to scare you though    ). Different people joined this forum for different reasons: some to learn about Bitcoin, some already know about Bitcoin but felt the need to join a community where Bitcoin is like a home( to see some of them, go to WO thread) and there are those who joined because they heard that people here make money... so their only motivation is to make money even very quickly.  These are the people that spam, lie and do all manner of despicable things because they want to beat the natural process of learning and growing. I want to announce to you that if you are only here because you want to make quick money, then you may mostly likely not make the money and here will be so boring to you because you will reveal that tendency and the OGs will notice you.Some of the older people can share their experience as regards to how they started, maybe we all can learn somethings too.",

My goal of joining here at first is determine more source of cryptocurrency aside from the faucet that is popular that time. Signature campaign rates that time is very low that's why I didn't become interested on it unlike newbie user nowadays which surely aiming to joining signature campaign.To cut my story short. I join the forum to search on what's cryptocurrency and what's other source of crypto aside from hyip which I knew scam that time so I acoided it and decided to chase about the real definition of cryptocurrency specifically Bitcoin.",

I don't think that anyone can learn anything from my reason why I joined bit I'll share it anyway. :pSo, first time I heard about Bitcoin was back in 2013 on another forum (Croatian forum of general type) and since I was active there for many years before that and known all the people there, I didn't have need to look for other places to discuss Bitcoin related things. Everything was fine and dandy up until bear market of 2018 hit, after which many members on the said forum lost interest in crypto. Since there weren't many people let active in cryptocurrency board, in the summer of 2019 I started looking elsewhere and since I knew some people that were active here, I decided to give it a chance. First few months I was just lurking & reading and since I liked what I saw (especially more lenient moderation than on any other forum I''ve ever been), I eventually decided to register. And here I am 4 years later.",

He told me that he got into Bitcoin less than 2 years or so but his knowledge was now so much that myself who's been into Bitcoin as an investor and not as a learner didn't have as much as his, not even up to. I thought I could bypass my way ans still be investor minded and grow so fast here financially but the modus operandi of this forum changed my mind because I was scolded many times for rushing as a result of my drive which wasn't a good one for the system here. So initially I was money conscious but just before I began to go for knowledge here and so far although it's not really encouraging but like my friend told me \"in Bitcointalk you have to be patient and gain knowledge and contribute positively and correctly if you must post anything, in that way you will grow to higher ranks and you not only be full of knowledge you'll also tend to grow big financially too.\"You can check my post so far I'm sure you'll find something to learn.

It's actually sad that the story has changed from seeking sincere knowledge to hunting after money. It however keep the forum more busy and active and it's a win for Forum. I can't say for sure, but as far as I remember, signature campaigns existed in 2014 when I first visited the forum, so we can say that they have existed for about 10 years. If you look at active members who registered 10+ years ago, you won't find too many of them, but that doesn't mean that those who joined later did it just to make money.The merit system arrived only in 2018, so although it may not be the ideal way to fight spam and alt farms, it has greatly improved the situation on the forum in this regard. However, it is not difficult at all to get 1 merit and become a Jr. Member, which for some is quite enough for bounty campaigns.Unfortunately, everything in this world revolves around money, and it would be strange if this forum was an exception. But we shouldn't consider it bad if someone has the opportunity to earn something along with acquiring and sharing knowledge, because that's what makes this forum different from the others.I can only say that I registered on the forum after visiting occasionally as a guest for almost a year, and I only joined the first sig campaign as a full member after realizing that everyone else was doing it. I guess that means that I didn't come to the forum just for money",

I can remembered last year you said it in a thread like this. And I like your sincerity, many people join this forum because of the money getting from signature campaigns and others ways but when questions are asked like this topic they would say, they are here to learn and know more about bitcoin but that is behind the mind. Even the OP of this thread is not sincere and that is why he did not tell us why he join the forum, he would have told what motivated him to join the forum then others would tell theirs. Well I was introduced by a friend to join the forum when he saw me to learn and invest in bitcoin and I was also told that I can have bitcoin if I join campaigns and that trigger the movement very fast to join the forum and really I am happy to join the forum. Both the learning and the signature campaign makes the forum lively and active.",
