You illiterate shitheads always try to prove yourself super smart by shitting with lies. If you have 0.000001% knowledge about anything related to computer and programming you wouldn't say this shit. What kind of dubass are you to say this is a phishing site? Do you have any idea about what really a phishing is? Or you just heard the word \"phishing\" and trying to act smart? Stupid asshole doesn't even understand what Metamask is saying. Ever heard of Web3? All kind of Web3 DApps require Metamask connection. We aren't asking for users private key THIS IS NO PHISING OR ANY SCAM. THIS IS JUST A FUN REFERRAL GAME.

I wrote the smart contract from scratch and I don't want to share my code to public for free, it's my choice. And tell me where is the exposing reference of bnbrocket?

And I have already told you, I was inspired by Forsage. That forsage thing went viral in my area so I thought to give it a try by launching a similar platform. You can see forsage has millions of users and billions of payouts. It's a referral chain, you register and then invite people and you earn commission from their fees. There is nothing else at the moment. I'm currently thinking about adding some more interesting ways to earn from the website like faucet or similar thing. But while I am thinking of improvements I am being called as scammer here and the website as phishing site for no reason. If I was scammer then I wouldn't care but I'm not scammer so I will defend myself everytime I am falsely being accused.",

It simply means the scam accusation was on point, we have cut off his only source of income. Get a legitimate job, dunghole and stop living off scamming people.I mean when your lies get exposed and you have no way of covering it up, won't you do the same? Get so angry that they lose focus on you so you can continue your scam and hopefully they forget what this is all about and focus on the madness that you're doing? Anger definitely is a big sign of someone's guilt although it's not going to be most of the time. Nice catch OP, first I've heard of this kind of scheme.No point to argue with fools anymore.",

There's nothing to trade, no purpose, literally nothing to do other than pay you and then sit and wait?No problem, you can archive the websites. And I have already told you, I was inspired by Forsage. That forsage thing went viral in my area so I thought to give it a try by launching a similar platform. You can see forsage has millions of users and billions of payouts. It's a referral chain, you register and then invite people and you earn commission from their fees. There is nothing else at the moment. I'm currently thinking about adding some more interesting ways to earn from the website like faucet or similar thing. But while I am thinking of improvements I am being called as scammer here and the website as phishing site for no reason. If I was scammer then I wouldn't care but I'm not scammer so I will defend myself everytime I am falsely being accused.For the record and to be sure, though you've said it repetitively, you're inspired by a project that's notoriously known for its ponzi scheme, stealing 340 millions of USD from their participants victims, and was indicted by an authority of one country?",

So, to summarize, your project is a ponzi scheme, modelled after a notorious platform that scammed 340 million USD, and it offers no other purpose than that? Of course, not mentioning [hopefully] brings you some bags of fortune on its process through the sign-up fee.",
