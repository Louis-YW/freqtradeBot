One can change address while doing transaction, at the point of this lots of addresses could be recorded making it too hard to sum up all total user that is having address.",

That's like 5-20 million users. But then there are also people who store their coins on exchange, and some don't even have a wallet and store all their coinse there.

And 95% of users here in the forum hold Bitcoin and the remaining is just for newbies and those who don't have enough money to invest yet.

The real right answer is how many addresses actually holds bitcoin or sats. Currently we have around 51,723,705 funded addresses according to LoyceV stats. This can be the only metric you can get because even chainalysis cannot link all addresses together.

      "body": "They probably have some ways to determine wallets but not individuals or people. Because someone or an individual can own tens or hundreds of wallets that contains Bitcoins. If the metric is just about having Bitcoin then that will be counted as a wallet that has it or they can have it in record as someone who holds Bitcoins. That's why it doesn't make sense to determine how many individuals are holding Bitcoin. Thus, if someone would ask everyone if they're holding Bitcoin, that won't make sense as well.",

Though as I said, I have seen some experts shown us the mined ones and the ones to mine but it was not like this number or figure you gave. Now from what you are saying the leftovers to mine is even more the the 21 millions people were saying. Lolz. This is more interesting. Well I am not a cryptocurrency analysis so I can't say anything on this for now. But I will make some research about this again.",

If there was a metrics that can evenly estimate the future number of individuals to adopt or join the network of BTC users, it would still not be accurate enough but just be a speculated figure. Am of the honest view that new users join the network to hold BTC or to not feel left out of trading or feel dumb when the topic of BTC is brought up. Hence why the number of individual users or holders of BTC rise on still and can be hardly properly ascertained.",

But I will make some research about this again.Hey mate I think you are actually mixing many things up, the stats provided up there isn’t even mine but rather that of coiinmarketcap as indicated there with a source and that could be wrong from what you might have read somewhere else bit still the difference wouldn’t still be much. If around 19.588 bitcoin have been mined according to them, then the number of bitcoin left to mine will just be 1.412 million, add this numbers up and they give you exactly 21 million bitcoin in total which as I said is not the exact number to be mined, as it is said that total number of bitcoin to be is kind of less than 21 million and not exactly that amount. The numbers aren’t mine and they are also not more than the 21 million you said. Sorry but we are going off topic here and it is derailing the thread.",

Absolutely! Let's say we both have one wallet and we use them in a multisig setup. This would generate an address set where we are both needed to generate the addresses. So all these addresses have both of us as owners. But we also own the addresses that our wallets generate separately.Bonus problem 2: Can I own one of your addresses? In fact I could theoretically own all the addresses that exist using a single seed phrase, if I used various derivation paths.EDIT:Zaguru12 mentioned it first",

What’s even more crazy is what if this is the case for everyone? Having 100 addresses each. Really impossible calculation",
