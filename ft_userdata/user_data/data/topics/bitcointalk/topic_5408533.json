Plenty of users here routinely post their analytical observations over in the economy/speculation sections. That's pretty much what those sections are dominated by, especially the speculation section. Alright, there's also just predictions with a little bit of reason, and not too much actual analysis, but it definitely fits those sections depending on the way the original poster goes about it. Altcoin section could potentially do with more specific sections in general anyway.",

But i only found 2 threads title which use word \"signal\". \"Analytical\" has wide meaning and already fit on boards i mentioned. Consider bump this thread again if thread about \"signal\" fill at least 1/2 of a board for some time.Yeah there are more of speculation and we see less of these signals for price movements related threads so it's already clear we don't need a different board for discussion which are not making significant part of the forum discussions.",

I don't see someone who trades on signals to be someone who would improve instead, it makes you dependent and lazy towards doing any actual analysis.QuoteIt is hard for me to believe that the most informative forum on Cryptocurrency lacks signal and analytical sections.I think we've got this in the speculative subboard with BTC/USDT wall observer. Perhaps a single photo would be all that would answers your question or some screenshot lines on a chart. A few of those still goes down in altcoins. You could visit those and get some signals of the speculations that goes on there.Mind you, there is no analysis pro or guru as you term it anywhere and there is a disclaimer to such information, be it stated or not. Its important you learn how to trade yourself.",

You might try it with a ridiculously low amount on our trading account before deciding to trust it or not. If you did not try, you wouldn't know. Regarding the explanations, I think it is not necessary as long as the signal is working just fine.",
