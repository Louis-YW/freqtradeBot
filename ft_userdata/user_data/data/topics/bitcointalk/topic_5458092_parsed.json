Please join our social media channels for latest information. For all queries, join our Telegram group: https://t.me/tribedigitalventuresHello TDVTokenWelcome to bitcointalk forum.This project came to my attention after seeing the Bounty Campaign topic posted by user sujonali1819 and that the campaign budget is held by user shasan at an Escrow Address. After inspecting both the campaign and the official announcement, I found a sign that you are the sole representative of the project and that the project team will also manage the bounty campaign, and that any contact must take place directly with you. The bounty campaign is live, and the official announcement was also published a few days ago, and despite this, you are not active at all, and I do not know how long it will take for any member to receive an answer, whether he has an evaluation of the project in the form of questions, or a participant in the bounty. I wonder why you didn't ask Sujonali to run/manage the campaign, since he's a specialist in that.",
