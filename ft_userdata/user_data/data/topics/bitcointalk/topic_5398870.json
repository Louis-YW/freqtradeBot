  "content": "Hi everyone,I'm quite newbie in the Bitcoin World. Recently, I downloaded Bitcoin Core (v23.0.0) and created a BTC wallet. I clicked \"Receive\" button and generated a btc address. Then, I sent some BTC and it worked well. After that, I did another transaction that worked well too. However, yesterday my balance was showing 0 and I don't know why. I used a explorer to check if the BTC was moved but it wasn't. I though it could be due to pruning the blockchain so I re-indexed but the balance remains as 0.I tried to dump my BTC private key but I can't since it's a descriptor wallet and the following commands don't work: walletpassphrase \"your walletpassphrase here\" 600 & dumpprivkey [your Bitcoin address here]Thanks in advance.",

If you want you can send the TxID to check that.This is impossible. It takes 14 days until an unconfirmed transaction is removed from the mempool. Also, the default maximum capacity of a mempool is 300 MB and we didn't reach that in the past days. So, even if OP has made the transaction with fee rate of 1 sat/vbyte, it should be in the mempool, at least.",
