Gambling is regulated most in the way to favour the governments in tax generation. If there are many gambling companies in a country and people are using them, the government in the country will generate more internal revenue from gambling, while some will provide gambling service to people outside the country as additional way for the government to make more money.",

The Canadian gaming industry contributes nearly $9 billion in annual revenue and supports various government and community programs and services.2. In 2021, the Canadian gambling industry was valued at $12.54 billion, with lottery sales being the primary source of revenue.3. Approximately 18.9 million people in Canada reported gambling in the past year, with 95% of players considered non-problem gamblers.4. Slots and bingo are the most popular types of electronic gambling in the country.5. The growth of the gaming industry in Canada can be attributed to the increase in the availability of legal gaming options.SourceIf we do speak about contribution of gambling industry then it cant really be denied that it do really make out that huge role in terms of economic approach considering on the revenue that it generates which its not really that something new considering that this industrycould really generate out billions.Although not all corners of the world would really be that legalizing gambling.",

Said amount is 49.43% higher than the P11.29 billion earnings from gaming in 2022.They support the health sectors in our country and our athletes' needs in preparation for the International meet, we are a third-world country and the contribution coming from the gambling industry sustains two sectors of our society that the government lacks the funds to sustain, like the United States it creates jobs and industry that revolves around the casino industry, especially the tourism industry, we have a robust tourism industry because part of that is we promote the casinos to our tourist since majority of our casinos are located on hotels.",

Also it can create a lot of jobs to their people but some of the country decide to ban it since maybe they can't accept the consequences brought up by casino and they think the income of their country is sustainable that's why maybe they are confident that they are still fine even if there's no revenue coming from those casino.",

Considering that based on government reports they lose typical state revenue due to gambling. Where the economic turnover, where people usually actively buy and sell goods, is now decreasing. Most of these cases refer to people's gambling activities which are becoming more and more significant day by day. They are more active in spending money on gambling than buying goods. As a result, economic turnover is hampered, this comparison is seen from before and after the pandemic. Therefore, if I'm not mistaken, the government is making improvements by blocking online gambling sites, in fact every day the government blocks more than 10K illegal gambling sites.",

In developed countries like the USA, many people can afford to gamble for entertainment without significantly affecting their finances, which isn't the case in poorer countries.Let me provide an example from my country, the Philippines. We have state-sponsored gambling, such as the lottery or commonly known as lotto in the Philippines, which generates substantial revenue for the government. While this isn't like casinos, where people can lose larger sums of money, some individuals still become addicted despite the slim chances of winning.Now, speaking of casinos, we have the POGO (Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators). These are often operated by Chinese businessmen who come to the Philippines to run their businesses. The government benefits from the tax income generated by this operation. However, there are restrictions on citizens gambling in these establishments, which are primarily intended for tourists or high rollers within the country.By limiting access to the casinos, the government can increase tax revenue while also ensuring that the financial status of the average person isn't negatively impacted. Unlike traditional casinos, which are open to everyone, including those with limited means, this approach aims to reduce the temptation to gamble excessively. Effective control and policy implementation are crucial to ensure that the gambling industry has a positive impact on the overall economy.",

Top biggest countries in the world as per https://blog.kheloo.com/top-20-biggest-gambling-countries-in-the-world/The top 3 are ;1. USA 2. China3. Japan.These are billion-dollar industries, and we can already imagine the significant impact of gambling on their country's revenue. Additionally, these are progressive countries. In short, the gambling industry could contribute to a country's economy and help it improve. Why do other countries ban gambling, aside from religious reasons?",

The parking space itself will accumulate a lot of money, what more with the gambling den, the cockpit. I heard stories/facts from the gamblers who visit the area, my neighbors to be precise. They say you bet for one an odd of 1.80 for one rooster you only get 1.60 if it wins. They are automatically taking the interest out of the winnings and no one can do anything about it because everything is computerized.Now, our city is upgrading, street lights, we felt it, paved and widened road, new city hall, and more.

Besides POGO is only for high rollers so I really doubt that a typical Filipino can play in there while thereâ€™s a lot of IRL casino available like city of dreams and okada. I believe the main reason why POGO is restricted to citizen is because foreign money in there often involved to money laundering which the government trying to control or hide.
