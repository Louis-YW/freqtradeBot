So profitable whenever the price is going.   Some guy on X talks about this news too that it is maybe that the first tweet on SEC is actually a draft but they send it rather than save it but who know right",

According to many people on social media, the announcement appeared like it was very well composed and it appeared ready from uncle Gary's drafts folder.However, what uncle Gary might also do is delay the ETF decision again to investigate the hack.",

It was simply a tweet purportedly from its chairman's account which, as proven, could be hacked. Whether or not it was coming from an official social media account of a member of the SEC, it wasn't the SEC releasing an official statement. Social media accounts of people can't be fully trusted as an information source. Even accounts of presidents could be taken over by anybody.",

We really don't know what's going on, but from what's going on, I have a feeling that even the SEC wants to manipulate this potential market for its own profit. They also want to make money from this market but abuse their power to make profits, what a shameful act. There have been many comments sent to Elon asking him to check the IP address of SEC's account X to know exactly whether they were really hacked or just playing tricks on themselves to manipulate the market. But I think Elon will not interfere in this.",

This is funny. And one theory being discussed about X is that this will be the reason why the SEC continues to delay approval of ETFs to investigate the hack. Everything is so dramatic and we are all easily manipulated by them, with just a few simple operations and some news they can manipulate everything. Personally, I also don't believe that everything is so strangely coincidental.https://twitter.com/Safety/status/1744924042681897343",

The bad part is that when SEC rejects ETF (which is a strong possibility IMO considering their history) we could see the same market manipulators start shorting the hell out of bitcoin and crashing the market!",
