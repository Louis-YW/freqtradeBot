Most people who have joined gambling sites will find it difficult to get out of the gambling circle. It doesn't matter how much you lose at gambling, as long as we still have money, we will continue to gambleReally? I think it's about habits and problem gamblers, it's true that more people are trapped in problem gambler circles, but all of that can be overcome by seeing gambling as a means to seek entertainment and not for life. For me, there is a separate allocation of money for gambling each week, and when it loses and runs out, I will not use the rest of my money that week.Quote from: Tuturtinular on July 12, 2023, 12:31:45 AMCan you share your first experience playing gambling? and who told you about gambling sites?My first experience of betting was in the Sportsbook in a UCL game a few years ago (if I'm not mistaken about 9 years ago), in that game I chose Schalke with a $3,5 bet and I won this bet. For who introduced me to gambling, it is certain that the answer is my friend.",

Starting from playing with a little money, after a while I didn't know how much money I had spent playing gamblingI forgot my first gambling experience because it was a few years back so it's still hard to remember.Gambling has been around for a long time so it's very natural that they know, the experience of what they do is certainly different, there are those who gamble once and don't play anymore because they lose, there are those who play and continue to be addicted until now there are many, I feel that many are starting to get addicted to gambling games, now more experience is crypto-based casinos rather than using fiat.I have never counted how much money has come out in gambling it has never been recalled and it has become normal for me that a loss in gambling is part of the risk but for me it is only enough with pleasure.",

It was later I went ahead to create an account in an online gambling site because of some advert I saw onine concerning the bonus that was attached to owning a new account.Alot of users here have their own unique story rangign from seeing others win big cash to just opening a gambling account to have fun...",

      "body": "My first experience with gambling was fun. It was way back when I was still in my elementary days. We played with real money. It was just like any other game except that it involved coins you can spend. So it was more fun. The desire to win was much stronger compared to when we were playing rubber bands or marbles. Online gambling came late. I was already working when I first got into online gambling. It was also fun but since it involved significant amounts, it wasn't just a game. So I had to be careful. It never got to a point when I couldn't care less about how much I lost for as long as I have the money and can continue gambling. I've never been addicted.",

He just took my coupon, applied it to system, took my money. Also I think I lost my first ever sports betting experience.",

I wasn't aware of any local online casinos back then, so crypto casinos became my starting point. At that time, crypto casinos handed out generous rewards from their promotions and sometimes they would announce a unique event only for their chat. I remember being lucky enough to catch the rain from one of the high rollers and I almost panicked because I thought someone mistakenly sent the money to my account.",

In the end what gets you hooked is winning a prize, that's what happened to me. I played a few times but when I hit the jackpot it became a vice. Luckily I didn't have much money at the time and the vice passed and I never had any problems with gambling after that.",

Gamblers who consider gambling activities as a place to seek wealth will find it difficult to stop even though they often lose, the adrenaline produced in their bodies always responds positively to the results obtained. I quite often visit gambling sites and place bets on various games, losing is inevitable, but it doesn't deter me because I see gambling as a place to seek pleasure and relieve stress after carrying out routine activities in real life.",

My bad gambling experience was when I joined gambling with the hope that I could get rich by gambling, but in the end after losing money I increasingly realized that You have to be wise in gambling and you shouldn't be greedy, especially with the aim of making a fortune from gambling. It's very impossible, of the many games I've played, all of them will never be lucky.The more mature I gamble, the more I understand that gambling should only be for fun, I changed my mindset from gambling to only looking for pleasure by gambling until now, don't take gambling seriously, just play wisely, that's why now I never gamble playing casinos but prefer sports betting , because playing casino against a machine will never win except for fun.",

Jackpots are not common and people think too much about their high confidence when they actually have none. This does not come to everybody and most people only think that if they play long enough they will win loads of money.Hence I consider this as a life lesson and not a bad experience. This helps newbies to learn both sides of gambling and not be stuck with only one",

On Afternoon, he came to my house and told me that if I know that am the best let's play and stake something little on the game. This motivated me because I wanted to win him to proof you him that am better than him when it comes to cheese game. I accepted and we had fun because we used the best strategy to make sure that one will win the other. It will ended up that he won me,I told him to come back the next day and he came but I won him this time. I never knew then that one can be addicted to gambling.",

Afterward, you will just leave it in Autobet and expect that either you win it or you are in the top 10 of the highest amount wagered rankings because they give rewards for that.Before, there was a limited type of games, Dice, Plinko, with cryptocurrencies as means of betting but now even in slots they are being accepted in third party online gambling sites.",
