      "body": "Not every currency in the down phase means that it is \"looking like it's about to break out\" and the Binance Launchpad's main goal is to monitor projects before listing them, so there is no guarantee that these currencies will rise unless you hear a lot of news about them or an investor joins them or there is a clear technical development.HOOK/USDT moved from $2 to 0.79, which seems better than ID/USDTEDU/USDT, but it may not be able to return to 0.6 and 1.5, respectively.Therefore, HOOK/USDT is better, but you have to follow the news, and whenever news related to one of the Binance Launchpad projects increases, the possibility of it being listed and its price increasing remains possible, although I advise you to stay away from such an investment.The distribution of tokens and the Fixed-Term APR of 31.54% indicate that it will be a pump and dump coin, and the next rise may be the only one before the price is below $0.2.",

Thats not how reverse of such long trend looks like. looking at the whole, we are dealing with a graph that goes down like a stone thrown into water. There is no reverse patter. The projects are valued at $500 million (Fully diluted market cap), and as you noted \"No idea what these projects really do\". Maybe because no one uses them, because what is the currently estimated userbase of these projects? Most like close to zero. And the fact that they might deliver something in the future definitely doesn't negate that and the valuation is detached from reality. Personally, I wouldn't put a dime into these projects, and certainly not based on 3 green candles.",

On the time that they starting being traded up then it would really be that usual that prices do spike and then make some deep dive.Its really that very common and i cant really say that each one of them would really be having that kind of recovery or pump afterwardseven those TA signs do really shows up that its a good entry or good buy time but it wont really be giving out assurance that it would pump when market shifts.This is where we do see that some projects being delisted due to lack of liquidity.About making yourself some position basing up on the OP given coins or projects then it wont really be that a bad idea on throwing up some bucks with those coins and will really be let it see if there would be some u-turn or spike after that. It is really actually a good entry basing up on TA and not really that a bad thing on getting in.",
