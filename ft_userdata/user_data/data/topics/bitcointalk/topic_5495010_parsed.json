Inflation is bound to happen in any country and there is nothing we can do to stop it however there is something we can do to protect ourselves from the damaging impacts inflation has. By holding our money in bitcoin, we can be confident that it will not be affected by inflation although of course it is volatile in its own so there are still some risks of it losing value. But it is not as constantly decreasing as our fiat.",

And then when the price are going up, like the one that we are seeing this year, then we are in a bull run. But as you have said, just continue to save and accumulate and sooner we might see the price increasing again and the prediction is that we might see 6 digits in the future.",

This is one of main reasons people believe in future of Bitcoin and consider it as a heaven for their asset storage.You gain my applause. Lol.Both the digital and non digital currencies are all inflationary but while outlining the volatility nature of both Bitcoin and the fiats, they're of difference because Bitcoin inflation is known for volatilities fluctuations where the rate of the value surges so high and the deflation is a period which its value depreciates and the values depreciates as much.The input and the output reactions of Bitcoin values is depended on the ratio of the demands and the supplies which means the more wider the masses adopts Bitcoin, so also it enhances its volatile potentials to gain more values and the more investors are in demand of more Bitcoins to buy is the more it gains more values considering that the Bitcoin is a limited to a maximum number of 21 Millions of Bitcoin in existence.So for that it would give it more walls to surge higher than it has ever been based on the price histories in as much there are still more of investors in demands to buy more .That is obviously to say that the invention of the Bitcoin digital currency is a non-custodian financial technology that every Bitcoin holders are responsible and holding alright reserved to control their Bitcoin assets without adhering to the polices of the governments or any authority.That is basically unlike the fiats that the government are in control about and does not have a limited number of printed more. And the sake that excessive number of money is being printed would always have the fiats depreciated whereas the reserve is much more than the demands.The governments even contributes to devaluing of the fiats as such dubious authorities from the central banks can just decide to have a specific amounts of money being printed specially for their own usage and get deposited to their bank accounts all to increase their financial portfolios.Meanwhile... It is not more becoming so competitive in demands my the public so, then the values are lost for exchange. The centralization of the Fiats where the government all at all course in-charge from having accesses and controlling of individual funds has already become a disregard of the fiats in the fact that bank account holders does not have Privacies and personal decision making of their funds.Also, the rate of living in a country or society Such as the cost of goods can as much devalue the fiats where inflation to the hike of goods has surpasses the value of the fiats.Just in a short, the federal government are responsible and can manipulate the fiats due to its centralization policy while Bitcoin can not be manipulated as the fact that it is a decentralized digital and non-custodian currency.",

So that makes the op's question about the price of Bitcoin legitimate.Bitcoin is seen by many as an investment, and also, its price isn't regulated by anyone. That's why when there's roughly the same amount of coins, but there's way more demand, the price increases naturally.As for the answer the op suggests, I disagree. It IS true that fiat value decreases, and $100 in 2010 is around $143 today if we adjust for inflation. But then there's another thing to consider: purchasing power. Nowadays, you can buy a car with 1 Bitcoin. In 2010, it was far from enough to buy even a single pizza.",

And I strongly believe that it's global user base and strong demand helped Bitcoin's price to increase. Bitcoin is not Limited to a cash transaction system anymore. What satoshi had said, is a different angle towards it. The global currency system did not see inflation of 57000%. So it makes no sense to discuss further about it. Bitcoin was initially launched as a currency but it became an investment because this is what people wanted it to become.",

Well, yes, the value of money decreases and this is called inflation, because the amount of money in global circulation is growing, which accordingly reduces its value. To adequately assess the decline in the value of money, you need to look at inflation in each country relative to the dollar, but there is a nuance. As usual, the authorities underestimate official inflation figures.Quote from: SAHASAN on May 02, 2024, 08:47:50 AMBTC 1 Bitcoin was worth 1$ in 2010Now Today' (2-May-2024). 1 Bitcoin is worth 57000 dollars, 1 Bitcoin is 57000$ means 57000$ worth of money has gradually reduced to 1$ and bitcoin has a power to show it clearly.Are you saying that USD has depreciated by 57,000% in more than 10 years?

At the beggining of Bitcoin a few pizzas costed tens of thousands coins, today a pizza costs a tiny fraction of Bitcoin.

Partially this is true.  But not entirely.The Dollar has not been devalued over sixty THOUSAND times in the last decade.  It had a very significant purchasing power decrease, along all the other Fiat Currencies.  But hell.  If the Dollar had a devaluation of over 60 THOUSAND times then we would all be living in a much more hell of a world right now than we currently are.The price of Bitcoin rose due to multiple variables and events.  Such as Halvings.  A LOT of people entering the Bitcoin ecosystem in the past decade, particularly in the beginning years of Bitcoin.  The Dollar losing value.  Et cetera.  If Bitcoin gains 50 percent by tomorrow it does not mean the Dollar has been devalued to half its purchasing power.  It just means that Bitcoin had a gain.",

Fiat money losing value also have a role in this growth, but this isn't the main factor behind Bitcoin's price pumps.",
