This being said, one cannot meaningfully mine bitcoin on cloud computing / AWS like machines.I don't know how is it for altcoins too, some can be mined with CPU/GPU and then converted for bitcoin, but you may want to ask about that on the altcoins area. I don't think it's legal (the cloud website might kick you out) or it may not worth it (too expensive), but I don't know.On the other hand, beware of cloud mining websites. Those are plain scams.",

But I don't like mining like this, rather than this buy yourself a mining rig and calculate how much energy is consumed and how much you need to pay for electricity.",

Meaning the hash rate you bought is from GPU mining and Nicehash paid you with Bitcoin. There are very few that currently legit cloud mining but almost all are scams. Miningrigrentals and Nicehash and the one that Bitmain promoted before I don't remember exactly what the website is but I think they don't offer hashrate anymore because the slots are full. Be careful what your brother said the only way to mine Bitcoin is to have ASIC units that support SHA256 algo if he give you some details and redirect you to another link with unknown cloud mining site then that's 100% scam.",

There were even companies that tried to do it more professionally (with real-time mining stacks, revenue tracking with block rewards, share systems). Think there were even at least a couple of ICOs in 2017 trying to raise funds to do it. It all eventually collapsed, not only because of market forces, but just the fact that it was really very hard to do fairly and accurately.Then again, I did earn some coins on Monero and others, when electricity wasn't an issue but I probably overworked my machine.",

Many of them charge high fees and may not be transparent about their costs which can make it difficult for investors to know if their investment is profitable or not.

It doesn't \"have to be\" a scam, but so far it has always been. Normally if the idea is to make sure that you have a collective cash, then you could sell something that could make 1.2 million dollars in a year, but sell it for 1 million dollar collective today, thanks to that 1 million you get today, you could buy a lot more machinery right away, and build that next to one you already have, when the year is over, you will have 2 systems worth 1.2 million so you would make 2.4 million next year.Plus, you would take the costs out of the earnings from the customers as well, meaning cloud system could technically work. It's just that nobody has done it in a legit way, and that's the issue.",
