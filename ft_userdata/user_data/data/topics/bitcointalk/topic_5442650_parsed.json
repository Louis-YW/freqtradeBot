This post is something I am doing for FREE. Just to be kind!If you are talking about the paid version (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5442653.0) you will get 100% Automatic updates that you can download DIRECTLY via the Panel you will get access to that is 100% Directly from the developer. It is all automatic. and it is $9 for 20K Original Plugins and Themes!",

(you probably know what balotelli wanted to ask)For example, I need these themes https://themeforest.net/item/mylisting-directory-listing-wordpress-theme/20593226 probably for two or even three different domains. So, let me explain how things going on here in this case.Just to mention, I already have this theme from a similar service offer like yours, but it's not updateable and now it's going to be useless since I haven't the latest updates which brings me certain limitations, eg support for updating to the new PHP 7.4+.",
