  "content": "so i see many people talk about their low incomes and their expenses and how to economise to either support a nice lifestyle or to maximise investments..and so here is 2 scenarios of people on $15/hour and $20/hour and a basic breakdown of expected expense.. things like putting 15% into pension before tax. then after tax putting ~10% into savings/personal choice investments30% into housing. and so onso lets see people views on how they would tweak the numbers of expenses to their personal preference to still cover essentials but maximise either a nicer lifestyle or more investingits not a marked exam, its a fun experimentto make it easy you can copy below to then adjust in your own post                $15/h         total 1990                 ||                      $20/h       total 2514                                                                 ||            invest[$200]        housing[$600]      ||             invest[$250]        housing[$755]                            bills[$400]      transport[$200]      ||                bills[$505]      transport[$250]        groceries[$400]        clothing[$90 ]      ||         groceries[$504]        clothing[$125]           repairs[$40]          hobbies[$20]       ||            repairs[$50]          hobbies[$25]entertainment[$20]         luxuries[$20]        ||  entertainment[$25]         luxuries[$25]maybe explain your choices too",

But I believe in planning ahead so for example 10-15 years ago when I was a university student I saved up most of the income I had and invested wisely. Most importantly was my plan to eliminate the biggest cost in life which is \"rent\" in my country. Eliminating that was the biggest reason why I could end up with extra money to invest and move ahead in life.Quotei still think if your eating through 15% of groceries.. your electric, gas, water, telephone might of been higher then 1%but good for you if your combined bills are only 1% high income.Nah. As I said even with minimum wage, bills would barely reach 2.5% and that is in extreme cases of an extremely low income and a wasteful household. You see these things are really ultra cheap here. Let me do a quick calculation here with some numbers:- Minimum wage is like 60 mil Rial per month.- Electricity is ~600 Rial/kwh which with all the discounts it would be like 200k-300k per 2 months (or free for those who decrease their consumption compared to previous year LOL)- Gas is 414 rial per cubic meter in cold seasons and 1350 in warm seasons and according to the gas company 90% of all the bills are less than 1000k rials and the bill is every 2 months too.- Water is 1860 per cubic meter, that's less than 500k bill every two months.(300k+500k+500k)/2 = 650k Rial per month which is 1.08% of minimum wage The bills I paid last month were 460k gas + 300k water + 160k electric = 920k rial for 2 months or 460k per month which is like 0.1%-0.3% of my monthly salary (even less of my total income). The gas bill a couple of months ago when it was warmer was about half that.I excluded phone bill because I have no idea what the average is and what I pay is only data/internet cost.",

Of course it is not an easy problem with maintaining consistency to do that but if we want to enjoy older good age, this must be prioritized, while the amount of investment, savings and expenses can still be adjusted to the monthly income.",

I think there are two problems the first one being people usually don't plan there expenses in certain regions or it's more to do with the stage of life they are into, as youngsters don't give much importance to this sort of planning and by the time they have a kids they are on tight budget to make the end needs meet, second sort of issue is the underpaid employees who barely survive on salary without even leisure or entertainment or new clothing hence they don't have a way to invest.
