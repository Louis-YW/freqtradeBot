How is it any better investing in TUSD over USD?The advantages of buying TUSD instead of USD?TUSD was a token. It's the same like USD. It's not any kind of investment method. If you wanna investing on it and it's better if you are trying to do that and pick another token in the market that didn't act as a stable token. There's no advantage buying TUSD over USD. The only thing that you can stake it to earn passive income but this is quite small. I think that you can search some articles that relesead officially by its developers.",

Do you understand now?Well, this is a fairly complete explanation. however, it is only a matter of placement, and also between stable coins, and fiat currencies. Stable coins like TUSD have quite a number of exchanges, and can easily be moved, because so far, quite a number of exchanges have adopted it. whereas, not all exchanges accept USD, which means, it may be more flexible. however, I also still think that it is better to choose USD if the exchange you use adopts USD. it just depends on taste. however, seeing what happened to Terra, I'm more inclined to choose fiat to keep my assets. if you want to invest long term, you should choose popular coins. but it's not a problem if you want to store assets temporarily.",

TUSD is just a token like every other tokens and has a lesser market capitalisation when compared with USDT. I'll rather invest in USDT or busd than TUSD.

How is it any better investing in TUSD over USD?The advantages of buying TUSD instead of USD?Don't be deceived, such pegs are not always applicable. There are many times that the value of TUSD has been lower than $1, so you might miscalculate your plans if you solely depend on TUSD=USD always. If you want accurate investment or storage, you should go for the USD if your platform allows that.Quote from: MAAManda on August 02, 2022, 05:32:15 AM[1] Is TUSD value always the same as USD value?- Yes they will have the same value because TUSD is a stablecoin with a 1:1 peg with its original FIAT, unlike USDD, USDT and UST.

It's not because it shows less, that it is actually less. With TUSD you're seeing the value in real time, while the USD may take a while to update since it depends mostly on what the government is doing, printing money for example. TUSD on the other hand may be pegged to USD, but it's still another coin, meaning that it's gaining or losing value based on buying/selling operations, so it's not like it fully depends on the US Dollar to have its own value, it does depend, but not entirely.",

Stable token = fiat moneyThere is an \"advantage\" because you could move money around in crypto faster by using it, but there are a lot of people using trx chain with usdt and not worry about anything else. In fact, I had a person send me 20 bucks on erc20 chain which is a weird move considering how much it costs just to send it, and yet even that was enough. So, I have to say that it is a smart move to use another stablecoin instead of using TUSD, it's really making it a mute point to go with TUSD when the others are making sense at least as much. This isn't a big deal because you do not have to actually care about TUSD at all, but you could use stablecoins anyway.",

How is it any better investing in TUSD over USD?The advantages of buying TUSD instead of USD?TrueUSD is the same as any other collaterized stablecoin. It's pegged to the US Dollar, bringing you the convenience of Fiat money without ever touching banks. The stablecoin is a great tool for day trading when you want to get the most out of the crypto market without going through all of the hassles of cashing out to Fiat. While it does come with its benefits, TUSD cannot be trusted for storing your money in the long term because it's not backed nor regulated by the government. Just like UST fell all the way down the drain (even though it was another type of stablecoin), the same can happen with TUSD, USDT, and other stablecoins on the market. There's nothing 100% guaranteed that will last a lifetime.I'd prefer to sell crypto directly to USD just to avoid all of the risks of holding stablecoins in my wallet. Ultimately, you decide what to do with your money. As long as you don't invest more than what you can't afford to lose, you'll have nothing to worry about. Just my thoughts",
