If it is only outflow, no new inflow, it will become dead with time. It's logic with all markets but fortunately, I see that Bitcoin demand will increase with time, and it's just late comers will have to buy bitcoin at more expensive prices.I don't think with late comers, it will hurt them, as said, if it is hurtful for them, there will be no demand to join this market in future.",

I'm sure we can agree, at some point, Bitcoin will be extremely expensive. For one who owns none, they have a severe disadvantage. The time at which this disadvantage exists, is at the time it hurts for not owning it. The reason why I think this is soon, is due to the very poor economic state globally, as well as the potential fall of the US dollar/debt explosion being closer than what we may think.

If we look at Weimar Republic, it only took 2 years to reach hyperinflation...most countries are already experiencing higher than normal inflation numbers.",

      "body": "As much as I love Bitcoin I think it's unlikely for all fiat currencies to implode at the same time, at least anytime soon. For now any collapsing fiat currency will more likely lead to people fleeing to other fiat currencies. This is unlikely to change until Bitcoin starts to play a larger role in international trade. If that happens, the clock will start ticking fast.Quote from: BenCodie on February 13, 2025, 02:03:28 PMMy fear is for the masses...It's a scary thought to think what an implosion of fiat will do to those who have no bitcoin, or who have debt, or worse, both.Upside: In your scenario having (fiat-denominated) debt is a good thing, actually.",

The younger generations are up coming and they have to be aware of such investments like bitcoin, so that they would know how to use it when the time comes. For me I would say, there isn't actually any amount of time required for average Joe. As soon as he becomes aware of BTC and has enough funds to start investing, then he should go for it as soon as possible.",

But as an investment or an asset one buys to make profit out I will simply say the more years it keeps going or the more demands coming the time left to get it at a discount price will be reducing. To actually put a time scale will be hard because the usa case of bitcoin is definitely going to make it grow in value everyday, but my prediction will be that as long as bitcoin isn’t mined entirely then it is not late to actually buy and make multiple profits from it. This doesn’t mean after the mining is done it wouldn’t still be a good buy but I believe it will be more scarce then",

As much as possible and as long as we can plan to start and most importantly how that desire can grow based on bitcoin’s performance which continues to show much better resilience going forward and if you don’t want to be left behind then you can start planning to buy it now. The question is how much time does it take for someone to start getting involved in the investment because the only reason we often hear is not having the money to buy it.If bitcoin can provide financial freedom to achieve a much better life, then all means must be done and there is no need to wait for the right time as long as we have money we can buy it in any amount and in my opinion it is not too late if we want to build financial freedom to be better.",

At least for me, personally, if I wasn't immersed into Bitcoin investment for almost a decade, I would be facing serious and concerning financial issues right now, with low thriving perspectives, added to demotivation, due to every other problems we also face in different aspects of life.However, it's important to highlight a good moment to start investing in BTC is during the bearish season. This market works in cycles, and to invest during the peak of the bullish cycle is only worthy if you have long term goals in mind. So, I would wait the current trend to cease to invest again.Just make sure to not miss the train next time, because we never know if it's going to be the last.",

Probably why people are mostly advised to maintain an investment in bitcoin to an amount they can afford to lose because it is not without risk owing to its volatility and market uncertainties that greatly shapes and determines the price of the coin. But having said that, BTC is one digital asset anyone should hodl as investment for the future in this contemporary time.",

By the way, millions of people on earth don't owe any Bitcoin, and they are living their lives without thinking of having bad encounters of not investing in Bitcoin.Not investing in Bitcoin doesn't turn out to be the worst for anyone. Not everyone on earth will love to invest in Bitcoin. Anyone who feels to have a risk of investing in Bitcoin, let them go ahead at any time they feel like, not proclaim negative thoughts to them",

The global economic crisis have made inflation to go high and making workers to spend all they have earned on basic needs. I think there is still time since the price of Bitcoin has not gone too high that someone wouldn't be able to adopt the DCA method to acquire Bitcoin.  Some people who know the potential of Bitcoin are seeking other sources of revenue to invest in it. The price has gotten above $100k and might get to $150k before the end of the bull run. I can't predict how the next four years will turn out to be. My conclusion is that since Bitcoin can be bought in bits, there is still time to buy the coin.",
