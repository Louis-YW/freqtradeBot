For Nigeria I no sure say e get any thing like highest price limit because anything price fit change at anytime, for those wey still dey set budget when dem go market the only thing wey u go dey hear na be say \"everything don add money so I no fit thing wey I write finish\" this talk now no be new thing for our ear because na wattin we dey hear all the time.",

Those days cup of garri was #10, exercise Note book was #50, pen #20, but if you go to the market to buy cup of garri now is #100, exercise Note book 40 lives is #200, pen is #100 for you to know that many things has go wrong in our economy, and many people have reduce the way they use to consume food these days. Those days you can eat more than 3 times a day base on the food is surplus in the market and the price is cheap compare to this current economy that made many people to maintain feeding 3 or 2 times a day and many people have reduce the way they use to purchase food items in the market base on the high price.I came to discovered that some of the food items made in Nigeria are still more cheaper than those items made in other countries and, their price is more higher than Nigeria products, and if you check very well you will know that they have the same quality in taste but different price.",

My advice is to have an additional job(this may be hard), start a business their capital can work with or start farming if there's an opportunity for you, which is the best, crop farming is not as expensive as animal farming and it will go a long way for the family.",

A general problem with merchandize in Nigeria is that they are too quick to increase price X2 of the the previous at every simple increment made by producer of a product but when same product price drops they don't act quick in dealing with consumers with the decreased price, and I don't blame them entirely, the government agency saddled with the responsibility of price regulations and control are sleeping on their duty to discharge punishment on offenders by taking bribes while the consumers pay for it all.What I can advise is that, try and be doing over budgeting, because the price you bought a product last week would never be same price of the next two weeks there will always be a top up and that's how bad the reality of things in the country has become.",
