If you didn't meet up your target before the end of this year, just pray and work hard.Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, that is something that quite a lot of people must understand, it is a long term speculative asset, and if you are a speculator, i'm afraid you will have to set your goals of ROI in the long run, mind you also that Bitcoin never stops to serve the purpose for which it was created, and that is as a currency, whether bear time or bull period, it remains exactly that, a medium of exchange.Having said that, i for one do not know the deadlines or targets you are talking about, you sound like you're gambling with different altcoins, mind you that's false diversification. Overall i rarely set goals with something as unpredictable/completely out of my control as cryptocurrencies, if i'm to set goals, i'd do that with RL stuff that i can somewhat control and work hard towards achieving.",

Had you bought bitcoin in 2018, 2019 or 2020, you would be having a completely different perspective about this.Don't wait for main stream media to start talking about Bitcoin's price surge before you buy it. Always buy when the noise is negative or when there's quiet like right now.",

If you invest now after 4-5 years time you will be smiling. It doesn't have to be a long-term investment, because if you choose the entry point well, after a few months you can make 100% profit or more. Of course, people want a lot more than that, and sometimes it takes a lot more time than a few months for that. Those who invest today could have a smile on their face even in 2+ years, because if Bitcoin reaches a price of only $100 000, that means more than 400% profit - and we know that the biggest bull runs happen right after the halving.However, it should be warned that past events do not guarantee that the same things will happen in the future, so always be alert and smart with your investments. And not only that, be even smarter about the way you will store your private keys - a lot can happen in 2 years, and even more in 4-5 years.",

I thought that by now people have learned that altcoins (tokens) are something that is not suitable for long-term investment, and that most of them will lose more than 90% of their value or will disappear completely within a period of 3-5 years (if not sooner). Those who are not up to the pump&dump schemes will very likely lose their investment - because investing in something that has no sense and purpose (and most altcoins do not) leads only in one direction.",

Remove all the deadlines you gave yourself to avoid depression.You shouldn't set a financial deadline for yourself, but a financial goal or target. While setting a financial deadline can put you under unnecessary pressure, a financial goal can keep you focused and discipline. A financial deadline sends the message of-\"If I don't meet up, I am a failure\" but a target sends the message of -\"I have hit my goal/target or at least get very close\".Quote from: JoyMarsha on August 09, 2022, 12:07:52 PMIn all you do, endeavour to set a standard goal, and if you fail to achieve all, readjust and bounce back.In all you do, also ensure not to set low standards for yourself all in the name of setting attainable goals, set high goals and targets for yourself that will keep you motivated all through your journey. Be easy on yourself if you do not meet your target or goals at fir trial after setting very high standards. A benefit of setting high targets and goals is that even if you don't get to hit them as planned at first, you achieve a very high level of success from trying to do so, and with a little more work and efforts, the high target that you thought was unachievable or be difficult to achieve will be achieved and you will gain the confidence to set higher ones.",

However, always know that bitcoin won’t frustrate us the whole time. Just never set deadlines and stop expecting much, that way you will not be often hurt.

But the reality is that everyone has to fight against themselves about how they have good management of their investments. Averages are not strong enough to withstand a large correction or price drop that causes them to sell and take losses. The psychology of trading and investing that they have is not as strong as they hope in the long term, this will certainly determine the end result that is not worth it.Short term or long term it doesn't matter, it just depends on the preferences of each investor or trader. Even some people like profitable future trading but with high risk, but to minimize risk, long term investment is the best option ever. Just don't be greedy.",
