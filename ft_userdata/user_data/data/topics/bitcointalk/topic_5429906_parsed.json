I basically just use the internet for browsing so I like to think I’m quite safe.Nobody can be 100% certain that they’re surfing securely but there are certain things that can be done to give yourself the best chance & I like to think that I practise safe internet use.",

I love this program especially because it lets me know the performance of my computer. With an easy program interface, it has a scan mode that checks everything on the computer, privacy sweep, anti-virus protection, spyware, clean out junk files, firewall security reinforcement and disk optimization. The program itself does give a constant checkup of your computer knowing that while you are using the internet it gives you protection. The only con to this program is that it has constant advertisements for recommended software but that can be easily disabled.",

For today's viruses and malware we need completely different protection.",
