I don't think those who are members rank or even higher rank.  They don't know how to wear a signature.If they don't know it, they don't deserve his rank. This topic has already been posted before. But his topic was normal Quote from: BitcoinTurk on July 11, 2018, 05:12:21 PMStep 1: Click on the '' Profile '' tab.Step 2: On the left side we enter the '' Forum Profile Information '' section via the menu that appears.Step 3: We move the page down a bit and find the '' Signature '' box. Inside this box we add the signature code you want to attach your signature to.Step 4: We are at the bottom of the page and click on the '' Change Profile '' button.When these steps are completed, your signature will change immediately. Signature exchange is that simple and easy!  But your post looks good. coz, you have used screenshot. This will probably help noobs to understand easily. Since you have shown how to wear the signature. With this you should have shown how to wear avatar.How to add Avatar? Step 1 :  Go to the Forum Profile Information and click the avatar option. For example check the screenshot bellow.Step 2 : now upload your avatar 120px wide, 80px tall, and maximum of 100 KiB in size. Then click upload Button. For example check the screenshot bellow.",

What you're talking about?It's make sense Jr. Member and Member rank don't know how to wear signature since they're still new in this forum, while Full Member you're need to earn at least 100 merit which is you're already familiar with this forum. It's just like teaching an adult how to eat while he already eat 3 times a day in his whole life, useless.",

You are correct that it is a noob post but don't forget the effort that op did just to make this thread which op's aim is to help those who didn't know how to customize his/her profile like adding/editing signature, personal text and more. Just so you know, newbies doesn't know how to add/edit signature since newbies can't add signature and newbies must buy copper membership to be able to add signature except those newbies which it is an alt account of a Jr. Member or higher rank.",
