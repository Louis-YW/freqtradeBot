It was all because I wasn't using knutz. ðŸ˜…Where is brother Luke btw? I have never seen him around here, I hope he is fine after the \"incident\" last year, hopefully they didn't find anything on him to blackmail him into advocating for censorship. Luke & Jack, kind of reminds me of Pat & Mat. LolSince he is a \"man of God\", what would have happened if God decided to censor all the demons? I know the answer, we would be living in a world without any temptations for sin, and then all the undeserving people could get a straight ticket for heavens, but now everyone has to prove themselves to show they are worthy and rightfully so only the worthy shall enter the heavens. Â All thanks to no censorship policy.",

The number can be checked at bitnodes.io or coin.dance/nodes.Bitcoin Knots: https://bitcoinknots.org/Decentralize is good but do you think if it comes along with censorship, is it a good movement for Bitcoin community?Having a decentralized and non-censored network are best things Bitcoin network has in comparison to many altcoin blockchains. If now, it is going to be censored, by Bitcoin nodes, I am really fearful about belief of people in Bitcoin.If you can censor small things, you can censor bigger stuffs and there will be no limits. Like central banks can lift their limits by brr money printing, developers and nodes can lift up their limits of censorship.",

The number can be checked at bitnodes.io or coin.dance/nodes.Bitcoin Knots: https://bitcoinknots.org/I am not sure whether the question is genuine or whether you try to attract ignorant people to bitcoin knots. I would suggest converting the topic to a detailed comparison of Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots, so we can have a serious discussion about it.In this regard:\"Spam-free\" << censorship resistant, so I 'd rather feel ordinals choking my neck than having my transactions censored. Hope it makes sense!Finally, as a community we must focus on expanding the network and on scaling it, rather than changing its fundamental rules.

I mean seriously, one must be very narrow-minded, to blindly make accusations like this.By the way, I don't really care what you say or what you do. Just run the code you like and makes you feel comfortable. I will do the same. Bitcoin gives you this freedom, you know. Unless of course you wanna use some other chain or Bitcoin fork. Finally, I am surprised you think \"censhorship\" is a buzzword. Censorship is the enemy for me. If for you, the enemy is the ordinal nonsense, just act accordingly.",

My understanding is, if I own my keys, then if the blockchain looks up my address and it sees a balance, it must be true. If a node feeds me fake info, wouldn't other nodes detect this and then block it off?Bitcoin Core seems too difficult to manage for someone who doesn't own a computer (desktop).

If a node feeds me fake info, wouldn't other nodes detect this and then block it off?Where are you looking up \"the blockchain\" if you are not using your own node? You are using someone else's node, either by using a wallet which connects to their node, or a blockchain explorer website which connects to their node. And whenever you rely on someone else's node, you cannot verify for yourself that the information is accurate. Let's say I'm running Electrum connected to a third party server. That server is owned and operated by a malicious third party who is entering in to a trade agreement with me, although I do not know this. They send some bitcoin to my Electrum wallet and in return I send them some altcoin, goods, fiat, whatever. However, it turns out they didn't send me any bitcoin at all. All they did was have their server feed fake information to my Electrum wallet, making my Electrum believe that it had received funds.If they send this fake data to other nodes, then of course other nodes will reject it. But that doesn't make any difference to me, since I've already made a trade and been scammed based on this fake data I received. If I ran my own node instead and they tried to feed me fake data, then my node would reject it as invalid, I wouldn't see a fake balance in my wallet, and I wouldn't have been scammed.The risk of such an attack can be lessened by checking against multiple servers (as Electrum does by default), but the only way to prevent it entirely is to run your own node and therefore validate the blockchain data yourself. And of course the more servers you connect to in order to lessen such an attack, then the worse your privacy since you are revealing your wallets/balances/transactions to a growing number of third parties.",
