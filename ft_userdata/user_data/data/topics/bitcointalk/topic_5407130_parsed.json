I have no idea about the commission rate of both stake and windice so I'm assuming you are deducting part of it to be your profit. This offer is a bit too good to be true and it will be helpful if you can provide any document that will proved that your service is officially partnered by stakes and windice because there's a chance that you might not pay all the commission earning in the long run if you are not really affliated to them.But this service is good in general if this is legit. I might try this if you can provide what I'm asking. Good luck!",

If you're that close to Stake, why ask people to sign on your referral link when you can just give them some of your service for more money in the end?you need to understand this. Crypto casino sites increase their commission rates for promotion. If you have a website or social media audience, you can send an e-mail to increase your commission.   I have to explain that this is a collaborative effort, so if you play, you earn and we earn. We pay 100% because actually everything is in your hands. When you use our reference link, you can see your wager statistics and calculate the amount we will pay. so no scam. There is a mathematical function for calculation on our website. wager * commission rate = your earnIf we do not pay you , you will stop using our referral link . Of course, that will never happen because we work together. we make a commission increase agreement with websites . In fact, if you use your own referral link, you will receive very little commission, we earn more on commission. and you can save on our website. If you want, you can invest and get a lump sum at the end of the month. If there are websites you want to see, we can add them to our website after talking to them.",

Good luck!As how I see it, I think op earn from commission from the gambling site if op did manage to find gamblers and access the gambling site through the site that op has provided if I am not wrong. As what I can say about it is op is a partner of stake and windice as stated in the site. I don't think that the amount you will get from your referrals won't be good amount so, that's what I think why op prefer to get commission from stake and windice when op manage to attract gamblers. As far as I can see in the site, there is only two gambling site as you can see when you access the site. (I think it's because it is new and as of now, op only manage to partner up with windice and stake. Maybe op will add more.",
