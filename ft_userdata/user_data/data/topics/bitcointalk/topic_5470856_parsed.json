So my fans are set to 61% about 4900 rpmwhich in my garage means I do not hear them.So this board allows you to run the s19xp in your garage. Without a lot of noise.update 1016.59 kwatts at 6:06.  pm  970.37 kwatts at 12:06 am  46.22 kwatts in 18 hours  = 2567 watts an hour2567/120 =21.39 watts. it is interesting to see the high end meter rates 21.39 watts a ththe software reads 23.8 watts a thSo I tuned at 120 th for 18 hours and basically it gives me no increase in efficiency but it let me lower fans to 61% and noise in the garage is okayNew  tune is set for 70 th  lowest setting is 60th70 th looks like this so farat 8:00 pm. k-watts are 1019.30at 10:00 pm K-watts are 1022.31             3010 watts1505/70 = 21.50 wattsI will post back on this.At midnight I set it to  110 th1025.78 12 am1048.35 9 am22.57 kwatts in 9 hours 2507 watts an hour so 2507/110 = 22.79 watts a th.  So the epic on down clocks does not seem to lower power use but it easy peasy allows fan controls now I do have 2 shitty chips on this xp that tend to drop out on this xp. Today I am going with an up clockthis is a 135th machine I will try 145thI am doing a no tune settingfreq 475power 13 vfans 80%all manual setting",

If you think its like the j Pro, think again...Yeah I am in the 70c to 75c top heat areaI may set shutdown to 82c not 85cMy garage testing is over It looks like I can do 152th at 22 watts a th fans set to 90%and never go over 72c.  It is a decent board. tough call to say it is better than using braiins.the flat fee is nice but it is about 60 more than a plain controller.so if you earn 5 a day you save 10 cents a day over braiins takes 600 days to save the 60 dollars extra cost. not to mention the first 100 cost if you do the math that way it takes 1600 days.  now if everything takes off and you are making 30 a day then you save 60 cents a day and it is better than braiinsIf you are a home miner it is great for noise reduction.I do not think I want a lot of them for now.I am still wondering if I want to not buy a lot of xp's and go to s21's",

How long were you able to reduce your W?basically the epic board on my 134th models does not increase efficiency at all.but it does lower fan speeds so if you are a home miner in you garage you can drop watts to about 2500 and do about 120th with fans at 60%So I recommend it if you want to make the miner quiet.",

If you conveniently leave out the purchase price of 3-5k. Yo could justify running it .I do this but that l7 paid itself off at my real mine.To go out and buy a machine for say 4000 that makes at my garage 3 bucks a day for only 7 months of the year.Is very hard to justify.Now if you get a cheap s19xp in a bit say 1800 and you have a need for heat yeah maybe .",

If you need it, it will only be 2-3 months a year. Advantage of living in Portugal.  In terms of energy costs, it will be around 15 cents.Anyway, it won't really be the best combinations for me to venture into having an ASIC.I don't know if you read my \"diary\" about an adventure I had in mining, using NiceHash.

I'm not quite as concerned about maximum HR but rather maximum efficiency - I'm building out a facility in NY State where power + delivery comes in @ approximately 15 cents / kWh so getting every bit of efficiency out of these machines is definitely something I'd spend a bit extra on if it were a difference that I deemed worth dropping the coin on.

      "body": "Hey! First - I appreciate your feedback and Yes - you’re correct. It took a few weeks to get locked in to an industrial electricity rate (had to form an LLC and show articles of incorporation to get the power company to offer it and for whatever reason it took the department of treasury almost 60 days). I was looking to undervolt / under clock mostly to increase efficiency which the boards did actually work very well for. Tuning the 19K Pro’s to 106T with the ePIC’s voltage optimizer keeps them hashing at a stable 2350w (a few machines much more efficient - 1 or 2 much less lol).And I know lol - even at the. 11.2 cents / kWh the numbers are a bit iffy - but I’ve got some S21’s that I’ve started to take delivery of so running these alongside those until I retire them seems pretty decent comparatively looking at other machines at that price point. With regard to efficiency, the UMC’s definitely helped me get to where I wanted to be. So I guess what I want to add here is this - for anyone considering them, I can’t speak to how far you can push the chips/boards for maximum HR, but if you’re looking to max out the efficiency while maintaining an impactful hashrate, the boards are a solid choice. And yeah I paid for the machines in late September so I paid closer to $1500 USD/S19k Pro. Anticipating the machines will follow the market price of BTC as they have in past cycles.",
