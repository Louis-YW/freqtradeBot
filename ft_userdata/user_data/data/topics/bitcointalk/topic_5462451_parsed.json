      "body": "The market will continue to grow. As technology evolves, people will come up with new ideas for products and services to offer and sell. However, this does not mean that the market will not be profitable for new projects. It still is for as long as you know how to sell your products and attract your target clients and customers. It all comes down to how competitive you are.",

Because the problem is whether or not a new project or company is still profitable in current conditions really depends on their respective strategies in terms of making their own project or company more attractive when viewed by many investors. Companies or new projects must also be able to see the opportunities that exist in the market so that they can make products that are most liked by many people in order to get better marketing. Because it is not easy to make a new product that is very popular and beat old products that are already in demand is not easy in the current conditions, so any company or project party must do its best to make products that are more attractive and have better benefits so that they can beat the others with more marketing.",

There aren't reliable crypto exchanges on the market and we need a good one that will provide us with a good and transparent service but will also respect our privacy.There is not a big competition among instant exchanges too, it's very hard to find trustworthy instant exchange with good rates, so this market is open for anyone who plans to offer a good service.Blockchain market is also the least saturated market I would say. Mostly because there is a lack of blockchain developers and there aren't many blockchain development companies.Hundreds of new projects doesn't mean hundreds of them succeed every time. Just have a look, how many students manage to get top grades? A tiny percent. So, among hundreds of new projects, only tiny percent manages to make it and in business, it's even harder to succeed than in school and university. Market is still profitable for new projects if you know how to sell and what to sell.",

It is true that Binance managed to control the market during a relatively short period, but this is what makes the task of new instant exchanges very difficult. How can new exchanges gain confidence and popularity in the presence of a strong and reliable exchange like Binance?Yes, we need a good exchange that provides us with good and transparent service and also respects our privacy, but will you trust the new exchanges? Most of the users prefer using old trusted exchanges over trying a new one.",

Most of the projects/startups will fail, a few \"Unicorns\" will survive and become big corporations. It doesn't matter if the market is crowded or too competitive. If the idea behind the project is good, if the team of developers is competent and the project's Business plan is achievable, I think that there's no way such crypto startup to fail.I believe that your way of thinking seems kinda wrong here. The market cannot be \"profitable\". The market is what it is. The companies can be profitable or not profitable.",

I think it's a matter of what the project sells, if the people want what they're selling, it will be successful anyways.As bitcoin bull run is fast approaching, you will notice that many projects will flood the industry because of the bull run. There is a tendency that 80% of these projects will survive until the next bear market when they will be hit hard by the market and some of them will extinct.Any project that is established during the bear market and it survives until the next bull run is no doubt a very fantastic Project. On the long run what matters is if such a project has a niche and solves a problem and not necessarily the bull run and the bear market.",

      "body": "It depends on a lot of factors - one of the main ones would be how innovative are you? In every market (crypto or not), you have to give something new and useful to your future clients. That also depends on your knowledge and ability to contribute to the market.If you are not looking for innovation and what to make a project on already available resources, making it profitable can just be even harder for you since there are a lot of bigger organizations everywhere and that might discourage you. On the other hand, even if the market is oversaturated with similar projects, most of the small ones don't have better chances than you would so you just need to know what your goal is and stand by it until you make a profit out of it.So it's either be more innovative than your competition or find a way to make your deal better and lead more consumers on your product/service. In any situation, you have to have an edge, if it's your knowledge or ability to manage that project you have in mind. It isn't easy, but you need to be persistent and it goes the same for the crypto market or any other field even though crypto is a story of it's own.",

But if you are just copying someones idea like using generic plans then expect that investors will avoid your project.",

I only mentioned the exchanges but cryptocurrency is not just limited to Casinos, Cryptocurrency wallets, and Exchanges it can be a lot more than that so it's all about innovation with some real use cases.If you come up with another shitcoin with the only intention of making money then there is no way it is going to make you a dime.",

If we can answer this question, the project can be profitable and serve something good.There will always be new projects in the market.
