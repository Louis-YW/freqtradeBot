We are already in a bear market, so it means investors are reluctant to put their money on the market because of uncertainties.And if ever we will go back to $37k-$38k? only time will time. It's hard to predict as I have said, we might be trading sideways for quite some time, and then go down again. Smart investors though might take this advantage and buy cheap BTC.",

Smart investors though might take this advantage and buy cheap BTC.Bear market season is one of the best scenarios to happen for certsin traders because they could buy a lot of things including bitcoin at more cheaper price. And since we are in bear market situation I'm also sure that many are now doubting to put their money on the market because many are so afriad to experience another 2018 bear market season which really hurt the market at that time.If ever bitcoin price would really go back to the figures yoh mention may we can expect that bear market will end up soon and the one will replace it is the bull market condition.",

A recovery to $35k and maybe staying in that level for a week should be enough to show that we recovered from the possible worst-case scenario of dropping down to $20k. I still wouldn't hold it that we're out of the bearish season though, it may possibly last till the end of the year.",

For us who have been here longer than the OP, yeah, there is nothing odd in the way the price is moving this year. There are so many factors, specially the war in Europe that really affects the price in a negative way, hence it has difficulty recovering to $35k and above. And you touch base an important topic, buy the dip because money are made in bear market. Meaning buy more in this cycle because they are at a discount and then simply HODL on them till the next bull run to make good gains.",

It should reach 37-38K for a positive sentiment.You couldn't just expect that Bitcoin will recover fast at this bearish time. We'd rather expect more on corrections instead. We see a little spike in Bitcoin in the past few days which gives us enlightenment and it gives us the confidence that holding is somewhat what we need this time. The sudden change in its trend is very common which is why the market remains unpredictable. Now that we see it is moving down, later on, this will move back high again. This is really how it works, nothing we get surprised.",
