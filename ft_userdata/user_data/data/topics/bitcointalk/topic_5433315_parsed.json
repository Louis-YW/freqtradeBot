To broadcast a transaction you need tron in your wallet. You wallet does not have enough tron for sure. Try to send some tron to cover the gas of the transaction you want to create.",

      "body": "Do you mind sharing the hash transaction?In any way, contrary to the gas issue, it seems there might be other problems. AFAIK, the gas issue error will spite out OUT OF ENERGY error, instead of TRANSACTION_REVERT.For example, see this hashes:OUT_OF_ENERGY: https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/839f21c0ba5da5d5d16f9c2f597c955a566affee80025981941a5a12606809c5TRANSACTION_REVERT: https://tronscan.org/#/transaction/927b0e233515799ba95e473062311edb795da79de842f322115028dc2a2b7cc2Based on OP, the information about the error is:Quote“Transaction Revert ”issues are caused：1.Call throw2.If you call the require parameter (expression) the final result is false.3.If you call a function via a message, but the function does not end correctly4.If you create a contract with the new keyword, but the contract is not created correctly5.If your contract receives TRX via a public function without a payable modifier (including constructors, fallback functions, and generic public functions).6.transfer() fails7.Call revert()8.Reach the maximum function stack depth 64.9.For more information, please go tohttps://developers.tron.network/docs/exception-handlingI don't know much about the TRX ecosystem, so I couldn't think of what's the problem in your case. Another point to debug further is to follow https://developers.tron.network/docs/faq#4-how-to-troubleshoot-when-calling-the-contract-and-return-the-revert-error to dig out the actual error.",

Since we are in the blind, I guess it could be due to insufficient energy or bandwidth in your address. This can be solved by adding more TRON into the address containing the USDT",

Yes, I have 17 dollars worth of TRX in my wallet.As described above in my post, it is not a gas issue. Another way to find out the root causes besides following the method from the Tron documentation page is to seek out help from the communities channel of the wallet you are using or the platform you are interacting with. Or just simply state it here, others might have the same issues if there is indeed a problem on the application side. Without either of those, there isn't much to debug further.",

It might be gas fee issue, i never faced transaction failure issue, i'm using trust wallet for the many years. Can you share a Snapshot?",

Yes, I have 17 dollars worth of TRX in my wallet.You can try to do a transaction again, and you must ensure that you have enough TRX balance to cover the Tron token transaction fees. The transaction will not make your USDT balance disappear. The most important thing is not to set network fees manually.",
