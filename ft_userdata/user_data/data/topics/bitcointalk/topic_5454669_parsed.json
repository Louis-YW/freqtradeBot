  "content": "The inception of NFTs brought a new era in the world of collectibles. Anything from art to rare items can now be collected in a digital manner. To some people, this is revolutionary because it eliminates the need to find space and protect your most valuable possesions. But to others, physical collectibles are better since they're something you can actually touch and carry with you wherever you go.I'd prefer physical collectibles since they're something that could last forever. Not digital (intangible) items that are stored on a centralized server subject to fade in an instant.Which do you prefer? Physical or digital collectibles? And why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

There are a few collections that draw true collectors from the physical art world (Fidenza, Nina’s), but every other project is constant pump and dumps. I was heavy into Bored Ape Yacht Club and the rest of Yuga’s ecosystem, but having seen the landscape shift so much from art to casino, I’m out.Physical collections absolutely get my vote.",

I have also lost over 100 XCP NFT's - didnt realize that freewallet doesnt keep the keys once a key is imported so after import I destroyed my copy of the key believing the key had been imported to freewallet but it did not and after restarting freewallet - the imported key no longer showed. I much prefer physical - if a physical has a digital - ok that's kind of cool but I do not see myself paying sats for a NFT ever.",

I saw it as more serious and \"secure\" then NFTs where many teams is to weak to survive particularly long. But lately physicals got hit and some of my idols proved not to be long-term sustainable. So know I don't fully know.I have most fun with NFTs. I am probably still most proud when I show of my physicals or watch them alone.",

Like something that could be shaped on fantasy and become true.I find everything realized in the first 5-10 years of bitcoin's existence \"interesting\". nowaday there are a lot of collectibles produced yearly (both digital and physical). meanwhile those from the early years are really interesting and certainly with a very limited edition.",

It just has more dimensions / layers added to the esperience that cannot be replicated in the digital world.That said, *some* digital art I would fully appreciate as \"real\" art. One of my favourites is a combination of physical and digital, there is an art expo called Ars Electronica which was very early in trying to combine these two worlds.They are still around, could still be worth checking out: https://ars.electronica.art/news/en/I am not generally opposed to NFTs but not a fan of mass produced-for-max-profit randomly-generated-bs.

Bitcoin can be a real investment for all of us, especially if we own a lot of Bitcoin and store it for sale at a peak price.But if NFT has developed later and many start using NFT as an investment, maybe I'll just start saving some NFT. For now, NFT prices are also unrealistic",

So I will still choose the physical collectible, and I think it is also more artistic when placed in a private gallery at home with perfect placement and spatial arrangement.And actually there are many advantages of physical collectibles more than what I mentioned.",
