That started in this forumPizza for bitcoins ?. It was in 2010.Two years later, another member (VIP), El Cabron made another classic trade offer.Raw Thai Honey (First 40 BTC of profits go to the forum!) 8 KG for sale!Many members had their trades with the VIP member but there is no confirmed post from El Cabron that all sales are enough to get 40 BTC. Eventually the user had enough BTC for donation and get the VIP badge by one way or another tradingMessage:Use case and utility of Bitcoin increase with time. That means its value increases a lot.Such deals are classic and shocking in the past but now, if you make such one, it is very normal.A random dig in to the past of forum and Bitcoin.  I don't know Meta or Bitcoin discussion is a best board for this topic. I see both fits with the content. For now, I leave it in Meta.",

I’d recommend you wait for another lockdown before you go down those rabbit holes - sorry OP going off topic.",

Since every computer consumes electricity, especially under load, mining has never been free.I understand where you are coming from 1 BTC = 1 BTC always.Free money means it did not have any demand at all. Like Bitcoin Pizza was 10,000 BTC. It was just fun to send 10,000 BTC to have those two Pizza. People used to buy hardware components in exchange of BTC. For them it was FREE in exchange of some coins. For the seller it was also some FREE coins in exchange of their spare hardware. CPU mining did not cost you much it was the same as the laptop you have turned on right now.",

Compare Global Rank on this to this to this.But after stepping away from here for 6 months, I realized theymos really only has to do one thing, and that is preserve Satoshi's posts.
