I do not know why this user chose him among the thousands of ways to convert Bitcoin to USDT safely, but there may be another reason.He did not give us more details, but it is better to avoid dealing with the user until we are sure that he is a scammer.Quote from: maudo on February 13, 2023, 01:46:22 PMwe did btc to usdt exchange with this user https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3532285same second btc transaction was confirmed he is gone online and not responding to telegram.
