What about spread and slippage on bingx because it does not seams to be a popular exchange. On such exchanges, there is usually no real movement and only the price change from other exchanges is transferred through arbitrage traders. It is difficult to achieve successful scalping in such conditions. In my opinion, it is even better to pay more in fee than always being a taker with a price of +-0.5% to prices from other exchanges (1% spread). Trading on binance futures is prohibited in Spain, but binance spot is available. Therefore, I recommend binance spot, and if you need leverage and the ability to take short positions, margin trading will be the solution for you.",

So don't decide to deposit money in any scam exchange thinking about free trading. and always try to use an exchange that has high trading volume and lots of orders for the coin you are thinking of trading. then there you can buy/sell that coin very quickly at your expected price. I don't know why you are interested in using bingx when it is not a popular crypto exchange.  Or somehow you're here to promote it!  If your intention is to promote exchange then I would advise you to open a proper ANN",

If you can earn profit with $102 fund and become $120 I don't think bad have to pay fees under $1, its normal for all exchange fees transaction and you will pay higher or bigger fees when trading in dapp exchange like Pancke. You will surprise when trading with dapp on ethereum network at Uniswap and need to pay higher fees each time swapping coins. There are not exchange are lower fees transaction for trading, in my local exchange have to pay almost 0.3% each time transaction including with taxes have to pay for government.",

Fees is definitely low but spread isn't that low but overall you'll find it great trading here. Even Bitget has been used by a lot of people so that can be an option as well. Apart from these the spreads will be too much even if you save in fees you'll pay in slippage.",

So basically try and make limit orders instead of market orders and your fees will be very low. Hard to go any lower honestly unless you are trading huge volumes.Also make not of the spread. Some exchanges might have lower fees but spread could be wider and it won’t help. So make sure the spread is similar to Binance or Bybit when it comes to the same pair.",

Those who make it a priority with what fees are charged trading are those who aren't too sure they can make a kill trading. Otherwise what should concern every trader is the security of their funds on exchanges they use and their ability to withdraw whenever they want. What's the benefit having little or zero fees charged for trading when the trader can't withdraw? There should be a call for traders to pay more attention to important things on exchanges than meagre fees charged trading.",

But fee that exchanges takes depends on the position you take not the collateral you have. So if you open a 1000$ position with 100x leverage a fee is taken from 100 000$ position (for instance 0.075% *100 000$ = 75$).
