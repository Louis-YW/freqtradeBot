What will you do if you make mistakes that cause a loss of his money and at the end, you won't have any bitcoin to give him?Will you be ready to pick your own pocket to compensate him?Mistakes can be typing inaccurate receiving address or was hacked unfortunately like this.Accepting his offer to help him is so stupid, at least for you with risk I discussed.QuoteI want to know if it's safe to buy Bitcoin without having the basic knowledge of it ?If you are his tutor and introduced him about Bitcoin, you should answer it already because what he is experiencing is exactly what you did in the past.Answer is simple, you should not invest in anything without basic knowledge. It's gamble, not invest if you spend money without knowing any basics.",

It is okay to have plans or to be curious of it but never invest without seeking for atleast prior knowledge 'coz if you'd do, you'll end up with one of the investors saying that this industry or technology is a scam with huge losses on your account. Any type of investment has its own risk and when it comes on this industry, you'd more likely suffer from market price volatility higher than other kinds of investment. Do not be carried away by impressions that this industry brings an easy way to get rich. There's no such thing. Indeed there are people who made their fortune out of this industry but think of how huge the number is, for those who were forced by circumstances to quit.",

At some point in the future, he can remember that he made that investment, log on to CEX and find his BTC, which he can then sell and withdraw fiat to his bank account.Of course, every CEX is subject to hacking or an exit scam, so it's a risk accepted by those who aim for simplicity and at the same time don't even have basic knowledge.",

If you just hype him for a promise of quick and huge profit just by buying then you should not accept this responsibility because it’s a pain in the ass if his investment value will go down. I have same scenario before when my friend and I started to invest on Bitcoin, He doesn’t have computer and cellphone that time so we agree that I will buy and hold for our holdings. He keeps badgering on checking the price frequently and he always ask me if we will still hold when the price is dipping. At the end he decided to take profit early and I didn’t stop him because he is giving so much stress with his consistent price check about our investment that we agree before we buy to hold it long term. @OP, You shouldn’t accept your friend’s proposal and let him DIY. Just guide him on basic safe keeping of his Bitcoin.",

If they refuse to help the neighbor, they will seem rude and the neighbor might do mistakes on their own and blame the OP for introducing them to Bitcoin but not helping with handling it. If OP agrees to handle coins on neighbours behalf, they will have an added headache of managing someone's money free of charge. And if OP simply teaches the neighbor how to use Bitcoin, they will still be responsible if the neighbor makes a serious mistake and losses the coins, or even if Bitcoin just crashes and the neighbor panic sells. Preaching Bitcoin on the Internet is pretty safe. Explaining it in real life to people who can clearly understand the risks, who can learn on their own is okay too. Introducing it to people who want to get rich quick and don't want to learn or can't learn about the basics is a terrible idea.",

So in the end, you are the centre of the whole thing and that is too big a risk to take, my advice is, you should take some time to school the individual the basic knowledge and the risk level associated with Bitcoin then let the individual make the decision.",
