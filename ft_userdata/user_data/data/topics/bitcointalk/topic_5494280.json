  "content": "The reason why decentralized networks work and can continue staying alive is that they operate on a purely peer-to-peer basis without significant traces of centralization. We have the Torrent, Tor and Bitcoin networks as 3 excellent examples of such systems.But with the passage of time, we have centralization creeping in. Sometimes it is 100% centralized services like CEXes that are a flaw through and through and sometimes we have what is known as \"decentralized\" services but they are either centralized behind the scene (eg. Binance DEX) or have significant \"traces of centralization\" that acts as their vulnerability or that \"chink in their armor\" which is going to be exploited by the anti-decentralization regimes to shut them down or worse to take control of them and turning them into honeypots.The most recent case is the Samourai wallet. At first look it is an open source software, it talks about CoinJoin, looks \"decentralized\" and all is good. But at the root of it, this is a centralized company and when you use it you are relying on a centralized coordinator (server) both of which could always been shut down and they eventually did get shut down.The worst part is that the same \"chink\" can be seen in a lot of places. There are simple cases like bitcoin.org which is a centralized website with a single owner that we saw how easily a well known scammer could force to take down the Bitcoin paper in UK by manipulating the legal system. There are not so obvious cases like the server dependent SPV wallets that rely on connecting to a single centralized server that can be shut down There are similarly server dependent DEXes that suffer from the same flaw just because the developer of that DEX wanted to make money (through fees) not develop something decentralized to solve a problem! Last but not least is the worst of them all: centralization in mining in form of mining pools that can be taken over, shut down or forced to attack Bitcoin (eg. the US based MARA pool attacking Bitcoin principle of censorship resistance)The only viable solution is to patch the chink in the armor! To eradicate as many traces of centralization as we can. After all we should remove the attack vector not try to defend against the attack.",

You have stated good examples like the Torrent, Tor and the bitcoin networks (nodes) excluding the mining pools.Mining pool is another problem that bitcoin developers failed to avoid. There should be something like ASIC resistant (and even if possible GPU resistant) means in the protocol. Just CPU is enough in a way it can not turn to a mining pool. Bitcoin mining would have been decentralized than this.How about decentralized exchanges like Bisq? I do not know how truly the exchange is. Is it using centralized server or through decentralized nodes?

Centralization is becoming like a plague pestering man for existence When would we ever be truly decentralized?Quote from: Charles-Tim on April 26, 2024, 07:25:38 AMHow about decentralized exchanges like Bisq? I do not know how truly the exchange is. Is it using centralized server or through decentralized nodes? There are many things that I thought to be decentralized before but later notice they are not decentralized but centralized in one way or the other.Bisq for now has shown to be decentralized and more like a market centered on Privacy. It's use of Tor is a proof that at the moment it does protects it's users privacy.It's quite similar with Bitcoin (guess that explains why it's mainly only on BTC) as a peer to peer exchange more of a market. No it's not using centralised server but a DAO. Quite similar to Bitcoin proposals by developers individuals with BSQ token can vote on certain proposals to improve the service.I do have a Bisq account and I would say Bisq while been decentralized has some element of custodial and wouldn't really recommend it much Because like CEX in case of dispute your funds can be held by individuals called arbitrators and unlike machines Humans have emotions, So you can tell there would be element of bias sometimes in their judgement.",

US and other countries government will not sleep and will ever be worried until they find a way to see how they can control bitcoin which will not be possible because of the way bitcoin was designed. My fear that the mining pools should keep to the purpose of bitcoin creation, and don't allow themselves to be controlled by the government.The problem here is that a decentralized network is using a centralized server, that sucks. Are there no decentralized servers out there. It is a threat to the purpose of bitcoin creation.",

There's still one weak link that makes everything go wrong, even though we want this to be free of rule and control.The thing is, Bitcoin works since it's not controlled by a single group. It doesn't belong to anyone, and no one can shut it down. Things with the Samourai wallet and those bigger mining pools are going in a bad way. We're going back to the old ways of doing things and putting trust where it shouldn't be.Better tech has to be the answer. Blockchains can't just kind of work or only work when a certain company or group acts perfectly. We need protocols, or rules for how to do things, that are not organized at all. There should be no easy ways out, as that would defeat the purpose. Then we have something that no one can touch. That's what blockchain is meant to have: power.",

The other two examples of truly decentralized networks tor and torrent are no where near as popular and as used as Bitcoin or are on the decline in usage. People tend to go for easier to use alternatives, after-all, they do not consider centralization in their daily activities. Bitcoin does not have a real alternative, people want to use it, hold it and profit from it, but just not in the way it was designed to be.Writing down your seedphrase, not being able to recover your sats if they are lost, checking the source codes of a software, running your own node and choosing your servers is not what a massive amount of the population are willing to do, but they are what create mass adoption.I do not know what the solution will be of if there is one. The trends of closed and failed exchanges stealing people's money was not enough to scare others from centralized exchanges, cause they want to trust something. The exchanges can come up with \"SAFU\" and everyone relaxes again or were never alarmed at all.Best case scenario will be to double down on privacy for those interested in it. Filtering fully open source softwares from partial ones and identifying platforms which are not as decentralized as they claim to be.- Jay -",
