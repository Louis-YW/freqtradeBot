However, it's important to acknowledge that the concept of consistent returns is quite rare.Now, let's delve into the specifics: Are we indeed referring to annual returns here? As far as my knowledge goes, banks typically offer interest on a yearly basis, and this interest rate can fluctuate from country to country. It's worth noting that some banks opt not to provide interest to depositors; instead, they may charge fees for the safekeeping of deposited funds.",

You can’t earn without exchanging anything for it either in a form of service or risking money for investment. I believe best term you are looking for is less risky which I believe through holding Bitcoin is your best chance to hit that profit margin with less risk if you will just hold your asset long term.",

Although the platform you mentioned is quiet reputable but you cannot get a guarantee that they will remain reputable and can 100% sure that they can deliver what they promise since there are so many unwanted circumstances that might possibly happen and that can affect your investment. We all like to have passive profit but we can only achieve that for now on income generating physical assets but if you search it on crypto maybe we cannot get that way since all of the options available are risky ones. So try to be more resources to search those good investment options so that you can try them up and make sure you don't place all your money in single platform since dividing it could potentially give us positive result.",

No one can. In fact i always sort of suspected that kucoin could go down any day. It had strange strategies at the start that that they already had to change, which made me think they didn't have any legal team or even advisors. Nor i have any clue if they ever got any.Their help desk is a joke. One could make 100x better implementing chatgpt translation, and i still don't think they would know any better than informed customer. As they are only working and looking the answering sheets. Most of the time it's a question that they need to ask their from bosses anyway. And they are busy and might not answer any time soon. If ever.I would say that while nothing is safe, some places are safer than other, so don't go chasing higherst return with the cost of having to deal with iffy exchange. Coinbase, kraken, bitfinex and binance have a good track record dealing with customers, and while they might not give biggest returns, i would definitely stick on those.",

You can buy an index fund like VOO or similar. If you are after a low annual return like 10%, you shouldn’t be investing in crypto imo. Crypto is for the high risk takers and high risk means high returns (or losses). 5% bank interest is only good if you’ll need the money in the short term. 5% interest will kill your bucks in the long term because the inflation is way higher than 5%.",

You can lend your ETH, WBTC or other stable coin in any leading protocol to generate 3%-5% yield. If any project is offering a super high yield that means they need to generate that much revenue as well to sustain the selling pressure from stakeholders. Most of the time they can not and end up being rug pulled to their investors or the price dumped heavily.",

If the DEX platform still has a risk, especially the platforms that are under the centralized system,But if you have faith in Kucoin and Nexo, the decision is still up to you, really. The community here on the platform like mine is the only thing we can do to give reminders to anyone like that, and it's up to you if you believe the opinions expressed by a few here in the comment section that you made a topic.As long as everything we do involves money, there is always a risk involved.

If you want to get that type of return, you'll have to choose the platforms that allows you to hold your private keys.
