We cannot foresee what the future holds.2. Untouched coins are not necessarily lost. One very common example is the funded collectible coins and items. Hence if it's ever decided that those coins will \"return into circulation\", that would mean in some cases stealing/confiscation (!).3. My questions to OP is: why do you think that such move is necessary? Do you know that the maximum (almost) 21M Bitcoin we'll ever have means (nearly) 210 000 000 0000 000 satoshi?",

[I assume you're referring to the [impossible] possibility that one day the BTC network decides to distribute the coins to everyone? ]Anyway, you can already make your node configured as strictly as a peer only, and disable the wallet functionality with wallet=0. I have actually done that already some time ago. Not that the protocol can force you to create a wallet or access and RPC calls purely by a message from a peer though, so adding this is not necessary.",

We don't know if those early outputs are still accessible, and therefore can't make a conclusion. In fact, we keep seeing people, occasionally, who unlock outputs that are more than a decade old.",

The lost coins are lost but not lost in value, the value of the lost coin will be added to the ones that are not lost as the circulatory supply is reduced. So, why creating it again, even no one knows the coins that have lost, because a coin is not transferred over 50 years does not mean it is lost. The more the circulatory supply is reducing the more the increase in price as the coin become more limited in supply and will become more valuable.Protect your wallet, seed phrase, private key and bitcoin so not to be a victim of a lost coin.",

Satoshi will keep his coins on his own chain but if that is abandoned his coins will have nearly the same value those currently mined on the BSV network have.Stupidity is the only thing in this universe that has no rules or limits, but I seriously doubt I would see something as stupid as this, at least in my lifetime.

What if people decided to do the same with their BTC do you just want to take that?As I said there is no limit to stupidity, I can perfectly see somebody coming up with an idea of recreating the chain where everyone has to come with his addresses and all KYC details to receive clean coins in a new chain while the ones not claimed by anyone else are presumed lost and destroyed. And trust me, you're going to see people cheering for this as it will give BTC legitimacy or whatever!Just looks at the number of topics like this one where random guys want a piece of satoshis coins, just because they think they deserve!Greed and envy will always manage to ruin a lot of nice things and ideas.",

Anyway 5 years is a short amount of time, for sure we don't have 4.5 mln of bitcoins lost forever, many of them are just sitting in the wallets of some real hodlers. There are addresses without any transaction for the last 10 years and then suddenly the bitcoin move, so what you're asking could even be dangerous because it would suggest to take the bitcoin from someone who didn't actually lose them.",
