  "content": "Right now no single crypto person that is not aware of the $trump memecoin launched on SOL network which has not only seen the token soar with hours but has in like manner invariably giving solana some fresh air and attraction.It is still fresh in our minds the campaign promises D.Trump sold to the public and in particular the bitcoin community that led to the mind-boggling  and overbearing support he got from bitcoiners across the States and outside.Surfing through I couldn't see where he talked or discussed about the launch of $trump token and he did with bitcoin wherever he went. Maybe I missed it, anyone could point that to me please.On that pedestal I have been thinking, trying to process certain items in my head. Did  D. Trump used bitcoin as a means to achieve his political ambition with a preemptive plan to later use that influence to launch a token of his? A means to an end, who knows! To now that he has launched the $trump token, where would his priority lies in the future. Bitcoin or his memecoin? This is something to think about the future of bitcoin and the trump effect, what does this make for the latest development.",

If Official Trump pumped very well, that does not mean it can not lose 90% of its marketcap just like other altcoins. Bitcoin can not lose 90% of its marketcap and it is the only coin that I see promising in the future.",

So ideally... Looking towards his goal on this token, it is nothing more than applying every means to soar the potential values of the token to compete with the other valuable Meme coins so as to optimize it adoption volume.For a whale as Elon coin have not been invented his own coin but prioritizes of endorsing other crypto currencies as Doge coin which most enthusiasts think he has been the owner but had not been confirmed so also his desires on strong supports on Bitcoin, I am think these are just timber of enthusiasts who literally tends to expand the utilizations of the crypto market at large while Bitcoin remains a top notch for everyone influencers.",

      "body": "Interesting discussion OP.I actually saw the listing of that meme coin on the exchange I use, and I must say that I'm very surprise with how fast it could pump within a very short period, but I fear that alot of investors that got in due to FOMO will definitely hit a massive loss if that memecoin fail to pump further than we've seen. That volatility is just too crazy. Price jumping within seconds, which is something to be scared of.Quote from: Familian on January 19, 2025, 09:49:52 PMSurfing through I couldn't see where he talked or discussed about the launch of $trump token and he did with bitcoin wherever he went. Maybe I missed it, anyone could point that to me please.I'm not sure if I can find the thread now, but I think a user shared something like that on this forum. I could remember, because the main discussion was based on how the $trump was allocated, but I can't find the thread now. Maybe I will check again.QuoteOn that pedestal I have been thinking, trying to process certain items in my head. Did  D. Trump used bitcoin as a means to achieve his political ambition with a preemptive plan to later use that influence to launch a token of his? A means to an end, who knows! To now that he has launched the $trump token, where would his priority lies in the future. Bitcoin or his memecoin? This is something to think about the future of bitcoin and the trump effect, what does this make for the latest development.Interesting question. IMO, I think trump capitalized on his massive support from the Bitcoin and crypto community in general. Winning the election, and launching his own token was just like killing two birds with one stone. Though, I don't think this memecoin serves any threat, because I believe that whatever law that is been passed on one, should apply to others, including his. And maybe his memecoin might even get a massive backlash if he eventually have any plans that doesn't favour Bitcoin. So, his priorities needs to be clear and transparent.Edited:And I just saw that Trump's wife also launched her our memecoin.This is absolutely nonsense if you ask me.I really feel sorry for investors with high expectations. It will be quite funny to see crypto enthusiast losing money to non-crypto enthusiast, all in the name of promises. Thank goodness Bitcoin isn't in this class.",

It remains less secure and more volatile compared to Bitcoin. It doesn’t seem like a serious contender against Bitcoin. Memecoins are riskier compared to more established cryptocurrencies. It’s more of a branding or marketing play than a true technological advancement. Even though Trump’s involvement brings attention, the real value will always be in Bitcoin’s security and decentralisation.",
