Then, greekcomunity changed his Moneypot username to 'greekcomunity.https://ninjastic.space/post/62918939Account Last Active dates: vaneshaSeptember 29, 2023, 09:54:23 AMgreekcomunitySeptember 29, 2023, 10:05:15 AM",

A few seconds or a minute apart might but not ten minutes. As for the first, it seems that the edit was fast. He may have simply wanted to copy the 'username' and inadvertently copied the whole thing: 'Username : vanesha', realising it immediately and editing it. Or at least he could claim that.",

Vanesha wrote the previous post on 1 June 2023 while greekcomunity on 3 June 2022. The fact of the error mentioned in the OP, that they logged out within 10 minutes of each other and have had no activity on the forum since 29 September is nothing more than circumstantial evidence. Although I am sure this will arouse the curiosity of blockchain analysis experts and perhaps more conclusive evidence will be uncovered.",

It's best to report this issue to leomedina, as he appears to be the official representative of MoneyPot. They have a better chance of detecting alt accounts and abusers directly within the platform compared to what we can do on the forum. The evidence provided may not be sufficient, as it could simply be a result of a copy-paste error.",

He is reserving work silently and scamming people  Its self admitted even by his name and post His name is even wrong as a professional translator. His behaviour is also very spammy posting about work where its not even required His last postshttps://i.imgur.com/2Sn8ul2.pngMultiple Proof of Scam: All his documents translated here are done used Google Translate (A simple copy paste and delivery of the work)This can be verified by any Greek person https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1To3YKinmTBbLMxdIR82fB2cSbQSnNFjy_0pCGG00OAU/edit?usp=drivesdkBut I saw in its history, the Greekcommunity did not make posts in other languages. Even if he used a translator, it cannot be proof that he was not from Greek. I'm also not sure if anyone has made an alt with another country because that would be very difficult",

Looks like a simple copy/paste job IMO. You might be 100% right, but when you present a case of alts I think more proof needs to be presented. Also make sure the rules of the promotion, campaign, or whatever are being violated as well. Everyone needs to try and have solid evidence before accusing IMO. An accusation can have bad repercussions on a user. Could get someone kicked out of a campaign, could get someone banned, or could get someone tagged. Be sure before you post an accusation.",

Maybe OP shouldn't be too prejudiced. One of the members is from Indonesia, I have read a little history of his writing and yes, he is a native Indonesian speaker. If the OP is still curious, try visiting the local Greek board and asking about the greekcommunity account.",

If not I wouldn't have known how I will come to explain myself, so the thing is before anyone apply for anything they should check very well before rushing to submit whatever they feels like submitting.
