His real name might not even be Satoshi and there is high chances he is not Asian. It will amount to a joke to think that someone inspired by the need for privacy, freedom and anonymity, to create Bitcoin, will divulge his identity easily.As for his private keys being lost, the chances of that being true is also very slim unless perhaps, he intentionally decided to donate those Bitcoin to the community.  Besides, he would still be very rich in Bitcoin because he would have still be mining Bitcoin with different data.",

Realistically, the best option for everyone would be for those private keys to be destroyed, because that way those coins would never appear on the market, but also no one else would be able to present themselves as Satoshi if they were to be found one day. I would also take the third option as the one that makes the most sense to me, because I also think that the person who wrote on this forum under the pseudonym Satoshi did not leave anything to chance and that even then he/she realized how important it is that these coins remain forever unavailable.It could indeed be considered the largest donation anyone has ever made for Bitcoin.",

This is a clear contradiction to the original idea. He chose the figure of 21 million, not 20, right. If Satoshi could and wanted to make a donation to the BTC-community, he would have sold it cheaply in the early stages or distributed it to the rest of the bitcoin-network participants, rather than deliberately reducing, note, the number of coins by ~5 % (more precisely 4.76%). I don’t think that, purely technically, there was a problem in sharing these 1 million mined coins. Therefore, the conclusion suggests itself that Satoshi could not or can't do this.Of course, Satoshi could not know (but could assume) that part of bitcoin would still be lost forever due to lost access to wallets by their owners, which, as a result, would further reduce the limit of 20 million bitcoin from the original 21 million.",

Recall his \"lost Bitcoin is a donation.\" First, I don't think the private key that the individual refers to as Satoshi is lost, nor do I think that he doesn't have access to it or even have those coins donated to the community yet, as he believes that everyone whom the owner no longer has access to is a donation to the community, as it's one step to reduce the number of supplies that could have possibly been in the market. What I think, I think for the sake of privacy and security reasons, the group of people or the individual involve don't see it as a right thing to do yet to spend any scent from the early accumulated bitcoin as their are many eyes on those addresses, any where the coins are moved to will definitely be traced, even if they decided to use a mixing service, every one is curious to know who or whom those entities are so spending from that address will raise attention and it might also comes with lot of panic considering the amount in question. QuoteObviously I am referring to the million Bitcoins or so attributed to him for having mined them at the beginning. If Satoshi is still alive (or if they are still alive) I am sure he has a good amount of Bitcoin but that nobody links with Satoshi's name. I believe the person or group of people are so much alive, and if time is not taken, they are among the top bitcoin holders right now, the already known address attached to the name \"Satoshi\" excluded, with or without them losing access to their early holdings. I still so much believe that they are part of the firm that is controlling the biggest minning pool right now, so one will have such knowledge as they do and will want to feel reluctant and stop accumulating.

Since he/they think staying anonymous is for the best, I strongly respect his/their decision(s), and I think it is for the best that we stop looking for answers regarding the identity of Satoshi, because in my opinion, I don't think we will ever find one. So these speculations are useless and heading no where if you ask me.",

That makes me think he either got an accident, or is in prison.Or, my personal favorite: Satoshi is a time traveller who went back in time to create Bitcoin, and is now spending his fortune in his own time.The posts on this forum cannot be taken into account exclusively when it comes to trying to understand the reason why Satoshi left the forum, and for some time (allegedly more than 1 year) he was in contact with some developers after he wrote the last forum post. In addition, history tells us that some very close associates of Satoshi at one point took a very negative attitude towards him and demanded more \"decentralization\".Quotegavinandresen: I just wish I could convince [Satoshi] to switch to a more collaborative development model.Tritonio: what do you mean? what is the current development model?jgarzik: mostly-closed. open source, closed developmentgavinandresen: Satoshi is the gatekeeper right now, all code flows through him.SourceOf course, for all those who want to know the real history, which is very likely the closest to the truth, everything can be found in perhaps the best article written on the subject, which also has direct links to all relevant links. Satoshi logically decided to leave/disappear after everything, because when the majority attacks you and doesn't agree with your decisions, what else is left for you?QuoteSoftware version 0.3.19, Satoshi’s last, would arrive the next day on December 13.Read now like the final public message from Bitcoin’s creator, it seems tactical that he chose to wind down measures taken in the wake of the value overflow exploit, a sign he might have felt his mission to lock down compromises to the code had been realized.Still, it’s difficult to say if Satoshi’s decision to walk away was his alone. After all, over the year, there had been a dramatic change in tone toward his leadership.As to whether he intended to leave, however, Satoshi was definite, his sign-off observable when he removed his name from Bitcoin’s copyright statements[X]. Thereafter, he would also update Bitcoin.org, adding the names and emails of other developers – including Andresen, Sirius, Laszlo and Nils Schneider (tcatm) – to its contact page and removing his own[X].What little we know about the transition was represented by Andresen publicly when he claimed a week later to have received Satoshi’s “blessing” to start “more active project management.”[X]In the interim, Andresen assumed the trappings of authority, putting out a “help wanted” post and making clear to new volunteers they would now need to move the project forward.The Last Days of Satoshi: What Happened When Bitcoin’s Creator Disappeared",
