I am not expecting a lot from it and I'm ready to lose it if the market is stirred up. I am not sure if I'd say it's doing good or not but in my portfolio balance, I am currently at a loss with it. And as you've said in your other post, I am holding BNB and that's just it. Whatever comes and whatever happens on it, I'll just lightly going to accept it since that's what I think is the right reaction to what's happening on it lately. Maybe I'd get some chunk as well during the bull run.",

Let's discuss our experiences and perspectives on how these tokens have been faring in this volatile market.Exchange tokens are not investment tokens, but assets that the platform prints and burns from time to time to provide liquidity, and some buy them to reduce trading fees within CEXs, as it cannot be traded on a large scale or a large number of platforms, in addition to its price being linked to the platform, which makes it centralized. It can be invested when there is an event that will cause an increase in its price, such as an expansion of the platform’s activity, an increase in the number of users, or any reason that makes you believe that its price will increase. Here, you buy it for a short time that does not exceed a month, and you sell it after that.",

Do you have any exchange tokens in your holdings, and what are your thoughts on their market performance this year? Let's discuss our experiences and perspectives on how these tokens have been faring in this volatile market.Yes, I have exchange tokens in my holdings, most notably the Binance platform currency. Unfortunately, I had invested BNB in order to participate in the SUI Launchpad, and after that the FUD event caused by the SEC, which led to a sharp drop in the price of BNB from the peak of $333, which led to my loss reaching more than -25%, frankly, I did not prefer exchange tokens because any exchange may be exposed to bankruptcy, regulatory pressure, or hacking, which will negatively affect the exchange token that the investor invests in, but there are things that make a person want to profit and reap returns and turn a blind eye to potential risks like participating in Launchpad and Launchpool and others, I have not lost certainty yet because the BNB token is one of the top tokens in the market, although it was classified as a security by the SEC, but it is highly likely that it will win like XRP and return better than it was and achieve a new ATH, and regardless of the SEC battle, the tokens of the exchanges currently did not gain the appropriate acquisition and it is certain that they will explode one day if the exchange team is as strong as Binance and knows what it is doing.",

However like other altcoins right now, the price is still dropped and it seems like they still need more times to go back stronger again and rise up as expected. But fortunately, I am sure enough that those exchange tokens have high potential and are worth it to wait and invest. Because they are some of the reputable exchanges both globally and also locally in my country. The most favorite exchange coin I have is the BNB which I am sure is a worth to invest. But if this is about CEX tokens, I think that I don't have any of them. This is not about how much we have the exchange tokens or coins, but what kind of coins or tokens we are investing.. because not all exchange coins or tokens will have similar worth to wait.",
