Let's see how they apply these \"advanced\" machines to teach humans.",

Users of the academy will most likely find it more easier to get things done with the help of the AI than it would naturally be. Â The one thing I like about cz and binance is how they quickly react to change and always ready to incorporate new features into the business.",

If it's an API that's being integrated to Binance academy then it will make things easier as it automates the questioning and answering.",

I guess that's why they're saying that now their platform can educate the users efficiently because they added an AI bot that will do the job itself.I don't think that addition of that AI will ever increase the development of the platform, and there is no chance that such bots can ever be proven to increase the price of BNB. It will just help those users who lack knowledge about Crypto and Web3 in general. That bot can definitely help those users who have very limited knowledge in those area other than that I don't find any good use case of the bot on their platform.",

It is a wise decision on the part of Binnace to start incorporating AI into their core business value at this early stage because it is going to help them to master AI and plan along with it, I won't be surprised to see them buy a solid AI company in future",
