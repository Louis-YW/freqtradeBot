      "body": "For me, it's a bit similar with Team Secret on top and then Tundra coming in second since I think they wouldn't have much issue dealing with Team Aster if they get knocked down by Team Secret. Then Aster in third since they already faced Team Liquid before in the upper bracket and earlier Team Liquid barely held on against Thunder Awaken. I wouldn't make a parlay with these but it's better to have them in singles if you want to take advantage of the promotions that some bookies have like these ones from Stake and 500casino. 1st 🥇: Team Secret2nd 🥈: Tundra Esports 3rd 🥉: Team Aster 4th 🏅: Team Liquid",

      "body": "Tundra will probably be playing the role of Team Spirit in the last TI games. They're the dark horse in this tournament. If I am to choose only 1 team, I will choose Tundra. In the group stage, they were able to take down Team Secret 2-0. It's very possible they can repeat it now in the upper bracket finals. Team Liquid, the familiar team dominating in the lower bracket just like when they reached the finals against OG in 2019, will probably defeat Aster and then Secret and reach the finals once more. But just like what happened in 2019, they will only end up in the 2nd place. This is just my personal take.",

      "body": "1st 🥇: Team Liquid2nd 🥈: Secret3rd 🥉: Tundra4th 🏅: AsterIt is just pure resilience from Team Liquid that will catapult them to the finals and eventually the Aegis. I like the Cinderella story of Team Liquid. Qualifying late to TI because they have to go through Regional and then Last Chance qualifier. Now they are top 4 of the tournament. We have seen how resilient they are and how they wanted to win this TI. Even when they are down in net worth and the Ancient is exposed, time and time again, they find a way to defend their Ancient, make a comeback and win the game. That kind of resilience is what makes a champion. It is maybe their experience, their leadership, or just their keen desire to give Matu an epic retirement, but it is totally working for them.",
