  "content": "with this thread, i would like to open a general discussion and a certain reference place dedicated to the topic of Bitcoin dust. in some cases, the Bitcoin protocol generates small satoshis value when users send and receive some Bitcoin transactions. some of these amounts have such a low value that issuing them requires more fees than they are worth.however, the blockchain has limited space. therefore, transactions of small value take up as much space as large transactions. therefore, many small sats amounts can cause performance problems throughout the system.originally Bitcoin dust (an amount of 546 satoshis) was not necessarily a problem for crypto users. however, that changed when fees increased and transactions with smaller values became more expensive. as a result, some developers are urging Bitcoin users to get rid of 'dust' as soon as the costs drop.some reference links:https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/what-bitcoin-dust/https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2unzen/what_is_bitcoins_dust_limit_precisely/https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-a-crypto-dusting-attack-and-how-do-you-avoid-itwith the following 4 slides, exactly this 'dust' topic is visually explained and should hopefully help you to understand the whole thing a bit better",

      "body": "With the dust attacks it's kind of, at least for me, an interesting loop. I have a few addresses that I put into 'cold' storage back in 2018. They now have a lot of 0.000005xx dustings in them.Dozens of addresses with a lot of dust. So, even if BTC doubles they are worth $0.30 each. Is it worth the time and effort and TX fees and everything else to pull the addresses out of cold storage and generate new addresses and move the coins? For me no, they will just stay there. Obviously YMMV. But, if I do need to move some of that old BTC do I move the dust too or just leave it there. At this point if I am moving the coins it's going to be in bulk to an exchange to sell since I am in NY it's probably all going to be KYCd 100% anyway and taxed accordingly anyway unless I go for a F2F thing. But if I am moving these coins something has gone to shit anyway so I probably will not be able to or even want to hide the funds. So does it matter?Which does bring up the point, does it even matter for most people? Are there more like me or less like me?-Dave",

We will be back to low transaction fees very soon. On the other hand, when you have a wallet that have coin control feature, you can easily exclude the dust inputs.I don't see dust bitcoin can create any problem for someone who have at least coin control knowledge. One does not need to be a bitcoin geek for that.",

So instead we use the size of a standard input, and the size of the specific output.So for a taproot P2TR transaction, then an input is assumed to be 67 bytes and an output is 43 bytes, giving (67+43)*3 = 330 sats.*This should actually be 297 sats in reality, but a rounding error means that 67.75 is rounded down to 67 instead of up to 68.",
