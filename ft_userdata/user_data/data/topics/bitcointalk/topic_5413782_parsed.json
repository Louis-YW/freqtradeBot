So your choice is only to buy Bitcoin via DEX and using mixer to increase your privacy.",

On the other hand, if whatever country's government decided to adopt bitcoin or maybe just stay lax about it, then expect more and more platforms to support buying and selling of bitcoin.",

You should have been a little more specific about the future, because if you think about the next 5-10 years, I don't believe that buying Bitcoin will be a problem in the sense that you won't be able to do it through various CEX, DEX, crypto ATMs, physical exchanges... On the other hand, the availability of Bitcoin on all these platforms (liquidity) is obviously much higher than the demand, and only a little less than 2 million BTC that have yet to be mined tell us that we will not soon have a situation where someone wants to buy Bitcoin, and that someone say \"sorry, we don't have it in stock\".In the end, it all comes down to whether you have enough money, because there will always be someone ready to sell.",

And if it's an app, all you have to do is deposit funds into the app and you can start buying bitcoins.Now many applications are integrated into mobile phones, so we will have no trouble depositing buying bitcoin. This proves local apps also care about crypto developments and want to be a part of bitcoin history. And hopefully, the government will also support this so that many parties can accept bitcoin.",

Yup some more facilities might be added, but the OGs will always stay.At first I thought you were worried about the price, but you just curious about the method through which you gonna buy. Nevertheless don’t think too much about the future. Enjoy the present.",

I think he is inquiring if the government will make crypto hard to access by the public because right now everyone can purchased it using there mobile phone alone since there’s a lot of app offering it.I don’t see any problem in the future because some country government are making law in favor for crypto being legal. They need this is imposed proper tax on it so that there citizen will legally pay there tax when they use crypto. Making crypto inaccessible to the public will very hard for government to do because it’s available on the internet.",

The people who are no longer hodling and decide to sell will sell at very high rates and that can be discouraging, making bitcoins much harder to buy by individuals who are not financially capable enough. So I actually think that bitcoins will be much harder to buy later down the road. Maybe via distribution like government agencies and private companies opting to start paying their staff in bitcoins, some people will be able to get some bitcoins, but if it is just the option to must buy from someone, it can be discouraging.",

If there will be bitcoin global adoption in the future, then even if the price gets higher, there will always be legit exchanges that will support it and make it easier for us to purchase every now and then. However, when the opposite thing happens, like when the government starts to be strict on bitcoin and there will be banning in most of the countries, probably it will also be hard on our part to look for legit exchanges that will continue to support bitcoin.",

And in the future, it's still easy. However, what might makes it difficult is when Bitcoin price is much higher than what you see today. Just like how these people who always doubt and hesitated on purchasing Bitcoins as they always think it is too expensive for the current price. Literally it is actually easy, but mentally it is challenging on how you feed your risk appetite.",
