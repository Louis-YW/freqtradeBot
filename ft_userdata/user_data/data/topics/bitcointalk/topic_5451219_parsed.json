I really don't have a contact that deals in those areas but I would recommend you to buy good Asic miners like Bitmain Antminer S19j Pro as they are good for future-proofing your mining operations. It depends on the budget then you should go with this miner and purchasing three of them will allow you to have around 300 Th/s and that's a lot of processing power.",

You can follow his advice. As for others, I do not know.My suggestion is that you can also look for sellers on Chinese online sites or offline resellers. I have seen ASICs on AliExpress before and I know that there are many legit online sites in China that you will know which you can use to order for the amount of miners that you want. If you want to buy in bulk, it is better to contact the manufacturer directly. Like Bitmain. Most ASICs manufacturers are located in China which should make it easy for you to get in touch with any of them.I will advice you to avoid scammers that will start to send you PM that they can help you.",

I have seen ASICs on AliExpress before and I know that there are many legit online sites in China that you will know which you can use to order for the amount of miners that you want. This is bad advice, buying Asics from the likes of Aliexpress is very risky, besides, the majority of brand new gears are now in HK not in China, none of those resellers on Aliexpress/Alibaba own a single brand new gear in China, they are either scammers or just brokers who will ship you the gear from HK via another distrutor, so at best, you will be overcharged, at worst, you will be scammed.QuoteIf you want to buy in bulk, it is better to contact the manufacturer directly. Like Bitmain. Most ASICs manufacturers are located in China which should make it easy for you to get in touch with any of them.Bulk for Bitmain and MicroBT is either 4 or 5 digits, anything short of that is not considered bulk and you will have to pay the same prices listed on their website.QuoteI will advice you to avoid scammers that will start to send you PM that they can help you. Indeed, unsolicited messages that promote some selling are likely to be scam attempts.Quote from: philipma1957 on May 04, 2023, 01:47:28 PMforum member mikeywith is good.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2033515Thanks Phil, always great doing business with you.",

It is a comprehensive platform that provides information on various ASIC mining machines, including their specifications, prices, and availability.Not top be trusted. Seems suspicious. I would rather buy from reputable stores or membersOffordscott was also another good dealer, but he got banned from the forum.
