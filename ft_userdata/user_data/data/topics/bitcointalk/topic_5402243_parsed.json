      "body": "The most reliable way to parse the BDB files is simply to copy the DB read/write code of Bitcoin Core and make a CLI frontend that will let you query any data. That's because drivers like db_dump(1) and others are not guarranteed to work, as within the BDB file format, the program can write it in however manner it likes (i.e. it's technically a BDB format but it's unreadable to other applications).",
