      "body": "There is no liquidity.That's mean no exchange at-all for selling these tokens, and how these estimations came out? did you get the estimation from explorer-estimation on the token list? Did you know most of the time these estimations have:- Scam token tried to impersonate the real token, and they update the information coin-information to their scam-contract- The price coin information not update anymore due there is no trade anymore and listed with the last price of these token sold.",

The unit price you asked is no longer valid, you must refer to the active bid price. Fantastic prices can be generated from the manipulation efforts of their own developers, and such tokens are actually common in DEXs.",

I personally hold $2 millions worth of shitcoins and can't sell it anymore. I accumulated them during 2017 ICO hype and lost every bit of it. Since I have experienced this personally, I do not advise anyone to buy shitcoins or memecoins anymore. All the best with attempt to sell it. This coin has no liquidity it seems. So I am sure that you wouldn't be able to sell them. But good luck to you.",

Heck, good luck selling it for $200.It’s not really worth $32b in the first place. I can literally create a shitcoin with a supply of $1,000,000, sell it for $1, and buy it for $1 on a separate wallet address and it’d be “worth” $1m — but obviously it’s not because no one would be willing to buy it.",

Who in their right senses would pay $2m for a bunch of tokens that are worth nothing since you can't sell them for having no liquidity? Whenever you've bought them, you did a mistake and wasted your money by investing in a project that was nothing more than a scam that must have run away already and these tokens are now totally worthless, I'm sorry for your loss though.These things teach us that we should always make sure that we are investing our money in credible and trustworthy projects and not some kind of shitcoins or meme coins which might have some hype initially but that will disappear soon and then they will lose more than 90% of their value in no time.",
