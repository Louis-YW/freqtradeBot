      "body": "The release of version 4.4.6 seems to be an important update due to security enhancements.Yesterday I found update notifications for several applications including electrum on my cellphone and I have updated them to the latest version. Its size is only 30.35 MB.Update 4.4.5 was done on 20 June. The update to version 4.4.6 occurred on August 18th. It took only two months for security improvements to be made again.Quote from: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/blob/master/RELEASE-NOTESCode:# Release 4.4.6 (August 18, 2023) (security update) * Lightning:   - security fix: multiple lightning-related security issues have     been fixed. We will disclose these in detail on 2023-09-11.     These release notes will also be updated at that time.     In the meantime, please update.   - fix: cannot sweep from channel after local-force-close, if using     imported channel backup (#8536). Fixing this required adding a     new field (local_payment_pubkey) to the channel backup     import/export format and bumping its version number     (v0->v1). Both v0 and v1 can be imported, and we only export v1     backups. When you force close a channel, the GUI will prompt you     to save a backup. In that case, you must export the backup using     the updated Electrum, and not rely on a backup made with an older     release of Electrum.  Note that if you request a force close from     the remote node or co-op close, you do not need to save a channel     backup.   - fix: we would sometimes attempt sending MPP even if not supported     by the invoice (2cf6173c) * QML GUI:   - fix lnurl-pay when config.BTC_AMOUNTS_ADD_THOUSANDS_SEP is True     (5b4df759) * Hardware wallets:   - Trezor: support longer than 9 character PIN codes (#8526)   - Jade: support more custom-built DIY Jade devices (#8546) * Builds/binaries:   - include AppStream metainfo.xml in tarballs (#8501) * fix: exceptions in some callbacks got lost and not logged (3e6580b9)Elecreum is the best. Don't care about security.",

      "body": "I wonder what they discovered and fixed, and how it could have affected the security of coins on the Lightning Network? We will see in 3 weeks. It will be interesting to see if the Electrum devs found these themselves or if it was reported to them using responsible disclosure. The security fixes according to the release notes are only for lightning use. Everything else is of secondary importance for this update.",

Hackers and malicious people are not sleeping. Something important must be cared for.I always try my best to pay attention to security in every way and that includes trying to always be careful not to let anything go wrong.That's why I always follow and read discussion topics about wallets, security and other techniques that involve members with mastery of knowledge in the scientific fields around it. All that I do for my benefit in finding out what is useful for me.",

In his OP, he wrote that he updated his Electrum to the newest version already. If he didn't care about security, he wouldn't be bothered installing the update. The ironic part could be the one where he wrote that the developers needed two months to fix the discovered vulnerabilities.Maybe he is also confusing the terms security and privacy.

But, we really don't know when they found out about the vulnerability so we really don't know how long they took to fix it. Will probably be an interesting discussion next month when we find out what the issue was.Show stopping easy to exploit and take all of someones BTC issue? Or a if this happens and the user does that followed by the other thing and then this odd occurrence must occur while the user is drinking a cup of coffee then there is the possibility of it happening issue.-Dave",
