  "content": "Terra’s new blockchain will be launched on Saturday followed by an airdrop of new LUNA tokens to users as part of a broader plan to revive the ecosystem, developers confirmed Friday.A snapshot of the new blockchain, currently called \"Terra 2.0,\" took place earlier this week after the conclusion of a vote among network validators with a 65% approval rate.Terra’s UST tokens saw a bank run earlier this month that caused prices of the tokens to fall to as low as 7 cents. This caused a loss of trust in the Terra ecosystem among investors, with prices of LUNA tokens falling nearly 100% and Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) applications losing upward of $28 billion in locked value.(Source: CoinDesk)",

Now, I always appreciate a platform that will do tis best to recover after a significant and potentially fatal fall. I am then wishing all the people behind Terra and all of its numerous holders and supporters worldwide the best in its struggle for survival and maybe eventual Phoenix-type of rising from the ashes.",

If you have old luna the one with latest incident then you are eligible for this. Sometime its confusing when they use the term airdrop for it since its not actually free but a way to receive the new tokens for new token economics that introduced.",

Of course, there will be thoughts like risk Big comes with big risks, but it's practical when this space still has many other things worth paying attention to.It's hard to predict whether this new project of Do Kwon will be successful or not but as far as I know, Terra has a huge community that they called themselves as \"Lunatics\" and there will be some who will support the project whatever happens.Still, I feel sorry for those people who lost huge amounts of money by investing into Terra coin. What happened to the project is a proof that it might happen again with their new project or blockchain whatever. I will not touch this project still whether they created a new blockchain. There are many projects who are a better investment than this project and it's less risky than Terra.The damage has been done and Do Kwon's reputation has been damaged and it will affect the whole project IMO. Invest at your own risk in this new Terra because with what happened, it's hard to trust Do Kwon knowing that it might happen again with their new project.",

Maybe I will not buy anything for now because for sure this will be pump and dump scheme in the first place. I hope there will be no people get FOMO for this and they need to be more careful upon the hype brought by new Luna coin.",

Even when majority of exchange sites are still holding their platform to make the deposit become available and the price was plunged so hard. it can be said that when the deposit will be fully opened and there will be a massive sell happens with it. Im sure that if the price of new luna will be dumped so hard to the bottom. Im just wanna try to buy this coin when this will be reached 50 cents or even less.

I still see a large amount of news in groups about people still buying Luna 2.0 but personally I don't want to take any more risks. Honestly, my current investment is not giving as good returns as it used to be, and I also need to make a plan to hoard safer things.",
