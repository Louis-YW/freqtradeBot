  "content": "12 Years ago on this date (22 May 2010) ...   Laszlo Hanyecz bought 2 pizzas via this forum for 10 000 bitcoins ==> https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=137.0 and it was worth almost $41 back then. Those same bitcoins are now worth almost $300 000 000.   He continued doing that for almost 3 months and then he declared that he cannot mine enough coins to sustain this. This made him a legend in the Bitcoin community, because he showed people that Bitcoin had worth and you can use it as a \"Currency\" / \"Commodity\" to trade or to pay for goods and services. So, we Thank you Laszlo Hanyecz for your sacrifice and your gesture that changed the way people looked at Bitcoin in the future. Bitcoin might never have achieved it's success, if it was not for you.  Happy Bitcoin Pizza Day to all of you, my Bitcoin friends.",

Lazlo is the reason why I never would buy food with crypto currencies. You can consume food only one time and there is no value left after that. If you at least buy a physical asset you have something left. And even if bitcoins rally after your purchase you have something tangible that doesn't make it seem so bad.

The end result will be that you will be trading bitcoins and nobody will be able to spend it. People has to spend their bitcoins for retailers and merchants to accept it as a payment option.... and that is where Laszlo opened people's eyes to the real purpose/goal of Bitcoin.The more merchants and retailers accepting Bitcoin as a payment option, the higher the demand for the coins and the higher the demand... the higher the price.",

It is just right that he is given the honor for doing something which started it all. To commemorate his famous Bitcoin pizza purchase every year is the least that the Bitcoin community could give to the man and his action. He will forever be remembered and honored. His purchase will forever be etched on the history of Bitcoin. But one thing I don't think he did was sacrifice. He did the buying with complete freedom and fun. He wasn't sacrificing anything.

He is already an unforgettable figure in the Bitcoin circle because every year we have the official Bitcoin Pizza Day...hope that by next year this same kind of feverish interest can be pick by the whole pizza industry so they can come up with promotional activities for the said day.",

Would like to track those coins too probably buy some of those coins just for it to be in my wallet to one day buy pizza. It would be cool to buy pizzas with some of those coins again for probably 0.002BTC and then add the blockchain analysis. People in the next generation will probably look up to you spending 0.002BTC for 2 pizza also while by that time 0.002 will be worth a lot.",

It should be noted that this was a completely different time when anyone could mine BTC with their computer and when very few people believed that Bitcoin could succeed. 50 BTC per block was a very generous reward, and I guess it wasn't extremely difficult to mine 10 000 BTC.This is without a doubt a historical event, but even if it had not happened then and in such a way, I guess Bitcoin would not have ceased to exist. Someone could also buy a few beers or burgers, and then we would celebrate Beer Day or Hamburger Day today.",
