Addiction may not be noticeable to someone who's still in the process, it tends to be realized after everything is gone and ruined. Those tales were not gonna be uttered and shared when everything is still fun. So, we're gonna be seeing more of it as there are many people who has compulsive gambling activities. They'll soon realize what type of hell they're getting into.",

It started with high odds, latter thinking to use high amount of money with low odds to make money, and later was the online odd low matches. I thought something like a means of earning something weekly or monthly is possible. Because of low odds, I won most of the time, but because of high amount used, I noticed that I lost than won in just two or three matches lost after like 10 wins. What causes me to lose high amount of money to gambling was that I thought gambling can be a means of earning income but which I later found I was wrong.",

They actually Dont think are doing something stupid by going all in with their habits until the damage is actually enquired and thats when you actually know that your gambling habit are getting out of hand. For me, i think the losses are part of the process so no need to say too much about it although its really hurts sometimes especially when you think you can take the risk and decide to go all in with your stake.",

Gamblers think there will be time that they will win and get back everything. This false reality can be really damaging in my opinion. Some gamblers don't realize they are losing their life savings anytime they keep playing and losing. Reality hits hard only when you are broke, too broke to even keep on gambling.",

Being in denial about your own addiction? Trying to escape and hide from your problems(but they hit you eventually)?Most gambling addicts are desperately trying to hide their addiction. When they hit rock bottom, they come up with the realization that opening up and talking about your problem is the only way to solve it. Another thing is that their sad stories might help in preventing other gamblers from sinking too deep into addiction. It's something like \"I've been damaged by this shit, don't go this way.\". It's a cry for help, but it's also a warning.",

If they only have a little pain they don't want to go and will wait until things get better by themselves or worse. It's hard to realise that we have a problem and need help. Also these are stories of a few unlucky gamblers, there are millions of gamblers out there who don't share their stories online. Most of the gamblers I know only play from time to time and don't spend every day at casino. It's a recreational hobby that they only spend a little money on it and would never go so far to bet all their life savings.",

Gamblers are expecting to win, they think gambling is fun and at the same time they also make money. Some gamblers do gamble for fun but eventually, they lose control that's why they were able to spend more than they can afford to lose. I think it's just normal that people make mistakes, what's not normal is when we already know the outcome of the said mistakes, and yet we are still doing it.",

I've never been so trapped in gambling addiction but have experienced it before I forcefully pulled back. This was possible for me because I have a strong mind, but some people have a weak mind that can't be easily checked unless they found help before they cross the red line. I will not blame anyone, nature does not give us the same mental strength, which is why you see some people ending their lives due to a little issue. Also, my addiction to trading for over a decade made me realise what such people are facing, they can't control their minds again, and they might not be able until they are completely ruined.That's why it's good to tell reasonable people how you feel, and they might be able to help you out or find professional help for you before it's too late.",

But that's not really the problem. The problem is that we allow ourselves to gamble with money that is not meant for gambling. If you allocate a few percent of your budget to gambling and don't go over that limit, you're unlikely to have a gambling problem, no matter how many times you lose.",
