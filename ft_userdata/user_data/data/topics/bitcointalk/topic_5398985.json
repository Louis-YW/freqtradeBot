Neutral tag is correct regarding this case for your self note or warning for the other manager to accept them in the future campaign, but I doubt manager will selective enough to accept the bounty hunters.",

However, I don't know what the purpose of creating fake bounty campaigns is other than trolling the forum.If he would have wanted to attack attention he would have used far more recognized names from DT1 or the top merit sources/receivers of the forum, no offense to the two involved but I doubt the impact created by that composite name. To me it's clearly somebody who wants to take revenge, seeing how both members have tagged quite a lot of bounty cheaters, the method of revenge is some fake bounty topics, for me is quite clear one of the tagged ones did it, and since one matches an older campaign here, I would raise my bet one level and say the cheater or one of his alts was banned from the previous Sovryn campaign.Anyhow, seeing the warning the pulitoken team has posted, I've tagged him, if not outright scamming he is still impersonating people.",

I wouldn't even go so far as to give them a neutral just for putting in an application--that's taking things a bit too far IMO.  If a member gets accepted and actually starts advertising for a scam project, that's a more reasonable debate.I read the first 4 or so posts in this thread, and I'm still confused as to precisely what's going on here.  I'm not familiar with who Pandu Geddon and rozak are.  Are they bounty managers?  I'm really confused about the member who combined those names, as it seems bizarre to do so.  Guess I'll keep reading the rest of the thread for entertainment.",

We can determine the project is scam doesn't because of the plagiarized whitepaper, ponzi, pyramid scheme etc (anything that lead a red flags). But most bounties now often reduced their own bounty distribution, pay lower than their promise, the coin doesn't get listed on exchange, crash and become worthless etc that I feel mostly bounties is a scam without going to debate IMO. QuoteI'm not familiar with who Pandu Geddon and rozak are.  Are they bounty managers?  Below is their accounts if you wanted to look:Pandu Geddon https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3416506rozak https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1016105They're actively exposing cheaters in the bounty sections, perhaps those cheaters that they have tagged are going mad and want to revenge them by creating an alt account with Pandu Geddon and rozak username. But as I said it's really pointless, it wouldn't hurt their reputation.",

Awaklara rarely posts in every discussion while Rozak and Pandu Geddon do the opposite.You are right, they can exchange merit with each other but that should not be interpreted as a connection between accounts managed by the same person [alt account]. You still need solid evidence to accuse them and so far you haven't risked anything.I think you have a problem with the three of them, is your main account really damaged because it was caught cheating? If my guess is correct, then you should really apologize for that from your main account because maybe I will also mark you as [honest man]",
