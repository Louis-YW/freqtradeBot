  "content": "I really want Bitcoin to reach $100,000 soon. So, I wrote a letter to Bitcoin, asking it to be good and go up in value.Dear Bitcoin,I am just a newborn in baby in your arms and its not that I haven't heard about you or I was waiting for a conviction. I would love to name my son Toshi in honour of your creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. I want you to embrace me in your arms and be cool to me. Hopefully, you are doing well as I write this letter.\" I wished to take a moment to share my sentiments and opinions with you. You have succeeded in attracting interest and curiosity from people worldwide during the previous few years. You have had an indisputable influence on the banking and technology industries throughout your extraordinary journey.To be honest, I've been keeping a careful eye on your development. Your ability to completely transform the financial environment and the manner your worth has increased are really remarkable. Because we believe in the potential you bring, many of us have committed our hopes and resources to your success.It’s been a tough couple of years for bitcoin traders. And I’m not trying to blame you. I understand that you are volatile and prone to violent swings up and down. But, the thing is, the cost of everything is going up. Well- not everything…you see, your price isn’t going up much. A couple of years ago, you were over $65,000, and now, you’re hovering around $26,000. I can't help but dream about the day you'll hit the much-coveted $100,000 milestone as we look to the future. Many of us are looking forward to this objective, which is a reflection of our faith in you. It's amazing how you're able to overcome obstacles and seize fresh chances, and I can't wait to follow your adventure.As I am aware that you are unable to read this letter, I still wanted to take a time to let you know what's on my mind. I hope that the upcoming year will bring about good things for you, that you'll keep moving forward and get closer to that remarkable number.Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey in my life. Cheers to your success and the exciting possibilities you bring to the world.You may think my problems are insignificant. After all, you are battling a legacy financial system that represses billions of people. You provide an alternative to the endless money printing and debt-ridden governments and institutions. And you have to deal with charlatans trying to champion you for their gains.",

You as an adopter can even give them unlimited value, which bitcoin is a solution to the shortcomings that have existed in conventional payment systems.Speculators limit the value of bitcoins to the price, and for them it is influenced by external fundamental factors. If speculators can also act as adopters, I think the value of bitcoin will be much better than it is now.",

I'm just not used to these types of things.Instead of making a letter towards a cryptocurrency, why not make a letter to people who trade it and make sell it? Because if there are people who sell it, it's going to be hard to reach a higher price with that. It's going to be hectic because of the sell-offs?",

Just kidding, good things take time so buckle up kid for the next bull run in which you will see me touching $100k. I hope Faisal2202 will convey my message to you.Hehehe. I hope you get my point dear here (not its faisal speaking).",

Man decided to call himself Hewlet and address Bitcoin directly in his first ever post on the forum like Bitcoin is his grandparent or what.And your target for $100k, is it for a month, six months or a year? I see you are here for quick bucks and praying bad to get Bitcoin pump with your letter.how about you try to learn HODL and enjoy the ride with everyone else? Think about it.",

Because you want it to reach $100k soon, how does that sound to you?  because it's kind of wired that you didn't use the time to do a more meaningful thing that could yield a result, and by the way, after drafting your letter, who did you submit it to? Well, just informed you that with your letter or no letter, Bitcoin is going to get to $100k some day, and no one for sure can tell the exact time when it's going to happen.But I hope Bitcoin replies to your letter so you can also give us feedback.",
