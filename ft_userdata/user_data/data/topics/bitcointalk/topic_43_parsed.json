  "content": "We had our first automatic adjustment of the proof-of-work difficulty on 30 Dec 2009.  The minimum difficulty is 32 zero bits, so even if only one person was running a node, the difficulty doesn't get any easier than that.  For most of last year, we were hovering below the minimum.  On 30 Dec we broke above it and the algorithm adjusted to more difficulty.  It's been getting more difficult at each adjustment since then.The adjustment on 04 Feb took it up from 1.34 times last year's difficulty to 1.82 times more difficult than last year.  That means you generate only 55% as many coins for the same amount of work.The difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort across the network.  If the number of nodes doubles, the difficulty will also double, returning the total generated to the target rate.For those technically inclined, the proof-of-work difficulty can be seen by searching on \"target:\" in debug.log.  It's a 256-bit unsigned hex number, which the SHA-256 value has to be less than to successfully generate a block.  It gets adjusted every 2016 blocks, typically two weeks.  That's when it prints \"GetNextWorkRequired RETARGET\" in debug.log. minimum    00000000ffff000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000030/12/2009 00000000d86a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011/01/2010 00000000c428000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025/01/2010 00000000be71000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004/02/2010 000000008cc3000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014/02/2010 000000006546570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/02/2010 0000000043b3e50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008/03/2010 00000000387f6f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021/03/2010 000000003813750000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001/04/2010 000000002a11150000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012/04/2010 0000000020bca70000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021/04/2010 0000000016546f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004/05/2010 0000000013ec530000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000019/05/2010 00000000159c240000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029/05/2010 000000000f675c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011/06/2010 000000000eba640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/06/2010 000000000d31420000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006/07/2010 000000000ae4930000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000013/07/2010 0000000005a3f40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016/07/2010 000000000168fd0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000027/07/2010 00000000010c5a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005/08/2010 0000000000ba180000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015/08/2010 0000000000800e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000026/08/2010 0000000000692000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000date, difficulty factor, % change2009           1.0030/12/2009     1.18   +18%11/01/2010     1.31   +11%25/01/2010     1.34    +2%04/02/2010     1.82   +36%14/02/2010     2.53   +39%24/02/2010     3.78   +49%08/03/2010     4.53   +20%21/03/2010     4.57    +9%01/04/2010     6.09   +33%12/04/2010     7.82   +28%21/04/2010    11.46   +47%04/05/2010    12.85   +12%19/05/2010    11.85    -8%29/05/2010    16.62   +40%11/06/2010    17.38    +5%24/06/2010    19.41   +12%06/07/2010    23.50   +21%13/07/2010    45.38   +93%16/07/2010   181.54  +300%27/07/2010   244.21   +35%05/08/2010   352.17   +44%15/08/2010   511.77   +45%26/08/2010   623.39   +22%",

So say, instead of making ฿50 every 20 hours, make ฿5 every 2 hours? I thought about that but there wasn't a practical way to do smaller increments.  The frequency of block generation is balanced between confirming transactions as fast as possible and the latency of the network.The algorithm aims for an average of 6 blocks per hour.  If it was 5 bc and 60 per hour, there would be 10 times as many blocks and the initial block download would take 10 times as long.  It wouldn't work anyway because that would be only 1 minute average between blocks, too close to the broadcast latency when the network gets larger.",

If it carries on, maybe a little meter indicating the % left until your block completes can be a nice addition so people would have some hope (actually, it will be a nice addition anyway whether the computations get carried on after disconnection or not!)Quote from: theymos on February 16, 2010, 06:01:51 AMI generated 5 blocks today on my Pentium processor. Two of them were within 3 minutes of each other.Ok, I just realized that I didn't understand how Bitcoin worked to begin with. The blocks get generated anyway whether you're generating coins or not. The average amount of creation conformed what I observed before (120/20 hrs, or 6/hr). This has got absolutely nothing to do with your CPU power, it's  constant for all practical purposes. The CPU power determines the \"transactions\" that get created and \"matures in xx blocks\". My head just got a bit bigger now This also means theymos that there was probably a coincidence or error for your 3-minute interval observation!",

Is there a way to optimize connections so that broadcasting is done via a pyramid-form to minimize the needed time? For example, the block creator sends it to 10 nodes, then those 10 send it to a 100 provided that none of those 100 were among the original 11, then those 100 tell a 1000 provided that none of those 1000 were among the original 111, etc to save time.",
