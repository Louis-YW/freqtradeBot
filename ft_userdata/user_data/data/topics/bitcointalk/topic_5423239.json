OP i will advise you read better on what bitcoin is and how it works with the blockchain technology, this will as well help your crypto experience at large because you will need it.",

      "body": "You can get crypto without blockchains but they're much less secure. There are solutions that don't need blockchains and update a chainstate instead based on \"masternodes\" or similarly centralised spaces. There might be something that comes out that can beat blockchains though (either in security or storage efficiency) although I don't think it's appeared yet so blockchains are the best we have.",

Technically any currency based on cryptography and blockchain technology is a cryptocurrency. But some of them are not currencies at all like ethereum which is a platform for smart contracts (with ether as the fuel for smart contracts).They can be decentralized like bitcoin or centralized like ethereum, ripple, etc.QuoteWhile Block chains are decentralised, public digital ledgers used to store crypto currencies and record transactions. Blockchain is simply a chain of blocks that doesn't have to be public or even decentralizied.QuoteBlockchain is the technology that enables the existence of crypto currency. There is no crypto without Blockchain.Correct about most projects but not all. For example there are altcoins that use DAG which is a graph (no linear relation like chain).",

Cryptocurrency is identic as exchange, we can't live if we haven't a cryptocurrency on there. so blockchain is a technology for use by people who own private keys, if he put the crypto on exchange is not called blockchain but cryptocurrency.",
