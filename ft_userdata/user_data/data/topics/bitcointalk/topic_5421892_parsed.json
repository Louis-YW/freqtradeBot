  "content": "This is the medium article I wrote: https://medium.com/p/aef58aa60b45I want to start by saying if you are a retail investor. It would be best if you immediately exited any centralized exchange and learn about self-custody.Pulsebitcoin Whitepaper: https://pulsebitcoin.com/white-paperImagine mining 50 BTC from your desktop computer every day. Early Bitcoin miners, like Richard Heart, were rewarded that.These days the difficulty of mining Bitcoin has increased to the point where the profitability of mining bitcoin is so low that many miners are shutting off their machines.“Being an early bird gets the worm, which has been the foundation of maximizing profit from any investment.” -PepeThe opportunity for proof of stake mining came with the launch of PulseBitcoin. The audited project has allowed holders of the ASIC (Application Specific Internet Coin) token to stake those coins and yield PulseBitcoin.Learn how to mine PulseBitcoin here: https://pulsebitcoin.com/how-to-mine-pulsebitcoinThe PulseBitcoin No Shenanigans PolicyFair launch (absolutely no special supply allocation). Supply begins at zero and only becomes available 30 days after launch if participants start mining on day 1.100% Transparent — Open Source Smart Contract(s)Code Security Audit — CertikKnown supply parameters (Maximum Supply: 21M Coins)No Unfair Distribution (ALL PulseBitcoin must be mined fairly defined by the Smart Contract)No \"Sacrifice Phase\" or ICONo Private or External Funding Received, NONE!No Admin Keys, No Admin Functions, No Admin anythingNo Inflation Outside of Defined Mining Rate ParametersNo Purchase TaxNo, Sell TaxNo Reflection FeesNo Referral ProgramNo Hidden PenaltiesNo Paid Promotors or Marketing, NONE!Bitcoin is outdatedBitcoin suffers from critical problems that prevent its continued adoption. To name a few: it's slow, expensive to use, requires special equipment to mine it effectively, it's not environmentally sustainable, it has had numerous inflation vulnerabilities, it is NOT compatible with existing DeFi without the use of intermediaries, it does not scale as well as the Ethereum network(s), and the list goes on and on…The world deserves a better Bitcoin, and the solution has finally been created: PulseBitcoin.PulseBitcoin offers Cheaper Transactions, Faster Transactions, Inclusive Mining, a Scarce Supply, Native Compatibility with existing DeFi, more Security, high Scalability, and, most importantly, is Energy Efficient and Eco-friendly!To improve the world, we must amend the current \"Bitcoin\" and improve it in every way that MATTERS!PulseBitcoin is not a copy; it is a much-needed innovation!The end of centralized exchanges is near.With fear on the rise for custodial wallets at an all-time high after the collapse of FTX and the case for DeFi has never been stronger. Crypto users are learning the importance of self custody which will drive them to enter into decentralized projects, such as HEX.com and PulseBitcoin.com.These projects create yield for the users with no counterparty risk. Retail and institutional investors have lost millions due to centralized entities such as; FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager.SummaryThe future of cryptocurrency lies within DeFi and environmentally friendly crypto projects. With the creation of safe, secure, and efficient PulseBitcoin. Miners can continue their yield by selling low-efficient miners, acquiring ASIC tokens and generating PulseBitcoin. This opportunity also increases fair yield for retail investors that can't afford to buy expensive machines, waste electricity at rising prices, and run loud miners in their homes.Written by: https://twitter.com/HostShawn via WNOTN.COM",

Somehow these shitcoins all have something in common. They are all so wonderful and great and the Bitcoin so bad. It's just funny that the Bitcoin reflects its value, whereas all the other shitcoins (mostly) disappear from the scene sooner or later.So cheers for PulseBitcoin and down with the Bitcoin. Popcorn is ready, Coke too, of course. Thanks for this amusing post, you have saved my exhausting working day",

Which also constantly creates sell pressure of it. Early adoption always gets the best value. Larger entities like Shell getting into mining with energy costs at a fraction compared to others. The sustainability of the smaller operations may not last. They still have an opportunity to sell the overhead now, while demand for their systems is still available and migrate to a simple laptop and earn yield with proof of stake. \"The innovator's dilemma.\"",

Obviously, OP just chose to be ignorant.It's quite clear that institutional and early adopter mining operations manipulate BTC and are only capable of being sustainable in mining. The Bitcoin brand is very well known, which is most likely why the founder used the name. As of yesterday, the first mined PLSB can be traded on Uniswap, 1Inch, and Matcha. There has been $4M Invested in ASIC token Miner NFTs as an adoption amplifier to acquire ASIC tokens at $1. This event ends in less than 2 hours. Currently, if all ASIC tokens were mining, the first Halving would occur in about 4-5 months.",
