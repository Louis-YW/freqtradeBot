A message was signed, and was confirmed to be valid as stated by some of the users above. However, Electrum cannot verify the message given by the OP above which is kind of weird. I tried verifying it on my end through Electrum but it just says that it couldn't verify the address. I don't know how that happened as I also tried signing a message through Electrum and verifying it through this site and it worked perfectly fine.I saw FiveStar4Ever's comment and tried the same approach and it worked in Electrum. How the OP obtained a signed message is something I'm not certain. Also, even if the owner of the address managed to contact OP, there's no guarantee that they will get the money back. I'm more interested on the back story of how OP got access to the seed phrase, really.",

In that case following the coins up the chain and signing a message from one of the earlier addresses will be more convincing.My take on what happened:Address bc1qn3d7vyks0k3fx38xkxazpep8830ttmydwekrnl received funds, which were immediately transferred again. That happens to every compromised private key, and many bots must be competing to be the first to steal funds. Usually, they use a high fee. In this case, my guess is that since more and more nodes accept full RBF, this lead to a very high transaction fee. Eventually, miners will get all stolen funds and the \"private key hunters\" will only be left with crummies. I hope the real owner can convince Antpool he's the real owner, so they don't send it to any of the private key hunters who also have the same private key.Quote from: voitelgluk on November 30, 2023, 08:14:27 PMI did some research, as a result of which I received the seed phrase of the wallet from which 139 BTC were stolen.

His signature was valid yet he doesn't seem able to understand bitcoin well after supposedly having hacked into a seed phrase. Hanlon's razor is a thing. Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity. We can't exclude the possibility OP is just a dumb idiot. He could have went for the claim directly. Now he'll probably get nothing and it will also mean that the poor guy who had his funds stolen also gets nothing as he can't get his address verified in a trustless manner given the proven compromise (at least by cryptographic means).",
