I rarely spend my Bitcoin on purchasing material things that doesn’t give me any extra benefits compared when I’m  using fiat as payment.It’s such a waste to spend Bitcoin on things that loss it’s value overtime because Bitcoin is an investment.",

      "body": "If I were to start counting what I have purchased with Bitcoin, I might start remembering that all my journey started with Bitcoin. My first purchase with Bitcoin was a P2P where I sent my friend BTC worth 10$ back then over a head set ear phone, which I was so much in need of. I have also made payment via BTC in a boutique where I went to grab some clothes, the option was not available, but when I purchased above what I budgeted, I asked the sales person if I could drop some BTC for a few other things that I wanted to grab. She said I should hold for her to call her boss. I gave him the offer and he accepted to not just accept payment for my other purchase but also pay for the entire purchase using BTC. It's good to see someone actually wanting to pay with Bitcoin in his shop.",

Although some persons have purchased good in some Bitcoin friendly nations from my country and the product was safely delivered, I have never paid for anything using Bitcoin. I have been hodling my Bitcoin investment and have no intention of selling or using them for transactions because they are my investment. I might consider using my Bitcoin for transactions if I go to a more friendly nation or my government lifts the restrictions.",

But I guess the main and important thing is to pay bitcoin with every purchase right? So it doesn't matter if they convert it to fiat automatically upon purchase as long as the transaction goes through. IIRC, most purchases that I make with bitcoin weren't that expensive, they usually go around converted in fiat from $10-$100 and those things that I shop online are only the necessary things. It's convenient since it's allowed by the shop that I usually go to online and I'll just have to wait within a few days and the package will arrive.  Yeah, the quantity may be a lot before the bull run but that's the purpose of bitcoin, it's for paying stuff so don't forget to treat yourself while holding a lot.",

I hope people will also spend more bitcoins in the future, since Bitcoin is a currency and not an asset.Although bitcoin is being seen as an investment instrument rather than a means of payment, if in the future it becomes more popular and accepted by businesses, its use as a means of payment will also become popular. People don't want to spend their bitcoin right now because everyone has the desire to get rich, so there's no blame on them. But when they make a profit or bitcoin reaches a stable price, people will also spend their bitcoin. Bitcoin will remain a currency in the future.",
