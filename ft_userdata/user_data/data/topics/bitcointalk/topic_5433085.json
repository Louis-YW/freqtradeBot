But surprisely I couldn't see the name again so I have to check Nigeria board to see if the thread has been moved to the local board but I didn't see it as well. There I checked a comment that made Igehhh to see if the user was removed from the forum but to my surprise the name has been changed to Igebotz. Igebotz congratulations to new name. theymos thank you for responding to request faster these days.Pakistan local board is also needed, their contributions to the forum and bitcoin is great.",

Everyone can request to theymos to change their usernames even me can request but the challenge as I say about it is that, will the admin granted your request?. What cryptoaddictchie said is true and during my time in Bitcointalk forum is I never heard or know that many people requested or ask to change their name. As I have posted before in other thread that I think only the name is changed and the username is the same. Correct me guys if I am wrong about it. Why I think that way is because when you go to settings is you can see username and name.",

Most are personal reasons, and I think its hard to discern or disclosed those of. We can say that theymos only granted those who have valid reason and explanation.

Don't worry, both are under my ownership.
