Still can't believe MEME token now can entering (Binance-Laucnhpad).Geezzz.   Well, in that matter, you need to believe that maybe MEME meets the requirements that the Binance exchange needs for them. We know that Binance's standards are high, but MEME passed, which means that meme coins will also be released in the crypto space.  It seems that there are upcoming airdrops if the task is easy. I might participate as long as I can do the task; there is no problem for me. And I also see that the percentage that Binance will get from those meme coins is also likely to be large. I will look forward to that.",

I completely agree with your perspective that it is likely to be legit project and I also participated in its airdrop campaign and completed all required tasks. Binance is also launching this project on their launchpad which is likely to be listed after twenty six days from now. Its listing price will be 0.01 dollar but it can potentially go from 5X to 10X after listing. Let's watch and wait how it plays out after listing. DYOR",

Certainly, Binance and other prominent exchanges like Kucoin and Bybit have certain criteria for listing coins, and not all meme coins meet those standards. However, it is important to note that exchanges are commercial organizations, and they are equally eager to generate profit from listing of coins those are in hype and baked by strong communities.As far as participating in any airdrop or coin's launch pad, it has been often observed that price of coins oftern fluctuate significantly which is an opportunity for experienced traders to use their technical skills to take advantage of such listing events.Newcomers in crypto currencies market should exercise caution, conduct through research  and evaluate their risk level before putting their funds in any project.",

Since its an exchange their business is fees and having a memecoin like that with a degen and defi community supported he dont wanna miss it. Plus its not a launchpad its a launchpool and its a free tokens just by staking your bnb without incurring any bnb deductions on your purse which users also like.  So whats wrong with that? I cant seem to find it a downside for bnb holders.",

I learned about this project quite early when they started the idea of ​​approaching blockchain, and I believe it is not like the usual memecoin in this space. Previously, the limited sale of NFTs and mints made me imagine that they could follow a similar development direction as APE, shaping the development of many different areas serving the ecosystem.Before that, there was some discussion about whether they would develop into a standalone L1, but that's just speculation. Maybe I quite like it because it has things that are not just for hype, let's be more precise than the previous field. Theirs has been in the works for a long time, and the memecoin trend in crypto has just appeared, but is fraught with risks.I do know about the airdrop information, and it's probably mostly for the owners of the NFTs. Another part that a lot of people are getting into is website farming, which is similar to some community engagement tasks but wouldn't fall into the category 25% airdrop, it will belong to the 33% ecosystem fund at TGE about 10%.And I think we will soon see another wave of fomo with this project, my guess is that it will most likely enter the top 50 soon, but I certainly won't fomo, simply waiting to see them distribute airdrops.",

IMO, farming will hardly be worthwhile because the number of participants is very large, or the dev will have criteria to eliminate bots.I think those who join early and own NFTs, or buy fire sale will receive big rewards, even the lauchpool on binance to me is just a form of marketing, it is not too attractive to me when the competition is very large. If you don't have a lot of BNB, it will be difficult to expect profits.Speculation is that I can expect MC to be similar to APE, GALA,... projects but it seems like GALA will be more similar.",

Usually, people start buying these coins/tokens when they see some well reputed exchanges announce of listing. People gather as much as coin they can and wait for the listing time. Once the coin get listed in the exchange, people quickly start selling it with the hope they will make profit from it. Most of the holders lose just because of this.",
