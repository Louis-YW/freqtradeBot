      "body": "If you did not even understand the subjects, how would you test the candidate that meets the requirements? You better hire a hiring manager to fulfil the needs of the position.Merely asking for a clue about what characteristics deserved to handle the job won't beneficially solve your needs. Another solution would be to hire an agency that has long-form professionalism and is reputable, but, if your goal is to make the developer join your company, then my main advice should be taken into account. You should know the depth and breadth of the developer.One thing that reminds me when hearing about smart contract developers is Lopp's advice. To cites it, \"When you're writing safety critical code, every arithmetic operation is potentially catastrophic. Smart contract developers should think less like web developers and more like aerospace engineers.\"",
