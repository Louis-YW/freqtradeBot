  "content": "Introducing Galvan - A Web3 Gamified Health and Wellness PlatformGalvan is a gamified Web3 health and wellness platform founded by healthcare and blockchain experts with the mission to ‚Äúgalvanize‚Äù humanity to invest in wellness.This mission is being accomplished through an ecosystem that rewards you for making healthy choices, informs you about ways to care for yourself and others, and empowers you to own and control your health data. By leveraging blockchain technology and a unique Proof of Action distribution algorithm, Galvan is turning selfcare into a reward-generating activity and reintroducing personal accountability.What is IZE?Put Galvan and IZE together and you get galvanize: to shock or excite someone into taking action. IZE is the native utility token of the Galvan Blockchain and incentivizes all the right actions in the ecosystem, from running a node to going on a run.IZE is used for:- Fees for processing transactions- Staking for new voting proposals- Rewarding active Node Owners- Rewarding healthy decisions in the Galvan Wellness App (coming soon)- Purchasing health and wellness products in the Galvan Marketplace (coming soon)IZE has a maximum supply of 50,000,000,000, half of which were distributed to Node Owners through the Galvan Blockchain in the first year. Each year thereafter, the amount of IZE issued is half of the previous year‚Äôs allocation. The official start date of year-one points accrual was Feb. 17th, 2022 at 00:00 UTC, serving as the date for annual halvings.Galvan's distribution model is similar to Bitcoin‚Äôs because new IZE is distributed solely to Node Owners through the Galvan Blockchain.You can get a deeper dive of IZE in Galvan‚Äôs Litepaper: https://www.galvan.health/litepaperWhat is the Galvan Blockchain?The Galvan Blockchain is a layer-2 of Ethereum focused specifically on empowering wellness. It is unique for three reasons:1. The ‚ÄúProof of Action‚Äù distribution algorithm that follows Swiss utility token standards2. Scalable blockchain-rewards system for healthy actions3. Easy participation through Node SoftwareThe long-term vision of the Galvan Blockchain is to become the foundation for health and wellness data and transactions. Imagine a world where you can store and manage a decentralized health record, earn rewards and subsidize healthcare costs through healthy actions, and participate in peer-to-peer research studies‚Äîall powered by the Galvan Blockchain.What is Proof-of-Action?Proof of Action is the algorithmic protocol that determines how IZE rewards are distributed among Node Owners through the Galvan Blockchain. The process is as follows:A user earns points based on actions voted upon by the Node Network DGF.The user's total points earned today are added to the Galvan Ledger.Every day at 00:00 UTC, a fixed amount of IZE is distributed based on the year of the current distribution schedule. The user's individual IZE allocation is calculated from the percentage of points they had that day compared to the total community points combined. In other words, the more points the user earned compared to everyone else, the bigger piece of that day's IZE distribution they would receive.The user's IZE distribution is confirmed by their node and sent to their wallet on the Galvan Blockchain.What are Galvan Nodes?At the foundation of the Galvan ecosystem are Galvan Nodes, which confirm transactions, earn daily IZE distribution, and provide governance for the blockchain. Community members can become Node Owners by purchasing node licenses. There are two types of licenses, which you can learn more about here: https://www.galvan.health/nodesOnce someone becomes a Node Owner, they also become a member of the Node Network DGF (Distributed Governance Framework), a blockchain coordination protocol made up of Galvan Node Owners. The Node Network DGF established the initial rules of the Galvan Blockchain prior to launch through a \"Charter\" vote, which was accepted by a majority of Node Owners on Nov. 27, 2022.What is the Galvan Wellness App?This is the first health and wellness application being built on the Galvan Blockchain. In the Galvan Wellness App, you can track your wellness holistically and earn rewards with your family and friends. Through multiple wearable and AI integrations, track actions related to your mind, body, and soul and earn IZE rewards from the blockchain when you make healthy decisions. Participate with family, friends, and the rest of the Galvan community in challenges, tournaments, and help each other when having a bad day.The public beta for the wellness app is set to release sometime in 2023. You can join the waitlist for the app here: https://www.galvan.health/app",

We have an Ethereum Bridge coming this month, awesome Web3 Wellness App public beta early this year, marketplace, wellness NFTs, and more! You can see our full roadmap on this page: https://www.galvan.health/about2. A Smart Node is generating around 3,000 IZE per day, and a Lite Node is generating around 12 IZE per day.Let me know if you have any more questions!",
