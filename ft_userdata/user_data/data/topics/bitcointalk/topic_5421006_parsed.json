  "content": "If you still trust your hardware wallet manufacturer for keeping your seed words, you should think again, especially if they are closed source devices.Bitbox released interesting blog article few days ago, and they are talking more about Nonce Covert Channel Attack.Most attacks could be mitigated by using third party open source wallets like Electrum connected with your hardware device, but this attack can bypass even that.Malicious wallet can manipulate nonces (random number) with additional data like parts of the seed as a hidden secret, and third party app has no way of verifying that this data is really random or it contains some hidden data.After sending more transactions attackers (malicious manufacturer or government agency) could have enough information to collect entire leaked master private key.Using this covert channel manufacturer could collect the seeds of all users without anyone noticing that!This attack is virtually impossible to prove and this gives additional motivation for malicious actors to perform attacks like this.Nobody knows if this attacks have even been performed in real life, but it's possible that someone already made a database of users or this could happen in near future especially with closed source devices.https://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/how-almost-all-hardware-wallets-can-steal-your-seed/As a protection from this attacks Shift Crypto and Blockstream are working on Anti-Klepto protocol that is adding additional randomness by the host device.This prevents the hardware wallet from manipulating the nonce and sending additional hidden information with every transaction.BitBox02 and Blockstream Jade are the first hardware wallets to implement this protections, but they are calling all other manufacturers to add this open source protocol.If someone don't want to add Anti-Klepto protocol or go open source, than you know you should stay away from this wallet manufacturer and move your coins to other device, if you want long term storage of your coins.They didn't say anything about QR codes, but I think this attack could be even more dangerous with devices that advertise as airgapped but they use closed source QR codes (like Safepal).",

But, is it? Someone with enough time and effort build a chip that looks like and acts like one. But does have some really fun code embedded in it.So unless I shave the top off the M4 CPU and look at it under a high power microscope do I really know it is one?Crap....back to dice, air gapped and multisig.....-Dave",

I don't know why they'd make a report like this and use it on their own hardware wallet without proving the attack works on others though - unless something is going to come out about other wallets needing major security patches soon - although I would expect those wallet manufacturers to have been contacted privately before this release too if that was the case.

If this is a feasible threat, they should take a hardware wallet from the competition, manipulate the nonces of transactions to include sensitive data, broadcast them, and show the community how it looks like in practice. After dozens of transactions, the seed should in that case already be leaked and become obtainable from the blockchain. Reconstruct it and the the vulnerability has been proven. After that, do the same thing with your own hardware wallet and invite others to do it with active Anti-Klepto protocol and prove that it's impossible thanks to said protocol. Until then, it's only unproven theory.",

It's not \"stealing the seed\" per se, it's more like creating the seed by somewhat simpler rules to allow easier brute forcing by them.This would be even easier imho than this \"Nonce Covert Channel Attack\", although this nonce attack could reveal the seed no matter where and how it was generated.I guess that no matter who is making the hardware wallet, the user unfortunately has to trust that company at least a little bit. But this was true from start, hence the hardware wallets should be used for \"daily funds\", not for a mix of daily funds and cold storage (safely generated paper wallet or seed is still more suitable for that).But, as the others said, I don't see why a HW company would blew its reputation by doing this kind of shenanigans, especially one with great sales over many years.

An intermediary can theoretically mess with the RNG of a laptop, or of a desktop in the same way. Absolutely; it applies to any hardware and is more likely to happen with Bitcoin-specific products. Most hardware wallets either have supply-chain validation (other link), tamper-evident labels or other security measures against that.DIY will be the safest way, also for your own op-sec, due to shipping. Even applies to very dumb metal plates, which by the simple fact of ordering online, can leak the fact that you own BTC to a number of entities.However, no DIY device has secure, permanent storage, resistance against hardware attacks and is easy to set up and use quickly for the average (even advanced) user.",

And we know what happens when people blindly trust others...[Updated] List of cryptocurrency exchange hacksQuote from: hZti on November 20, 2022, 12:45:45 PMWhat I also don’t know is if it is even possible if you never connect your ColdCard to the computer and only use a SD Card.The attack presented in this topic works irrespective of the method used to transfer PSBTs between host and device.Quote from: Hispo on November 20, 2022, 10:09:38 PMSo we are actually going back to roll dices and generate our own entropy?what are the chances that Trezor devices are vulnerable to this kind of attack?, I am not tech-savvy enough to figure it out by myself.Also, in the mean time, it would be nice if someone could provide a nice tutorial on how generate my own 24-word seed phrase using coins, because I don't think I have any dices on hand.  Here's a guide: https://medium.com/the-capital/cryptocurrency-911-how-does-12-word-seed-phrase-work-9d892de9732Do keep in mind that it shortly mentions (but doesn't further explain) how coin tosses might not have very great entropy, after all, according to some researchers. 'Random coin tosses' should generally be thought more as a model for visualizing a 50/50 random experiment, but not to create Bitcoin seed phrases.To answer your question: no, I don't think anyone's going 'back to dice rolls'. Even live-booted TailsOS is ususally considered a really secure way to create an offline cold-storage wallet for large sums of BTC, using simply your PC's randomness.I also don't understand how you get to this conclusion, since the attack presented in this topic doesn't target the hardware wallets' random number generator at all.There is always a point where trust is required, buhe question is how much do you want to do to minimize the tust that you need to give. For example your coins can be stolen when you send them to an exchange or somebody can simply come to your house and force you to give him your coins. With a lot of effort you can stop this from happening but the question is also how likely this is. Still it is concerning that there is a possibility of doing this.",
