I didn't use the casino because their ad popped up on my screen. Blockchair explorer is not to be blame if a person fails to do their research. For all I know it could be google ads designed to surface when you type certain keywords. The casino is a scam, no amount of paid ads will change that.",

Popular platforms have a civic responsibility to vett any website which wants to be advertised through them. They have a reputation and users can easily trust their recommendation.Google and play store have received lots of backlash for promoting s am platforms without doing their due diligence.There is however still the possibility that they didn't discover the scam accusations before promoting the website.",

Walletexplorer creates a database out of users who have fallen victim to this giant honeypot created and operated by a chain surveillance firm (Chainalysis to be exact), which only aim is to deanonymize bitcoin users and infringe upon their right to privacy so that governments, dictators, law enforcement and others can access this information and would be able to attack those who dare to use censorship-resistant money no one can control. Walletexplorer collects IP addresses, timestamps, and other system information and associates all that with the data you type in the search field. Further, it uses this information to find your other addresses, wallets, and maybe even accounts on centralized exchanges. All your activity is being monitored, analyzed, and, if requested, handed over directly to whoever pays for it.",

I prefer to use this one over the others.I loved Blockchair.com a lot but after they upgraded their UI to the current one, I did not use it. I don't know what their product owner thought to build up that version. It is odds to not see full Bitcoin addresses in one transaction. If you want to check what is an address, click on it. It is inconvenient and worse than their older versions.",

Quote from: Charles-Tim on July 10, 2022, 03:13:50 PMI like blockchair.com before, but I stopped using it when I saw 1xbit ad on the site. Theymos once sold 1xBit advertising space on Bitcointalk. Maybe you should stop using Bitcointalk as well.  The decision was reverted after several members complained and informed him about the awful reputation that casino has. The point is, theymos didn't know what was going on in terms of scamming players even though those things were happening in front of his nose and on the forum he administers. I seriously doubt blockchair representatives browsed Bitcointalk or other sources to check 1xBit's reputation before giving them a place to advertise.",
