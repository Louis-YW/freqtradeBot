Education is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and beliefs that enable individuals to understand and navigate the world around them.Education empowers individuals to make informed decisions, pursue their goals, and achieve success in their chosen fields. It provides a platform for personal growth and development, fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and enhances creativity and innovation.Furthermore, education is not limited to formal academic settings; it can also be obtained through practical experience, informal learning, and self-study. Regardless of the mode of education, the benefits are numerous and far-reaching.As you rightly stated, education also contributes to the betterment of society. Educated individuals tend to be more socially responsible and aware, and they are better equipped to contribute to the growth and development of their communities.In summary, education is a fundamental human right and a vital tool for personal and societal development. It is the key to unlocking one's full potential and achieving success in life.",

How many characters are in the Chinese language?Quote from: https://studycli.org/chinese-characters/number-of-characters-in-chinese/The number of unique Chinese characters used through the ages, though the exact figure is unknown, is safely in excess of 100,000.

Think about it, do you know all the words in an English dictionary? Probably not. A Chinese person of average education should know about 3,500 characters. A literate Chinese person may know 6,000 to 7,000 characters.The point is, education is everything. No wonder that, even though there are more and greater 'spikes' of high intelligence in Westerners, average Chinese people are way more intelligent than average Westerners. The Chinese have to learn way more difficult operations of language just to live than do Westerners. It's exercise. And practiced education exercise is the way to strengthen the brain.",

Many people mistakenly believe that the purpose of education is just to get a job, and with the current unemployment of bachelors, many people think that education is expensive and unnecessary. It is a very misconception, they cannot get a job after graduation, and they blame education while they have never looked back at themselves and what they have learned and accomplished. Those who despise education will always fail in all areas of life.",
