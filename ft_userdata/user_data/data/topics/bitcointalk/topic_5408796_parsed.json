  "content": "sourceOn Thursday during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Dallas, Texas the US conservatives cheered Hungarian PM Viktor Orban. Orban is a die-hard supporter of Putin and is seen as the black sheep of NATO and the EU because he is always opposing sanctions on Russia. Generally seen as autocrat who has banned the teaching LGBTQ topics in schools and criticised creating peoples of ”mixed-race”.But among the US conservatives he is seen as a role model and a freedom fighter, fighting for  the future of Western civilisation. Just like Donald Trump's, Orban is their hero regardless of their perceived political and social excesses.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/8/5/us-republicans-cheer-hungarian-pm-viktor-orban-at-conference",

Let's not forget, that US conservatives made Trump as president possible, so it's really hard to take them seriously by any means. And they will buddy up with anyone that has remotely similar views. Actually, makes me wonder how they didn't think Putin was great as he's basically the same thing .",

      "body": "More and more we are finding out about the ancient nation of Tartaria. The language of Hungary is based on and similar to Magyar, the ancient language of Tartaria. This being the case, the ideals of ancient Taartaria have probably been handed down, parents to children, throughout Hungary and the nations around her.While this is still under investigation by scholars, there is some basic info here - https://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-ancient-writings/are-t-rt-ria-tablets-actually-written-hungarian-007893.It seems that the history of the world that includes Tartaria is being hidden, intentionally. We are barely taught anything about Tartaria in our schools. But evidence is turning up all over the place, regarding history that is different than what we are being publicly taught.For example, it's reasonably common knowledge that the discovery of Antarctica dates to somewhere in the 19th century, and its complete mapping to the 20th century. But we have loads of ancient maps, from at least several centuries before, that show Antarctica, and even the land under the ice.In addition to that, there are all kinds of things, the knowledge of which has been more or less hidden from general knowledge - https://shiftfrequency.com/history-tartaria-erased/. If you read the things in the two links above, you will get enough info that you can do searches to find out a whole lot more proof of what is really going on in the world, and why... and why history is being rewritten to leave out much of the true past.The Hungarian language, being similar to one of the greatest languages of the past, might be the language to study, if for no other reason than to get a feel for the mindset of the truly ancient world.",

It may be the effect of the Trump sequestration of the US Republican party for his own means that brings this type of \"leader\" to be a role model.",
