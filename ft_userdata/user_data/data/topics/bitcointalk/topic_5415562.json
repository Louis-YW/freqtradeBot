      "body": "EV carsConsidering the challenges of oil and gas plus the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its effect on Oil and gas supply to Europe, more countries may focus on manufacturing of electric vehicles by next. They will see this as a substitute for gas used cars to reduce the effect of its dependence. Some cars have been in the lookout this year but next year is likely going to have more improvement and production of EVs. Again I believe that robots will have more place in human development by 2023.",

      "body": "People are moving towards convenience and higher life demands. I predict the electric vehicle industry will continue to grow stronger in 2023, It is not only because of the current energy crisis that electric vehicles have been developed, but this is the research work of many car manufacturers around the world for many years and now that we've made great strides, it's time to make the most of it. It will bring a solution to reduce costs and bring convenience during use. AI will be an industry that will continue to be focused on development when AI is being applied in many fields to serve people such as transportation, health, education...",

And there's already CRISPR that has been used already, I think that we will only see more commercial use of it in the next year but I think that it's still too early, we need more long-term study. I'm not too excited with cryptocurrency though, I feel like it will be stagnant like this year since halving won't happen for another year.",

This will be truth if halving does not come like we have experienced for hodlers that the time for profit is such time when there is volatility after halving but besides hodling the trading aspect of bitcoin is what those speaking of profit are doing, they are trading and not just hodling because that takes time like 4 years at every circle for another ATH to be reached. Learning to trade is profitable than to hodl.",
