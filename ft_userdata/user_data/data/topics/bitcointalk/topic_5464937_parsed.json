  "content": "First of all, I have known about crypto since 2021. So somehow I have some knowledge of it. One of my friend recently got into this sector, and he knew I was somehow involved with crypto. So whenever he got into trouble or had confusion, he would come to me and ask me.One time he came to me and said he had a method to earn money. He met with someone on the internet who was an NFT seller. The seller (scammer) promised him that if he bought his NFT for 100 dollars, it would generate up to 20 dollars daily. Hearing this, I was a little confused. Because NFT recently became popular and was still new, I didn't have enough knowledge of it. Even then, with my experience, I could tell it was a probable scam.I checked the scammer's account, their Twitter account (less than 3k followers), and the NFT in Binance. The NFT didn't have any significant daily trade or volume; it was some random NFT listed for sale. I sure knew it was a scam. So I warned him not to buy it. But he tried to buy it even after my warning. When he was about to send the scammer money, Binance blocked the account due to suspicious activity. The funny part is that the scammer knew it would happen. So he was already prepared with a video link on how to unlock the account. Then my friend was 100% sure he was a scammer and blocked him, and he was saved big time.So if you are new to crypto, always do your own research before investing.",

Your friend’s or the scammer’s? No offense but this part of your post makes everything sound made up, it’s normal for someone to encounter a scammer online as they are everywhere in the internet but them having their account blocked as soon as you / someone else was trying to make a payment to them seems weird, assuming it was a telegram account I would have said the account got blocked because he (scammer) was also messaging some random people that got his account reported but for binance it's unusual ngl.",

At last, scammers need to lure them into some offer so that they start to think that this is the one and only chance to earn free money from the internet, and they fall for FOMO and fall prey to the scam too. The best practice is to follow someone's advice when they at least tell you not to do that. Ok, I get it. If you are stubborn and think the advisor is the hurdle between you and your success, then at least try to look from a different angle at what benefit it brings for the advisor and scammers.Then those scam victims will understand that they are making a mistake by believing the scammers. These are all just phishing schemes to lure them into thinking that you will earn a hell of a lot of money by doing just nothing.I totally agree with you that once we eliminate the idea from our minds that there is nothing like free money in the world, then we will be saved from scams for all time. well, at least to some extent. But these scammers always come up with different ideas as they have a higher IQ than the Einsiten.",
