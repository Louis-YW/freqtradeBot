  "content": "Are there any such points? For some elliptic curves with less bits they can be found. I wonder if there are any such points for secp256k1, and if so, how to calculate those public keys? Even without private keys (that could be hard to find in such huge space), calculating those public keys alone could be interesting.For example, if we use \"p=14071, n=13933, base=(1,3660)\", then we can find those values:Code:n= 5744, x= 2318, y= 2318, y^2=12073n= 8470, x=11203, y=11203, y^2= 7960n=13652, x=  551, y=  551, y^2= 8110As far as I understand, if we have y^2=x^3+7, then in this case we would have x=y, so x^2=x^3+7. That means, if we look at complex numbers, then we would have three solutions for such equation. Of course, not every real point can be always represented, so when we have (1,sqrt(8)) as a solution, where x=1, and y=sqrt(8), then it is on some elliptic curve only if \"sqrt(8)\" can be represented modulo \"p\" (so if there is any value between 1 and p-1, that would give us 8, when it is multiplied by itself).",

Also have you ever seen x=y in secp256k1?A few months ago as I was playing around with xs and ys, I remember to see something like x=y, but since I had no  clue what that could really mean, I just ignored it.Main question, what would be the result of finding such points on secp256k1?",

      "body": "I see what you're getting at! In the equationCode:y^2 = x^3 + 7, If we assume that x and y are equal, we can substitute that into the equation to simplify it to.Code: x^2 = x^3 + 7.  This simplification gives us a cubic equation, which could potentially have three solutions.When we're working with elliptic curve cryptography it's important to understand that we're dealing with points on the curve that satisfy both the x and y coordinates.Not every combination of x and y will be a valid point on the curve.  For the secp256k1 curve which is the one used in Bitcoin.Code: y^2 = x^3 + 7 defines the curve itself. But not all x and y values will give us valid points on the curve. This is because the curve is defined over a finite field, and the coordinates (x, y) must satisfy the equation modulo a large prime number.So, while it's true that there may exist y-values corresponding to certain x-values that satisfy the equation, we need to check if both x and y fall within the valid range of values for the finite field defined by the curve's prime modulus.In your example of :Code:(1, sqrt(8)), which satisfies Quotey^2 = x^3 + 7, It is important to note that it may not correspond to a valid point on the secp256k1 curve. To determine if a point (x, y) is on the curve, we must ensure that both x and y are valid values within the finite field defined by the curve's prime modulus.",
