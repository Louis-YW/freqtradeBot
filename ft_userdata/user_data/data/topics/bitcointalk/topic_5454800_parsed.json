  "content": "Hi,Any idea what happened to blockchain.info API? Is it still functional? This url: https://api.blockchain.info/customer/signup gives me a 503 error. It's one of the oldest and most popular APIs around and it would be a pity if it would go down forever. I also don't see any options to contact the support - it seems they offer support for their trading platform/exchange and wallet services but no mention of API anywhere?",

I did contact them finally, using their trading platform support form. I really hope they'll forward it to the person(s) in charge of the API. API itself seems to be functioning, it's just the url I provided above has issues.P.S. The status page seems to monitor just the exchange and nothing else.",

But I'm trying to run a script which uses this link: https://api.blockchain.info/customer/signup and it's giving me a 503 error. And I think you still need XPUB key to use it for purposes I'm trying to use it for. So XPUB is also not working/impossible to acquire. Perhaps I'm wrong and you can guide me?",

Xpub really works and I'm able to get it by visiting the page in the tutorial you posted above. This url is necessary for requesting an API key and it doesn't work. P.S. Not sure why this thread was relocated to Web Wallets since the issue is not with the wallet.",
