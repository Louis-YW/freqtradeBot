It will depend on many things. Is it in the ToS? If it is in the ToS it is not going to do much good to go to court.I think this is more typical of crypto gambling houses, as I am not aware of it happening with fiat ones.",

What are you gonna do if the casino does these offenses you mentioned?Sue them? Yeah good luck with it.",

      "body": "That's ideal but maybe it depends on each casino's policy and if the casino really wants to reveal the identity of the person who won big, the casino should ask the winner first. And if the winner feels that it is not necessary, the casino should not disclose it to the public and only provide the letters of the winner's name or lottery number.Perhaps if the winner feels that this could put him at risk by revealing his identity, he can file a complaint with his casino and if necessary, he can try to seek recourse to the courts. But it's best to resolve it amicably because this is between the winner and the casino.",

There are many winnings that gambling site would disclose that someone won big amount of money but will not disclose the name of the person. About gambling house, immediately a gambler wins, the news is already almost everywhere around that this particular person won so big, a land based gambling is not a place of privacy at all even without the gambling house disclosing it.",

I can't deny that the press may push the platform to publish who has been winning the reward. IMO if i never see that such thing if online platform was publishing the winner. I saw only offline platform like lottery winner who has been publised by press. There is also another way for people to avoid to be published just like someone who has been using mask to claim their reward from winning lottery. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXni9Z4twW4Just take it easy.

I don't think I've ever heard an issue about it really, the most I've heard was the winner's location is revealed at most, their names? Not really. I also don't think it could legally be complained about unless it was stated in their casino policies, especially in online casinos.

But filing a lawsuit will just make it worse as well and the user will expose himself further when doing so. It's a price to pay when you want to play all the way and submit your data which makes the users vulnerable. If the user is willing to go to court, I guess it depends on him.",

Still, maybe the purpose of the casino revealing the winner's name in their casino is to tell the public who the winner is. But casinos should have thought carefully before they did because it could involve the winner's safety. But suppose the casino discloses the name of the winner to the authorities. In that case, it may be because of regulations from the local authorities that require the casino to report it to them.But either way, the casino must inform the winner before they reveal their identity so that the winner can find out so they can allow the casino to do so or choose to keep it a secret. But I don't know if this case is reported to the court. The court will help the winners and consider it a serious offence or the court will help the casino. After all, the winner might be an ordinary person with nothing to finance the case.",
