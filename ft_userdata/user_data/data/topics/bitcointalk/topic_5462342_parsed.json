  "content": "Hello guys ðŸ™‚ Me and my friend want to start a peanut butter business and are looking for a good wholesale supplier. After many research, we found out that Turkish manufacturers can potentially offer us high quality and reasonable price for peanuts or peanut butter. Long story short, we are looking for Turkish peanuts wholesale suppliers and/or Turkish peanut manufacturer companies that are willing to manufacture 0.5-1 metric ton of peanut butter under our brand, i.e. to put our label on it. We just want to test things, so, that's why we plan to manufacture that amount at first. This amount may change during negotiation, I'm just briefly saying it here.Does anybody know any website like Alibaba where we will be able to contact Turkish manufacturers/sellers? Or is anyone here in touch with peanuts/peanut butter manufacturers?Thank you in advance",
