But I am sure that genetically modified plants are contributing to an increase in agricultural productivity. Also, most farmers in developing nations still use crude tools, empowering them with modern farm tools could also help them to contribute to global food production. I don't understand your question about how information from crypto might assist in curbing food shortages. But in recent times we have seen how bitcoin miners have contributed to the agricultural sector. With the increase in the cost of power, we have heard the news of bitcoin miners using the heat from their mining equipment to dry timber in Norway, while the heat is used in greenhouses for crop production in the Netherlands.You seem to have created six threads out of your seven posts in less than seven hours. The new topic icon is not the only one there, you can respond to other members' posts if you have something to say. But as a beginner, my advice is that you spend more time reading and not writing because you have so much to learn from the forum. If you want to create a thread, ensure you put in some work so as produce quality writeups.",

There may be indirect ways in which cryptocurrency, especially the blockchain technology that it uses, could be of help to somehow address food shortages and even climate change, but it is not what it's made for. While Bitcoin mining, for example, could reduce methane flaring by making use of excess supply that is otherwise burned and, therefore, saves the environment from additional harm, Bitcoin is not created to address global warming. It is a currency.",

Small country with a high poverty rate.When we talk about climate change and extreme weather, we cannot avoid it. But for some developed countries there must be a solution for that, for example gardening with the help of technology that can manipulate the weather.But the problem is, how can these poor countries find solutions for themselves? I think the most appropriate step is for developed countries or rich countries to provide assistance to poor countries. Because poor countries have almost no way to solve their hunger problem because the economic circulation there is very limited, the exchange rate is low, and the wages of workers are also low.",

You are thinking in terms of the \"apocalypse\" line of thought which might be true in the long term but not right now. Food shortages and all that are often the scare tactic take by many lobbyists to promote their idea. Please remember that not every country is going to face this problem and if you are earning enough to afford a simple meal.In the future we might see problems, but the question remains whether you should worry about it? One might have undergone a natural death long before such bad times actually come in, so whats the point to worry?And I dont understand the crypto angle to this - like many forum users have often pointed out, crypto is not a silver bullet to every problem in the world. Poor people and poor countries will remain poor, they will not be able to buy crypto and gain that so called \"financial freedom\".",

Food shortages can be addressed indirectly through cryptocurrency. How so?Cryptocurrencies can help with the provision of farm credit to poor farmers and those located in hard-to-reach areas where financial services may be nonexistent. Doing so will give them the morale to get back to the field to cultivate their crops or rear their animals.",

But I would say that don't forget where we live and the potential sources of food that can be produced. Nature provides water, land for us to grow crops and produce food. But the fact is that currently all buildings, factories and springs are running low. I'm not going to attribute it to the crypto industry because this point is extra. You are talking about food and of course it is the main source of survival.Take a look at the economic conditions around you and see if there is any potential for growth amidst the incessant internet-based jobs? context of conversation Global food shortages will not be the same in the regions of spice-producing countries. All of that goes back to government policy which should limit companies from building factories on land producing food sources.",

      "body": "Apart from climate change, natural disasters and other things that naturally affect the agricultural sector and developments for food fulfillment, I think in this case it is also triggered by an increase in the global population which certainly places an emphasis on the demand for food and increased consumption and narrowing of agricultural land due to population density, on the other hand I also noticed that there are many generations, especially starting from the millennial generation, generation Z and the new generations that have emerged, they are very reluctant to enter the agricultural and plantation sector because they prefer to enter the latest industries such as technology, mining and others that generate more money and minimal losses. I think this also affects the supply of food because there are very few people cultivating food. I think this happens in all countries, including mine, where basically the land in the country is very fertile but there is little interest in farming. the solution to this I think the younger generation should see this crisis and start farming because there may be more scarcity in the future.",

We just pay attention to our surroundings, how much land that used to provide a source of food has been used up due to development.Humans move faster than nature, nature is still there but humans have moved far ahead, if that is not accompanied by that awareness that makes the balance not maintained.",

As a farmer, I can tell you that we are not well paid. According to the commodity system, it doesn't matter if we really make a profit.Imagine bankrupting the people who depend on everyone's survival. Consider that logic. Middlemen get rich by taking huge profits without worrying about producers actually being able to keep working. It seems rational that all of society most wants to care about the survival of its farmers, rather than saying 'o well capitalism' In which case you all starve and the peasants can say 'o well capitalism'",

Raising animals for food is another way but this is somehow can cater to lots of concerns because of the waste materials it produces that can affect the neighborhood.It is also good to learn the the long-term storage .QuoteYour stockpile of food needs to get stored properly to withstand the test of time. Freezer foods are not non-perishable, but they can work well if rotated out regularly. You’ll also need to rotate out your non-perishables in your food storage areas – just not as often as your freezer goods.To keep your items edible and ready to nourish your family, start by labeling everything with the date you bought them. Then, mark the items down in a spreadsheet with the purchase date, ideal use-by date, and location in your home.After that, store the pantry items off the ground in a cool, dry location. If you’re using your cellar, make sure that all your food sits on sturdy shelves. All your frozen goods go in the freezer for regular and emergency use.Check your list monthly to see what needs to get rotated out. As you identify items to use up, rotate them into your normal food supply and replace them during your next trip to the store.By taking this approach, you’ll avoid having to replace everything all at the same time, keeping your costs manageable without compromising your ability to stay well-prepared. Your efforts will also help reduce food waste through the years.Quote from: Iroh on February 11, 2023, 08:46:27 PMHow do we survive food shortages? Easy solution.

This is easier said than done especially when you are living in an area where there is no space to grow your own food.  This is applicable to people who are living with huge backyards but most who are in urban area has very limited space so you cannot apply this kind of solution in the said area.  Besides not many people can afford to get a piece of land.[1] https://www.outdoorhappens.com/how-to-prepare-for-food-shortage/",

If you believe the theory of human evolution, which is from monkeys, then there's a theory that I would like to share with everyone. Every living organism gets adapt to its surroundings. If the climate change ever occurs to the point of life forms being in danger, over time it will get used to the change and mutate accordingly. Another evolution will happen. As for an example, scientists are already doing research on seeds in order to change their DNA to survive in extreme conditions. And report says that they are quite successful in doing so. Maybe one generation will suffer, but the upcoming one will come up with a solution to this for sure.",
