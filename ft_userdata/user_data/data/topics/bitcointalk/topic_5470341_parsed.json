  "content": "The question about Bitcoin's current state keeps surfacing on the internet, and here's my perspective on it. I believe that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a significant bearish phase. This might come as a surprise, considering its widespread popularity, but when we delve into essential data points, it becomes apparent that some of the optimism surrounding its future is unravelling.To provide context, when we look at Bitcoin's historical performance, we would expect periods of surges followed by normalization, fostering sustainable long-term growth. However, the reality differs. A close examination of monthly trading activity data from the beginning of 2018 reveals a consistent year-over-year decline in Bitcoin's trading activity for at least five years.For instance, in September of this year, Bitcoin's trading activity was 68.6% lower compared to the same month the previous year. Over the past two years, it has seen a more moderate decrease of 54.8%. Yet, when compared to three years ago, it has declined by 68.9%, and compared to five years ago, it has plummeted by a substantial 86.1%. The overall trend is unequivocal: trading activity is on a steady decline, and Bitcoin's price significantly relies on the optimism of traders. Acknowledging these trends is essential. This is what some people believe.However, I hold the view that Bitcoin's price is primarily driven by sentiment. Whether we accept it or not, it's our sentiment that propels Bitcoin's price, not technical analysis. Technical analysis only comes into play when we need to determine the price range for our next buying or selling decision.I've observed that many people employ various strategies to accumulate Bitcoin during this prevailing bearish phase, such as the widely recognized DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) and Dual Investment (I often discuss these together because they complement each other). Some opt for Smart Trend, while a significant number engage in trading Bitcoin on futures contracts.Everyone has their approach in anticipation of a potential Bitcoin surge in the near future. However, we should also consider how long everyone can wait for this expected turnaround. It's commonly suggested that next year will be fundamentally positive for Bitcoin, but what if price manipulation, like the dynamics of price ranging for several days getting to weeks seen this month during \"Uptober,\" comes into play with no significant direction on where price would go but a mere indecisive action that can lead to manipulation and sweep traders who either long or shortSo, what is your perspective: Do you believe we are currently in a bear market, or is this merely a manipulation to discourage some individuals from Bitcoin?",

I have seen it not do all that weirdly so far and I am thinking that we are going to do a bit more common for a while as well and not really move up or down too much. This doesn't mean that a small chance won't happen, as much as %10 could possibly happen in either direction, that would be the highest I would say until its a trend.

It nonsense to assume any trend while the price is clearly on the sideways of bullrun in short time frame(days) and bear market in long time frame(months). The price is currently on indecision phase so there’s no current trend here unless the price breaks any major support and resistance that is already a boundary for more than a month.All this price action is clear the result of 2 sides of traders that has opposite belief. Positive trader believe that ETF approval and Bitcoin halving will boost the price while the other side are those still viewing the Bitcoin chart as bearish.",

      "body": "If I look at the position of bitcoin within one year, or more simply from the beginning of 2023 until now towards the end of the year I see that bulish dominates, especially during the first month of this year until April where bitcoin experienced a significant increase which eventually stopped at $ 31k as the first highest resistance at the beginning of this year, then then experienced a bearish phase again until the price of $ 24k which is the lowest support in the middle of the year. If we race to support and resistance, it is clear that in 2023 bitcoin has increased where some previous supports are lower than the latest support, so of course there is a fairly dominating increase. And well now bitcoin is experiencing a new bearish phase if we look at the last two months after experiencing a sideways phase which finally gave indications for the increase that is now really happening, we can see now bitcoin is forming new support in this October which is higher than support last month. According to what I see, there is already a pretty good confirmation that shows an indication that the price will go back up in the near future, and according to my prediction the bullish will continue until it at least touches the highest resistance in the last month, namely $28,580.",

The overall trend is unequivocal: trading activity is on a steady decline, and Bitcoin's price significantly relies on the optimism of traders. Acknowledging these trends is essential. This is what some people believe.Ok, I got it that, the BTC price is declining because traders are decreasing, Is that what you are trying to imply here? But what I think is, that we should not use 5 years old trading data/stats to predict the reasons for the current market price. Well, you can use the current data, but to be honest, I don't think that's a good thing to predict the BTC price, because it not only depends on the demand and supply factor, but only 99%. (Some might not agree with me). What I am confused about here is, if the trading activity is decreasing, but holding activity is increasing so much, is that still an indicator to influence on the BTC price? Well, D&S does have a great impact, and daily trading, makes the price of BTC very volatile, but when a huge buying pressure comes, the market takes big pumps, and most of the time, the market (BTC) takes huge pumps due to some good news. Quote from: Best-mary on October 14, 2023, 04:19:03 PMwhile a significant number engage in trading Bitcoin on futures contracts.So, you are saying the trading activity decreasing but future trading is increasing! I mean really. Well, first, I would like to see the source from where you took the stats. Quote from: Best-mary on October 14, 2023, 04:19:03 PMSo, what is your perspective: Do you believe we are currently in a bear market, or is this merely a manipulation to discourage some individuals from Bitcoin?We are in a bearish market, and there is no doubt about it, or you can see we are in the accumulation phase and we should take benefit of it to fill our bags with BTC or other tokens (diversification).",

I get your point mate and it makes sense this is how I paint it. before a price can be considered flat what was the market prior to that. Let's say Bitcoin start rising to $40 we would say that the bull market is on and let's say at the market fluctuate around $35k-$45k the market is still maintaining if the resistance breaks lower I think it can be considered a bear market trend and is the resistance breaks high then the bull run may have just kicked off again",

People think that these trends of bull or bear meaning the price, but it means the direction not the price.Exactly, a run, either it is bull, or bearish, it does not mean, the price of BTC is increased or decreased, but it means a bull zone or a timeline has begun in which the price of BTC will make ATH, or tests out, all of its resistances and the bearish zone is a timeline in which the price tests out its all supports. In other words, in the bearish zone, we will see a decline and in the bull zone, we will see an increment in the price of BTC.And if we study the bull and bear zone with respect to the Halving, then after halving bull run starts, and after a bull run, the bearish run starts and then halving again. So according to this knowledge, we can say that we are currently in a bearish zone and going toward a bull run after the halving.

If they are universal then I think I can also use them, but to my knowledge, I have already said what is bearish run and bullish run and how I interpret them.",

This is why there's no concrete definition as to when we classify a bearish or bullish season. For some, we are in the bearish season as we are below $30k level and it was way more than half of the BTC's ATH.However, if you will compare it with the first 5 years of btc, you can say that we are absolutely still in the bullish period.So yes, how you label the trend of this market depends on when you want to based it with, what time period you want to refer to.",

There's no reason for it to fall under these two categories since the halving is not here yet, and there are no news/issues that have surfaced which will affect the disposition of the people towards bitcoin. With that being said I can say for sure that in the coming months up to a year after the halving, we'll see some awesome stuff going about, possibly a new ATH, etc. etc. We'll just have to play the waiting game at this point and eagerly work towards building our portfolio, months from now this could be the cheapest that bitcoin could go so we better get ready just in case.",
