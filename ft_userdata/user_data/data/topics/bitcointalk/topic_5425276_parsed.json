It's best to copy the full webpage to external media (or download from github, as OmegaStarScream suggested) and run it on an air-gapped device. If you generate a private/public key pair offline, then there is no chance that your keys will be archived on a server. Besides, the code is open source, meaning that anyone can analyze it and understand how it works and what it does.",

Previously, there were no hardware wallets or they were expensive and untested.It is by choice and what you think is best for what you want. Paper wallet cost nothing to setup and you can set it up within few minutes, yet it is secure. Although, having a hardware wallet is good for altcoins.Having hardware wallet is useful for multiple coins, but for bitcoin, you can still use a paper wallet because of some reasons, like not spending your coins over long term. Paper wallet has gone beyond using bitaddress to generate a single address wallet, you can even use iancoleman or a reputed wallet like Electrum on an airgapped device to generate a paper wallet, which means to back up the seed phrase on paper or somewhere safe like on metallic sheet, having some private keys and addresses backup that you can later run on online wallet whenever you want to spend your bitcoin, making easy means of making transaction possible. But the main purpose of a paper wallet is for a long term storage.Some people may prefer papper wallet as it is a cold wallet with no transaction made on it before, unlike hardware wallets that still connect by some means like USB, bluetooth or NFC.",

Previously, there were no hardware wallets or they were expensive and untested.Hardware wallets are growing in popularity, but they are not for everyone. In addition to the cost, those extra features are not always necessary, especially if you just want store a few different kinds of cryptocurrency. A paper wallet is great to have, not only in case something happens to your device (hardware wallets can be lost or damaged), but also because you can use them as \"savings\" wallets where you are not spending from them often. Paper wallets are convenient for offline storage and for long-term storage.",

Although, having a hardware wallet is good for altcoins.As a paper wallet is discouraging to hold (many) Altcoins, I would say that it's another reason for a paper wallet.  Bitcoin has proven to be overally the better investment compared to Altcoins (at least for now) and we have good reasons it will stay like that. And yes, I agree, paper wallet is a good choice for HODLing your BTC, it's free, you don't leak any personal data (like Ledger's recent personal data hack) and downloading BitAddress it from GitHub is the way to go.",

All you need to do is to create a deterministic paper wallet, that is a seed phrase printed on a piece of paper. The keys generated for each altcoin is at a different BIP32 derivation path so there is no conflicts there either.",
