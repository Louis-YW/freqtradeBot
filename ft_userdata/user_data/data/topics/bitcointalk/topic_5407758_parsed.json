      "body": "Bitcoin has moved in 4 year cycles almost since inception. It’s just the way it goes, maybe as time passes the market will become more mature & the price will be less volatile but we are not there yet.The block reward halvening still plays a big part in the price, it is usually this that dries up the supply & availability of new coins on the market which leads to the very start of each bull run. The market eventually gets overheated, we reach a high & then we enter a new bear market.Anything of value which is in demand increases in price if you cut the supply. We have at least 2 more 4 year halvening cycles of boom to bust, bull market to bear market before some form of price stability forms.Some of the things mentioned in the OP do have some effect on the price but I am a firm believer in 4 year cycles & we are still going through them, almost like textbook. We are in a bear market now & will be for at least another 6-9 months. A bottom will arrive, probably coinciding with some kind of capitulation event due to real world shit. We will then move sideways with a slow uptrend as we near the 2024 halvening. We’ll rise & get a big all time high in 2025 at some point & then it’ll start all over again.Rinse & repeat, the 4 year cycle trend is your friend (until it isn’t).Now is certainly a great time to buy though.",

In my opinion it's the mainstream media. When price goes up the trend for them goes high. They starts hyping the media for bitcoin. As a result people think it's the time not to miss. Most people do not understand investment. They are driven by hype.",

The bear market will always come irrespective of other economic factors, same is the bull market. We had the longest bull market after the pandemic but some factors favored the long bull. Bull requires a lot of fund and the present interest of borrowed fund may have affected the abrupt dump. Exchanges take an important role in price manipulation and they work with the whales, so the market is not out-rightly decentralized.",

There are multiple reasons behind the current bear market. Also people go through a psychological factors like FOMO. These type of people won't buy bitcoin when the price is at all time low. But this same population will buy once they see an upward trend. For a global currency like bitcoin, it is always multiple factors that come into play. Also we have to keep in mind that it also goes through a bull and bear cycle.",

      "body": "You forgot about probably the most important factor: the pandemic. What we're seeing right now is in my opinion a direct result of how countries handled covid. Ukraine is just a secondary factor, but the primary one was money printing and giving it away in the form of stimulus packages to prevent the economy from collapsing while the lockdowns were in place. I believe the lockdowns and covid restrictions were unnecessary and the governments first issued those, then they printed money and now we're getting the inflation shockwave which is what's causing all stocks to go down and cryptocurrencies along with them. There's nothing wrong with bitcoin. It's reacting to the world around it. Companies don't have money so they sell assets. Those who have enough money to hold through these hard times will come out on top when the trend reverses, and it always reverses. If it ever does not reverse we'll have a world war or some Mad Max type of chaos, so you won't need investments anyway",

Then the dumping started and the downtrend shaped.It could have ended there but all of a sudden we started seeing a wave of FUD and market manipulation that tried to intensify the panic sell and keep the downtrend alive.This could have still ended but suddenly economy of most countries like US and most of Europe crashed. Obviously some people would need to sell their bitcoins to cover their losses so the downtrend continued.The final straw was the fact that other markets (eg. US stock market) started crashing hard and over the past 2 or 3 years people are fooled into thinking that bitcoin should drop because of that, so they started panic selling hence prolonging the downtrend even more.The other reasons you mentioned such as the war and inflation are actually reasons for bitcoin price to go up not down.",

I see this as a win. The blockchain isn't damaged at all by this and the BTC community is strong.The war in Ukraine had lost it's influence over crypto prices.

Even if the low is in and price reverses to higher levels, it'd still be a bear market and why it'd be called a relief rally, as it'd be some relief from the bear market. Until there is a significant higher low, there are currently only lower highs. Even in 2019 when price went from $3.2K to $14K, it was still a bear market as price simply created a lower high. The bear market only really ended in that cycle when price made a higher low at $3.8K in 2020. As quite obviously dropping 75% from $14K is considered pretty bearish (and continuation of the previous bear trend).",

What we did not expect was that the war between Russia and Ukraine made the world economy even more wobbly and difficult and bitcoin is not immune to that influence. With or without these factors, this year is also expected to see a drop in the price of bitcoin, this is a crypto market cycle and a lot of people have been waiting for it to happen.",

That sounds weird but the action of the people towards a crypto can affect their volatility. It can be that the price will go up if many people buys and hodls but the opposite thing can happen once they sell.About the Ukraine war, I think there is only a small impact in the price of cryptos because before the war came, the dip are already starting. Third is when people follow others but this is what actually happening now. Many people are buying but out of our surprise the price can still go down sometimes. The last item in your list is probably the one that has a big contribution on the fall.",
