The effect of big tech companies and businesspeople like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk on misinformation and disinformation is worrying. However, holding everyone and business accountable for their acts is critical for democracy's integrity.",

No don't is intelligent enough or gullible enough not to fail for a fake news article or a campaign done with malice. That being said, the openess for Musk towards free of speech may have affected the way other social media view their content moderation, it has been so much emphasis on free speech rights since he took over Twitter than users of social media in general may be becoming more aware of all the censorship and filters they had been subjected to, for the sake of anything (political correctness, democracy protection, etc). It is big business if people start to abandon your service because they way you moderate, if continued that way it would be either to change the way you moderate or be ready to lose some market share to competition. Those migrating probably are mostly within the political right.",

Big Tech isn’t following Elon’s lead in disinformation. Big tech got caught misleading and censoring the truth from individuals to help steal an election. Now that the cat is out of the bag and informed people are aware of their manipulation, they’re attempting to show they can act fairly to avoid being fined or worse.",

Of course, \"disinformation\" being inconvenient facts that contradict their own agenda. Facebook and youtube still have heavy censorship, nothing's changed.More speech is good for democracy, even if it makes the MSM upset.",

The stockholders, users, and advertisers have some influence, assuming the leaderships cares about the future of their business. In a free market, if we actually had one, that is enough, you do not need the centralized, corrupted Government causing more trouble by \"holding people accountable\".",

So if they planned to change their course of action on how they manage information, the CEOs of those social media would be likely called to testify to the Senate of the Union, just like it happened to Mark some years ago, but it was for different reasons.If this push of information being forced to us (according to what you say) is coming from government itself, then there are small chances of permanently stopping, not matter who the CEO is at the moment.",
