In this case, Bitcoin will be quite important as a support for anticipating a definite financial crisis when a food source crisis will have an impact on inflation which will experience a sharp decline. Avoid mass chaos as much as possible and do not get involved in certain political interests.When a country like America experiences a crisis, of course we will surely see the impact of the invasion of other countries. Absorb the natural resource needs of developing countries down and beat them to maintain America's economic stability. Although to be honest this sentence is more appropriate for China, which is often at the forefront of invasions of natural resources than the US.Turning to a Middle Eastern country with limited oil supplies, raising the price per barrel is one of the surefire strategies that has allowed it to survive the global crisis.The question is: will it really happen and hit the average economy of every country?",

So if there's anything an average Joe can do to stop the war, they should (protests against the war, against the Black Sea blockade, against trading with Russia). Also, if we're talking about middle-class people, they aren't the ones who'll be hit by the crisis the most. But still, if it's possible to afford it, I'd stock up on flour, dry pasta, yeast (to bake the bread if there's none), non-perishable goods. Not much, no need to go crazy, but just some of it in case there's a severe food shortage and you need to survive.",

Or what?If you live in the city and have no opportunity to produce your own food, you have only two options - to come to terms with the situation and start buying less expensive food in smaller quantities. Another option is to consider relocating to a place where food can be grown, which would mean relocating to a smaller urban area. This has its advantages, not only because of the production of your own food, but also because of a healthier life due to less pollution and less life stress.Quote from: mk4 on May 22, 2022, 01:37:30 PM1. Buy a good amount of preserved goods. Canned goods that has years before expiration, and the like. Don't over-hoard though, don't forget that other people need food too!Cans are very common for food storage, but like plastic they have one very negative feature - they contaminate food with BPA (bisphenol A). This is not something we do not know, but it should be borne in mind that such packaging is harmful and poisons food, although producers do not care about it, and the authorities are not too interested in tackling this problem. An ordinary person will always choose not to be hungry, no matter how unhealthy the food is.",

Or what?Global food threats have become a serious concern of the world including the United Nations, if you want to do an agricultural strategy that is the best step and many countries and research suggest agriculture.In some cases producing land, livestock and fish farming could potentially yield substantial economic benefits and could overcome the food crisis, in the management of agricultural land in the next 2-4 years can produce such as: green beans, soybeans, sorghum, millet, rice, wheat, cassava, corn and many others, all of this income can be saved in the long term to cover the food crisis.In other methods can also be done to overcome the global food crisis.For example:Carry out energy-saving methods while planting trees that are useful for the sustainability of human life and methods of maintaining cleanliness and not littering, that waste can hamper agricultural production, if the waste contains toxic elements, most of the water for agriculture is taken from rivers that flow into agricultural land.",

      "body": "I think chickens might be a good option. They can feed on termites, insects and other random things found in the environment. And produce a decent number of eggs every week. They bypass current issues with inflating costs of natural gas and fertilizer. With a good amount of productivity and short term returns for little effort and knowledge base. Chicken populations might grow and scale quickly enough to fill gaps left behind by other food sources.People may have to abandon cities to migrate to more rural areas where self sufficiency is a more achievable goal. Keeping milk cows, milk goats and other livestock could be other options. But I do not think that we have the population numbers necessary for that to scale. Or that those population numbers be reached quickly enough to make a difference. There are some who claim microgreens and sprouts can be used as a food source quickly although I'm not certain how sustainable that is.Plants and crops might be other options. But I think the shortest turnaround for that is around 90 days with potatos and tomatos. The value of seeds could inflate if demand rises. Although I do not know if many would pursue that option.",

      "body": "It's not easy to run an animals or crops farm. It requires a lot of spare time, effort and care from the farmer. You need to work all day long to earn too little in return, because it's not only about planting the seeds, watering them or feeding the chickens once in a day. You need to check everyday (probably more than once) the crops to see if there are any diseases or parasites attacking it, you need to clean the chickens' spots, water and food trough, because it becomes dirty really fast, you need a very strict routine to not miss any daily task.For most people it's not practicable, especially for those used to the life in the cities.What people can do is to invest in a countryside property and rent it for now to local farmers or something like that. And if someday a chaotic crisis starts and food supplies become low and expensive, their jobs stop being profitable, they have already a plan B in mind, that is to live in the countryside full-time, producing their own basic goods to survive. It looks romanticized, but in fact it's a harsh life or better saying, a survival experiment.",

Neither will hoarding or even increasing his/her purchasing capacity address the problem, unless the only cause of the crisis is inflation.But since there are a number of causes, there should be a number of approaches also. Supply chain problems, war, rising prices of fertilizers and other related products need different solutions. In my country, there is a need for the government to put more focus and priority and funds, too, on agriculture and food production. Strengthening local agriculture is the key. Decreasing dependence on imported fertilizers will help. Subsidizing farmers is also needed. Fighting against ruthless middlemen is also important. To the average person, however, little efforts as planting and raising their own food is of much help. Make every idle piece of land productive in some way. This will make us less dependent on the market which will hopefully lower down the demand and therefore price. In the long run, this might even significantly bring down the demand to import. The local produce might suffice. It would also help if we stop being wasteful.",

Stockpiling food isn't a bad idea for people in countries that might be the most affected by a possible food shortage (and damned if I know exactly which countries those are), but if everyone started doing that all at once it might be more of a problem.  When COVID hit, it seemed like everything was flying off the shelves--and that was before the supply chain issues hit.  I remember the cat food aisle being almost bare two years ago, so when panic buying happens it leaves a lot of people without the things they need.Farming is a great idea, but the problem is that not everyone can do it, either because they don't have enough land or knowledge or money to invest in setting up a garden.  There are a lot of very poor people in the word, you know.  And I have a feeling that they're the ones who'll be the hardest hit if there comes a food shortage.That's a big \"if\".  In the US it seems like there's plenty of food to go around, and the government is one of the ones that helps out other countries when they get hit by disasters (never mind all the horrible things they otherwise do).  But who knows?  I could be one of the people planting tomatoes and living off of salad until the world re-equilibrates.  I hope it doesn't come to that, but these days nothing is off the table as far as possibilities.",
