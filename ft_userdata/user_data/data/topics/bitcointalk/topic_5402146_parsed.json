  "content": "I have a friend who used to be so crazy about sports betting. He would bet on live sports and simulated leagues. On some days, his strategy will be to bet on a specific outcome within the game. While on other days, he'd bet on overall outcomes within the game. Sadly, he has lost more times than he won. One day, everything changed when he discovered online crypto casinos. It was as if a new world had opened up. He would spend most of his time on slots, dice, table, and games... When I asked his reason for abandoning sports betting for online crypto casinos. He told me that aside from being able to receive payment in bitcoins, he loved the instant winnings that the online casinos offer. Secondly, online casino games are less stressful than sports betting.  He explained that sports betting requires knowledge of the sports and sophisticated strategies to win.  I cannot tell if he is better off in terms of winning in his online casino games than he did in sports betting. So between sports betting and online casino games, which do you prefer?",

Yes this require more skills but it also gives you more control unlike luck-based casino games. I also don't have to deal with the house edge hehe.QuoteHe told me that aside from being able to receive payment in bitcoins, he loved the instant winnings that the online casinos offer.Does he not know about bookies that accepts deposits and pays in crypto? QuoteSecondly, online casino games are less stressful than sports betting.Less thinking or analysis is what he means I guess. Wait until he starts losing and strategies doesn't seem to work.",

      "body": "I guess if you followed several sports then sports betting might be good for you. Online casino games like slots? the odds for us to win is very slim so it's not even comparable to sports betting per se.Maybe your friend just wanted to find a way to continue his gambling habits and recover some of his lost money on sports betting. Maybe he just have a string of bad luck in sports betting that he needs some fresh air to think so he play different games. Nevertheless, if he is smart enough, he knows his chances are not the good. So for me I prefer sports betting.",

But do take note that in casino games, you are relying on your luck, which means, you have no idea when will you win or lose. Whereas, with sportsbetting, if you are very familiar with the sports, you have high chance of winning. But yes, it does take time of waiting. In this case, it depends on you where you are comfortable of. I also bet from time to time in the sports that I am familiar with. But if you want immediate results with thrilling game, you can always play with the usual casino games. But don't expect that you will go home as a winner.",

So between sports betting and online casino games, which do you prefer?I agree with the points raised by your friend but it all boils down to personal preference.As explained by your friend, online casino games are instant- meaning a person bets and the outcome is showed to you within seconds after the round ends in a current game. While some games require pure luck (e.g. slots, etc.), there are some card games that require some degree of techniques in order to at least reduce the risks you are facing (e.g. poker, etc.).With regard to sports betting, knowledge about the given sport is definitely essential. If you have some data to formulate a hypothesis on who would win in a given match, then you are somehow reducing the odds of failure. The problem is, the winnings can be realized later on after the game ends.Personally, I would choose sports betting since it is relatively safer compared to online casino games. Though there may be a delay in profit materialization, at least the risks involved aren't that high compared to playing slots, poker, or any related online casino games.",

If I lose a bet in sports gambling, I think about it for days sometimes. Until I can better define what went wrong and hopefully not make the same mistake in the future. Sometimes I wonder if I invest more thought and strategy into my sports gambling than generals on real life battlefields invest into waging war. There would never be soldiers digging trenches in a radioactive chernobyl red forest to be found in any of my sports line ups.Dice does carry a lower curve which is better suited for those who want to gamble on fast money without having to worry over details or statistics. Having a winning mentality and winning belief which allows a person to consistently roll the dice needed to win. Eye of the tiger, heart of the cards. Dice is closer to poker in terms of players not being able to alter the cards they're dealt with strategies or clever tactics but still potentially being able to come out as a winner.",

Sports betting is a waaaay more better (subjective, don't judge me), than casino games, and I've tried both. Sports betting has that sense where you don't rely on luck but rather on analysis and studying. And imo, you can even determine the winner without having the need to study it that intensively, with the knowledge of the basics of the game and the teams that are playing you can already assume who can win. Though I guess if your friend wants to turn off his brain, then yea simple games like dice and slots would work. Probably the thrill of finding something new imo, I reckon he'd come back to sports after a few months.",

On the other hand, if he is aware then maybe he is following some tips and not doing his own analysis and that's why he says its more complicated. Perhaps the only logical explanation is that maybe h is a bitcoiner after all and wanted to be paid in BTC.And again, it should be the other way around, from online casinos->sports betting because the odds is greatly increased on our favor.",
