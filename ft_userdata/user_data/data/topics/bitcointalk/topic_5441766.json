As you said, the uniqueness of Bitcoin stems from its origins and the vision of its anonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. and very different from the traditional profit-driven financial system. Yes, that's right, Satoshi's intentions are focused on solving financial problems and benefiting humanity and my personal views. This led to the creation of a decentralized system that operates on the basis of consensus and authenticity where Bitcoin's pioneering status matters a lot, but more importantly, it addresses critical gaps in time, space, privacy and security.",

Yeah, it has its short comings in terms of volatility, confirmation time and its not accessible without network but, other coins out there share some of these attributes and if they have enjoyed much time as bitcoin has or were any good, they could have as well swelled the cryptospace but no.Non have been able to come close but instead, watch from a distance.

      "body": "When Bitcoiners are asked this question, I think everyone should have one special thing to say, although @Snadra_hakeem rounded it up in a Nute shell. But come on, for me, Bitcoin is unique because it's the only crypto that has made many people millionaires yet has never collapsed. Why I said this is because most altcoins have had their all-time low at their very early stages, but at some point, for many people that purchase the coin during the ATL, if they are lucky and the token price gets pumped and they make their first millions, there is a high chance that the coin will not get pumped again. I have tracked a lot of altcoin's price history, of which, since their first ATH, the price has gone to the bottom and has been so for more than 3, 4, and 6 years, respectively. After seeing the price history of those coins and looking at Bitcoin price history, the price of Bitcoin always turns out with a new ATH during some bull run, and that is what almost all altcoins have not been doing. Altcoins get pumped and dumped, and that's the end of it. In the next season, they get replaced with other new altcoins, but Bitcoin is static.Cheers ü•Ç, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange üë∫üë∫",

It's a masterpiece.¬†Every transaction is recorded in a ledger without the need of third-parties. Lots of things happening around the existence of bitcoin shows that it's a surprise package to the world. I definitely agree with your statement- what makes BTC unique is that it frees people from their transaction. This is also the reason on why others call it \"financial freedom\" where people can freely transfer products from anyone without any restrictions.The problem with the modern world is that institutions and third-party programs always interfere with it. For example, you cannot freely transfer cash from one account to another since it has go through the screening process in order to prevent fraud. Though this kind of reason is acceptable, sometimes, government interference becomes too much to the point that it makes it restrictive.This is the reason on why Satoshi envisioned BTC to be financial freedom- where everything is transparent and reflected in a public ledger (which can be accessed by anyone).",
