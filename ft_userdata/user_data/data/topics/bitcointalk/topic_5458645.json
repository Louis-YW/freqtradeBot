  "content": "It's not easy to get started, and there are always new things to learn. When you're just starting out, you think that the safest way to buy BTC is on a CEX. Indeed, the place may seem safe and everything is well explained. But you'll have to hand over a lot of documents, and you don't necessarily want to do that (and what's more, you don't have your private keys).The little bot here accessible on telegram is pretty easy and fun. It works with BTC lightning, so you'll need to have what I call a hybrid wallet (on-chain and lihtning) like breez for example. Then the bot will act as an escrow between you and a seller/buyer. You can place an ad or spot one and make a proposal. FIAT offers a wide range of transaction methods, including Revolut, Bizum, Wise, Paypal etc... It can be useful and simple to use this bot for small transactions, because in the end there's nothing to download (as with Bisq) and it's easy to understand. There are probably tutorial videos on the net in your language. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them.",

The bot doesn't need to have any reserve as it is only an escrow.I don't understand why there should be a CEX in the interactions either, since it's P2P. The buyer sends the shitfiats, the seller sends the satoshis, the robot acts as escrow and when everyone has received what they want, they type in the /release command and that's it.When the seller receives the shitfiats, the bank doesn't know what he's bought.",

Such as OKX and Houbi exchange etc.Plus we can make p2p transactions on many decentralized exchanges where we will not be asked for documentation such as bisq and peachbitcoin and localmonero etc. And the there is less availability of such bot in countries like mine where we do not have the facilities to use paypal etc. We only prefer to use what is easily accessible. Plus who have made this bot (like whom to refer when things went upside).",

(I hope you don't take it personal, these are just my sincere observations, and I will like to be clarify)Hello,I discovered this bot with \"decouvre bitcoin\" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouZk05HfSnE),  which offers free courses on bitcoin. It's a serious team that explains things really well (in several languages).yes I've already sold sats without any problem, but as I was focused on the process, I didn't write down the fees. Then I have to say that currently my wallet breez doesn't seem to work properly and the sats seem blocked, but it should resolve.Otherwise for scams, I don't know, I guess it must exist like everywhere?I think it's great that we're talking about it together, that's what a forum is all about and maybe there are things I don't understand, it's good to be able to talk about them.,",
