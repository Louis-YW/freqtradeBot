  "content": "Personality and reasoning vary but I will say my mind. And to avoid drawing the attention of external people on the forum, I will not put @name.I'm dragged into this because I wrote a topic on the meta section (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449138.0) on Monday tackling what a legendary rank member (I didn't want to tag such) wrote about AI-generated content. This was because a very good writer could be affected by his detection-suggested approach. The reply of people however encouraged me to do a little detective task on the forum on this subject for the first time, and sincerely, I'm not happy with my investigation.70% of the 10 accounts tested guilty (though new ones) have identified with us by writing on our board. After using AI-detection sites and ChatGPT, I still proceeded to carefully study the posts manually to deliver my verdict. The plagiarism is much even as some of these posts had already been declared AI-generated by other users before me. I find this implicating, and I advise us to stop it.I'm not accusing anybody, yet it's obvious, the little way we can behave ourselves and uphold the image of the country should be utilised. We all abuse politicians and others here, craving for a change, but are we good ambassadors too?You will be surprised that some of these people are even more brilliant and vast than those that write well by themselves. But laziness and trying to cheat and outsmart everywhere they find themselves make them do it.Let's stop the selfish and I-don't-care attitude that has cost us and our country so much pain.Thanks!",

I do not use any AI because I know the English I was taught in school with the little that I can use to communicate is enough for even a native English person to understand what I am communicating which is all that matters to me. I am 0% dependent on AI.",

So on that note I will advise those who think they are not that good in English to download this app called \"Grammarly\", as it will go a long way in helping improve your English writing, which is more safer and better than using an A.I assistant.",

Even to an extent Satoshi offering some free-will donation for our newbies and member ranks to increase their posting format in other to be qualify and whomever that posts very good will be rewarded according to thread. So i wonder why will any of us try using AI to post or even create content. As a matter of fact, i try my possible best to use a common english language that will be easily to reader by everyone, The arm of english language is for us to be able to communicates one another and if that is being achieved i don't know why people should go extra-mile trying to explore AI to please or satisfy the reader. To me english in Nigeria is a borrowed Language and all we should do is to be able to effectively communicate here without any tools or pleasing the reader, I myself don't use any tools to write despite the level of my education yet i still try my best to create and communicate with people, even seeing people here says my posts are not quality enough yet i didn't get discouraged any way.",

One reason I feel Nigerians always get bad representation is the fact of not being credible, always looking to outsmart the system. What if we infuse pidgin English into our posts, will that show it is not AI generated or will it make it more authentic?What if we use AI generated topics or replies to questions we ask and remake a post to our advantage, will that also be called cheating or call for bad rep? What gets me concerned the most is the deregatory remarks made by fellow Nigerians about the offices of government and their personnel or other bodies, infact, If we say nothing bad or become abusive,  we would have presented or projected the entire nation in a positive light.

You can easily spot these accounts creating topics everywhere on the forum. And I don’t think the use of AI was because of a language barrier, it’s not a valid excuse.  Anyone who can prompt an AI must be literate and Nigeria is a English speaking country. Some of these accounts have been reported a couple of times for plagiarism, the sad part is that they have written some posts here in our board (some are plagiarized posts as well) so it makes me wonder why should one feel the need to copy content to post in his own local board.",

If any nation or people are suppose to be doing this, it certainly shouldn't be us Nigerians. Nobody needs your big grammers in the forum so far as the message you are trying to pass can be understood by others, you are good to go and you can definitely participate in every area of the forum so I see no reason or use for AI.
