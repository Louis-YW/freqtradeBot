      "body": "Our clients:We cater for the people with experience in webshops like eBay, Amazon, shopify, Etsy and all those 3rd party apps thoiught to make selling easier.Starting as a small online shop on Etsy, Ebay and Co. is surely not a bad good idea. A cheap homepage also serves its purpose, just as did Steve Jobs' garage once did. But as the store evolves, it's time to break new ground. It is useless to build another \"garage\", or just about plug-ins to expand the shop. You need a new building that is suitable for your purposes.As a rule, you now also need access to the shop's database. Furthermore, you should be able to react quickly to the requirements of the market and integrate popular payment systems into the shop. The once so wonderfully suitable off-the-shelf online shop can no longer keep up. That is where we come in. We have done updates from PHP 4 to 8. repaired Shops, moved them and much more. You need examples? Drop us a PM.",
