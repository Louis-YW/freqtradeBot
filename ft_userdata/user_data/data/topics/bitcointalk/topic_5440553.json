Because if they are from one country even in different states, the receiver of the coin might probably buy it from them. So as for me this accusation is not water tight accusation. But if there is any other information about the accumulator which is connected to the other users, you can equally present it. As it is I take it as p2p transaction and that is one of the core mandate of bitcoin.As I said I am not arguing with you, but I am looking it from the purpose of bitcoin.

The address is not very active but is quite old (there are transactions which are 175 days old shown in the last 25 bep-20 token transactions list by the given address). Some BNB tranfers are even more older than this (300days+). I assume by the transfer style, it is a main wallet of a user for storing and spending his coins; and is not a p2p trading address, neither an exchange address.",

You really don't need to portrait a character of a merit hunter. Many people will not like it and some day they will start digging you and will give you unnecessary troubles why you will make finding scam accusations, finding alt accounts as your full time job here.There are many ways to earn merits. Share your knowledge, not everyone is expert in everything. You must have some specialty that you know better than anyone else. Learn bitcoin technology, seek questions on the technical boards, learn how to keep your wallet safe, share the methods of securing your bitcoin. Know the forum rules and when anyone seems confuse guide them and help them. Be friendly with everyone. Most of all spend time in the community.",
