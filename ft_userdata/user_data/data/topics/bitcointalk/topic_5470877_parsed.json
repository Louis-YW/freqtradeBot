      "body": "Thank you, @pakhitheboss, for introducing this exchange. It's great to see a non KYC P2P exchange for INR, which can help protect our KYC information. it should be noted that it is still in its early stages and has some limitations, such as high minimum withdrawal amounts, only supports Polygon blockchain for deposits, etc. Many of our questions were answered in the FAQ section of the website.",

      "body": "I have few points to make: 1) Although there is no kyc from exchange itself, you'll still have to show it to from whom you purchase or sell, at least this is what I get from faq, CMIIW. 2) Their way of stopping impersonation fraud is to limit transaction value to $100, one can still get scammed for $100, how is that a solution? 3) Trying the app: I'm not too sure how it works tbh. Downloaded the app, no information was asked whatsoever, I created buy order for testing's sake, app accepted it, it and it asked me to send money to merchant, I didn't send it cause I don't trust it enough. Their 10 minute timer also keeps replenishing itself forever, what's the point of it then? If someone has guts to try their service, please share your experience.",

Well, at least they are trying to limit the losses. I like this approach though. I know it's not a full proof solution but it's better to lose $100 than $1000.QuoteTheir 10 minute timer also keeps replenishing itself forever, what's the point of it then? Â That's a red flag for me. There's no point if the trade remains active forever. May be it's a bug from their end.There are no google reviews which makes it even harder to trust.",

All the USDT buyers have been selected after a thorough investigation. I would recommend you to check with the admins of their telegram channel. Whatever information I got was from their telegram channel and from their admins. As I have already said I am not representing the exchange nor I have been paid to write this post. I wrote it to make the Indian community aware of another exchange and It is your choice to to either use it or ignore it.",
