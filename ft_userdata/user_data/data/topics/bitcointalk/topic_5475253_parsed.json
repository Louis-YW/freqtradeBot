They can't be a backbone of any sort of financial revoultion.As for the great reset, it's just a hype narrative for promoting cryptocurrencies. The governments will never allow this to happen and they have all the power they need to stop it. And they won't hesitate to use that power if they will start seeing crypto as a threat.",

Neither can everyone jump into \"NFTs\" or use crypto currencies as mainstream curreny. You are suggesting people to use USDT, BUSD, USDC and other stable coins. You do know that those coins are also somewhat centralized? The USDT and the USDC that you are talking about are in fact backed by fiat USD currency. So if fiat goes down, so does the stable coins.",

Crypto owners might save the world in return they get the assets like real estate. The question is, is the NFT you currently own still worthy of being a promising store of value?In my opinion, it is more effective to store wealth assets in property or in Bitcoin. The Fed doesn't need to bother using crypto as a bailout because as long as the financial system they currently have is profitable, it doesn't matter whether conditions are good or not because bad conditions don't apply to the Fed. The impact is only felt by society, but if sensible people still have debts in the bank and we still need fiat to pay for a slice of pizza then who is the stupidest?",

However, the government is starting to shyly enter the world of blockchain by creating a CBDC, which is actually a step that makes the government closer to crypto. They are just embarrassed to admit that crypto and bitcoin also interest them. So they try to match this by creating a CBDC. But actually it's just the same thing as regular fiat. It's just that transactions are easier to track because they use a blockchain system. The current centralized banking system is not doing well. But the government has always been able to fix it so far. It's just that what needs to be improved now is the world economy and the humanitarian crisis which is increasingly being ignored. The current economy is slowly continuing to decline. Even fiat becomes more volatile when compared with other countries' currencies. Which means that the economy of all countries is currently far from stable. Everything is in shock and is trying to survive so as not to be knocked down (inflation).",

This is because many governments have not legalized the use of crypto as a means of payment. The government could use crypto as a bailout but that is still waiting for its time.Indeed, state assets can be taken by foreign military forces. But the government will definitely not let that happen. They will definitely protect their assets from takeover by foreign military forces. Yes, the fact is that even now, there are still many people who trust the government. Because after all, we live in a country that has a government that regulates everything.Like it or not, that is what happens in many countries. We can only accept it. But we are lucky that the government still allows us to use crypto as an investment. And that is what we must use for our benefit.
