      "body": "You should make your intentions very clear; if you need poker players who will help you test your betting site, you should say so. I don't understand what you actually mean by \"staking\" a player on weekly payment. Or you are trying to say that your selected players will be paid on a weekly basis.Â You should drop more details instead of just a Telegram user ID, and I believe you will get volunteers from here.",
