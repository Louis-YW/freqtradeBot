However, the community is reporting the losses could be even greater.The attack appears to have been meticulously planned, with the attackers sending malicious ERC-20 tokens to 73,399 addresses in order to steal their assets. MetaMask security researcher Harry Denley was one of the first to raise the alarm bells of the attack, telling his 13,000 Twitter followers on Monday that the scam was underway.This is yet another reminder of the importance of being vigilant when it comes to cryptocurrency trading and managing your digital assets.",

And now he find again another potential exploit to same exchange that he reported same abused? This is really interesting.",

Or is it just on random phishing with a fake website? It seems like something which most serious DeFI should be able to easily avoid and warn their Liquidity Providers against, ahead of time.In fact, that so much money was stolen is testament to the absurd security ignorance which some DeFI platforms choose to not care about until its too late.Hopefully we will see some responsibility and some new measures implemented to avoid something like this happening again.",

I noticed the account is new, so he may not be familiar with the forum rules. I believe that if he noticed something and wants to write about it, he should include a source link where he saw it so that anyone who wants to read more about it can easily visit the site. I could be wrong, but I believe that if he noticed it, he should have added a link of where he saw it.",

Yeah, it's important to be updated at most times.With cryptocurrency usage users need to be more cautious than using the traditional system. With time we could see more and more forms of scam approach through which hackers breach into the wallets and take control over the funds. Initially it started with phising websites and now we don't know in what way they're attacking. So, in a each and everytime we use cryptocurrency we need to be very careful handling it.",
