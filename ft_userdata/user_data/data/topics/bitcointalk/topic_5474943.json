  "content": "Binance CEO CZ has just shamefully resigned today and pleaded guilty to fraud and money laundering violations. His company will also be forced to pay a whopping $4.3B fine.For years, he claimed anyone who criticized him or his corrupt exchange are spreading \"FUD\" - but turns out,  it was all truthful. We have over 480+ tweets and articles mentioning the fraudulent practices of Binance. We were attacked left and right by the maxi mob, but, as per usual - Time proved us right, again.Source: https://twitter.com/WhaleWire/status/1727017951230894441Trending Sources: https://twitter.com/search?q=Binance&src=trend_click&vertical=trends",
