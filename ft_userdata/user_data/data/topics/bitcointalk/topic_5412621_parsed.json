BBC sourceAfter the two years it's unclear what will happen but oil is a very sporadic industry and extra production can be set up in the North Sea as well as other countries being able to compete with the current supplies if they become more stable/less sanctioned in that time. There's also renewables such as wind which would be a reliable source of electricity in most of North West Europe (aside from a few weeks of sunny days every year).The new prime minister about to be sworn in has been criticised for being out of touch with normal people and for chasing as much money as she can so this is an interesting start.",

Some countries share/steal each others bills too so they might be able to function off that for the rest of her term.

Fingers crossed.It's a big problem and one that might cost more if it isn't fixed - in things like healthcare.Quote from: hugeblack on September 06, 2022, 05:06:35 PMHow much is the current bill? This number is exaggerated in my average country, it is from 300 dollars, and even luxury villas do not reach this amount.When the cap was £1300 my house was estimated to be using £900 and I paid  about £600 a year so yes the numbers are a bit weird. Some old people will pay a lot more because they'll need the heating. I could warm myself up pretty well with a jumper and a hot drink on a day when it was cooler than expected (like -15C)...

It doesn't have much debt compared to other countries so that might be something that could be temporarily exploited.Most of the covid support was spending from reserves (and I'm not sure if that's the same as other countries or not).",

They are making vast profits right now with energy prices peaking and hundreds of millions of Europeans are getting screwed over for a relatively small amount of investors. Norway had the right idea all this time with the creation of a sovereign wealth fund, where oil profits are invested for the long term benefit of citizens of the country instead of short term payouts that only help the rich get richer. Even if it was just a temporary/emergency take over until the Russian war on Ukraine is sorted, it would seem like the best solution than going for a huge loan that doesn't help the underlying problem longer term.",

I don't know about any counties(other than Russia) that will increasing gas supply if they are \"less sanctioned\".3.Renewable energy is still pretty expensive, because building and installation of wind turbines in the North Sea is expensive.4.Subsidizing the oil and gas prices for the small consumers and small businesses is a short term solution, but the British national debt is about to hit unprecedented levels.5.The populist policy of \"The rich have to pay more\" makes sense in such situation, but the rich can just take their money/financial assets and leave the UK.There's no easy solution.",

Fingers crossed.Liz Truss won a very close race with Rishi Sunak to become the new Prime Minister. She promised a lot of things, and some of those promises look difficult to implement. And in the next general elections, her party will lose no matter how much she perform. The gap between Labour and Conservative Party is just too wide at this moment and I don't think that they will be able to close that gap before 2024. On top of that, Keir Starmer is much more popular when compared to either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak. A Labour-SNP coalition is likely post-2024.",

This will be an important debate for the government, not only for those on low incomes but for everyone in the country. We should all look forward to what the outcome will be and hope there is some thought for the future. I'm confused as to why they don't build wind turbines in North West England, or in Cornwall and that seems to have been discussed for a long time.",

I believe the privatization of the energy sector is a bad step taken by the government. I used too work for \"British Gas\" long back and I was really surprised to see the increase of more than 10% yoy basis. This is not sustainable and has to stop by the government. I am happy that finally UK government and its new PM has taken a serious look at it and taken measures to stop it. It will put some extra pressure on the UK Treasury but if that's going to provide some relief to the common people, that's what is needed!",

Britain, as well as the EU, will survive this winter with a slight decrease in the quality of heating and, possibly, some decrease in industrial production. But for the next winter, everyone will already come out with an optimized consumption of gas and oil, with alternative sources of supplies (to diversify ristos), and the Kremlin's gas and oil terror will end there. Now ask yourself the question - what will a terrorist country do with a huge amount of gas and oil that no one needs?  But nothing - they will globally degrade and collapse, because the government is kleptomaniac terrorists, the population has been reduced to the level of cattle, and the government does not care about it. Write down this forecast and in 2-3 years compare the state of Russia in autumn 2022 and in autumn, for example, 2024 ... This is if Russia, as a single state, remains united",

Of course, the UK isn't reliant on Russian energy sources, but the global market is affected by the pricing set by its actors and by what consumers are willing to pay (with consumers being countries, not people, of course).Freezing the rates can be tricky for the future but can help people struggling with bills this winter. Maybe there can be a better short-term solution, but I don't know what it can be. And the long-term solution should be moving away from gas and oil anyway.",

The government could have taken over BP at fair market value, secured reliable access to all of their oil and gas licenses and really thought about benefiting the country long term. Norway has done it for years and grown very rich off responsibly managing their oil reserves for the benefit of all their people, instead of just the few. Alternatively they could have imposed a windfall tax on these producers, who's costs have not gone up, but their profits have skyrocketed due to the war the Putin started in Ukraine this year - they do not deserve this naked profiteering.",

When you put that ball in the government's court, companies are forced to foot the bill for a consumer that uses more energy than they're allowed to charge for with hopes the government will hold true to their promise to reimburse. I don't anticipate this to be an issue with the UK government, I just don't believe this should be the roadmap for Europe's energy crisis.
