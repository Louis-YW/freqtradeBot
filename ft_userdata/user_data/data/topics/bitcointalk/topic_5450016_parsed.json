      "body": "I'm guessing you don't have your seed phrase? Since want to know if the wallet file is encrypted, try to open it using notepad.If you see random characters that you don't understand -> file is encrypted.If you see your addresses and everything, scroll down to \"xpriv\". If its value starts with \"xpriv\" you're good, if it's anything else, it also means your private keys are encrypted.I couldn't find much about the error you mentioned, but assuming this is a compatibility issue, you should be able to read the wallet using an older version.",

Or else It would end up corrupted to the point where there's no way to recover it.Based on the error it seems Electrum is trying to decode the wallet but failed.Would you mind completing the error and post it again here I would like to try to search it on Google if there is someone who has a similar issue.",
