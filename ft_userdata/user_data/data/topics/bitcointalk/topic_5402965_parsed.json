I think it's only a matter of popularity and first move advantage that USDT is still the top stable coin for now. Circle has also proven that USDC is fully backed by a Dollar when they hired a reputable Auditing Firm called Grant Thornton. They issue a monthly report where the public can verify if the 1:1 claim is true. It should be the same case with EUROC.",

I wonder how the Euro stablecoin and the digital euro (CBDC) will coexist. Hopefully, this will not serve as a reason to restrict the use of euro stablecoin by the euro union and the central bank.",

Eurocoin release will not be a major news event, so don't expect a large market growth. Circle is more reliable than Tether and other algorithmic stablecoins, and this Eurocoin release gives investors more choices when holding stablecoins.",

There are already too many stablecoins on the market. I don't understand why anyone sees any prospects in EURO?",

We saw what happened when UST lost its peg, the whole crypto market came crashing down so Circle announcing a Euro Coin doesn’t fill me with any great hope or bullishness.  I think there is a reason behind why UST lost its peg.  And I think UST has different mechanism than those of USTD and USDC.  Looking at this article[1] we can clearly see the difference between USDT and USTQuoteTerraUSD (UST) is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin that underpins the Terra (LUNA) blockchain.UST is pegged to the US dollar in an attempt to maintain its value at USD 1. However, unlike centralized stablecoins, UST isn’t backed by dollar reserves in a bank account. Instead, to mint a UST token, users pay USD 1 worth of LUNA, which acts as TerraUSD’s reserve asset. while  Tether Limited,USDT was designed to be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This means while the price of other cryptoassets fluctuates, USDT’s price usually stands around USD 1. See the difference between the UST and USDT. USDT and USDC has almost the same system of pegging to dollar 1:1. Though in terms of credibility, I believe USDC is much more stable than USDT because Centre complies with audits and governmental regulation, and has more transparent, fully-backed reserves.[1] https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/usdt-vs-usdc-vs-ust-how-do-they-compare.htm",

The time-tested mechanism of USDC functioning does not require additional innovations, which will be transferred to the new EUROC stablecoin.I would argue about the claim that the USDC is fully backed by the dollar. Since the last audit, this claim has been questioned and even Circle itself has amended its website to say:QuoteEach USDC is backed by one dollar or asset with equivalent fair value, which is held in accounts with US regulated financial institutions.In essence, they are writing that each of their tokens is backed not only by a dollar, but also by an asset of equivalent value. By this you can mean various securities, bonds, etc. Actually, I read somewhere that USDC has no more than 60% real fiat collateral, the rest is all in securities.",
