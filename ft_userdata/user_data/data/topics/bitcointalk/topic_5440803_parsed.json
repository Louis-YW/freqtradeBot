Everyone should have a savings where these funds can be used when there is an emergency, but if we spend it just for a moment's pleasure it doesn't feel necessary to do it especially just to buy an expensive drink at a famous restaurant it will only be a waste of the money we collect, right? means not allowed but more to where the needs that must be prioritized. Avoiding financial problems is one way to relieve stress and reduce the burden of life.",

Because everyone who is always self-aware does not spend a lot of money on things that are not needed as you describe, of course they will save money on expenses that are more important and will ignore things that are not important for their lives.So regarding how to spend this money, actually everyone needs to look at the amount of their income every month and classify every important expense that they have to spend every month and stay away from things that are not important for themselves, because they can still live frugally without having to eating at a fancy bar surrounded by women who weren't his wife. So only themselves can be blamed for this because other people have no right to be blamed and linked to this kind of thing.",

I can not provide any statisitics but I am sure that many people have fallen in the trap and can not get out.  I hope you are not one of them.Life is all about choice. People tend to spend their money on what is important to them. But I totally agree with your examples on how people spend money on what they don't necessarily need. Recently, I was guilty of this wasteful spending. I did a monthly Netflix subscription and I just watched one movie for less than three hours because I had no time to watch movies. I regretted this financial waste and will never try it again.Many people claim that their earnings is not enough but they can afford to buy several bottles of beer for friends in a bar. They would buy shoes or clothing that they don't even need. I have a friend that bought five pair of shirts and forget that he bought anything like that. He later saw the shirts wrapped inside his wardrobe after seven months. He doesn't really need them. If you are a low or average income earners, the only way you can save is to spend on mostly basic needs and avoid spending for fun or pleasure. Food, clothing, housing and other important expenses should be paramount. Others can be set aside until ones income has been diversified or increased.",

      "body": "Please don't mistake the people who are financially irresponsible with the \"working poor\" members of the working class. There's a definition of \"working poor\" in Wikipedia. You can check it out. There are people, who aren't making any irresponsible financial decisions(like buying expensive coffee, smoking, drinking alcohol, having gym memberships), but they still don't make enough money from their job to make ends meet. Who is to be blamed in that situation? The people, who are working in such low paying jobs(because they lack education and skills to get a better job) or the labor market/employers/the government? I think that everyone can be blamed for the harsh conditions of the \"working poor\". The workers have to educate themselves and develop better skills, the employers have to pay higher salaries and the government has to create a better environment for the businesses to grow and make more money.",

The gym or dating are activities that are actually easy to get disqualified from the expense list when someone realizes that their financial condition is declining instead of complaining first.I agree with you that the example given is something we can clearly judge without difficulty. How is it possible with their complaints about financial conditions, they are still doing that. This is no longer their complaint in my opinion, but more how it is difficult for him to let go of the lifestyle he has lived so far that has made his financial condition worse.I also have an environment that always complains about their financial situation, but their condition is caused by themselves, I mean it's not funny when they complain about finances but they are reluctant to try to at least get a job? I understand that finding a job is very difficult now, but if we just stay quiet what can we expect? Waiting for a miracle?",

And it would be stupid when they actually spend like that in the midst of a very difficult economy. Rich people may not be too worried when they behave extravagantly because their main needs have been met, but still they shouldn't do it even though they can do it because they have a good economic condition.I'm not anti-entertainment or anything else, because I also do it once with the intention of appreciation for what I do every day, but I do it for a certain period, it can be once a month or even once every 3 months.",

I'd only ever give out the idea of buying those type of things when you're really comfortable with the amount of money you get. People may argue that it's a sort of \"enjoyment\" part of your finance, but really, you'd only ever have that sort of part in your wallet if you didn't have problems with money, aka as I said, comfortable with the amount of money you get.",

For me, going to the gym will be mandatory, just because I will pay for it. Going for a morning jog on your own is always rejected by the desire to sleep longer. A cup of coffee drunk in a nearby café is also defining the coming day.In fact, of course, you can deprive yourself of everything. But a person gets used to the good very quickly, and it is almost impossible to wean oneself from it. Therefore, allocating your finances in advance for vacations, closing loans, renting a home, and even investing will be the best choice. But the younger we are, the weaker we are at educating ourselves. But time teaches, and I think that with age, many begin to understand that some pleasures can really be deprived of themselves.",
