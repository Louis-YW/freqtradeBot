      "body": "In common sense, I think hard work is more like working in an office that requires the employees to go to work at 7:30 a.m. (or 8am) and return home by 5 or 6 p.m., depending on where they are working, but smart work is more like those that work at home right on their phones or computers, and yet on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, they always have money that flows into their accounts, and most of the smart workers don't need less time, less energy, or less stress to perform their online jobs in order to get paid. I know of a freelancer and an affiliate marketer who make about $1k to $2k every month and some months more. The fact is that some people who are going from their homes to work every day and closing late are not earning even up to what some of these affiliate marketers are earning. Another example are most of these social media celebrities who make some funny and educational skits and get paid daily.",

The hardest labor and jobs are no longer the highest paying jobs, people sit at home and make the total money for a year that just a hard worker and not a smart worker can make. For sure, I agree with you that smart workers make more money than hard workers. When you discover this, the first thing you have to look out for is, “Why is this thing happening?” The main reason why this is happening is because of the high number of people who engage in the work. For instance, let us take tailoring as a case study. The number of tailors in Nigeria now is so large that almost everyone knows not less than five different tailors around their location. You know, all of them can sew clothes, which means they are hardworking, but inside them there will be someone who will create a good fashion design that no one else inside the tailors can do unless they are taught, so from there that single tailor has made a smart move that he will get more money than others. The solution here is that whatever work you are doing, you should make sure you are creative so that you can be smarter than others doing the same work with you.QuoteLife expectancy for Nigerians dey short because of bad health care and poor environment, we nor need to add stress to am, make we for nor go die quick. While we dey try to make money, we gats focus majorly on finding smartways to make money, not just depending on harwork, Hardwork alone no longer incurs success. To me, life expectancy depends on your location of settlement, and I don’t think it contributes to your topic. Life expectancy means, in short, your access to those things that will make your life more safe and healthy, like an adequate water supply, a good road, adequate health care providers, the availability of light, and many others that can ensure adequate safety and standard in your life. So with this small definition, I can say that if you work smart, you can have money in rapid flow and have access to all these things.QuoteSome examples of smart ways to make money are;be social and make good friends who you can grow with.

Share some other smart ways to make money.Yes, keeping friends that are ready to look for more is a good option because any time you hang around, they will just be discussing where to invest so that their money can be multiplied, so if you stay around with them, you will have more experience and knowledge about making money. Also, I will suggest involving yourself in many online activities, like creating content and advertising content on various social media. All you need is to be creative, and you will get paid, so I will say creativity works with smartness, and that is what we need to succeed in Nigeria.",

You're right, smartness requires hardwork before it can work as if you don't work hard your efforts may just be limited, you wont go extra miles to makes things work out well for you. Okay let's take for example now this forum that we are in do you think it's an easy task? Sometimes before you post here you will first of all go through other people topics and comment to see that you don't copy another person. Do you think it's easy? What about campaign Jobs, you need good and quality post before your campaign manager can retain you in his campaign is it easy to make good and constructive posts here? So you will find out that most of us here go extra miles to do research about things before we unleash it to the public. Some of us spend hours to make constructive and informative topics before we post it so there is no easy road to success, every successful person works real hard, okay what about now other people are enjoying there sleep but we are awake looking for a way to meet up our targets here. Isn't that hardwork?",

I think we have had a discussion similar to this although they aren't entirely the same because this is heading towards another direction but both threads are in relation to hardwork and smart work. The main thing wey make hardwork dun dey outdated na say e dey limit your earnings, hardwork wey be physical work go make am you no go fit dey make money from multiple sources and to survive for Nigeria you need multiple sources of income. Hardwork if you ask me na all dis 9-5 works wey be say e dey start by 9 and go end by 5 everyday without giving you the opportunity to do other things.

Hard work joined together with our poor environment has been a serious challenge to our health but since there is jo other way and their is no job opportunity in the country we just have to take the risk.
