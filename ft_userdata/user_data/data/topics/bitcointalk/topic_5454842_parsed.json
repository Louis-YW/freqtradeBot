      "body": "To have an idea about the mining pool to join, check the latest blocks that are mined and check the mining pools that mined it. Then you can make more research about which one will be most profitable for you. Mining pools in relation to the latest mined blocks: https://mempool.space/blocksYou will need a powerful miners too, there are single miners that can generate up to or more than 100 Th/s. Example are the S19 series like S19 Pro. Antminer S3 can only generate 478 Gh/s which is somehow small and the reward would be small too. 478 Gh/s is not up to 0.5 Th/s.",

Your reward is 6.25 BTC (+ tx fees) or nothing. And if you take 0.5 Th/s on SoloChance.com, it gives you the following estimation :Between 12000 and 13000 years with an average luck, so your chances of getting a reward are small. You can keep mining on solo.ckpool.org if you want like a lottery ticket. You can be very luck and have a block. Or you could earn nothing at all.If you want to earn some sats, you can always try to mine on ViaBTC, at least they pay the transaction fees to the miners.I hope that you pay very low amount per kw/h, because the S3 is not the top ASIC regarding efficiency.",

All the best.Another other way to look at this is moder gear the s19 with 1 board not 3 set to low speed will pull 700 watts and do 27000gh or 27than s9 set to 1/3 speed will pull 400 watts and do 4700 gh or 4.5 th a s3 set to full speed pulls pulls 380 watts and does 400gh  or  0.4 thso 27 x 7 cents = $1.89 a dayand 4.5 x 7 cents = 31.5 cents a dayand .4 x 7 cents = 2.8 cents a day.so in 100 days if power is free you have $2.80 USD700 days if power is free you have $19.60 USD so not a good unit to mine with",

BEFORE you pay for electricity.To put it another way, if you mine at a non solo pool you will make about $0.01 a day so about 2000 days to cover the $20 you spent.If it's just to learn about mining that is OK, but don't think you will ever make money.-Dave",
