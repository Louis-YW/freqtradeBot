  "content": "The Premier League is the best league in the world and also the most competitive league every season,so it is difficult to predict which team will win.Likewise with the top scorer, it is difficult to predict who will come out as the top scorer at the end of the season,because almost every team has a striker who is hungry for goals. So your prediction is who will be the top scorer for the 2022-2023 season?1.M.Salah2.Erling Haaland3.Harry Kaneor players like Jamie Vardy, Darwin Nunez and Gabriel Jesus who are also potential top scorers.",

For me this season I go for haaland.",

You only mentioned few but I checked for potential highest goal scorer this season and 19 players already listed though with Haaland as the top for now with 10 goals.",

The Manchester City midfielders are better than Tottenham's midfielders.That's right Marcus Rashford very productive for Manchester United, although it has only packed 3 goals scores but its performance is quite worthy of being one of the competitors, more candidates are more interesting rather than only three players.Regarding Haaland there is no doubt that he is the favorite maybe everyone is voted this man, because performance in scoring of goals is very talented, but who knows there are players who have managed to overtake him, I think in the Premier League still have a many great players.",

In fact, they are all good goal scorers. They are scoring goals in every match. There will be more competition between them in a few days. They play their best for their team and score goals that boost their individual careers.",

Erling scored 10 goals in 6 games. I think it's a difficult achievement for any player in the Premier League to match.Moh Salah may still lag behind other competitors. that's because Liverpool's performance was not so good at the start of the season. I hope to see Salah perform as scary as last season.",

He is the good attacker who utilized every given opportunity he gets and the best asset Manchester City could have this season after the just concluded transfer market. So if I'm to predict who may win the title of top goal scorer of the year, I think Erling Haaland is already halfway their haven scored 10 goals in 6 matches,",

      "body": "I think that you should think of some other impressive strikers on the recent weeks as well. For example, you can add Fulham's Mitrovic to this list too. Mitrovic has been amazing against every kind of team so far. He scored against big teams like Tottenham (1 goal), Arsenal (1 goal) and Liverpool (2 goals) also. There is only one game he didn't score so far. He will of course have a big difficulty against a beast like Haaland but it wouldn't be surprising to see Mitrovic being in top 3 at the end of the season.When it comes to Salah, he is far ahead of his usual performance and has only 2 goals in the league now. As long as Liverpool don't pull themselves together he also wouldn't change much. But even after recovering his job is going to be difficult to catch up with the leader in the top scorers table. It seems like Haaland is the biggest favourite by a big difference against the rest of the scorers for now.",

Sincerely Halland is having it easy on this, because either the regular frontiers are having issues with there club or they are shadow of them.First is Sallah, two goals in six matches no one saw this coming but his goal drought has been caused by the switch of roles by Klopp. Sallah was the pointed man during his mane-firmino-sallah trident. But right now he does the hard work mane and firmino were doing before and this has also affected the entire Liverpool teamNext is Harry Kane, one thing with him is he is always cold at the start of a season then goes back to normal middle of the season. I was even surprised to see him score in his sacred month (August). But let's wait and seeAnother person is arguably the greatest player of all time (Ronaldo), he has found it hard to just settle into Ten Hag team and with age happening to him I don't see him catching up. But Hey its Ronaldo, nobody rules him out. So I will put him there.Another slow starter to the season is last season's winner Son, I feel he hasn't just been himself.So since Halland isn't going to the World Cup then the odds are surely for him to win it",
