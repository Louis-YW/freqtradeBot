Possibly to mitigate for small blocks?https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28715#msg28715December 10 2010 - Satoshi anticipates that the block size might get kept small to allow as many users and small devices as possiblehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28917#msg28917In August Satoshi seems confident that block size may be increased with no regards to size, eventually allowing micropayments as storage and bandwidth capacity improve over the years. Then in December, he hints that block size might remain small to allow as many users as possible. Did he then change his opinion on storage/bandwidth improvements in the future? I'm not sure what to make of this.",

Bitcoin has been a work in progress for a number of years.",

      "body": "A few things to consider.When Satoshi launched Bitcoin, it was not a perfect Currency.  It was not as greatly made as today.  The concept was still insane, but Satoshi was not a God.I see it in a different way.  It seems to me that Satoshi was open minded and knew the future Bitcoin will not look like the Bitcoin he released years prior.  So he came up with a lot of possibilities and solutions he thought of for each of them.  I believe he was more focused on what will realistically happen in the future and how the community will see Bitcoin instead of focusing on what he wants.Every time I read his posts, I see most of them as possibilities and solutions.  Like a third view over everything taking place.  Not personal opinions.  Even where you see opinions, they are constructive most of the time.Surprisingly, most of his ideas and thoughts eventually came true.  But since Bitcoin was not a perfect Currency, even if he did change his mind it is something to be expected.  As Bitcoin and its community evolved, he saw flaws he could not before.  He saw possibilities he could not before.  So, change is expected.-Regards,PrivacyG",
