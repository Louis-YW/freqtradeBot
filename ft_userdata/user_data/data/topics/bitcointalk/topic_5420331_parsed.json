  "content": "The WBC Convention is ongoing and one of its latest actions is issuing a mandatory for its welterweight champion Errol Spence against ex-unified champion Keith Thurman. Keith Thurman is the third-biggest name in the division right now. But as popular as Thurman is, he is not the same fighter anymore, in nearly 6 years, he only fought 3 times and he struggled in those fights. Thurman doesn't even deserve a top 5 ranking but the WBC is one of the best when it comes to business exploitations. This seems like a sweet save by the WBC so Spence can avoid undefeated young prospects Eimantas Stanionis and Boots Ennis. Both will be high-risk with low rewards for Spence but they are supposed to be the mandatories for his WBA and IBF belts. And who knows, Spence will be ready against WBO champion Terrence Crawford who's turning 36 next year.     Errol Spence: current WBA/WBC/IBF championPro record: 28-0-22 KOsKeith Thurman: ex-WBA/WBC championPro record: 30-1-22 KOs        This is not yet official but if Spence won't take this big easy fight, he will be stripped of his WBC belt and he might face either WBA or IBF mandatories the young and undefeated Stanionis or Boots. Spence can also move up to 154 and say goodbye to a possible undisputed fight against Crawford.My personal take. This fight will happen since this is a big fight and should be very easy for Spence. Spence should be able to stop this past-prime version of Thurman or at least win an easy unanimous decision if he wants to stay safe.",

Probably he won't last until the last round because Spence can preserve his power until the last round and Thurman can't take that many powerful punches especially if he takes many solid punches on his stomach and his chin.",

      "body": "It was said that Stanionis and Ennis will be among the undercard, they will definitely be watching who deserves to fight Spence when he wins against Thurman. Terrence is to fight Avanesyan by Dec this year. You can view this as a tuneup fight but the organization may also want to confirm if Terrence still has the punching power to defeat Spence. If it's the case, we'll not see Spence vs Crawford until he's near 40.",

Thurman is mandatory challenger so it will be a challenge for spence since he need to pick up that match to defend his belt. I don't think this is easy since Spence is at his prime also Thurman is so hungry for a win and saying he will do all just to get back the champions status under his name so provably we can see a great match here. Spence should not take Thurman easy because he's still have capability to win since his hunger could bring good motivation to perform very well.",

      "body": "Thurman has been inactive after his lost to Pacquiao, he went hiatus and then make a comeback fight against a balloon fighter that Tank Davis has defeated.Of course this is a much easier fight than Crawford vs Avenasyan, I mean David is a knock out puncher and it's riskier for Crawford if he is caught by that one Hail Mary punch. So this is a win win fight for Errol Spence and PBC since both are in the same stable anyway.If this fight is made years ago, when Thurman at his prime, then I will say it's 50/50. But not the version of Keith in 2023.",

But as others said, Thurman is not in shape and maybe he is no longer in his prime. But since he is the mandatory then Crawford will have to give him a chance to his belt.As far as Crawford vs Spence, not going to happen this year.Not sure though if I will be excited with this fight, but I will say could be one of the best setup fight next year in the Welterweight.",

He'd been ducking to fight Spence for years asking an incredible pay. He is in decline for years but the fight may last 12 rounds since he has a good tank. Somehow he was given a shot after defeating Barios.Crawford vs Spence is not happening, Crawford is now on a different network, and negotiation is off.",

But I guess the WBC is not keen on that idea, and so decided to have Thurman vs Spence.Well, nowadays sanctioning councils do not want to offend big promoters and networks, except probably on the IBF who usually insisted when it comes to its mandatories. But the WBA and WBC as the most corrupt sanctioning bodies in boxing are in constant talks with these big promoters and networks. Vergil Ortiz's title shot is long overdue but we cannot hear mandatory announcements because the WBA/WBC/IBF are with PBC while the WBO was then at Top Rank. Even PBC fighters, the WBA regular Eimantas Stanionis, and IBF mandatory Boots Ennis are sending and petitioning their respective sanctioning bodies to impose and execute their mandatory positions against Spence.

So we will see how Spence is going to adapt on Keith's style.This is a big fight indeed because Thurman is still very popular. But I don't think he is the same fighter, the only skill Thurman has these days is his loud mouth. But because he is popular, he is treated like a VIP, he continues to get big fights and title shots. He went inactive for 2 to 3 years but the corrupt WBA didn't even strip his title, the WBC stripped him though. Made a tune-up where he struggled, and was given a shot at Manny Pacquiao right away. Went inactive again then made a tune-up against a 140 guy who was knocked out in his last fight, Thurman backpedaled most of the fight which was supposed to be an easy KO for him. And then here we are WBC mandatory. I don't think Thurman will return to his usual prime form. He is already rich and unified 2 belts. That first long inactivity made him realize that life is too good to not enjoy while having the money to spend. I don't see his hunger anymore. His previous tune-up says it all. Spence should be able to stop him or cruise to an easy UD.",

It's off at least now, and it really feels hopeless for the fight to happen, but I know it will happen. Worse thing is, the fight will happen when they're out if their prime.

However, they are still in the collision course there, we have Charlo as the unified champion, but it will be interesting now if both will move up.And i guess if this is mandated by the world governing body that Spence is holding the belt, he can't refuse it unless he wants to abandon the belt and not fight his mandatory.
