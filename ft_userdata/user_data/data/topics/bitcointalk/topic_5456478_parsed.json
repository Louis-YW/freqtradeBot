It always does that for old compiled coins forked from bitcoin or litecoin version v0.8.7.5 or below.Compile yourself a wallet from litecoin at this version https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v0.8.6 and you will get same result.",

While the one from phloxcoin I actually had the same result between my own compiled wallet and the official one. So I know it's safe. And by experience I always get this situation when using an old fork from litecoin or Bitcoin.If you compile it yourself you will see. Compile Litecoin v0.8.7.5 too and you'll get same result, even with the official litecoin code.But yeah, it's better not to install or use it if you do not trust it, I am not saying people SHOULD download it and use it, I'm only saying that from my experience I know it's false positive. I encourage people to compile the wallet themselves.",
