I don't think the other countries do adopt altcoins, they are only want to create their own token aka CBDC, not an existed altcoins e.g. ETH, BNB, XMR, USDT, XRP etc.",

Don't say that because your country encourages you to use Altcoins then you invest in any altcoin you see, that will be bad practice. Bitcoins should remain your first choice when you consider an investment in cryptocurrency.",

The Central African Republic needs to be included under El Salvador, while many other countries with the world's largest economies are still wary of the risks from crypto assets, the Central African Republic surprisingly formalizes Bitcoin as a means of payment.Canada is also worth considering, this country has a friendly approach to Bitcoin. Canada views Bitcoin as a commodity that can be traded by regulators in that country.",

      "body": "I think giving some reasoning for your list (and other lists being shared here) would be better instead of just listing names. If we want to be stricter we also need to make a standard on what do we mean by encouraging revolution. Does doing research on cryptocurrency technology counts? Does having an education program focused on crypto count? What is on the opposite end of encouraging the revolution, is it banning Bitcoin from being traded, or blocking any access to crypto information such as Bitcoin whitepaper? Etc. If there is no clear line then everyone will arbitrarily agree on one thing and disagree on the other. So far though, what I can see is that most of us seem to limit the encouraging part from a trading/sale perspective.Quote from: Jatiluhung on February 19, 2023, 11:49:11 PM-Indonesia 11. https://bitocto.com/I think your article code is broken. You probably want to add the title instead of the URL of the publisher. That aside, that article basically claims that it is easier to increase the numbers of crypto users in Indonesia because people spread the news quickly and most people are eager to try crypto since there is a lot of credit that they can use to trade/buy it. It is implied that the regulation is not that strict and people can trade crypto easily. A lot of countries can fit this standard IMO, not only Indonesia.",
