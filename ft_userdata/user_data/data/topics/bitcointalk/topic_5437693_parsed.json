In today's situation, commercial banks are collecting 10% on counter against new notes. Could this be a result of the Central Bank as well? A further escalation of this scarcity occurred over the weekend as a result of a deadline shift. In preparation for elections, politicians are stockpiling funds with the help of bank managers. Even today, there are still old notes in some ATMs.",

My mind doesn't understand how Nigerians suddenly changed their expectations of their president, you expect a show of pragmatism that hasn't been shown in the past seven years. He has demonstrated that he cannot control the system, not even security. This is why I do not want any soft leaders in government any more, but I do not want tyrants either. Bank heads can be summoned to the capital to explain the scarcity after so much has been released. If they cannot, they should be sanctioned and publicly punished.",
