They are waiting for the regularization or the approval of their registration as a Digital Assets Service provider, correct?This would be a significant step for more people to be interested in crypto and probably have the best approach toward different types of investments along the way. Being the best provider would reap its rewards.",

All these license from the banks they acquire eventually help them to expand their business but these licenses force them to be strict. Strict means play buy bank's rules. We need decentralized exchanges to take over the market instead of these centralized exchanges. Only then we will enjoy the freedom of bitcoin.Quote from: Bttzed03 on July 09, 2022, 07:50:15 AMI remember when Binance was criticized for not having an official country where it legally operates.

So meaning competitions might drive services and produce features for the better.So I'm not surprised by this another expansion by CZ in Europe. And this could be just the beginning for CZ having his foothold in EU. But there will be such time that CZ will be so powerful, just saying.",

Binance is expanding and targeting regions where they have most customers and they're doing everyone a favor to reach as far as they can. This is why they're also becoming controversial for some countries because of the wide reach that they have.",

He become so powerful and enormous, and then when they have a chance to break him up and take a shot in relation to use of data, then CZ will have to be very careful here.

I'm honestly amazed at this man's business aggressiveness. In addition to Cristiano Ronaldo, Binance also recently signed a deal with the popular social media personality, Khaby Lame.CZ even met with presidents like Kassym-Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan, Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, Macky Sall of Senegal, Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast.Perhaps what the bear market gave CZ is the opportunity to grant loans to, or even acquire, a number of crypto companies that have been severely affected.",
