      "body": "So, anyone can install the apk and start mining without any cost? How will they prevent attacks like the 51% attack then? I think you need to explain more about profitability and the cost. For example, how profitable is it to run this on a mid-range Android phone, how much you can earn per day, how much electricity is required etc. One of the most obvious issues is whether our phones can sustain the heat or not. I don't believe phone mining is sustainable and profitable regardless of what we mine, and I think I'm not the only one who believes this.",

I meant i have been watching gaga got hyped due to the partnership with huobi. This token potentially to be listed on huobi instantly without any doubt. I think that i kinda feel that bunch of people who mined this token were actually betting on it. The price was very cheap in the p2p. I would prefer to buy this token from others instead of doing mining. The reward was not even worthy with the time. People who were mining this token was wasting their time.",

There are countless projects that tries to support mobile mining but of course tis performance affect the stability of mining and can cause early destruction with the device.Most projects that introduces it are probably dead by now. There are plenty of factors so bettet to focus on computer instead.",

For me theres no problem mining at this rate been mining since last month and I got 16k gaga credits (plus 100*** I bought lol)  at the moment without doing anything, I just checked it weekly if node are running and leave it.",
