      "body": "Bitcoin marketcap was initially zero, because Bitcoin, unlike altcoins, didn't have any pre-sale and pre-mine. As for the first purchase, the first Bitcoin trades were done before any centralized exchanges were created, so little is known about the first instances of trading. This demonstrates that it's irrelevant of how big your marketcap is at the start, it's important that the project is actually useful to people.",

It wasn't sold to people.Instead bitcoin started as a currency but it didn't have any exchange rate (price) to determine its market capitalization because it wasn't being traded. Additionally market cap was not a thing back then, this is a concept that was introduced by shitcoins to gain an arbitrary rank due to their uselessness.",

It was merely satoshi sending some of his own coin to Hal Finney in exchange for nothing in return.As of the first block, few people except satoshi even knew that bitcoin existed. It was more or less trivial to get as many bitcoin as you wanted via mining, and there were no willing buyers to my knowledge. My understanding is that there were no willing buyers of bitcoin until mid 2010, which the going rate was less than a penny per bitcoin. At this point, the market cap was still very close to zero, and it was not possible to spend much money buying coin.",

Is this really true ? So the price of 1 BTC was initially $0.0007639.This means that bitcoin's current price has increased to 37,963,084x times the initial price.Do you have the buy/sell transactions made during those times ?",

The first buy (or exchange) transaction between two people is what results in Bitcoin Pizza day. ThisBitcoin for Pizzas ?Something happened before that, however, and it is related to the New Liberty Standard - and is considered the first sale of Bitcoin in which one of the founders of this forum Sirius (Martti Malmi) participated. We can note that Sirius sold 5050 BTC in 2009 for just over $5, and that as early as 2010, two famous pizzas which are paid 10 000 BTC were then worth about $40.Quote from: https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/12/bitcoin-timeline-bitcoins-record-highs-lows-and-history.htmlOctober 12, 2009 The first known sale of bitcoins in U.S. dollars takes place: New Liberty Standard sends $5.02 via PayPal to Martti Malmi, and Malmi sends 5,050 BTC to New Liberty Standard, enabling the site to establish the first-ever bitcoin trading service. The price of bitcoin is 0.099 of one penny.",
