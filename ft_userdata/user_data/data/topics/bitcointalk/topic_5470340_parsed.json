      "body": "I had not heard about it, though. Thanks for giving the headsup on this scam accusation. I personally try to go and follow my instinct that 5% per day/month is definitely a scam. The only cases I have seen myself are Ponzi schemes dressed up as betting platforms, where it is basically impossible to lose money and people get up 5% daily because partaking in false sportbetting in the ficional casino. In the end it is always the same, the money gets seized and the scammers withdraw it all towards their own private wallet.  I have noticed that these days Ponzi schemes tend to be very camuflajed, so people will think they are actually doing investments, or betting, or buying precious metals from home. Keep us updated when this scheme collapses.",

      "body": "2 months ago I saw on YouTube, channel owners who had a lot of followers being paid by a certain casino so that these channel owners with a lot of followers started promoting the casino, the strangest part I saw was that the guys on YouTube They said that when people put money in the casino they would receive dividends every month, so many people started depositing money in the casino in the hope that they would receive dividends every month, as a month has 30 days, so when people deposited money at the casino, they leave the money in the casino account and wait for 30 days for dividends to be paid, but it turns out that after 30 dayspeople didn't receive any dividends, so they started trying to make withdrawals, but they couldn't because the system told them that they had to fulfill the wagering requirement, as people didn't know anything about casino, they got in touch with support, who told them I told them to place a bet if they wanted to make withdrawals, with great naivety people placed bets and lost everything, then many of them started crying on social media, then the guys who own YouTube channels deleted the videos that said people would earn dividends when they placed money in the casinoand they start posting videos in which they say that people should play responsibly and that gambling does not give guaranteed profits, in other words, the guys on YouTube received a lot of money from the casino to keep lying to people, something sad and shameful, so The case ended up in court, but the casino has a Curacao license, no one knows the real identity of the casino owner, so the court has no way of arresting the casino owner.",

How people do get blinded about having signing up some loan contracts instead of investment contract if it was really that an investment?It does really shows on stupid those people are and making investments blindly without even trying to dig out on whats the real deal that they are facing on, on which they are really just that too much focused ongetting those returns without even trying to look on what are those potential risks that they could face on.Its always been that a golden rule that everything that turns out too good to be true then its most likely a scam or definitely a scam but still there are really that those stupid people who cant really just resist even it is really that obvious that it is really that clearly something fishy with those.Getting some huge % on a specific amount of time without doing anything? You should really be thinking up twice already because there's always a catch always in the end and this is somethingthat you should really be looking into.You wont really be getting wrecked if you had just made yourself that wise when it comes to decisions and really that making use of your own common sense rather than on makingyourself getting blinded with those offers which are obviously that a scam attempt but people do really likes on losing money first before they would really be learning theirlesson on which this had been always the case.",

There is always a percentage that those involved get from bringing in high wagers, as that can't be free, and not everyone will also be able to enjoy that benefit, as such luxury costs more, and maybe you need to have a wager up to an amount rounding up to millions of dollars before you can benefit from such an offer.",

Casino junket operators are businesses, and they are trying to make money. This means that they may try to pressure you to gamble more than you are comfortable with.Some casinos do offer high-end experiences to VIP players, aside from traditional perks like rakebacks. These experiences can include exclusive events, access to premium services, meals, drinks, entertainment, and even all-expenses-paid vacations and it's usually reserved for high-rollers or loyal customers. Some casinos even offer private jet charters and VIP suites for their high-roller customers. They expect their high-roller players to gamble heavily in order to earn these rewards.",

But they will let out the investors that they will victimize and give them a loan of contract which is what they don't say, the worst thing is that in the end they let out the investors as well, but they are the ones who receive the money of their investors which is right here is really a red flag to me.",

This isn't new; I've seen numerous scam stories in the Philippines involving significant amounts of money. I believe people need to be educated about these matters. Anything that seems too good to be true should give them pause before making hasty decisions.I'm not sure what the government is doing to prevent this from happening again because it seems like it occurs regularly. Perhaps their measures aren't truly preventive, which is a problem.",

In return, they will get profit sharing on the total amount spend by their recruits. Casino junket counter part in online casino are those Gambling review sites and other that offers extra rewards such as free spin or other form of rewards which they are paying from their own pocket when player sign up using their referral link.I become curious on this subject since there’s a big scam incident on my country that involves casino junket operation as business front in exchange for investment. They are offering 5% income per month to all investors which we all know that is already a ponzi.https://entertainment.inquirer.net/522430/yexel-sebastian-asserts-casino-junket-is-legit-amid-investment-scam-accusationsI’m just thinking if there’s still some casino offers this type of luxurious reward to their players aside from rakebacks. I think there's a legitimate running business model like this and casino use this just to make their VIP stays on their casino, they offer a lot of benefits and loan to make sure that those gamblers will be tied up on their casino. But what you show here is a pure ponzi schemes since and they just use the casino junket name as an excuse so that they have something like a escape route then tell that there's money is gone since they lose it for the said business. Investors now crying out loud for the money they lose from said program that's why its never good to invest any amount if we are not sure on what they are doing. Also ask for the right contract if they are really running a legitimate business so that we can avoid such the same unfortunate incidents. To many times this happen and we need to understand that casino exist in any forms and we should not invest on to good to be true offers presented to us.",
