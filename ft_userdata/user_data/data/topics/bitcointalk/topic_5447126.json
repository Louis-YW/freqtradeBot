  "content": "I am not going to show you any hack or any bot to pass this new captcha, and i am not a coder or programmer.so i am sharing some tips to solve this captcha faster and easier,this is a good pattern i solve with : 1. patience is very important in that game(flappy bird type) and another patience is all important while posting we forget to type subject and quickly taped \"post\" then the number of coins to collect with increase by one . so patience is important2. see the physics of game like how long it jumps, how many seconds it takes to come at initial position , 3. always tap when the bird at location : a little down from the pipe and a very little gap is there between bird and pipe, the bird will go directly from between the pipe.4. adjust screen size when screen is too small and too big then also it becomes hard to play5. don't tap many times by thinking that more you tap you will get passed quicker, this game is of patience and calmness.6. don't rush for tapping in the beginning of game, first let the bird travel in a line when the good place comes them tap.7. don't see numbers that how many coins you collected, you need distraction free environment (the post seems like a motivational speaker is giving tips Â )8. playing in frustration = more time to pass , playing with calm mind = less time to pass the captcha9. enjoy playing i was at 10 coins to collect then i closed bitcointalk , after logging in after sometimes, while writing this post the coins to collect became 8 means the difficulty is directly proportional to number of posts in unit time.i hope that was helpful.",

I think people should just relax and chill, enjoy the moment. There's no cause for alarm. All will be gone in less than 24hrs and forum resets to status quo. I was very scared when I saw the instruction and I thought it was very serious because this forum is very formal. I don't want to be called a spammer that is why I was doing my best to get the coins, but the game was not as cheap as I thought. But when I saw some comments from members that was when I knew that it was nothing serious. It's just to add some fun to the ever-serious forum. The captcha looks like a game called Super Mario that I used to play decades ago. But this one is very strange and difficult for me. I have not played any game for many years now and I guess that's why I am finding it difficult. I can't wait for these unpleasant red remarks on my post to disappear. I hope it goes out immediately we get to 2nd April. As you said, I am relaxing and expectant.",
