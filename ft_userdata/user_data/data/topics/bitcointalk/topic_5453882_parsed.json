How about you have you been threatened by your wife, your girlfriend, or your parents, if so tell us your story.",

But regarding being hideous,  if they are struggling financially, then I think she has the right to know that he won; not to necessarily disclose all of his winnings. But I do get the point that he might be protecting his funds especially if he knows that her wife would use all of it not unless the husband is just greedy of his profit, but that's his rights tho', especially if it is soley his funds which helped him. We just all have our own reasons but I'd probably be hideous as well especially if I'm providing enough for the household. Not because you're married, it would already be a reason for you to share funds; that would depend on your set up as married couple.",

But if my wife discover that, that should not lead to a threat after being a good husband that is taking care of the house financially. But some people still make their wife to be financially supporting the house. This can happen to people like that. The solution is to tell your wife that you will stop even if you do not stop. But people are reasonable, maybe the person is spending too much on gambling too and that is very bad.",

How about you have you been threatened by your wife, your girlfriend, or your parents, if so tell us your story.What his wife did was right to the point that she didn't want her husband to be addicted to gambling and spend money or even be able to sell things at home just to gamble. Every wife who wants to save her husband will do the same thing and with these threats at least she has proven her concern for her husband. Examples of cases like this have occurred at my place, even more than 3 cases in the last 2 months. My wife's neighbors and friends even filed for divorce because her husband chose to use the money he earned to gamble instead of supporting the family.For me personally, I would also choose to leave gambling and return to improve myself for the sake of family harmony. Remember to place the portion of gambling properly, don't let lust rule over everything, because lust always has the opportunity to destroy what it has.",

I agree that's also my view if he is only honest and does not hide anything from his wife, his wife will let him gamble just moderately, wives have a budget to protect even if it's the husband's money he still has a concern because what both owns are conjugal, wives will be angry if the husband did not tell her about his huge winning it's like betraying her, but it's good that he choose his wife than gambling, relationship is important than gambling",

The main lesson here is to treat your partner when you win a significant amount hehe. You don't need to tell her that it came from gambling. I haven't faced that kind of situation ever since I started gambling. I guess I'm not at the same level of addiction as your friend.",

And in reality we can not say that all the time we can hide our secrets cause once we are too unlucky and our secrets revealed then that's a big loss. So for me it's better to say in early stage because there's a chance that you will be forgiven or let's say they will allow you in gambling but only for fun.",

I don’t see the logic behind hiding profit to his wife while they are both living on the same roof and benefits on each other finances. Maybe you should ask your friend about the reason on hiding his profit. I understand when he wants to hide loss because my wife will really got angry if I loss money on nonsense things for him but I will be proud to share my profit on gambling if I ever I win big time because my wife deserves to share with it unless he I didn’t love her anymore.Hiding gambling will just result for broken marriage since the wife will always blame gambling whenever they experienced financial problem even though it’s not related anymore on gambling.

I think it's possible to reach a middle term. It's expected and understandable she is mad on him for not telling her about the big win, but if they love and care for each other, this strife will cease at some point, and then it will be the right time to talk about the gambling matter.There aren't any issues if the husband enter an agreement with his wife stating that he will continue gambling, but responsibly, without compromising the family's funds, just for short periods of time for fun. Moreover, in winning case, she will be the first person to know about his achievement and they will celebrate it together.This way they can reach a consensus which won't destroy the marriage, while also keeping the husband's hobby alive.",
