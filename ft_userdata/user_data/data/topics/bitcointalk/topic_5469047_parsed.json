A quick google search shows that Solana had an outage on January 7, 2023. But for Solana having only 1 issue for this year is a great achievement.Considering the current low TVL and weak activity I'm not sure if anything happens once it becomes more popular.Quote from: billyd7 on October 03, 2023, 05:11:43 PM2. Is there? what does that amount of transactions and so cheaply?As per DefiLama it have only 0.88% of total DeFi TVL.

It hasnt at all. No shit.About 43% of supply was allocated for team and various private rounds with a price from 0,04$ to 0,25$ while only 1,43% went to CoinList public sale.",

I've known people that are also sol maxis and I have no problem with you guys.You seem to have a strong belief on it and I'd like to say good luck with it because you likely all know what you're saying about it and why you're a maxi of it.",

Looking back at the process of its appearance, its positive features, limitations, internal controversies,... in general, altcoins can easily increase sharply but can also easily decrease sharply through the example of the SOL chart.Although there are currently many new L1 appearing and competing for market share in this market, SOL is still a name that has brought great positions so they will still be noticed. But as for optimal selection, it is not suitable for me, some new products that I believe will have greater hype will bring good profits.",

It looks like the only thing that could even get close to doing an Ethereum style run.The reason it still on the top L1 is because majority of holders of solana are the top whales and only few retailers. How can you move it down if almost all are being hold by few people while others are totally different. They can really maintain their high valuation in contrast to others. So I think thats a good way to say they are on top of L1. But in terms of technical or product there are far way more greater than solana. Remember how they network got off many times before? Isnt that a bad sign in security aspect hence they arent go down that massively? Well you can tell why (my first reason).",

The network is completely centralized, there is no real development compared to the L2 projects on Ethereum, which have become faster and cheaper POS and its reliance on a decentralized network.

Poly, Avax, BSC etc. Not that they differ/offer anything revolutionary over SOL but its the power of first movers. This also means most of the action/volume is on those chains so traders stay there aswell.A huge problem for SOL will always be the FTX/Sam factor. Its considered a pet project of a scammer.

Remember, the bitcoin, the one we are here because.1. Solana is so centralized that in last few years network STOPPED more than few times!2. When Solana network stops, you cannot even login to your wallet (had this issue, twice)3. Solana has fake bitcoins made by Sam Bankman not backed by anything, that's why price crashed4. Solana has fake other currencies not backed by anything5.

My biggest bag is Bitcoin, followed by Eth and then Solona. I have responded to many arguments put forward (I dont need to respond to everyone - especially those who feel the need to advertise dodgy crpyto casinos nobody has heard of or uses). I can prove some of the claims against Solona are absolute nonsense. The only one that is of any note is the centralisation one. I haven't see one single L1 put forward as an alternative yet....",
