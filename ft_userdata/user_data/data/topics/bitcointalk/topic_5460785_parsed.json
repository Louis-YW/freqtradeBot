      "body": "Since you installed version 22.0 recently maybe the Bitcoin core is still open or running in the background you should close/shut down it completely before you install the latest version or just copy the open source code from Github and paste it to /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt folder. This guide is on their release note here How To Upgrade.Also take note you made a two thread you should delete this one below- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5460779",

It flashes but .dmg is mounted, just check the mounted drive/folder.I tested on the older version of Bitcoin Core 24.0 the dmg installation file also flashes, but on 23.0 the drag-and-drop installation method popped out.So make sure you unmount any currently mounted Bitcoin Core installation drive, to make sure you did not mistake it with the older version, then click the dmg and check the mounted drive.",

Are you guys aware of anyone in the Bitcoin Core project who might be interested in covering those expenses?",

OP problem has nothing to do with binary notarization. It is a different matter.Quote from: NotATether on October 19, 2023, 10:20:42 AMAre you guys aware of anyone in the Bitcoin Core project who might be interested in covering those expenses?The notarization has already been talked about. But it's hardly about money problems. See https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/15774.",

I implemented it on macOS by renaming the Bitcoin Core App and adding a version number to differentiate it.",
