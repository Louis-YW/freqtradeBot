  "content": "I am new to DEX and Uniswap. I used it before for simple market price swaps however I am wondering is there anyway I can set limit orders whenever I want to sell something or buy something. Currently I would set alerts on Tradingview and then I would go to Uniswap and buy and sell at whatever price the market is trading at. However I am wondering if its possible to just use limit orders to buy and sell.",

Is there any order book? Dex's are still underestimated for their true potential just because of the violent network fees.",

But the link I have just shared explains how it works. You might have to use third-party tools if you want to achieve other things such as viewing the trade history, chart, get alerts etc. one of them is Dextools.io",
