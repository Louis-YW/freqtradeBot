With the controversies at hand, It's a matter of time for Aptos to move!FTX has been funding so many crypto projects. I don't even know why this company has so much money to invest in any projects in the crypto. Those projects already invested by FTX would be the main target by FTX to be liquidated. I guess FTX has owned by mostly of tokens caused by VC was always buying at the early phase. Aptos has no different with solana. It's also heavily invested by FTX. You can see how the dump on FTT affected all of projects invested by alameda reasearch. Quote from: Famous Grouse on November 07, 2022, 02:11:26 PMAlso, a lot going on in Canto ecosystem...

I don't even know what canto is and it seems like that a new blockchain that has not yet launched.",

I know many people hope that there will be something good coming out of this, but crypto does not work like that. Normally if you see something going bad, then in any other situation you will look for an alternative that wouldn't have the same bad thing and you would be protected better next time.But in crypto, it‚Äôs not like that, when you see something going bad, then you just get out and not invest into anything else neither, just put it on btc or eth and make sure it‚Äôs safe. That type of reactions are the reason why when one thing goes down, others do not go up, it all goes down.",

And if ever it will, it is going to be cyclical, maybe in the next couple of years, new technology comes along.",

A few weeks back when Aptos was about to be listed on the big exchanges like Binance, Kucoin and others, i already had some stablecoins prepared to invest into aptos as soon as the trading on Kucoin starts. During my wait for the trading to start i did some reading though, which of course i should have down way before that but i just wanted to throw some money at Aptos because everyone was talking about it, and during my research my enthusiasm for Aptos dropped and in the end i did not invest into it at all. I just don't like the fact that they have collected 400M $ from the big companies and that those companies are now owning a majority of the tokens. As soon as the price is in their desired range, they will massively sell off.",

We can't deny the fact that there are technology that aren't replaceable if you think the other would do better, it's just that they don't call it replacement but upgraded version.But if you happen to see some kind of technology that has a lot of contributor then it's not their creation in the first place but rather a copy of existing technology but with added features just like how they fork Bitcoin.",

Even though the project is older, it has had some messy issues which that seem it is still not completely addressed. This increases the chances of seeing it at a halt once again very soon.As for Aptos, it looks like they have it all sorted and have presented a good alternative. Unfortunately, I've missed the Aptos Airdrop and had to buy a few, so I'm hopeful it will succeed",
