What makes your project different from others?The difference is how we generate the yield. Most Yield products are Defi products and have significant inherent risks. We are offering Advanced Autocallable Options products which only the wealthiest in the world have access to. Minimum Investment size there is at least $100K USD.We are offering it at a very low entry amount of $100. Besides, none of the products offer 25% APY on BTC and Ether. They offer high yield on low value Altcoins no one has heard of. We are offering on the most reliable crypto assets like BTC and EtherQuote from: PSULLWALERS on December 11, 2022, 08:15:11 PMIs it 25% APY on a fixed deposit? If yes, how long do I need to hodl my bitcoin for?Its not like a Fixed deposit. It's like a subscription of a certain tenure based on specific rules. For 25% APY, the max duration you need to HODL is 6 months. However, based on our past experience, the product converts earlier automatically based on the 105% knock out feature and you get positive returns [Moderator note: consecutive posts merged (separated via horizontal lines)]",
