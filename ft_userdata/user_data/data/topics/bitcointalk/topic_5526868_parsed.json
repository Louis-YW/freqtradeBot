So don't try to do a self marketing skills with anyone any your spread of bitcoin awareness.",

And that's the fun part of Bitcoin, it's good till the point where it didn't even need marketing for success.",

Let's spread the btc world to others, cheers.I consider the role of a BTC-missionary a waste of time and I believe that it is not needed by those who might be interested in bitcoin, and those who definitely will not be interested. Those people who are interested in finance, one way or another, have heard about bitcoin and can easily find all the information about this type of asset in the public domain. And it is useless to talk to those who definitely will not be interested in bitcoin and try to persuade them to invest. I am inclined to believe that such \"agitation and propaganda\" of bitcoin only pushes people away. Therefore, you should not force conversations on this topic. Unless people themselves ask to share their opinion and information if they find out that you have such.Those who need it, will \"find the way\" to BTC themselves.",

Not awared???Bitcoin has been in existence for over 10 years, and every day many people keep developing interest in bitcoin because of her good impact; even the nomies are into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies now after impacting bitcoin knowledge on them.In fact, not only a friend, but even most of my family are into cryptocurrency through the knowledge I impacted on them; moreover, cryptocurrency is now something you don't even need to convince anyone of; the reality is clear when they see good changes in you....Big thanks to the Forum members.You can go through this link below to gain some basic knowledge.https://learnmeabitcoin.com/",

Remember teaching people bitcoin is not a do or die affair but only teach people who show interest in it. Yeah that is the real truth about it because going about telling people about Bitcoin investment is totally wrong decisions. Because you don't know who is against you, and even though telling people to join Bitcoin investment without their willingness we look as if you want to scam them. However, I think always good to teach people who have the interest rather telling people who don't have interest. because as far as I know investing in Bitcoin is a personal decision, is not really good to force someone to joined.",

      "body": "I try to explain bitcoin to people. I'm glad that 3 people I have explained bitcoin to bought the idea and invested when they did. My very close friend is the most peculiar case. He was first convinced by a friend of his to buy a certain altcoin that it would give him a lot of profit in a short time, I didn't know about this arrangement and even then I wasn't into bitcoin, I wasn't even on the forum. Over a year later he was complaining to me about an investment he had made with a friend of his. He said he sent the guy money to buy a certain coin and he has not received a single profit from the coin, he just wants his money back and he doesn't care about any more profit.I was already in bitcoin now and that was when I began telling him that if he had left his money in bitcoin for over a year there was a higher chance he would have gotten profit. That was how I began educating him on bitcoin and how it was different from other coins. He read up and bought what I was selling. Somehow he got his money back from the guy and with my help, he set up his wallet and bought bitcoin. We are currently far away from each other but he calls me occasionally to tell me how much profit he has made and how he has invested more since the last time I saw him. Just recently he called to tell me how he took out profit from bicoin to solve an emergency he was faced with. I feel a little bit proud because he's not only just investing to make money but he totally understands the basics of bitcoin. He knows the risks and volatility, he bought his first bitcoin when it was about $40k or thereabout and he has seen how the price fluctuates so he understands. I'm also proud because he tries to correct misconceptions people might have about bitcoin and educate those around him. He currently has more bitcoin than me too. I feel like a proud teacher seeing his students doing well  I don't go about telling every Tom, Dick and Harry about bitcoin but if I see an opportunity where someone Im close to is interested I try to educate them on it and answer their questions. I also do not convince anybody to invest in bitcoin, it has to be their decision.",

And it seems that many of them now have a good knowledge about it and one of them has made a good profit by analyzing it himself and investing in bitcoin for a long time, although he has not sold the bitcoins yet.And it's actually true that I like talking about cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin more in my community because most of them are currently misinformed about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, many of them thought that Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies were only used for illegal purposes on the dark web. I definitely like to break their misconceptions, and when I explain these things to them, they understand, analyze, invest, and make a profit, but it's not really something to plan. However, we should be careful that it is not wise to talk publicly about your Bitcoin holdings or your financial affairs.",

Most of them didn't discuss about it because they want to do it secretly but in pure honesty most people are into Bitcoin and crypto these days and that's a fact. So, I believe it's good to discuss about Bitcoin and crypto in general with your family or friends but you should tell them to learn about it instead of suggesting them to invest in it.",
