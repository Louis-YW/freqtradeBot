This is what the message looks like in my inbox.When I opened it, it's just a blank message with an attachment asking me to \"tap to download\".I think the attacker knows me and he/she has been relentlessly sending me this malware hoping that I would download it. Please whenever you received messages like this delete it immediately and never try to download the attachment because it's one of the ways hackers get access to your devices and steal your sensitive information such as pins, backup phrase, card details etc.I've blocked the number and I'm hoping it would stop.",

I enabled such feature on my settings that does not support auto download of applications over wifi or data on playstore, will check if similar feature is available for messages.

I don't think so. It's more likely there was a data breach of some site or service that you use and whoever did it or whoever bought the database is now trying to exploit it. Be careful where you sign up with your personal information such as you real phone number. Ii isn't a bad idea to have a secondary phone number to use for that sort of thing and keep your main one for work, family, friends...Your interest in crypto is a private manner, so don't make it public in a way that it might attract attention with the wrong people. Trust only a handful of close friends and family that you are into crypto. There is no reason for your entire ZIP code to know who you are and what you are doing.",

I think the sender has a number and his identity is unknown to the Op unlike the kind of unknown number you mean that has no identity or number, that can only happen for calls, I've not received an SMS from an unknown number without any ID. However, it's certain that Op would receive lots of these messages and the sender may not be targeting his crypto it could be some marketers using bulk SMS to market their app. But to be safe it's better not to download the file. Secondly, Op, shouldnt drop his numbers on public forums or social media where these people scrape numbers for bulk SMS.",

Marketers who use bulk SMS will not provide document files like the SMS that OP gets. In general, bulk SMS for marketing purposes will have the identity of the business owner sender and some attractive offers. The SMS that OP got in my opinion is quite dangerous because there are document files that need to be downloaded. I would suggest deleting it and blocking it if you can.  It is possible that those who sent the SMS got the number randomly, but it could also be because the OP entered his personal number on a website or forum which eventually became a hacking target.",

For most persons, they've not been hit already by the effects from these auto downloads because the files aren't large but, the case might be different when it comes to applications. Applications like WhatsApp is one that comes with this auto download feature and should schemes like this take this part, some users would get hurt.Turning auto download off on all apps and your device is definitely a choice to make and avoid connecting to random WiFi network if you should at all.",

This information is not only to the OP alone but also to everyone. We should just be careful with our dealings online and  some kind of message we received. As the digital technology grows every day so it is the scammers improving every day. There are sometimes that some well known app ads like Truecaller,  1Xbet, Ayoda, etc would just installed in my Android phone, and once I see it I would uninstalled it.
