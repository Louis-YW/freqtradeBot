      "body": "A New Hybrid Yield AggregatorMAXX Finance is elevating the standard of traditional staking/yield farming systems we have seen in the past by focusing on high performance and efficiency. By applying innovation to pre-existing staking protocols we have created a cutting-edge ecosystem that rewards users for removing their tokens from circulation. In addition, MAXX has improved the tokenomic system of staking to reward the staking class and simultaneously combat inflation through deflationary measures.People love staking and yield optimizing platforms. With MAXX we a building a protocol from the ground up to allow users to maximize these returns in an innovative and unique way. — AlphaWhat is crypto staking?Crypto staking is an activity where a user locks or holds funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. Crypto staking is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.In staking, the right to validate transactions is determined by how many coins are “locked” inside a wallet. However, just like mining on a PoW platform, crypto stakers are incentivized to find a new block or add a transaction on a blockchain. Apart from incentives, PoS blockchain platforms are scalable and have high transaction speeds.What is yield farming?Yield farming allows investors to earn yield by putting coins or tokens in a decentralized application, or dApp. Examples of dApps include crypto wallets, DEXs, decentralized social media, and more.Yield farmers generally use decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to lend, borrow, or stake coins to earn interest and speculate on changes in price. Yield farming across DeFi is facilitated by smart contracts — pieces of code that automate financial agreements between two or more parties.The problemsYield Farming & Staking can be a very profitable endeavor, however, it’s not without risk. The cryptocurrency ecosystem can be highly volatile, by staking or providing liquidity to multiple pairs you are essentially at risk.Potential risks:Impermanent Loss — It is very common that LP (liquidity providers) can experience impermanent loss during holding multiple pairs during a volatile market. Staking rewards and yield farming might not be viable if the underlying assets you are holding have experienced price drops equally. This is a very common issue with being an LP provider.Regulatory Risks — Cryptocurrency regulation is still shrouded in uncertainty. The Securities and Exchange Commission has declared that some digital assets are securities, putting them within its jurisdiction and allowing it to regulate them.Rug pulls, market volatility, and smart contract hacks are some additional risks associated with staking and providing liquidity to multiple different projects.HODL has been a long-time motto of the crypto space, which every investor should consider since it generally works as a viable strategy. However, holding BTC for a year without staking it will produce no return, which is a shame when some protocols & platforms offer 15–20% APY while you HODL — AlphaThe MAXX SolutionMAXX Finance has taken the best of both worlds with a hybrid yield-aggregator staking system that is designed to remove risk from you, the end user. This allows users to have an all-in-one staking ecosystem to interact with and earn guaranteed yields without the risks associated with yield farming, or staking.Creating A Storage Of Value EcosystemBy building on a L2 (Layer 2 blockchain) MAXX is not required to verify transactions since the L2 does this for a fee. We have created a staking system that is intelligently implemented and allows users to earn rewards by staking MAXX.Essentially we operate like Bitcoin’s storage of wealth ecosystem and allow for users to facilitate transactions to and from wallets while giving rewards in the form of $MAXX to the staking class. — AlphaRemoving the middle manMAXX encourages users to remove their coins from CeFi (Centralized Finance) CEX (Centralized Exchanges) and enter the DeFi (Decentralized Finance Space) instead to reap its unique benefits. DeFi is the best place to be in the crypto sphere, as you own your own wallet keys and coins which solely belong to you, not an intermediary party, which helps to remove any counterparty risk.With MAXX the coins never leave your wallet, you are always in control of the private keys and can buy, sell, or cancel the stake at any time. This allows you to hodl while the protocol is pre-programmed to pay out a yield that is gathered from the global blockchain of MAXX.You sleep better at night knowing that the valuable assets you have are not in someone elses wallets — AlphaDiscouraging trading activitiesEvery trader will tell you, that there are wins and losses when trading crypto or any other asset class. By staking your crypto you are effectively reducing potential loss to your holdings since a smart contract locks up your coin, similar to putting your money in a piggy bank. You can end your crypto stake at any time, however, the system is created to encourage you to fulfill your obligation and wait for the full term of your stake to reap the maximum benefits. Ending your stake early is always an option but you will incur a penalty by doing so.95% of traders are not profitable, while the remaining 5% require at least 3 years of trading to become profitable. Are you part of the 5%? — AlphaProviding Risk-Averse EnvironmentBy removing the need to stake two or more paired crypto assets, MAXX removes the need to chase the best yield proposition from other platforms. By using the MAXX token within the stake constantly rebalancing the portfolio is no longer necessary.MAXX gives you the ability to earn a GUARANTEED amount of yield unlike other L2 staking systems that offer 5–13% APY, nearly half of what MAXX can guarantee.How MAXX is gamifying the system.Yield AggregationSafe and steady deflationary measures allow us to operate in a safe and predictable manner. We dedicate a percentage of liquidity that is specifically allocated to owning validator nodes across top L2 platforms such as ETH, BSC, FTM, MATIC, & more.LP Providing popular protocolsThe second layer is to create LP pairs of popular protocols to constantly provide liquidity & yield farm the crypto ecosystem. Without having to worry about the downside effects or focus on a very short time frame we are able to constantly capture tangible yield to distribute between the MAXX Vault.Careful Risk On & Risk Off StrategiesWe will have an overall macro outlook on the market determining the market condition and focusing on long-only holdings that are never leveraged. These assets will be held in a multi-signature wallet that will allow us to have maximum protection. The strategies will come from AI technology that will give us clear information about the cycle of the market with the ability to take risk on & risk-off strategies to capture the maximum amount of gain during a bull or a bear market.MAXX TX TAXMAXX uses a dynamic tax implementation system that contributes to the deflation of the entire protocol & chain to generate revenue for the protocol. It will cost a small fee to process transactions on MAXX, but in the long term, this will benefit the overall protocol and allow all users to benefit from the deflation.MAXXVaultMAXX will constantly be building further on the platform through our community-voted Vault system. The vault is designed to burn tokens, pay for marketing, as well as fund further development of the protocol.The MAXX Staking system is designed to remove supply from circulation and reward users by doing so. With MAXX you can safely hodl while you own your own wallet keys, which will create lots of positive price action and price appreciation in the future. We have multiple data sets and points that prove that this system will be sustainable well into the future providing a long-term staking solution for yeras to come.The MAXX team is grateful for the support of our community as we continue to develop this much-needed solution.

The objective is to allow its users to take control of their finances and remove counterparty risk from central exchanges.The core product “StakeMAXX” is the genesis smart contract launched on the network. This staking system is designed after a certificate of deposit investment tool seen in traditional banking worldwide. We programmatically create “game theory” features allowing for this smart contract to reward users up to 74% APY on their stakes. The StakeMAXX contract will be immutable, fairly launched, fairly distributed, and community-owned.The platform is designed with the four pillars of community, growth, code, and core as the foundational building and core principles we stand by.— AlphaPillar 1: The Community — We are focused on community first. Once the project is created, we will have it self-governed through a DAO system and a vault to allow the community to drive the project in the direction it wants to go.Pillar 2: The Growth — MAXX plans on implementing and innovating new cutting-edge technology in the blockchain space. With plans to develop our multi-chain DEX, lending borrowing system, and NFT lending platform. These things will allow the platform’s future growth to roll out in Q3-Q4 2022.Pillar 3: The Code — We have hired the top solidity developers we could find and had them work together to create the code; this code then gets regularly audited for quality assurance.Pillar 4: The Core — The MAXX Staking smart contract will be the core contract allowing users to generate wealth and store value. It is designed to remove supply from circulation allowing the value to grow exponentially and the users will then be able to transfer the funds out where they can interact with other MAXX products.The development of MAXX is being built from the ground up; we are not forking this project from another chain. The development process is arduous and requires a lot of attention from our team and the focus of our developers. While the team continues to make great strides and is hard at work, we will start the platform’s marketing portion to engage users and build the community. Given all proceeds smoothly, we anticipate the platform’s launch in September 2022.You can stay up to date with all thrilling progress by following our twitter.com/maxxfinance",

      "body": "Amplifier & DistributionMAXX Finance is not only creating an eco-system that allows users to take part in a never before seen staking system, but we are also renovating the way that tokens are distributed. We believe a cryptocurrency project must be user-focused and provide the best safety & security for the user this is why MAXX has spent the past month testing the smart contracts & preparing itself for the biggest amplifier event ever. The pre-launch is very important for us to prepare ourselves to give MAXX the best opportunity to launch the distribution amplifier phase.What is the AMPLIFIER?The MAXX Amplifier phase is a 60-day period in which we distribute 40B $MAXX tokens to the community. This will be distributed in a way where a lobby opens each day for 60 days & users will be able to reserve the space to receive their free $MAXX tokens. The sooner you reserve the better!Why do we distribute in this way?The typical way blockchain projects distribute is unfair, the massive supplies that are distributed between early investors, institutions, or large holders create an unbalanced and unfair environment. The retail investors are essentially just allowing institutions to use a LP (liquidity provider) to unload their supply.How is this method better?The amplifier gives people the ability to choose the day to enter the lobby based on the publicly viewable amount of people who enter and participate in the transformation. Previous ways of distribution would raise capital in stages and the later the stage the more the price of the tokens. If we were to instantly releases the tokens on a DEX the price would very rapidly raise and users would have to pay a much higher price than when you distribute it over a 60-day period.How much will the MAXX Token price be?The MAXX token is considered a utility token that is plugged into our ecosystem which the users on the MAXX web3 platform will be able to interact.By staking MAXX you receive rewards in MAXX which creates the ecosystem and staking system. MAXX does not sell tokens rather you sacrafice your $MATIC (POLYGON) for FREE $MAXX tokens to use in the ecosystem.RememberMAXX token has no value, So the value of MAXX is and forever will be $0,00 within its own ecosystem. But once MAXX is listed on a DEX (decentralized exchange) the community will then be able to offer the MAXX token up for sale and this is where the price of the token will be created by the users who trade it.MAXX does not imply any expectation of profits from the ecosystem, nor do profits get derived from the efforts of others. Just like BITCOIN creates inflation to sustain its ecosystem, MAXX does the same. By staking MAXX you remove tokens from the ecosystem supply and create a scarcity which you are rewarded for. The inflation is counterbalanced with deflationary measures through dual yield farming, penalties, and trade taxes.How Do I Buy MAXX Tokens?MAXX tokens are never for sale, you essentially forfeit your $MATIC tokens to get FREE $MAXX tokens, the amplifier stage will be announced soon! Be sure to visit our website https://maxx.finance/incubator and follow our socials to stay up to date with all the news. https://twitter.com/MaxxFinanceYou can forfeit your $MATIC through our WEB3 portal dashboard on the maxx.finance website.
