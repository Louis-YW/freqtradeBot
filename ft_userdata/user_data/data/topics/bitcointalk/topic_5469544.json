  "content": "I was wondering if I could stake multiple BTC addresses on Bitcointalk! We all know that, in case our account gets compromised or hacked, we can use our stacked BTC address to sign a message to show that I am the real owner of the account in order to recover the account. No matter how much we try to protect something, sometimes we cannot. It's the same for the BTC address. That's why we see many cases of losing passphase or private keys due to hardware or software failure. It can be intentional or unintentional. Hacking, phishing or other means. Accidents happen, regardless of the precautions we take.I had another question. It may sound somehow off topic. Is there a board on Bitcointalk where posts can't be edited or deleted?I want to change my Bitcointalk password because it's been some time since I changed it. I feel like we should change our password at least once a year. But I don't like the message that says, This user recently changed the password. It may sometimes make others suspicious. That's why, before changing the password, I want to make a post on Bitcointalk saying, I, DYING_S0UL, the real owner of this account, am going to change the password.Some might say, Why don't you stake BTC or PGP and sign a message saying that? The thing is, I don't have a desktop device at this moment. Most of the time, I use Bitcointalk on my mobile. I hope everyone understands my situation.",

You can but what is the point to have more than one address?If you join any signature campaign or games and rounds, you might use different addresses. Staking one address doesn't mean you can only use that one to prove ownership. You can sign any address you've used on the forum before. It serves the purpose well.",
