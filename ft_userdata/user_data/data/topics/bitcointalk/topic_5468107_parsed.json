Unfortunately here there is no way to indicate that someone has read a reply to a comment but is not interested in continuing the discussion, one way that exists is to send merit but merit is not effective for that.Is it possible that there is a tag (some kind of like button or some kind of merit but not limited) to tell the discussion partner that I have read the reply and am not interested in continuing the discussion. Is that possible?Sorry if the writing is messy because I use a cellphone",

You can find this \"lock topic\" at the bottom left of your own thread.",

But first, not all members would love to use such buttons or neither would they have time to inform you that they are about leaving your discussion. I might no longer want to comment or reply a thread and just exist or ignore that thread. There are so many things you sometimes wish it was designed on the forum, but some members prefer the forum, the way it has been design simple and anonymous. Every has a choice. For instance, you might have asked your self why you cannot see the usernames of members who had read your post. It only indicates the total no of persons who viewed it. What I'm saying is that if these many features were added it still won't change a thing some members won't use them. I really think the merit system is fair and the best for your request. And I will advice you to lock your thread if possible to avoid unessesary replies from other members because you might also not like them.",

From this point on, you have to stop expecting other replies from the same people so that the discussion doesn't go out of context.

There is usually a point in the debate where it is clear that opinions will not change on both sides. A person knew, knows when it arises, and must leave. By doing this, you will be able to stay calm, stay on good terms with everyone and avoid arguments that leave you looking bad to other readers (whether you are right or not).Remember this is an online forum. 99.9% of the people we talk to, we will never meet in person.

Some could reply maybe when they feels exhausted with the said topic or discussion they won't like to respond again, while those who created topic and never goes back to follow up their post is either not using bots and they don't know if people are actually following up his or her topic.Watch the numbers of people quickly responding to specific topic are using bots meaning whenever a topic is being created or are being mentioned they got notified for that and they are always active on the board. For a \"like\" button well i doubt if that will be possible because all platform has there way of builts so you won't expects this platform to looks like other popular platform where you are more familiar with and actually merits has already replaced the \"like\" options so i don't think if that could be possibly to be achieved or goes into implementation.
