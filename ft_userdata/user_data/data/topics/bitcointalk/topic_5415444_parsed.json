Some of those countries are not on ties with US so its not surprising that they are the one who will initiate it but seeing UK, France and Germany, it seems they arent also into US being the leader on monetary reserves.This will change the world if ever it occured and wondering what could be the impact on Cryptocurrency especially on bitcoin.",

While some countries may indeed give up USD as reserve currency, while Eurozone countries were supposed from the inception of EUR to slowly give up on USD, giving up SWIFT means not much of sense and it's not a country related thing, it's related to the (commercial) banks.And mixing up these can mean that the news is not a real news (like someone commenting there, I fear too that this is bs), it's just some things (not necessarily real) put together to attract readers, and the whole point is just a weak advertising for gold and silver.",

      "body": "I am already aware of this monetary movement years ago...there is that great plan to get away from the influence and power of the USA Dollar as the preferred international money especially for international transactions. Many big countries are now starting to show their dislike for the USA leadership...and in the short-term this may significantly weaken the USA Dollar position as there will be less demand for the green bucks. Soon when majority of the international transactions are conducted away from the dollar then that can be the time when USA can feel the enormous devaluing of its own currency...surely the kind of inflation happening right now in that country can be a child play. I am then hoping that somehow, there can be more adoption of Bitcoin for international commerce when countries are weaning from the USA Dollar.",

Dollar dump is is a big news to media houses and probably that is what it wants to achieve. However no doubt that some of the countries mentioned won't blink an eyelid to do that like China and some more countries in Asia that have the communist kind of system. The question is where the abandonment were possible, which other becomes the reserve for countries, definitely not gold nor silver. I have been considering bitcoin but same countries are haters of bitcoin, which means this news probably is not reflecting the reality. No where else have I heard this even on CNN, al jazeera, BBC, nowhere at all.",

The currency inflation was major part of USD being dumped from currency reserves, the other factor is the U.S. implementing sanctions on a whim and freezing assets from country's recklessly.Russia and China, many months ago, began conducting their transactions with their own assets and currencies instead of using USD for the transactions. Wasn't economically feasible for them to have to use intermediates if the currency continued to become worthless.Quote from: jrrsparkles on September 30, 2022, 09:38:19 AMThe article is overly exaggerated what it means, simply going to make trade with other country where US dollar usage is restricted or for some other reasons it doesn't mean they are settling to entirely new monetary policies and all their future international trades will be in that way.

If you can't trade with countries using USD, you empty out your USD holdings because they become less useful. I saw this coming years ago prior to all the war nonsense. U.S. has been sanction heavy over the last many years and it goes both ways.",

It will drastically decrease the demand of US dollar and hence the exchange rate will be decreased. But don't try to link it with bitcoin. Because even if a new world financial order is being formed, bitcoin is highly unlikely to appear there.

That's not really a surprise.Yeah, there's definitely a tad bit of bias in there . Although, the US dollar has been a staple in the last couple of decades really. It does seem to becoming a little less used in other countries around the world, but having said that it's still used in places like Asia quite a lot. I know when I've visited, they actually prefer US dollars to the local currency, probably because they used to get a decent exchange rate. Not sure if that's still the case now though.",

Chances are, no, the world is not ready to do that. The listed countries only abandon the USD because the said currency is weakening their own.
