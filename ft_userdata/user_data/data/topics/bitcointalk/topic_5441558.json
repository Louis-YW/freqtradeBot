The guy knows what he is doing and I do not yet see him as an addict. What newbie gamblers can learn is still that they should know that in gambling, the gambling sites have house edge which is a means the gamblers are the ones losing more while gambling site gaining more. Which means they should not take gambling as anything than fun and not spending more than necessary on it because they are prone to lose more than win.",

He isn't the only one who lost I should say, there were too many people just rooting for Jake and the bookies themselves seem to have confirmed it thru the odds.  $400k in one game, I could never get to do that even if I have millions. For Drake, I think it's forgivable. Drake had also made a lot of money many times through Jake's fights. The article says so.",

Wherein this loss happened to someone who either used peoples money or they use their life savings or some sort of monies they wouldn't have used, then it becomes a huge news on how gambling is bad and banned in most places. As always, don't gamble with money you can't afford to loose. I don't see Drake making a noise about this, because he sure could afford the loss.",

The bookie also got money to fund their operations. I read one of the comments in a social media post that he knew Fury would win when stories of Drake betting on Jake surfaced hehe.It's just how it is for gamblers.Quotewhat lessons can be learned by this event?Bet within your bankroll. The $400K was certainly in his range and I bet he could put out more money if he wanted to. I think Drake is still a financially smart man despite his losses from gambling......One of the best meme I've seen from this.",

This is not new for Drake; he already lost a lot of money gambling previously, which for sure he is okay with as we know that he is rich and he can recover it in no time. For sure, he is again included in the promotions, so he has a cut of their earnings also. He will for sure bet for promotional purposes as well as to win money for the upcoming celebrity boxing matches.",

I remember one thread yesterday that stated 'if someone suggest you to bet 100% sure win how will you do it' Hypothetical Question the lessons and events that happened to Drake are valuable lessons for gamblers, gambling really has the nature of luck for those who place bets.In the current world of boxing, Jake Paul is on the rise and viral, many gamblers are placing bets for Paul, the fact that he can be beaten by boxer Tommy Fury, who ended up being KO'd, Drake shouldn't have been so rash as to place a $400,000 bet, he should have thought his greed and optimism towards Paul could cost him all his money.Conclusion: never gamble based on greed and ambition, bet with a cool head and careful calculations, one more thing, don't try to put all the contents in one bet.",

Nobody can tell me otherwise: Drake is a gambling addict, and I believe he must have picked up this habit many years ago. It makes no sense to waste such huge amount of money on gambling and keep going back, especially when losing. Or maybe he is not actually losing, perhaps he is doing free advertising for those casinos. And the fact that he is so rich is only fueling his addiction even more. I mean, this guy bets on anything, from sports, online casinos, this isn't a responsible way to gamble. If he is misleading the public by making them believe that he is using his own money when it is provided by a casino, I think it is high time he gets called out. Many young people look up to him, and they might follow in his footsteps because their role-model doesn't see anything wrong with it.",

So him losing $400k on this bet is no big surprise but I must say he's gat gut to be doing something like this even and I guess he's the only artist I have seen that does things like this, maybe the rest are just scared or do not fancy the idea.",

If he would be greedy on that bet, he should have bet a bigger amount because in the first place he can afford doing such thing. Unlike with small investors and players who could only afford losing small amount but are expecting huge returns. He simply knows what gambling is all about and it is more likely that he managed the risks involved with that bet. Players have different wealth and capabilities both players and as an investor therefore it won't be surprising to know especially in this industry that there are people investing an amount which is a big deal for small ones.",

Wow there are people making incredible figure bets and most times I just wonder how wealthy they could be and Drake over the time is one fucking rich dude that I know and I'm sure that loss wasn't something so big to him and one of the funniest side of the stories I read was when Paul was trying to blame drake for his loss but he finally promised him a win on their rematch.I always feel happy when I see youngies treating losses as nothing an ld staying hopefully and I almost made a bet on paul but couldn't because my card wasn't working right and I'm glad I didn't because I would have lost massively.",
