      "body": "Nigeria has been in down turn throughout this administration.First the Fuel scarcity is as a result of the subsidy removal done by government. Although the government said they haven’t it the price of the fuel yet but there is report that it was indeed increased which resulted in scarcity. Then the Marketer hike their own price which in turn had his hardship on the citizens. The lack of acceptance of old notes by the fuel stations is also another reason.Gracefully the election is close and people could correct their mistakes by voting out the bad politicians. But this current situation in the current has made me to realize that the government is just a quarter of our problem but we ourselves are the major problems. Imagine people hiking everything like POS withdrawal fee and also food stuffs in market having variety of price depending on the kind of money you are using to purchase the goods. Those with new money buy less costly than those with old notes. Bank managers hiding the new notes and disbursing to only some specific people that could bring gain to them.Before we vote out the bad politicians we need to correct our own mindset because I only see citizen looking for the opportunity to pounce on the country funds if given the opportunity. CHANGE BEGINS WITH US",
