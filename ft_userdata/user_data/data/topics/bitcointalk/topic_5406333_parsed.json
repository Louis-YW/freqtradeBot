Even without knowing the password it should show you the balance.Syncing may take a while though.",

I keeps all your addresses, why did you write \"not sure which wallet exactly\"?Hashcat seems to be the best option if you need to find the password, but as you said - the chances are big only if it was somehow \"personal\" password. If it comes from password manager and/or is longer than 8-9 characters, the task becomes very very difficult.",
