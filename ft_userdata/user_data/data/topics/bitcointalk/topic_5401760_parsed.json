      "body": "If I'm not mistaken I often see accusations against gambling sites, Stake and primedice, but most of the accusations from them don't have good evidence, just talk and tell stories.As far as I know the Stake team will fix any errors or mistakes experienced by Stake users, I've seen them solve problems professionally and nothing is harmed by both parties, I think if @RichGang, having a problem, of course they can contact their team and anyway they have an active thread here, fair, with valid evidence of the problem being included.Except: there is a certain motive from the users of the site, most of them complain because they lost the bet, are frustrated and lost their minds.Overall and professional, if @RichGang, has a problem with both gambling sites, he can talk in their thread, who clearly doesn't know the real motive he wants, for sure he knows the truth, is reputation damaging or valid.",

      "body": "About a year ago (or so) there were tons of accusations against Sportsbet.io that many felt were unjustified, but those accusations got plenty of support from reputable members here on the site.  I defended Sportsbet because I didn't see any evidence of scamming, but some members decided to remove me from their trust inclusions, and one even added me to his exclusions as a result.The main difference here is that I have a lot of experience with Sportsbet and none with Stake or Prime Dice.  I tend to agree with those who are supporting Stake in this case, I don't see nearly enough evidence to suggest they're scamming RichGang.  What I do see is this gem of a comment:Quote from: RichGang on June 08, 2022, 03:39:30 AM1. They do not give you loss back.Lol, what casino does give you back your losses?  They're in the business of collecting people's losses, that's how they make money.  What in god's name would cause anyone to think he's entitled to recouping his losses?  No one forced him to wager those funds!  It seems rather obvious that RichGang is just trolling in an attempt to shame Stake into giving him his money back.  Much like the slew of accusations against Sportsbet in the past.  Anyway, that's off topic, I know, but I only bring up to make my next point:These are very touchy subjects, and picking a side is often a lose - lose scenario.  You're going to piss someone off, whether it's anti-Stake people, or it's the pro casino people.  The ones with the strongest opinions usually already had their minds made up in one way or the other about the casino in question, or casinos in general.  As for tagging dragonmega, I don't think that's a good idea.  A red-tag for a difference of opinion is not a good use of the trust system.",

They think they can extort a site by spreading misinformation. In the end it only gets them red tags(which they care nothing about) and untrusted. 1 day they may have a legitimate claim against a site and noone will pay attention because they already cried wolf 10 other times.",

In all likelihood, he was all butthurt after losing some money at the casino (clearly more than he was prepared to lose) so, he bitched about the multiple casinos after losing a few dollars. I would say it is a result of a very unhealthy attitude towards his gambling habits. I honestly cannot imagine this guy losing so much money over and over again without some serious accountability going on in his head. He is essentially compulsive in nature but, to date, does not recognize it. This man is like those that gamble and then, once they realize they lost the shirt off their backs, end up bitching about \"getting ripped off\" or \"nobody told me it was gambling.\" Then, they go to the casino and lose even more.",
