If $30k or so doesn't hurt you that much then you can go and try to do the bet. Same calculation as to how much you'll earn in the timeframe of 3 months since he's giving you 90 days. Well, personally if I were offered that much and I have the capability to earn more than that within a month then I'll try to gamble, not due to TA's or anything but just pure gamble. Besides there is also no assurance that Bitcoin will reach $1M within that time frame, there's also a high chance that the price will stagnate to that amount for a couple of months or so. The odds are against him too and you can buy more after the gamble if you felt like it so it's still a win-win situation for me. How I wish I could make that much money in month.",

      "body": "I suspect that this person who posted a long winded post on Twitter did it for Twitter clout purposesCome to think of it, it doesn't make sense that he believe the US dollar will hyperinflate, causing Bitcoin's price to skyrocket within 90 days, yet he willingly chose to store a million dollars in USD instead of just buying Bitcoin. Not to mention that this person was also a former CTO of Coinbase[1], which implies that they likely have a significant amount of Bitcoin at his disposal waiting to sell at a higher price. It's highly likely that this Twitter post is just a way for him to manipulate the market and make a profit.He just composed an extremely technical narrative of economics to make him sound credible on the outside without really knowing what he is actually talking about in the first place. And no, I barely understand what he actually wrote apart from that stupid bet and hyperinflation thingy..[1] https://cointelegraph.com/news/former-coinbase-cto-makes-2m-bet-on-bitcoin-s-performance",

From the OP mentioned the guy who tweeted that bet surely can afford to lose a huge amount of that money. If its not true then he might doing it for the likes and retweet to gather more followers. But he seems like he could actually what he posted since he have a checkmark in his account which looks legit. As for myself 1 bitcoin worth a lot to me that I will surely sell and invest again due to needs of money. But from my experience, I haven't seen people who would really send that amount of money from twitter I actually seen a lot of post like the OP posted. If its true then he is really rich!",

All of these are ways to also cause traffic on his twitter handle and we all understand the benefits of high traffic and followership on Twitter. I believe bitcoin can hit any price in the next day, week months or year but for someone to come giving me figures with precision supported with a bet bargain then I have to be careful cause this is too good to be through. Even if I have billions of dollars in my name that losing a million dollar wouldn't have an effect on me, I rather put in that one million dollar in buy bitcoin anticipating for his so-called prediction for the next 90 days stead of using it to challenge his prediction.

I would definitely make such a bet (whether the twit dude meant it or not) BUT only in bitcoin not in dollar. Meaning if I had a million dollar worth of bitcoin (that is 36.21BTC with current price) I would put it up only against another 36.21BTC and I'd say price is not going up to $1 million in 90 days.My reason about the rise is simple, it is impossible to see a 3750% rise in 90 days. The market is too big to see that kind of rise in such a short time. If it were until the end of the year (specifically next winter where the energy crisis is 10 times worse than previous one in the West) then I'd say the chances are a lot higher.My reason for refusing dollar is that we know dollar is being dumped as more and more countries abandon it and we know that US economy is collapsing slowly as it is evident by the banks that keep going bankrupt. Dollar in my opinion is the most risky currency in the foreseeable future, which is from now till at least next 5 years. $1 million today may not be worth that much in 90 days. Although I also have to say that this doesn't mean I think US will enter \"hyper\" inflation (as this bet seems to be about), that bet is also silly. Higher inflation for sure but not hyperinflation.Not to mention that bitcoin for bitcoin is easily done through the 100% secure bitcoin smart contracts inside the immutable bitcoin blockchain without needing to go through a shitcoin specially not a centralized stable shitcoin like USDC.",

A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet.Balaji take the bet and instead give his term of Bitcoin reaching $1m because of the US hyper inflation.QuoteUnder the proposed terms, if Bitcoinâ€™s price fails to reach $1 million by June 17, Medlock will win $1 million worth of the dollar-pegged stablecoin USD Coin USDC and 1 BTC. In the same way, if Bitcoin is worth at least $1 million by the date, then Balaji can keep the 1 BTC and the $1 million in USDC. Srinivasan explained in the thread: Besides Medlock Balaji also bet another $1m proving his point of view.QuotePer the thread, other Twitter users helped set up a smart contract with the betting terms. Srinivasan also disclosed that he would move another $1 million in USDC for another wager on the same topic: Balaji Srinivasan also stated:Quoteâ€œI am moving $2M into USDC for the bet. I will do it with Medlock and one other person, sufficient to prove the point. See my next tweet. Everyone else should just go buy Bitcoin, as itâ€™ll be much cheaper for you than locking one up for 90 days.â€œIn my point of view, US may enter hyperinflation but I do not think that Bitcoin will reach $1M Â in 90 days, I think that is too early for Bitcoin because the hype of the market isn't fully geared yet.
