  "content": "Everyone should be careful to do any trades with TheChin0s- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3506957 at least for the moment.Couple of time ago he asked for loans on the forum, he also wanted to trade $500 with me. - I don´t see anything wrong with this... But when I put that together with what happens now.1. Here OP says he got scammed by TheChin0s : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5452233.msg62226257#msg622262572. Then when I asked TheChin0s about this in his thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5451886.40He straight away locked the thread instead of explaining what have happened.So he had a opportunity to explain the situation in his thread, but choose instead to go silence and lock the thread.Then I saw on his profile he got some negative feedback..I don´t want to throw water on somebody and be wrong or create any kind of drama or be negative & I can gladly remove this if I am wrong.I only want people to be careful IF trading with him before he have explained the situations.I haven´t and wont give TheChin0s any negative feedback since I don´t have any proof of a scam, but I just think its very suspicious everything, so people should be aware until some kind of explanation have come out.I do this for the safety on this forum.Wish you the best.Best regards CC!",

It's true you guys don't need to pay anything to him since he's not ask any fee and there's nothing wrong to try, right? but don't put a big hope about it due to his suspicious activities.I'd say @OP is trying to built his reputation and trust by offering a free service.I see if many users were saying if his service is fake or bullshit, but since he's not asking any money, is he deserve to get negative feedback because he offer scam service without money involved? I would say he deserve because we not know what he will do if he get many merit and green trust.But since he was once ask a no collateral loan, my feedback was appropriate too, I just not a DT member that's why the feedback not show.",

I prefer to use the feedback in prevention of a scam than to use it when the user has already been scammed. I think I'm still in DT, although I haven't even bothered to check lately, so I guess it will show.It is not clear to me why he was not red tagged at the time for borrowing without collateral, when it is standard practice on the lending board. By the way, Plaguedeath, probably the fact that you don't have a custom trust list is an essential reason why you are not in DT. I've had a look at your feedbacks but I see that you don't have a trust list and that's why I don't include you. There are cases of people in DT that delete their trust list and stay in DT despite having deleted it but if you want to get in DT you need a custom trust list.",

Well, this case is definitely somewhere on the border. I would say it deserves a negative tag, but also not enough evidence for it. Personally, I prefer that there is some obvious evidence before a negative tag.Both cases that the OP mentioned are also just the words of other members. TheChin0s already has some negative accusations on his profile, but they are all on the untrusted feedback list. The problem is that none of them gave a valid reference, so we would have to rely only on their word. Asking for a loan without collateral is still not solid proof that spam has happened, nor that it will happen because I am not sure that any newbie will ever get a loan under such conditions.",

People should really start putting Reference links on their negative feedback, without that, it can never become Trusted.I saw the case OP mentioned: a Newbie dealing with another Newbie on scammer's paradise Telegram.

The only one way a newbie can ask a loan is, he offering a legit collateral.Tagging a newbie account can be useless, but it's what it's.",

However, I do believe that anyone who gets scammed by a newbie account should've themselves to blame. I mean, on what grounds will anyone solely trust an account that young which virtually has nothing to lose even if it gets red trust? It doesn't make any sense to me. Now that the account has been tagged, the user will obviously create another account and continue with fresh gullible victims. Nothing to lose for them. A few days ago on a different thread I made a post suggesting why the lack of moderation on scam should be reviewed. It's because of related issues like this.",
