  "content": "hello everyone, as many people already know, crypto casinos have chats and have the option to send tips to other users, in my personal case I have an account in many crypto casinos and I have made friends with other users who speak my language, when I have profits playing I like to share a part of my winnings with friends.sometimes I send tips to my friends when they have not asked me for coins, other times my friends ask me to send them coins and when I am winning I have no problem sharing a part of my earnings, the problem is when I give them and they do not stop asking, some seem to be satisfied with nothing.I sent several tips to a friend a few days ago, he told me he was losing and asked me to send him more tips, a recommendation that I made to that friend is to play more intelligently so as not to lose the balance very quickly.I would like you to share your opinions on this topic, how do you handle this issue of beggars in crypto casinos.",

Anyway, I play silently in most of the casinos as when you started to make noise and they see that you are winning they will start befriending you and ask for money. It happened to me in Bustabit where one user also tried to show his Twitter page (he has many followers) but no luck to him I wouldn’t share any coins that I have.",

      "body": "There are 2 types of beggar in chat room of any casino, they are active and passive beggars. The one you mentioned in your example is active beggar who ask you some money directly. Passive beggars are those who usually do not ask you directly but they say some words in chat especially compliment and congratulations in a hope that they will be tipped. Of course not all those who congrats you are all beggars but basically we can differentiate it ourselves by looking at how their act/word in chat. IMO it is not something new and it is something very common to find in almost all casinos with chat room feature. If you dont like to be asked for tips, simply ask moderator to ban him because I believe most casinos do not allow their users to ask for tips in chat.",

TIn the worst case situation you might be giving money to a problem gambler, which is encouraging their addiction and prolonging it, when they really need to face up to the problem by gaining some self control. I have no problem buying someone a drink or food, even getting entertainment for them, but giving money over is a dangerous line to cross. They may see you as a soft target, which could lead to repeated requests or it might cause friction in a personal relationship if you have to keep turning them down again in future.",

Not really that bad to give out some tips but this is actually depends on someones preference or interest yet there are really some people who do really love on doing this despite whether his losing or winning but most of the time it would really be that on winning state or condition on why people could really make out such move.Its indeed not necessary but for the sake of liking on doing something then its their choice to make.You could really expect for someone to have those kind of behavior whenever they do see big winners around neither offline or online.",

The problem with people who ask for bonuses and money in casinos is that they will not stop as long as you continue to win. The more you win, the more that these people would follow and bug you around ask for money. So that best way in order to deal with these people is just to ignore them and move on from them. To be honest, it bugs me that your \"so-called friends\" only approach you whenever you win your games. I think this is the sign to cut them off completely from your life as they are taking advantage of your money, OP.",
