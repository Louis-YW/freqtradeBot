  "content": "I am having trouble wrapping my head around derivation paths in multisig setups. I had a multisig wallet with the derivation path m/49/0/3 (i.e., each key used that path). I wanted to swap a key to set up a new wallet. I used Sparrow and, even though the new device used the derivation path m/48/0/0/2 and the other two had m/49/0/3, it still generated the multisig wallet (i.e., Sparrow detected no error).My question is, can each device in a multisig setup have a different derivation path? I always thought every device had to refer to the same one.",

Technically, it's not an issue since each of your MultiSig Addresses are derived from each cosigner's individual child keys.The derivation path is just a way to tell the client a way to derive child keys.Signing wont be an issue either as long as the client know how to derive those child keys from the master key.As for Sparrow, it's using \"Descriptors\" to take note of the derivation path for each cosigner master keys.",

      "body": "Quote from: aesthete2022 on June 27, 2023, 09:12:05 PMMy question is, can each device in a multisig setup have a different derivation path?Absolutely.The derivation path tells your software how to turn a seed phrase in to an extended private key and extended public key. So if you use m/49/0/3, this tells the wallet to derive the extended key at the 50th index, then use that to derive the extended key at the 1st index, then use that to derive the extended key at the 4th index. This final extended key is the xprv/xpub used in your multi-sig wallet.It doesn't matter if every seed phrase in your multi-sig uses a different derivation path - each one will end up with an xprv/xpub which are combined to create your multi-sig. In fact, the wallet does not even need to know the derivation paths at all. Indeed, there doesn't even need to be a seed phrase in the first place. You could just generate an xprv directly from some entropy source.As long as you feed it it the same xprvs/xpubs, it will always generate the same addresses, regardless of where these xprvs/xpubs came from.",

I always thought every device had to refer to the same one. A derivation scheme is just one of the ways to organize the storage or relationship of keys: each key in such a scheme will have its own place within this huge hierarchy, but they all can be derived from the common ancestor. The entropy (single signature wallet) or a bunch of entropies (multi-signature wallet) serve as an entry point from which to generate information needed for wallet creation and signing of transaction data. While you are absolutely free to determine how initial entropy and derived keys should relate to each other, it is advisable to follow standards described in BIPs and similar specifications because this helps wallet software to remain interoperable and interchangeable.",

Allow me to explain.Take the following familiar derivation path: m/84'/0'/0'.m stands for your master private key, which is generated from your seed phrase. Technically speaking, this is the only key which should ever be called your master private key, but a lot of people and software also use the term master private key to refer to your account extended private key (which I'll come to in a second).The next three numbers are, in order, your purpose, coin type, and account. 84 is the number assigned to P2WPKH segwit addresses. 0 is the coin type for mainnet bitcoin. The next 0 simply means the first account. As I explained previously, that derivation path tells your wallet software to generate the extended key at the 85th hardened index,* use that to generate the extended key at the 1st hardened index, and then use that to generate the extended key at the 1st hardened index. The extended key you end up with after doing all that is your account extended private key. Account because it is at the account level, extended because you have an extra part which allows you to continue to derive at further levels. But as I said above, lots of places incorrectly refer to this key as your master private key. When you extract an xprv from a wallet, it is almost always this key that you are extracting - your account extended private key.Now, to get actual addresses from that key, we need to derive through a further two levels. The derivation path of the very first address in your wallet will look like this: m/84'/0'/0'/0/0. The first extra zero is change (0 for not being a change address, 1 if it is a change address), and then the second extra zero is in the index of the individual address itself.m/84'/0'/0'/0/0 - 1st non-change addressm/84'/0'/0'/0/1 - 2nd non-change addressm/84'/0'/0'/1/0 - 1st change addressm/84'/0'/0'/1/3 - 4th change addressAnd so on.Note that multi-sig sometimes add in an additional field called the script type, so instead of something like m/84'/0'/0' you would have m/48'/0'/0'/2'. (48 is the purpose number for such multi-sig paths, and 2 is the script type for P2WSH.)So, in the case of HD wallets, you can import keys in two ways. The first is that you can either import a seed phrase, and tell the wallet the exact derivation path you used to get the account extended private key. So for example I could give you the following seed phrase:Code:tray expect pact quantum junior chronic nation topple boy today maid syrupAnd tell you I used the derivation path m/84'/0'/0', meaning you can calculate the following xprv:Code:xprv9zScb44VdRkzpdV8djUnNzD69QWRCA3iMvMm29UaouknnXxH3KRrnpN9QAyzEbqgMSVUVUavpkiaWuBhTBpefXXX5kg4tUvSQpd2dDHKFFXThe wallet then knows to start there and add on the extra /0/0 derivations to reach individual addresses.The second option is I can just give the wallet the xprv directly, and not tell it about the seed phrase or the derivation path I used to get to the given xprv. The wallet will take the xprv and add on the extra /0/0 as above, without knowing the derivation path used to reach that xprv.Now let's say, for example, I'm setting up a 2-of-3 multi-sig. In this particular multi-sig, I'm using one seed phrase on my computer, and two hardware wallets. Let's say the seed phrase on my computer is using the derivation path m/48'/0'/0'/2'. Great. So my software knows to use this deviation path to calculate the first xprv from the seed phrase it has, and the corresponding xpub. Now my two hardware wallets come along. For the sake of argument, the first uses m/84'/0'/0', and the second uses uses m/0'. What a nightmare! Each hardware wallets generates an xprv at the given derivation path, calculates the corresponding xpub for the xprv, and then feeds the xpub to the wallet software on my computer. Now, my wallet software has three xpubs, but it may or may not have any idea the derivation paths used to reach the two xpubs from the hardware wallets. But actually, it doesn't need to know. All it needs to do is calculate a child key at /0/0 for each one and combine them in to a multi-sig address.So it can do seed phrase + m/48'/0'/0'/2'/0/0 to generate the first key itself, and then it can do hardware-wallet-xpubs/0/0 to generate the second and third keys. One it has all three keys at /0/0, it combines them to create an address. It does the same thing at /0/1 and combines the three keys to generate the second address, and so on.*Hardened indices, indicated by the ' symbol, are actually the number you see plus 231, but the reasons behind that are not relevant for this.",

It depends where you get the xpubs from.If you are using the xpub already at m/49'/0'/4', then it will derive the right addresses. If you are using the xpub at m, then you will need to specify the derivation path.Quote from: aesthete2022 on August 05, 2023, 06:03:12 PMWhat is the difference between m/49' and m/49? So far as I can see, the derivation paths for all my multisig wallets are hardened (i.e., m/49).m/49 is unhardened. m/49' is hardened. The relevance is that unhardened levels can be derived only using public keys, while hardened levels require the private keys. In short, they are entirely different numbers and will derive entirely different addresses.",
