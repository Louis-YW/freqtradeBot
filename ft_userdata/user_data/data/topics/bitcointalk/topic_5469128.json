These NFTs and token minting were taking up a majority of blockspace but now that user interest has plummeted it alleviates the mempool backlog and reduces fees for monetary transfers.",

      "body": "If you take a look at the all-time mining history, the spike in transactions followed by a significant decrease is not surprising.I second the opinion that the recent one is affected by the BRC tokens, but it is possible that the BTC price movement also affects it to some extent. I don't think you need to be worried about it as of now, considering people still mine even before BRC tokens were a thing. CMIIW.",
