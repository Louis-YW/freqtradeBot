So yes I also believe say many altcoin investors dey sell their coin to buy bitcoin, and apart from the one I also believe say good news no dey dit hide forever e must burst make people for hear am, so people don dey see the important of bitcoin for their life com dey invest for am, so even though say altcoin investors no leave their sell their coins invest for for bitcoin the adoption for bitcoin for still dey increase, because no body go like go buy fake thing when em fit still buy the original with same amount but na just the quantity naim go change.",

So many people are adopting bitcoin because of its decentralized nature, use as a store of value, hedge against inflation. It one thing that is making people adopting bitcoin currently is because they see it as an asset that they can invest in to make profit from it. Altcoins are shitcoins and were created to fraud people of their hard earned money by the hype. So many people have come to understand and see the unique nature of bitcoin and the benefits attached to it that is why most people prefer bitcoin to altcoin. The only people that will know about bitcoin and leave it for altcoins are greedy people who think that they can make 100x profit from altcoins. But at the end they were disappointed on their decisions. Say no to altcoins and embrace the original, which is bitcoin.",

Abeg make ona shear ona idea on wetting ona think dey increase bitcoin adoptionAnytime Bitcoin makes a move, it will continue in that pattern until it hit a resistance and it couldn't break it, it will stay in that zone for some days before making another move upward or downward. So, in the process of that price distribution, that's when altcoins pick raise. You can see that altcoins were not pumping a lot when bitcoin was moving, so what traders do is that they remove money from bitcoin and start to buy altcoins and that's how you see the coins shooting up especially the ones you mentioned above.You can see that Blackrock and Ethereum ETF are waiting to be approve from Security exchange commission but nobody knows about the status and many people are speculating that it will eventually be accepted but till now, we have not heard anything. All this are just to bring new hope of people to believe in bitcoin. If you believe bitcoin is the best, but small and if you have some money to spare, try some altcoins like the ones that have never done all time high.",

Sometimes watin dey make some people invest in some shitcoins is that they see bitcoin say the price don too dey high for them to invest their $10, $20, $50, or $100. Them dey reason am say if them put that kind money for Bitcoin say them no go make better money from the investment even if bitcoin beat itâs previous ATH. But they come dey imagine say if they had invested in some shitcoins wey come do 100x with that their small capital say them go make am sharp sharp. Thatâs why you go see people dey invest in some alt coins without doing proper research about that particular alt coin first. Some benefited while majority loss their investments. Investing in some alt coins that has good potentials like ethereum and bnb and others will real life use cases is not bad. But my own is before you invest DYOR. So those that has lost their money over time in shitcoins have now realized that itâs better to have your $10 or $20 where it is safe in bitcoin than losing it in some shitcoins.",

It's the lifeline of cryptocurrency, and so many people know that if there is no Bitcoin today, it will be very difficult for cryptocurrency to do well again. While I was investing in altcoins, I lost my money many times because of failed projects, and that was the reason why I just decided to only be focused on accumulating bitcoin, and I believe this is also a reason why Bitcoin adoption is dominating. Investors know that Bitcoin does not have a pump and dump mechanism like altcoins, which makes them feel more safe.",

Many of these so called altcoins are actually owned by some big name in the business world and whenever they feel like they can easily dump or pump the coins for their own advantage just like the way Elon musk does to some of his own altcoins.Another thing is the believe people have come to put on Bitcoin as its can withstand the bear market and the potential that most big firms in the world today see it as a means to generate profits or income massively without stress.",

      "body": "Me I never any other coins fall oh except Tera Luna and FTT was a token for FTX which was like BNB token. So has FTX collapsed FTT also collapsed because they were one and unseparatable. Apart from these two I have not heard any other one. And by the way FTX was not a coin or a cryptocurrency but it was a Centralized Exchange which supported the FTT. And if any of you want to invest in any altcoins, you have to look well to know if it is a centralized or decentralized. Invest only in a decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain and not the opposite. Bitcioin adoption dey increase because of it value and no be because of what happened to Luna Terra if na weti happened to Luna Terra nai make people dey adopt bitcoin dem for no adopt am oh because everyone been dey fear.",
