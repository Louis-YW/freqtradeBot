      "body": "The Genesis block, handcrafted with crypto passion by Satoshi Nakamoto, is block height 0. Computer nerds always start counting from zero.  And _act_ was quicker: first block with subsidy of 3.125BTC is block height 840,000 and this block subsidy will last in the 5th epoch until block height 1,049,999 (inclusive).Quote from: odolvlobo on April 19, 2024, 07:33:26 PMDoes it begin when miners start working on block 840000 or when it is found?Your question doesn't make sense to me. A block of height 840,000 is only accepted and valid when its coinbase transactions has a subsidy of max. 3.125BTC plus transaction fees. To crunch hashes on a valid block candidate, miners have to assemble a correct coinbase transaction and all the rest of the block before their ASICs start hashing, otherwise it's a waste of time, money, energy, sense.Edit (as franky1 points out correctly):Miners who mine in pools rely on the pool operator to assemble a proper block candidate and double hash variations of the 80-bytes block header.",

Is it 840000 or 840001?Halving will occur after block 839999. It will begin with block 840000.Though I stand to be corrected, I thought we were told that \"Halving\" is the period which marks the moment wherby the reward for mining is cut into half? Alright, so at block 839999 it means we are still on the 3rd halve of Bitcoin, and not yet on the 4th halve, and it is at exactly block 840000 that the block rewards automatically cut into half, of which any miner that mines a block from 840001 onwards will be given half reward.Note:Block 839999 marks the end of the previous halving.Block 840000 is the halving Block 840001 marks the beginning of the new halve where block reward are cut into halfSo what i explained above, is how I think it works, but I stand to be corrected if there is any miner in the room willing to elaborate more on this for our fullest understanding. Thank you",

To add confluence to what Cricktor explained above, the last halving began from block 630000 here is a  tweet by F2Pool as they had a special message on the block 629999. So even by a rough calculation of adding the 210000 blocks that separates the two halvings the last subsidy reward of 6.25 will stop at 839999 block. Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on April 19, 2024, 07:58:07 PMNote:Block 839999 marks the end of the previous halving.Block 840000 is the halving Block 840001 marks the beginning of the new halve where block reward are cut into halfSo what i explained above, is how I think it works, but I stand to be corrected if there is any miner in the room willing to elaborate more on this for our fullest understanding. Thank youBy this your calculation then what is the block reward for block 840000? Because apparently it will have its own reward. So I think with the above tweet from F2Pool this is 840000 is where the new 3.125 reward starts counting from",
