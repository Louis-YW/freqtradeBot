For experienced investors, it’s easier to verify if a website is legit, but sadly, some still fall for scams like these. What’s alarming is how much the victims lose, one reportedly lost over $100k, and another over $300k. That’s a massive amount of money. It makes me wonder, how did they manage to deposit such large sums? Was the so-called business opportunity really that convincing to make them risk that much?QuoteThe suit cites seven victims, identified by pseudonyms, residing in New York, Virginia and Florida. One New York victim lost over $100,000, according to the suit. A Florida woman lost over $300,000.",

Real employers will never charge any candidate to pay for job offers, or interviews or secure a spot for them. I think because of the desperateness of getting a high-paying job, many people are in haste in making decisions without thinking of any possibility the offer might be fake. One way to find out in case next time is the urgent demand of payment from these scammers, another is how mandatory they make the payment aspect, but real companies will not make anything mandatory apart from the job requirements like CV and other documents. In general, anyone looking for a job should research the company or organization that gives them a job offer. For example, they can check if they have any legal agreement with the government, find if they have a physical location, and confirm with others if it really exists. That is one of the easiest ways to identify scam companies.",

When you get a job, you offer your services in return for money; you are not asked for money so that you can earn more money. When someone asks you for money so that they can give you an opportunity to earn more money, you should understand that it's a trap and that actual jobs and assignments don't work that way.The fact that many people believe earning money online is very easy and anyone can do it is the reason why so many people fall for such scams easily. Once they get an offer, they believe it's real and they will get more money if they spend some because that is how others earn money which isn't true.It's a basic lack of knowledge issue found in people who are eager to earn money but understand nothing, and they ask others only after they get scammed which is unfortunate since nothing can be done when it's late.",

Asking someone to pay for a job position before they can get hired is a red flag of scam. The scammer might be really skilled at manipulating people, which is why some actually ended up funding the crypto wallet provided by the \"employer.\" Aside from that obvious red flag, they probably didn’t notice that the offer was too good to be true. That said, not everyone is aware of these types of scams. Even something as simple as checking if a website is newly created, which can easily be done on certain tools, could help avoid falling victim.

There are people who are great in other fields but may lack knowledge in crypto, and that’s likely what happened here. We can’t fully verify since the information is limited, but a total scam amount of $2 million is huge, especially considering this wasn’t even an actual investment opportunity being offered.",

If the victim has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in cryptocurrency, they should have done some research and know more than the average crypto user. How do these people fall into such scams?I have never heard about scams like this one but I know that in poor countries it is very popular to offer good job benefits to people abroad. For example, some scammers offer people that they'll create a visa for them to work abroad in countries like Dubai. Everyone knows that Dubai is great but people don't know the dark side of Dubai. There is a slavery in UAE. Scammers lie to people, transport them to Dubai and then they become victims of slavery. Poland's visa is also a very popular offer from some scammers. They promise people that they'll have to work in a good environment and their salary will be 100-200 Euro per day but when people move to Poland, they work in factories and farms with bad pay and a high workload.",

Considering some victims lost amounts like $100k to $300k, it’s unlikely these scammers are aiming at places where even $1k is hard to come by. Their target market must be wealthier individuals or regions where people have access to such large sums.",

Especially the random stranger wanting me to setup a crypto wallet and send funds to that particular crypto wallet. Nothing shady at all.  I can guess that this would be a 2-out of 3 multi-sig wallet and the scammer probably has two keys to unlock the wallet.What kind of \"form of security\" is this?
