  "content": "It is a reality fact that most middle class or rich parents as it may be classified, who has future plans for their underage kids usually creates bank accounts for them with designated periods of depositing funds in the account on a specific amount and also period of time.So when the kid (s) grows up he/she can utilize the fund as desired but aimed on productive utilizations.The expectations of the parents is to norture the kids on financial management and letting them know that storing money in the bank is the safest place so that you can be financially disciplined and also stay keep off from thefts.Looking at this system, it is like investing on Bitcoin for a long term goal and accumulating more Bitcoin values in applying the DCAs and hodl in a specific period of time aimed to achieve a goal.Comparing the parents motive in this digital era, such banking plans for kids is a waste of time.For instance, imagine parents depositing the least $100 per month in the childs bank account assuming the child is 5years old, you will hold for more 13 years for the children to grow an adult before having access to the bank account.That means the parents are funding the account on monthly basis for 13 years.Assuming the parents applies this practice in Bitcoin investment, the parents would not only safe store the funds for the kid (s) to start up their desired life but has engaged the child in an investment whereas he/she will grows up, harvest the profits overtime and still keep accumulating and holding firmly the asset as a lucrative hope for his/her future.Having the money stored in the bank would have it loose values considering the current economy situation and the possibilities that the future holds worsen economy threats. Therein, the fiats are quite fast loosing values and inflation is distancing the stocks from gaining valuabilities. If only the parents would understand the safety and productivity potentials in storing values in the digital assets as Bitcoin, then it would be better if they grow their kids minds of financial management and productiveness by redirecting them to Bitcoin instead of the banks.Investors who had been in the Bitcoin industry for couple of years can attest the profitable rewards of holding and accumulating such assets on $100 monthly bases for 13 years or above depending on the kids age before getting things planned.",

Middle-class usually think that cash is their friend and they should save as much cash as possible but I know many of them recently take a loan to buy an apartment for their kids, which is a good investment when it comes to stability.Majority of people are very sceptical about Bitcoin because they only hear bad news about it from mass-media. If you ask a random person about Bitcoin, there is a high chance that they'll tell you it's scam, pyramid, the money of criminals and etc... It's sad but many parents ignore Bitcoin investment and they can't understand what a big opportunity they are missing. I have convinced my relative to buy a hardware wallet, store it securely, buy Bitcoins every month on exchange and withdraw it to the hardware wallet's bitcoin address. This is really the best investment option right now when we talk about long-term and high ROI. I believe that everyone, who wants the best future for their kids, should invest in Bitcoin instead of cash and fiat. Just pure facts, the coin has been rising since day one.",

Moreover, bitcoin is not in competition with fiat or not against fiat because from your statement it sounds as if bitcoin is against fiat. You can suggest doing the same practice of saving or investing in the kids life using bitcoin instead of in fiat but saying it's a waste of time seems very wrong for me because it still has value at the end but depreciation is not evitable.",

      "body": "I can't agree more with you, besides the profit if parents prefer to hold money in the form of BTC, they will save themselves from loss due to the devaluation of the money they stored in the banks due to inflation. And if some bad event occurs in these 10 or 13 years that those banks go bankrupt then you are rekt. I hope it will not happen if you choose a good bank. Although situations are not the same everywhere like in my country I can't true banks as they said by themselves they are not responsible for the money haha yeah they said it.BTC is a good choice and if parents fear to go all in one coin then they can prefer some other one too. As diversification is a good thing to minimize the risk. Overall investing in BTC is way better than keeping your funds save in fiat form. But the tragedy is, most of the parents who care about there children and think of saving funds for them are not very familiar with BTC that's why they go to banks, their parents took them to banks, and now they are taking there kids to banks as well. The trend is shifting from generation to generation. But I hope in near future trend is going to change and it already has changes a lot.",

In countries like the US there are types of accounts for that, like 529 plans. Although I prefer to have the money myself, increase my net worth and if necessary I will be able to help them. But I think it is more important to teach them how to fish than to give them the fish. Spoiling them may end up with them spending their money on drugs and the like.",

      "body": "It is proven that bitcoin has real value, starting from freeing up the financial system, having a low inflation rate and also a high rate of return. The thread created by SquirrelJulietGarden has also proven this [1], you can read it and get good insight there. And therefore all modern parents should switch to bitcoin investment model for their children rather than FIAT. But, is it actually that easy to imply?I don't think it's that easy to imply, children don't easily understand complex things like bitcoin, that's why parents prefer to go to FIAT. Whatever it is, parents have good intentions and know what is best for their child.Let me take this to one case, imagine that a parent invests in bitcoin for his child, he buys bitcoin & moves it to a non-custodial wallet, he holds the keys, then due to force majeure circumstances the parent dies. So what happens to bitcoin? the bitcoin disappeared from circulation & the child got nothing.Bitcoin is not for the uninitiated, it is more complex than we imagine.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5499661.0",

      "body": "Bitcoin has shown significant growth over the past few years, but it is still considered a high-risk investment due to its volatility. The concept of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology might be difficult for some parents to understand, let alone explain to their children. It’s crucial that they fully understand the risks and rewards associated with such investments before deciding to invest on behalf of their children. Financial education is about more than just where to store money. It’s about understanding how money works, how to budget and save, how to invest wisely, and how to navigate the financial world. Whether the money is stored in a bank or Bitcoin, these lessons remain the same.",

Fiat saving can mostly be useful for the day to day running of the family, but leaving a high deposit on the Banks are what a lot of parents are rethinking at the moment.",

Parents setting up bank accounts for their children is one thing that could secure a future for that child, or if in an emergency, they can pull out money to use for their child. Yes, storing money from banks will not give you money because the interest is too low, so even if you store it for too long, you will not have any benefits, unlike if you invest in bitcoin and hold it for years. But again, it depends on the capability and knowledge of certain parents. And how can parents be so sure that their holdings could earn or grow? We get that bitcoin is increasing its price over time, but we cannot be too sure because the market is unpredictable. So I think if you want a life savings, then storing in a secure bank is the best option. Meanwhile,  if you want to risk it and invest in bitcoin for future uses, then that is the most efficient way.",

The problem is that most people are unaware of the potential of keeping Bitcoin for a long time. Many of them are used to traditional investing methods like stocks, fixed deposits and saving money in banks. I have an uncle who was very sick and he told his wife not to worry that he had saved enough money in the bank that would take care of the family if he died. A few years after his death, his wife began to sell properties because inflation had made the huge funds in the bank worthless. I am sure that my uncle would have invested his money maybe in Bitcoin if he was aware that keeping money in fiat is useless. Bitcoin is not the only investment platform which is profitable, but it is worth adding it as part of your investment portfolio. DCAing for thirteen years means that the hodling will go through three halvings and we all know what it means. I used to have the intention of keeping some properties for my children but this perception has changed since I began to learn about Bitcoin.",

You don't want to be making decisions purely on the basis of maybe and maybe not.You do want to spread your risk. Bitcoin, like it or not, is a risk. Depending on the user, possibly even riskier than a state-insured deposit scheme that could still be inflation resistant with the right currency (say, the euro) and the right interest rate.You don't just tell parents to rush into Bitcoin. So many ways that could go wrong. Buying on a broker/app where they don't hold the coins. Losing access if they do store on self-custody. Failing to pass on the coins if they die. Or Bitcoin going to zero (heh, you never say never to 1 million dollars, so you should keep the same view for zero).",
