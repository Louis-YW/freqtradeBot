  "content": "Hi, I'm new to crypto and still getting my head around how it works.I've found charts on blockchain.com that show the network difficulty over time (https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/difficulty). Is there anywhere to find more specific information about difficulty-- eg. What is the current target value for candidate block hashes? Or, on average, roughly how many nonce values need to be tested (in the billions? quadrillions?) to find such a value?",

What is the current target value for candidate block hashes?There is a difference between difficulty and the target.Difficulty is only used when we want to represent \"how hard\" it is to mine a block. Current difficulty is found here: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/ and is calculated as explained here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/DifficultyTarget on the other hand is the actual value used in mining to determine the suitable header hash and is explained here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/TargetIt's value is found in each block's header in a short 32-bit form that can be converted to the long 256-bit form.QuoteOr, on average, roughly how many nonce values need to be tested (in the billions? quadrillions?) to find such a value? On average it depends on the hashrate of your device which is the number of hashes it can compute per second.Current estimated total network hashrate is 387 EHS which is 387*10^18 hashes per second.",

On the platform, it says; Bitcoin Average Difficulty is at a current level of 55.62, unchanged from 55.62 yesterday and up from 30.29 one year ago. The platform claims it is a change of 0.00% from yesterday and 83.61% from one year ago.Take your time to go through my source: https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_difficulty#:~:text=Bitcoin%20Average%20Difficulty%20is%20at,83.61%25%20from%20one%20year%20ago.",
