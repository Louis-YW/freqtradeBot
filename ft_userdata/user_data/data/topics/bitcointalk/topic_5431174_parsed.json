  "content": "Recent news is SBF (Sam Bankman Fried) has released because of $250million bond. Source : https://blockworks.co/news/sbf-released-on-bondAs we know, Solana was created by SBF before, and Alameda research still own huge sum of $SOL coin (approx 13.25% from supply). Source : https://www.google.com/amp/s/m.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/sbfs-alameda-research-holds-1325-solana-coins-in-circulation-2952320%3fampMode=1So i think there are 2 scenarios, 1st, $SOL will come back, as SBF will find a way how to make it \"pump\" again. We know $SOL price has been dropped -95% from ATH2nd, $SOL will die. If alameda decided to dump all their $SOL holding on market, it will make huge dump for $SOL coin.So whats your opinion?",

Some of Solana's best developers have left already to work on Aptos and Sui.I reckon Fantom has more potential than Solana.

The real problem is everyone dumping SOL not only alameda. And I think that people will turn away from solana. 1- its price was manipulated by alameda and stolen founds2- it was way overhyped mainy because of price pump from stolen founds3- it did not build userbase big enought to compete with ETH, TRX, BSC when it was popular. They didn't do it when they were at the top, they won't do it now4- there are other projects that will fill the gap",

He's out temporarily and will use it to do other better things but yeah, one of it could do something like pumping any coin he wishes. But will he be able to do that on this situation? I doubt.",

They need to show what they got. If they pass this one then the trust of the public for them are going to be more stronger.

But i have to admit that when i just saw Jim Cramer bashing SOL and other altcoins and calling investors idiots, i have to admit i am starting to be very bullish. As you really can't get more bullish signals then that. Trading the opposite of Jim Cramer is smart money no matter how crazy it seems. That guy is wrong about everything and always late to the party.I will accept the doom of SOL after Cramer buys it. Until then it's long SOL for me.",

Yeah, but probably how low it an go this bear market that maybe investors are going to look for other coins to invest? sort of leaving Solana for dead because it's name is attach to Alameda/FTX fiasco?So we will have to see, maybe there are a lot of coins that could pump in the next bull run, and it might not include Solana unfortunately.And for sure there will be new coins that will come in the near bull market and more likely going to be pump. Just like what happen in 2017 bull run, a lot of ETH challenger pump so hard but in the bearish market they all become dead or barely breathing by now.",

I don't exclude that Alameda, together with FTX, can be restarted in the future under new management and with a new strategy, then FTT and SOL have a chance to continue their life.I agree with you Sam is in the middle of life treating a crisis after the collapse of his firm last November where millions of Americans lost huge money, this has changed things around the CEO lately, and if you have watched the look on Sam Bank-Fred's face lately you will see a guy that is disoriented I don't know if that is as a result of drugs due to the depressing situation or just a game plan to get sympathy from investors who have lost money im the process but against all odds, remaining in jail seems to be the safest place for SBF right now and I don't think he will go through the stress of getting Solana pumped just to meet his bail condition. As a matter of fact, SBF is no longer in charge of things and he has no balance in any of his accounts as he went from billion dollars to a few thousand before his bankruptcy note, so spending 10 years jail term is a kind of safe haven for him until things settle for him personally. Realising him on bail is a big risk to his life because Sam has been the mastermind behind the ruining of many people's life.",

If they can still see other way to survive this major problem, better to do it now without any help from FTX or even on Alameda. The released of SBF is nothing but just a way to skip his liabilities, most probably SBF will start to liquidate and look for other ways to secure his money.
