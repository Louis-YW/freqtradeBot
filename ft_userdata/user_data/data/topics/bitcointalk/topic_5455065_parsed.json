The phenomenon of owned purchases in the MetaverseThe purchase or rental of a property is the first step in being able to carry out any activity in the new digital dimension. Buying a house (and land) in the metaverse is becoming one of the main activities in the new digital dimension, given the possibility of carrying out practically any activity, from simple ones like having a place to be at the start of commercial activities such as shops, sales, and advertising spaces.In 2021, at the peak of real estate transactions in the metaverse, staggering numbers were reached. The prices of land on existing platforms rose by 500%, and the transactions exceeded a total value of 500 million dollars. After an important correction in terms of economic value, which occurred last year, many believe that this is the best time to invest in the real estate sector. Thanks to the large growth rate, the phenomenon will become increasingly well-known. The increase in demand, especially in the most prestigious metaverses, will likely drive prices up.“Investing in the Metaverse today can be likened to buying a house in the countryside before it develops into a big city.”The metaverse of The SandboxThe metaverse of The Sandbox can be understood as a three-dimensional virtual universe that can be explored through the use of avatars representing real users. Just like in the “analog” world, even in the metaverse, it is possible to interact with other characters, travel, buy objects, build, customize, sell, or rent properties in which to live or start commercial activities.Buy a property in the MetaverseMetafutura Srl, an Italian company made up of expert builders, has launched the “YourVerse” project, which will be a place with real estate properties, events, and exhibition spaces that will facilitate the purchase and sale of owned properties in the metaverse via NFTs. The acquisitions will be signed through Smart Contracts, intelligent contracts that leverage the blockchain to define unmodified and extremely sophisticated transactions, with the deposit of the purchased NFTs in the buyer’s wallet. It is essential to emphasize that in the metaverse, purchases do not take place with traditional currencies. The system is, in fact, linked to the blockchain, and cryptocurrencies are used for buying and selling. The Metaverse Real Estate Market has entered a vortex of strong growth, and given the potential for the future, therefore it seems to be the propitious moment to invest in the sector.It is important to underline the twofold implication, on the one hand for the user who buys the property, which is realizing an investment that also entails the acquisition of a sort of “showcase” in the metaverse of The Sandbox, as well as to participate in activities of socialization and a series of events that will lead to the expected and unexpected beneficial owners (participation in exclusive events, gifts, airdrops, treasure hunt etc …)On the other, for those who develop an economic activity, they can find a way to generate a profit directly or indirectly, creating events, sales, marketing activities etc…YourVerse, a unique proposal1000 exclusive properties managed with NFT Zoom of the map of The SandboxThe project is carried out on a 2x2 Land on which a thousand properties managed through NFT arise, divided as follows:•   Deluxe apartments•   VIP apartments•   Robot-apartments•   Shops•   Megastore•   Billboards of different sizes1000 properties accessible to all.
