  "content": "« Not your Keys, Not your Coins ». « Don’t keep your Bitcoin on exchanges » These advices are excellent, and no rational person with a genuine interest for Bitcoin should ignore them. There's no need to explain why, when you consider the number of scandals, scams, exit scams and accounts frozen / seized by the different CEX; because, let's not forget, CEXs work hand in hand with governments.All the people advising this are therefore informed that CEXs are not reliable, do not work in our personal interest, and rightly so.However, every time I read this on the internet, people stop at the Bitcoin storage step. That's not enough. There's another important step: exchanging Bitcoin.So why not just advise and tell people to stop using CEX entirely? Bitcoin is by nature decentralized, why make it centralized? Why should a CEX that doesn't deserve to store our financial funds, our cryptos, deserve to be left with our banking and personal information?Is it really that important to take the risk of having your funds frozen, losing your personal data, and enriching these useless people? Who wants to contribute to CZ's wealth, or encourage Coinbase in their disgusting practices?Some will reply that CEX users choose \"convenience \". Even that's not true! How is passing your KYC to Binance and using their UI easier than installing/using the Peachbitcoin (for example) app? It’s not! The only reason CEXs are in this position is because they benefit from substantial advertising resources.We have effecient, fast, simple, user-friendly and totally P2P solutions at our disposal. For example :-Bisq, a great P2P exchange, focused on privacy-PeachBitcoin, their motto is #KYCfree-Robosats, simple and efficient for those using Lightning network-Majestic Bank, where you can swap BTC and XMR in a privacy-friendly way-LocalMonero, another P2P exchange platform ; privacy focusedThere are plenty of others, which you can easily find on kycnot.meSo why not advise people to use these services, in addition to advising them to use a non-custodial wallet?Why shouldn't we be as enthusiastic about advising people not to use and register on CEX as we are about not storing their BTC there?Not your keys, not your coins. No CEX at all. P.S. : In this topic I'm not interested in altcoins and launchpad / launchpool type products, I'm only talking about Bitcoin exchange and storage. Personally, I don't think any launchpad justify a KYC procedure, but it's up to each individual to determine his or her priorities.For those who want to read more on this subject, I highly recommend this topic from GazetaBitcoin",

You can choose non KYC exchanges to buy Bitcoin and some altcoins, then hold them in your wallets.The most challenging problem for many people is: they are not investors, but they are traders. They trade a lot, with many coins and tokens so they end up to use centralized exchanges. It is a biggest issue to maintain non KYC practice. They only can achieve non KYC if they are not trading many altcoins to get rich.I read your note.You should add this topic  Reminder: Do not store your coins in online accounts.",

We do not have that privacy, but we should not leave our coins on exchanges, that is very important.

It is the first no-KYC exchange that we recognized, but no more because they will start mandating KYC starting from July 15th, which is just not more than two weeks from now.If you say no CEX at all, that is not possible, traders rely on CEX to trade.

It offers the added advantages that DEX can't offer, which include higher liquidity, zero exchange fee and much more.DEX would have done it if it has the power. Aside from keeping Bitcoin private and preserving ownership, CEX offer more benefits that people will turn a deaf hear to what you have to say about DEX.",

Because most think like this- you need to find a trader that matches your offer, which is not so easy- it's more costly as with a CEX they survive on the trade fees, with a P2P the guy that is always there to handle your exchange is doing this for money also, so the rates will be lower, and also you're going to pay the transfer fees- are you uncomfortable with CEX knowing your name and face? Then are you happy with a total stranger on the internet knowing your full name and bank account when you do a so-called P2P exchange?- with a CEX you always think you have support, you send some coins, you exchange them, and that's it, there is no third party with which you have to dispute sanctions, there is no fear of somebody doing a chargeback, there is no fear that you might have just bought coins from somebody who is going to be raided tomorrow and he has your contact as last person called in his listQuote from: iwantmyhomepaidwithbtc2 on July 03, 2023, 10:17:22 AMSome will reply that CEX users choose \"convenience \".

Converting them to the available ones would still require you to swap them to your currency. My only advice when dealing with these exchanges I.e centralized one’s is that do not treat them as wallet but rather as a marketplace where you buy and take off your funds. As for traders use two or more of them so that when one eats the dust you down you have another to turn, considering you never leave off large amounts on any of them.

The P2P scammer are easily gotten by the KYC they submitted. Sadly this is the advantage of it",

Personally, I never buy BTC (my BTC comes from mining + signature campaigns and my salaries paid directly in BTC), but I do sell some dusts on a regular basis. I regularly receive offers for currencies other than USD or EUR, which I accept. Depending on the country and the bank, conversion fees below certain amounts are not a problem (at least for me). I give preference to the less common fiat currencies when I sell, precisely because the point you raise is true, some users have difficulty using their local FIAT in P2P.

I sell some BTC to pay for certain things, and like everyone else, I'm not against the idea of BTC having a high fiat value. But I would have said the same thing with BTC at 3,000 usd, which is basically the same to me. I'm not denying that CEX has helped push up BTC's popularity and therefore its price. However, I don't deny either that they are contributing to denature BTC from its original purpose.Quote from: dzungmobile on July 03, 2023, 10:24:32 AMIt is more easily you don't trade and only invest.

US or UK? Go for Coinbase, for example, and benefit from some state protections if things go wrong with the exchange.And most regular people might also need to account for tax and insurance on their post-crypto wealth. A CEX might make that life easier.It's hard enough to get people to safeguard their coins with sole custody. Getting them to then use P2P with low liquidity and multiple steps for errors without protection is a next step farther down the line.As a lot of users already mention, we're trying to understand that people want ease and assurance.

      "body": "Well, OP, for trading only CEX makes sense. DEX makes no sense for regular trading.And the Bitcoin DEXes don't have a lot of volume and so charge well over the current price, so their is a fee issue with them. Also you can only buy in certain amounts - the amounts that people are selling on the DEX. Over time hopefully Bitcoin DEXes will get much higher volume and so they will get close to the exchange rate of Bitcoin and will have lots of different amounts to buy and sell which will make them useful for more people.But yeah I agree with your general idea, that DEXes are better because we can keep our bitcoin anonymous. It's a bit of a chicken and egg probably currently, because they need much more volume to be more useful but more people won't use them until they many more users to provide that volume.Bisq for example only does about 1200 trades per week, doing about 40 - 100 bitcoin in volume per week. That's nothing. And the prices range thousands of dollars away from the actual price of Bitcoin, so that to buy more than a couple tenths of a bitcoin you need to $1000 or more above the current price.",
