I don't know if it's possible for a wallet to vanish, but I know there are some wallets that can vanish after 15 minutes or, at most, after 24 hours. But I did not think that wallets would vanish after 14 years. But after reading your post, I realised you were talking about a wallet named Wallet of Satoshi.The name is so confusing that although I never heard about it, I never used it, so I can't say anything about it. But I wonder if it would be of great importance to US citizens, as in the news they talk mainly about the US. It's closure should not be a problem if it's a non-custodial wallet because the seed phrase can be used to recover the assets anywhere on any wallet.This raises the question: if a wallet is custodial and it vanishes like this, then what will the people who had funds on it do?That's why we should be afraid of these custodial wallets and try to keep our funds in non-custodial wallets. US is narrowing down the laws and regulations on different wallets and exchanges, and this really has made many small or big businesses leave their territories.",

Users simply don't have any other option than to wait for the outcomes of the proceedings if any or simply come to realization that their funds held in such custodial platforms are gone. US government is going to go after any entity or service that gives too much power to users whether custodial or not. Take the tornado cash shutdown for example. It was even rumored that Uniswap and some DeFi platforms might start indulging their users in KYC/AML paperwork in order to continue operating smoothly.

Since Satoshi vanished, a lot of things related to his profile became frozen for a while. So it's fine if the app is no longer used in the US, people will definitely have an alternative. Very soon, it won't be something exclusive to the US anymore; other countries might set their own policies following what the US government has done. I won't be surprised if that happens because the US is considered a world power country, and decisions made there often have an impact on other countries within some period of time. It will gradually start until it is implemented.",

Any custodial wallet can stop operating at anytime, we can all see how centralized exchanges collapse, so such wallets aren't supposed to be used for hodling funds of a substantial amount, but they are not bad for small amounts and to make micro payments when needed.",
