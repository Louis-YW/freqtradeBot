I wished there was a way to restrict those people without being accused of attacking the freedom of speech.Nigeria is fighting terrorism not only in the Eastern part but also in the Northern and Western parts of the country. The terrorism In the East is a product of the struggle for political power and the rise of secessionist groups that are seeking independence from Nigeria. The terrorist in the North are members of Boko Haram and ISIS West Africa. The terrorist in the Western part of the country are militias that were chased out of Libya during the civil war and most of them moved to Nigeria pretending to be herdsmen. The Nigerian military has the capacity and military might to put an end to these internal conflicts and external aggression but because some corrupt highly placed government and military officials are gaining financially from these conflicts, that is why it has lingered for many years. As @op rightly pointed out tribalism has also contributed to the escalation of these conflicts. It is believed in some quarters that the president is sympathetic to these terrorists terrorizing the western and northern parts of the country because they are from his tribe.",

Nigeria is a crack with hard to crack leaders, the country is not ready and willing to change everybody is in one way or the other corrupt on daily bread than future bakery. They have no true democracy, no incredible election or leaders, no sincere youth who will refused elections bribe and corruption. Always complaining after a failed system. God help Africa",

I made an observation, the 144th out of 180 should be in the category of the least corruption countries in the world. When you talk about the most corrupt countries in the world, Nigeria is in top 30. Below are the links 1. https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/most-corrupt-countries&ved=2ahUKEwitkcyyoIH-AhUv9LsIHc5zAHIQFnoECBAQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0uW3mPY8guAHF9GHy1nx4t2. https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/578920-updated-nigeria-improves-in-corruption-ranking-despite-having-same-points.htmlSo far it's very evidential that corruption has remained one of the major problems hindering Nigeria as a country from developing at the same place with other developing countries. Politicians are not helping matters, the citizens are also not also helping matters as they allow themselves to be used by the corrupt Politicians who don't care about the poor masses.",

This can include measures such as the use of technology to enhance the credibility of the electoral process and the implementation of laws and regulations that promote free and fair elections.Similarly, to tackle corruption, Nigeria can introduce anti-corruption policies and measures to enhance accountability, such as strengthening the judiciary and law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute corrupt officials. Also, promoting transparency in government transactions and procurement can also help in reducing corruption.Finally, it's important to address tribalism in Nigeria. This can be achieved through promoting national unity and social cohesion, creating a sense of belonging and shared identity for all citizens irrespective of their ethnicity, and promoting equal opportunities for all Nigerians regardless of tribe or ethnicity.In conclusion, Nigeria needs to take proactive measures to tackle these challenges, through the implementation of policies and the promotion of strong institutions, to ensure a prosperous and stable future for the country.",

I assume the high degree of mistrust in the public administration has pushed many within the population to move their money into Bitcoin, so decisions made by bureaucrats in power cannot affect as much their savings and economical plans.
