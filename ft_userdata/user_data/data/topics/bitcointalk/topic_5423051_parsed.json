  "content": "“Zombies are real on Aptos.”  - We hope to bring a new experience with Aptos Zombies Utility NFT. We hope to have everything in place and ready for launch, this includes ANFT Staking. Only 850 Zombies are to be minted during the genesis phase where eventually we will roll out a second version of Zombies with more items in the collection. Tokens that are staked from ANFT Staking will then be used to be able to mint the second version of Zombies. More about tokenomics to come at a later date, at the moment we’re just focusing on the art. Minting for Aptos Zombies has not yet been announced but for now you can enjoy the artwork provided below, we will also hold a few more sneak peeks on Twitter and in Discord.Linktr.ee - https://linktr.ee/AptosZombiesDiscord - https://discord.gg/wEuFVE5r4zTwitter - https://twitter.com/Aptos_ZombiesWebsite - https://aptos-zombies.gitbook.io/aptos-zombies/Crew3 - https://aptoszombies.crew3.xyz/We like to keep our AptosLabs announcement updated with our latest development as well reply to users, you can read everything here:AptosLabs - https://forum.aptoslabs.com/t/aptos-zombies-zombies-are-real-on-aptos/145938Art preview: https://forum.aptoslabs.com/t/aptos-zombies-zombies-are-real-on-aptos/145938/30Currently working on:- Aptos NFT Portfolio - View every unlisted NFT in one place, click and connect.- Aptos Zombies frontend- Aptos Zombies Staking frontend- Aptos Zombies Testnet Mint",
