The question is when, not how.”Mahmudo says the BTC/USD chart suggests crypto is bottoming out while stablecoins are overbought.“USDT+USDC / TOTAL under the BTCUSD chart.Bottoming zone, again.Stables overbought, crypto oversold.Important to note that we are in a different monetary regime, so caution must be exercised, but this is where we stand on this multiyear structure.”Sourcehttps://dailyhodl.com/2022/07/01/crypto-investors-ready-to-deploy-25000000000-once-bottom-is-in-according-to-quant-analyst/",

For a lot of this money there is not really even another option, since there would be a huge amount of taxes that the owners would have to pay if they cash out to fiat currency. However I think it is not right to say that a stablecoin can be overbought. This suggests that there is some kind of technical analysis involved that would point at some chart pattern where you can see that stable coins will no be put back into crypto. This is simply not true since the price is always the same for stable coins and there is an unlimited supply of each stable coin, that adapts to the demand. So by concept a stable coin can never be overbought because then there is simply more of it generated.",

Surely, once they can see that the reversal mode is on they would immediately jumped on the board and then we can see the rise of BTC again. As of now, this is not yet happening so it is true this is a question of WHEN and not of HOW nor IF.",

Because one mistake could ruin all the savings that were being kept in stablecoins. I am not a hardcore Bitcoin holder but I do think most of that funds should go to Bitcoin because other coins will be easily pulled up whenever it pumps. Investors will most likely FOMO and get their investment back at their preferred altcoin, so it's a win at both ends.",

Otherwise a large number bitcoin users who sold their bitcoin on bitcoin exchanges used fiat and those amounts can not be tracked.Otherwise there is no doubt that at times like this when newbies are panicking, a lot of money is waiting on the sidelines to jump in bitcoin.",

YET (have patience)..that said even with bitcoins price averaging $20k more recently it then suggests that there are twice as many fiat in exchanges then there are btc.. trying to suggest subtly(saying it without actually wording it) the bottom is half the amount of current prices.. this is another mis-leadexchanges are not purely BTC-USD.. they do altcoins also. so they need to account for the altcoin hoard in exchanges aswell to see how much USD is shared across the markets ready to buy, to then get to a better figure of where the amount of USD is that will probably go to BTC. and i guarantee you its not all waiting for a bottom that is half the current. they are waiting for other indicators much higher",

They see it sitting there and that’s why they conclude because the 25B USDT will not be there if investors decided to convert to fiat because it will burned out of the tether supply since each tether is just mint because they paid fiat in exchange for tether and they need to burn the tether if they want to get back there cash. That’s the simple logic behind this stuff.I’m not sure if it’s that easy to know what the wallets of all exchanges are. Moreover it’s unclear who is the balance owner at that time. Could be the exchanges or issuers themselves.",

JPMorgan's prediction might be true because most crypto platforms are taking necessary steps to build back clients confidence on the sector. FTX is leading the drive to ensure that Crypto lending platform bolster their  balance sheet and platform strength. FTX recently gave BlockFi a $250 million revolving credit facility which would help the crypto lending firm to deepen its financial relationship with its clients and attain stronger balance sheets. The proceeds will be used to fulfill client balances across all accounts. Last month, crypto broker Voyager Digital (VOYG)  secured  a revolving line of credit with Bankman-Fried-founded quant trading shop Alameda Research. The loan of $200 million cash/USDC-backed credit facility and 15,000 BTC is to safeguard its customers’ assets from current bear market conditions. Some other crypto firms have been forced to liquidate a large client that “failed to meet its obligations on an overcollateralized loan. While others are cutting workforce just to ensure that they cut expenses and stabilize the company’s financial conditions.",

I remember reading somewhere that the average 30 day volume in the bitcoin market is around 20-25bn USD. So that would mean we could see a huge spike in trading volume which should influence prices heavily. And once we see a lot of new buyers in the market I am sure that others will follow to not miss out on the next rally. The only question remains are we really at the bottom. I really hope so, but the news about a possible famine due to the Ukraine Russia war keep me worried.",
