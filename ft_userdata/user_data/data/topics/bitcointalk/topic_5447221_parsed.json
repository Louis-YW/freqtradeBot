Even $5 can, but considering how the fees on exchanges and dex, you should save first in order to maximize the profit if you meant ia for trading. But I suggest you increase your budget like save some and only do when you got enough. Also do some studying first before engaging into trading cause this isnt something we take so lightly.",

      "body": "If you are buying crypto via P2P, it's possible to start with $10 or less, but if you are buying on the exchange, please note that there are some exchanges that allow a minimum buy, such as Binance, and you cannot buy on the sports trade with $10 because there will be fees attached that will require you to have at least $11 so that after the fee has been deducted, you will still have about $10 to invest. $10 may be small, but you wouldn't want a situation where your little effort becomes wasted, so after you buy your coin on the CEX, do not leave it on that platform; kindly move it to a non-custodial wallet. The $10 you are putting into the crypto market will not yield you much ROI in a short time, unless you are holding for a long time or gradually adding to your investment to accumulate more.There are a lot of members here with trading ideas, so I asked that you move the topic to the trading discussion board, To move to trading discussion, check at the bottom left corner of this thread and you will see move topic. Tap on it and from the next menu, select Economic-trading discussion. good luck",

      "body": "It can be quite difficult to start trading in the cryptocurrency market with $10, as many exchanges have limits on the minimum transaction size and require a larger deposit.Try to buy a small amount of cryptocurrency on an exchange that allows you to start with a small deposit. Some of these exchanges are Binance, Coinbase, Kraken. But you need to be careful, as many of these exchanges charge high fees, which can quickly eat into your funds.Try trading on an exchange that offers leverage such as BitMEX, Bitfinex, Binance. This means that you can borrow more money than you have in your account, which can increase your profits but also increase your risk of losing funds.Consider investing in crypto funds or investment pools such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund. Some of them can accept investments from several thousand dollars, but this can be a way to invest in cryptocurrencies that does not require you to personally participate in trading.",

It's always good to have a little more capital to work with. In my opinion, you would be better off concentrating on increasing your capital. $10 may not get you very far, but if you can save up a little more, you can potentially invest in a wider range of cryptocurrencies. Just remember to do your research, invest wisely, and be prepared for the risks involved.",

If the OP decides to buy Bitcoin or some alternative, then it would be better for him not to make a separate withdrawal, but to do so after accumulating a slightly larger amount of coins. Of course, there is always a risk of keeping cryptocurrencies in a custodial wallet, but on the other hand, it is simply completely unprofitable to withdraw such small amounts.",

You're not limited to buying whole bitcoins but can purchase tiny fractions.I was actually referring to a P2P, decentralized exchange when I talked on securing in your wallet, in which case the bitcoins would have been directly transferred there by the seller, but thinking about it now, the transaction would still be too expensive for such a small amount of USD.",

Although it takes time before this to multiply or even you can lose it for bad decision on trade but you need to think that this is good start to get some experience about trading using real time money. But if you can afford to lose that amount better try to do more efforts to learn about more skills in trading so that yoh can get minimal loses once you start to place your money on real time trades.",

That's why a fraction is purchasing Bitcoin, but be careful in purchasing and always read the terms on the exchange platform that you will use.

You can only make your money to $20 if the price gets double and might be difficult to happen in just a week. So if you're looking for alternative ways to preserve or make it double in a short period of time, I recommend this two ways of earning in crypto space:PERPETUAL TRADING - it's a way of trading that you can be able to use leverage to earn much money with a small movement in a markets price, so $20 in a days is possible. This is not recommendable for beginners especially to those who don't have enough knowledge in trading. Learning what is cross mode and isolated mode is a must.P2P TRADING - is a way of buying and selling cryptocurrency directly to a user without intermediaries so we expect the fee is very low. Though it's hard to trust if the other party would send the payment, crypto exchanges uses escrow to avoid this scenario. You earning is might be small, but as long as you know how it works your capital will be safe.",
