Be Tethered or in any other stable coin if you smell that the bear market is about to come but if it's too late then don't convert and just let it be on its form. And you choose altcoins that you're going to buy, if somebody tells you to buy this coin then you don't have to follow them quickly, that's how you apply DYOR.",

My guess bull market will come again after a few years or after block halving. But if you want to stay active in a bear market shorting is the only thing that I know to survive in a bear market but you need to have timing when to buy and short. There is no perfect strategy in a bear market but HODL is always suggested by most people and buying at a dip is the solution to make a profit when the bull market comes.",

Buying random coins from the top 100 list will not be effective, yes you understand the method properly but you also have to find the right coin not just any coin.And there is no safe asset in the cryptospace,you have to take the risk to get the rewards.If you're not ready to risk everything then just buy bitcoin when it at its red then wait for green days which may happen in short term or long term.",

On a market condition like this then it cant really be avoided for you not to panic considering that its way too unpredictable in terms of price movement which is really that very common on where it is really hard to sustain yourself on fixing on a particular analysis which you are hoping for it to be followed or to be precised.When you do see your portfolio is really going down then you would really be having those thoughts on selling on loss because you are afraid that you would really be experiencing even morelower or losses which is something a very common reaction.",

But anyone suggestion in this situation when we fall in bear market. Lol! It's not really a good time for trading. It's a time of accumulation to be honest. Day trading un bearish market is really risky unless you use a mix of short and long call. So I would rather recommend you to accumulate more of your favorite cryptocurrency. That will help you in medium term when the market fires up! Please remember the trend. ATH was 22k and ATL was 3k during previous cycle. Now the ATH is 69k and ATL seems to have strong suppor5 at 30k level. That's why I am saying to accumulate.",

It's totally depends on you that how you would like to trade, if you are a long term trader then you use in current dip situation and hold for long-term. Then if you are a day trader then you should trade on top notch coin I mean use btc ,bnb ,eth for day trading , you can also use bot for this .",
