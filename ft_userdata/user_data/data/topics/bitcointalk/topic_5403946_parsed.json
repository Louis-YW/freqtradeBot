A general tip is if you'reconcerned about compatibility don't go cheap.

OP you can use any motherboard you like it will work, I have a AM3 FX 6100 CPU and motherboard that I use to build a 5 gpu rig with higher end graphic cards RTX and it works very well, when it comes to old components you need to give it a shot to know.",
