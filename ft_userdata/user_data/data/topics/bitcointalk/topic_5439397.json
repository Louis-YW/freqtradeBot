Those who take loans from banks provide mortgages (collateral), why? Cause they have to sell and if the price of their mortgage increase then they might not able to buy again. In the same way, you might have bitcoin as collateral but you may think the price of the bitcoin may increase more than the interest you are offering.",

I would suggest exploring alternative methods such as getting a loan from a licensed financial institution. I have also applied for a loan from a bank and it got approved and disbursed within 4-5 days.",

Even if you send the passport to your lender directly by post/courier then still you will have an unknown cause if you default on the loan we would not be able to do anything with your passport as you can file a gd about the loss of your passport and you can retake your passport from passport officially.",

Â I don't know what's really going on, but something about all these accounts is very familiar...If they are all alts of one person, that would have to be an incredibly stubborn or certifiably insane individual.

No common sense whatsoever. In what world do you live? Your face on a screen does not prove honesty, nor does it make you a better known person. It changes nothing, it only wastes time. You can walk into a bank, have tens of cameras record you and countless witnesses see your face and the bank WILL NOT give you a no collateral loan.",

      "body": "Let's paint a realistic scenario of someone who needs a short term loan, like the one you requested a year ago:1. Alice askes for a $500 loan2. Alice promises to pay back in 30 days when she gets her paycheck3. Alice is rejected and does not get a loan4. 30 days later, Alice gets her paycheck and no longer needs a loan.So after all that, Alice has to wait until she gets paid through her regular income streams to get the money she needs, and finally got it. Â What does Alice do now? Â Does she keep pestering the potential lenders who initially rejected her request? Â What's the point of that after she already got the money she needed? Â Maybe the point isn't the loan, but the idea of the loan. Â Maybe she's trying to gain the trust of the lenders so she can take bigger and bigger loans. Â Or maybe she's just trying to scam one of the lenders because she feels like she's entitled since she was scammed herself.Regardless, you are not getting a loan here and if you're too stupid to figure that out after a year it only justifies the lenders' decision to reject your request.As for whether you are scammer or not, it doesn't matter. Â You are a newbie who has not contributed anything to this community. Â You have done nothing to earn respect, admiration, or trust from any member of this community. Â Quite the opposite in fact; those who reject you are trolled incessantly because you have nothing else to offer. Â So, for all practical purposes I would warn every lender to treat you as if you are scammer who is waiting for an opportunity to scam. Â Not because I have proof, but because that's the safest path forward, and because you sure as hell look and act like a scammer. Â No proof of you being a scammer is needed, and no one here is obligated to give you a loan even if you aren't a scammer. Â Is that clear enough, or are you too stupid to understand that?",
