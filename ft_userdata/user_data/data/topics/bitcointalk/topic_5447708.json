  "content": "Happy Birthday, Satoshi Nakamoto!I am unsure if this thread should belong to this board. Let the Moderators decide if it should be moved to somewhere else.On This day, A legend was born in 1975. He gave us Financial Freedom. He created Bitcoin and this forum too. This event surely deserves a thread. I just wanted to say Happy Birthday, Satoshi, on your 48th Birthday. We are too busy these days, and sometimes we forget such things. Maybe you are watching us. Maybe not. Where ever you are, Stay safe and healthy! Happy Birthday Again!Edit: I will quote myself,Quote from: Learn Bitcoin on April 05, 2023, 05:51:07 PMQuote from: RapTarX on April 05, 2023, 05:30:44 PMWhere did you get this birth date from? From P2P foundation? I can't remember if I have seen a birth date there. Considering how much privacy he maintained that we couldn't trace him, his birth date can be faked too LOL. If you have any other sources, feel free to share. Sharing such an info would help finding Satoshi Nakamoto I guess.Well, Satoshi himself used this date on P2PFoundation when he registered there (Source). This can be faked. But, That's what we know so far. His Birthday date is claimed as 5th April. If you google Satoshi's Birthday, It shows 5th April. Wikipedia has the same information. Still, this is claimed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto",

But of course we can celebrate his birthday with existing references even though we don't know the exact date. If I want to celebrate Satoshi's birthday, then I tend to use his forum account registration date as a reference rather than some of the dates floating around the internet.",

You can find it here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5193860.0well this is true. thanks for sharing the link to the event. I hope there is the same event about this. maybe we can't celebrate a birthday for Satoshi because no one knows for sure when his actual birthday is. but I think celebrating a birthday for the bitcointalk Forum he founded could also be a tribute to the founder himself (a symbol of respect for the founder). and I hope Theymos do it again fun event like in that link. although I'm not sure I can do anything about art. but yeah I want to be part of the event if it's held again.",

Happy Birthday Again!In many ways I see reasons why this thread shouldn't exist on any board as there isn't any factual evident to the noted events in this thread.We have question of gender?If Satoshi Nakamoto is a single individual or a name of some organisation that existed and are now anonymous?How do you assign a birthday and even age to someone or some group that you don't even know?Good enough you know the date is alleged and so are the games of everyone who dares to include it on the forum and many other online registration out there. You never can tell until there is a document to prove. For someone that cares about privacy and anonymity, this is just another act to elude identification and as you can tell, Satoshi Nakamoto is best at it.We should ne careful not to conceive a wrong idea to make it true.",

That being said, since we are certain satoshi is a human being, that means he indeed has a birthday and I would not mind if this community could find an agreement on when it would be the most suitable time of the year to celebrate it.",

The date is definitely not his real birthday, rather a message or a highlight of a day where liberties were violated to trap citizens inside the depression by banning their ability to buy the only thing that offered a chance to protect their financial positions from the depression.QuoteDigging into the history of financial regulation, the date is found to hold a connection to an iconic moment in American monetary policy.On Apr. 5, 1933, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102, which made it illegal for American citizens to own gold.This drastic measure was part of the government's efforts to combat the Great Depression, which had left the global economy in shambles.Recent sourceedit- Quote from: hosseinimr93 on April 05, 2023, 05:44:17 PMWe don't know who is satoshi and there is no way to know when an unknown person was born.

Whoever you are and whenever you were born, thank you for what you did, and happy birthday Satoshi.Many religious bodies claimed that their founders were born on a specific date and these days become sacred. Just like the Christians believe that Jesus was born on the 25th of December and Easter was the period he died and was resurrected. Since Satoshi is unknown, bitconers can decide to adopt a day as his birthday if it is relevant (birthdays are not important to me, it's just like any other day). That day should be used to engage in awareness about Bitcoin and funds can be raised for certain humanitarian activities. That should be our gifts to him because he loved equality and giving. If today is his assigned birthday, I say Happy Birthday to one of the most selfless and meek personalities.",

The forum's original domain changed twice until it finally became Bitcointalk.org. Satoshi was active in the initial forum on sourceforge.net. After that, the forum moved to bitcoin.org. I think it wasn't until 2011/12 that it finally became Bitcointalk. Satoshi was long gone by then.QuoteI just wanted to say Happy Birthday, Satoshi, on your 48th Birthday.

Happy Birthday Again!Although we are busy with various activities, it is never forgotten that Satoshi Nakamoto is an invisible person or group whose identity no one knows.
