  "content": "Binance has an exciting feature where users of binance alone can send and receive crypto for free via a unique Payment Identification Number (Pay ID). It is fast, free as they have said and very efficient, I have tried out this feature.How to get your Pay ID.(1) Click \"more\" option on the home page of your binance.(2) Scroll down to \"Pay\" under the \"Finance\" option. A page with your unique PAY ID number, and a \"send\" and \"Receive\" option will be displayed. You can send crypto to another binance user with the \"send\" option, you will be required to input the receiver's unique Pay ID. There's an option for ease where you can easily scan a unique QRcode from the receiver. After inputting the PAY ID of the receiver, it is a simple process from there on.On the \"Receive\" option, if you want to receive crypto from another binance user via this method, when you click receive, a unique qrcode which can be scanned will come up alongside your PAY ID, you can easily copy and send to the sender.I hope this method will be useful to someone here, I've tried adding screenshots to make this simple guide more explanatory, but i noticed it is not displaying, how do I go about it?",

You can't with your current newbie rank. It's a forum restriction. You will have to become a Jr. Member at least before your posted images will become publicly visible. There is a way around that and that is to purchase a copper membership. Read about it here.Sometimes if the images are essential to the thread and a higher ranked member feels they should be visible, they will quote your post to display them.",

You can send to another Binance user through email. It is also free.If you are a p2p trader, you will provide you phone number, using Binance also involve full verification, so nothing private. The receiver can provide his phone number for free payment. It is free for sending cryptocurrencies too through nphone number.Binance Pay is free and better because your email or phone number is not required, only binance Pay ID is required and can help not to disclose your email or phone number to the sender.",

This means the transaction that was made can be validated in a public ledger while off-chain was not.  That's why the transaction fee has a low cost or is totally zero.Good to know that Binance adopted this feature, it will really help those small traders that wanted to save fees.",

Especially for users who have retail businesses, sometimes binance is the reason they open a business and start accepting crypto payments. When someone is too comfortable with \"efficiency,\" you can hardly change their minds unless they run into trouble with it sometime.",
