  "content": "CryptoSec.info >>> ChainSec.ioAfter a good amount of thinking, I decided to rebrand the CryptoSec.info to ChainSec.io.The reason being that .info domains seem to look scammy for a lot of people, and knowing that we're in the cryptocurrency space which is full of scammers, I won't be surprised if a lot of people look at CryptoSec.info as something suspicious. Unfortunately CryptoSec .com/.org/.net/.io are already taken so I had to rebrand to something else.Anyway, to the few people who always link to CryptoSec.info when topics concerning security or privacy arise, I appreciate it a lot. All CryptoSec articles automatically 301 redirects to ChainSec so all those article links you lovely gentlemen/women posted will still work.I know my website is just one small pawn in the grand scheme of things, but every small bit counts! I'll continue to work on the website to make crypto security as simple as possible for the masses. Thank you all and have a great productive day!",

      "body": "If it means anything, I believe that you made the right move with the name change. I would recommend expanding a bit more on the information you are offering. Everything you have right now is great from a beginner perspective. If you want a suggestion, I'd recommend explaining the importance of system security. A weak system renders a lot of information useless if a user is vulnerable. This is a great start though and I hope that you build on this resource!Â P.S. I believe you should move this thread over to Service Announcements.",

It doesn't even do any recommendations with concerning to investments; it's just a small website focused on crypto security.",

Just to be clear, it's not a direct sponsorship; but I earn a small amount from referral purchases. Hopefully earning a bit is fine for the community, as building this website took a good amount of effort. Not to mention that I'm personally a fan of Ledger products regardless if I earn referral commission or not.Quote from: hugeblack on March 10, 2023, 08:58:02 AMWhat is the reason for choosing the new name? The old name sounds better.I think the old name sounds better as well. The change was purely for the TLD. .io is simply far better than .info",

Some articles are good in terms of writing and wording, but the problem is always that the bias in writing the article, especially when it contains links to that service, gives the impression that it is a paid service and thus reduces your credibility, but in general the available information is good.Overall, I wish you good luck and make a good profit with as few ads as possible.",
