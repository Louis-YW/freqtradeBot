I don't think money can be used to reduce inequality. Bitcoin becomes profitable if you invest in it. Inequality can be reduced by making and implementing people-centred policies and not Bitcoin. The poor will benefit from Bitcoin if they can invest in it. But you know it's difficult to do that since their focus is survival QuoteThe good things are that Bitcoin could help people who don't have bank accounts get access to money.  This would let small businesses grow and people could easily send money to each other, even across countries. The major reason why people don't have bank accounts is poverty. Some people don't have extra funds to save in the bank. These days you don't need to go to a physical bank to open an account. Another reason especially in developing nations is poverty. When you don't know how to read or right, you can't operate an account or even a wallet. QuoteIt could also make things more transparent, so there's less chance of corruption.  Basically, it could give people more control over their own money.Corrupt government officials will still devise means to steal funds. They can still inflate contracts or use some privacy tools to make transaction tracking difficult. Bitcoin could be effective in international trade since middlemen are not involved. Nations can make a profit by hodling the asset. It also promotes privacy giving citizens control over their financial transactions. But the government wants to control everything about finances, that's a big problem.",

People themselves should follow the right path but which is not possible because people are intelligent than one another and also not everyone have the right exposure.

But the government of a country can help in having better economic growth and development.Quote from: franky1 on January 28, 2025, 07:03:36 AM\"bitcoin could\"well yes could, but in the last decade it has been seen that the development and coding has been changing bitcoin to be more institutional friendly and less accessible to the poor, uneducated, unbanked parts of the worldHow will the poor be able to afford bitcoin even if bitcoin price is still low? That is not possible unless they have the money to buy. But many of the poor will also call bitcoin a scam at the early stage while most of them do not know what bitcoin is.

Not anymore! Bitcoin now has become a cash cow for the corporates. Also many governments are now actively thinking about adding a reserve in Bitcoin. So the wealthy section of the society is now a part of the game and it will ensure that riches get richer and poors get poorer. Bitcoin cannot help easing the inequality anymore.",

Because that person never shows enough interest to invest in Bitcoin with little money,( you can follow the MicroStrategy company as a rich person.
