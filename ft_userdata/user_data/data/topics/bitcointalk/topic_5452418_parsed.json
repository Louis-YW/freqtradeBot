They also have an ann thread over there but there are not many reviews[2]. I guess most people are just buying instead of selling gift cards so you don't see many reviews. I think I guess you can take a look there and ask if you do have some questions. Btw, you already made a similar thread asking about this. I think you can just bump that thread in the future instead of making a new one.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=989661[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1884536.msg62228344#msg62228344",

Anyone tried this website before ? Since you're considering your service to include the general exchange of gift cards with cryptocurrencies, this discussion ay not best fit on this board except if your consideration is centered only on bitcoin exchange for gifts cards payments, however it will be more preferred you move the thread to service board or to altcoins discussions board where it could be properly discussed by members.",
