  "content": "The concept of Soulbound Tokens was proposed by Vitalik Buterin and two other authors in the whitepaper entitled Decentralized Society: Finding Web3â€™s Soul in May 2022. Ever since then, a fully-decentralized society has been outlined with how Soulbound Tokens(SBTs) can function as unique credentials. However, the use cases have not been that abundant compared to the attention received back then. What really holds back the application of SBTs in Web3 ? Project FireDAO intends to use SBTs and hopefully this will be another new use case. What do you think ? Please let me know.",
