Look at the longer-term moving averages, and the tendency is still crystal clear. Understand that all short-term price moves are pure speculation and have (almost) nothing to do with Bitcoin's future prospects.Quote from: Greg Tonoski on January 18, 2023, 09:52:05 AMWhat important signal/information escaped (Bitcoin community) attention? What to catch-up on?I think one aspect which is often ignored is that there are better informations every year about Bitcoin's user base, which is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions (globally) by entities like Coinbase and Crypto.com (last estimation: 402 million for late 2022 (for all cryptocurrencies, more of half of it is believed to be BTC), see here for their latest full report). To know that there are a lot of people \"on board\" should give a bit of relaxation to many investors/users.Also I like to follow Lightning's growth, although the websites tracking nodes and channes seem to have run into technical problems lately.",

Elon manipulative acts and that FTX fraud is indeed  the main ones who did make out some huge effect into this market.Now we are slowly recovering but not really that much basing up into those percentages.",

But the collapse of FTX had not stopped when it was reported that Genesis would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the near future.
