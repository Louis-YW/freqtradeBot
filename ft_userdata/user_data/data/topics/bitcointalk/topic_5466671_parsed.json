Since its local I guess it's easier to win, their SM numbers are very low, so it's a relatively high chance to win.Regulated in Estonia and recently shared some mica-ready license so seems abruptly safe.Entrants need to follow SM, register and make a purchase.More details here: https://zondacrypto.com/en/news/zondacryptos-bitcoin-giveaway-win-1-btc-and-elevate-your-crypto-journey",
