  "content": "ðŸ§¨Crypto took a hard hit early May. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, fell to around $29000 from its all time high of of almost $70000. Other cryptocurrencies fell too and people started to wonder whether this fall would be permanent, but will crypto rise again? ðŸ”®Itâ€™s likely, but it wonâ€™t be a walk in the park. Shortly after the collapse, the majority of cryptocurrencies began to rise in price. Bitcoin started trading around the $30000 mark but remained largely below that for the time following the initial revival. Since then itâ€™s been a roller coaster ride for cryptocurrencies and they are yet to reach levels near where they were before the crash. ðŸš€Right now, the bull market rages on. Cryptocurrencies are still experiencing ups and downs while remaining largely around the same price theyâ€™d reached after the collapse. However, sentiments on the market are largely positive, with many experts and investors optimistic that major cryptocurrencies will reach new highs just not very soon.",

Today Bitcoin is trading at around $28K which is quite a dangerous zone for Bitcoin. It would fall more at any time since there isn't any major news to come out. Terra dumps the whole crypto market but not sure if the market start to recover after the Terra fork. The overall situation isn't much better right now till Bitcoin stay above $30K.",

Or were you just looking at the charts upside down?I was sort of thinking the same thing. Â The prices of most coins are down 85% and Bitcoin's price has been cut by more than half from the highs. Â I wouldn't call it a bull market. Â I'd say we're in a straight up crash and have been for more than half a year now. Â It will soon be time to start buying again to prepare for the next wave up (once capitulation lowers the leveraged long positions). Â I feel like this cycle we didn't get a good moon shot, only two failed attempts. Â If we do hit another raging bull market, it will be something to behold as there is a lot more awareness this time.",

But mate I would pretend to agree with you that some(definitely not many)experts are thinking that a new all time high would be achieved soon. First you have to check what the all time high is and the present state, Bitcoin has the highest ATH and thatâ€™s over $70,000.

Luna's sudden death cost them immense loss and now they wish everything would have a miracle that would help them regain their lost money. As of now, bitcoin has not seen any signs of bullish return. I don't think we'll see a bull market anytime soon, the crypto winter is just beginning and will extend to the next bitcoin halving.",

(bad combo to not stake fiat to a thing thats described as a fiat stable coinyep they never bothered to actually keep dollar reserves themselves to stake/peg stablecoin.. so now they need dollar to make people whole.this is just temporary.. once they sell their btc. they wont have any more btc to sell. so sell-off endswe are going through a crypto summer and some are getting burned. whilst others are seeing the sunlight and discount of bitcoin as a way to sunbathe, ride the waves and enjoy the warm feeling from cheap btc.this is not a crypto winter. and it wont last until winter. winter will add more layers of value and the price will rise. ..ethereum however is a different crash. and is going to continue to decline due to the switch to PoS soonish.. which is going to re-evaluate a ethereum 'bottom' underlying value from over $1k to only a couple dollars. after all it doesnt cost much to sign blocks on PoS. so expect ethereum to not grow.it was the PoW of over $1k that gave ethereum a value over $1k. take the PoW away and boom. underlying value drops to PoS rate. which is only a couple dollars a coin. so watch outdont expect ethereum to be worth this much next year.try and ride the temporary waves this summer to keep averaging down. or cut some losses now. and hold fiat or swap to btc until next year.. to then buy ethereum at next years super low.",

Other cryptocurrencies fell too and people started to wonder whether this fall would be permanent, but will crypto rise again? Whether it is stock market or precious metals or even crypto, there is no permanent movement. Assets always tend to go up and down for various reasons.Crypto will rise again? Yes it will. Markets tend to go down and up and it's the same with crypto.Quote from: DBX CRYPTO on May 27, 2022, 05:38:53 PMðŸš€Right now, the bull market rages on.

Sentiments of the market largely positive? Are you f*cking serious bruh? If you will see the fear and greed index right now, it is at 13 meaning investors are in extreme fear and worried to invest. Experts and investors being optimistic? Yeah yeah its pretty obvious that if there are some pessimistic ones, there are some optimistic ones as well. I disagree though with what you said that right now, the bull market rages on. It's pretty obvious that we are in a bear market and many are saying that we are already. U.S stock market going down, war going on, interest rates going up, quantitative tightening upcoming, inflation. The current events are against the market which is why it goes down and that includes crypto. We aren't in a bull market anymore right now but the opposite.",
