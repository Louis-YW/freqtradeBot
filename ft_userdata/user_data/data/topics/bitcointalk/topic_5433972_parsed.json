      "body": "It is called a commitment transaction because you put up a certain amount of Bitcoin which should be considered as collateral. This collateral is used to ensure that both parties can fulfill their obligations in the event of a disagreement. The parties that have opened up the channel can perform an unlimited number of transactions between themselves without having to broadcast each one to the blockchain. Then once the trade has finished they can close the transaction and only then is the amount broadcast to the blockchain.To open a channel you need to make a payment and the person you are transacting with needs to make a payment. Both parties need to be in agreement to open and close a channel.",

      "body": "Bitcoin lightning network need both parties to make (receiver and sender) a payment on top of the transaction because of the structure of the lightning network being built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain to enable fast, off chain transaction which is called the commitment transactions.  So the reason for the payment on top of the ongoing transaction is to enable a fast off-chain transaction.A commitment transaction is a type of transaction that locks up a certain amount of Bitcoin in a 2-of-2 multi-signature address, where both parties have the ability to spend the funds. This creates a \"channel\" between the two parties, allowing them to make an unlimited number of transactions without having to broadcast each one to the Bitcoin blockchain.You can find more explanation here: https://medium.com/softblocks/lightning-network-in-depth-part-1-payment-channels-b943607950dd",

In fact, nobody does a payment in the sense of spending BTC using a regular Bitcoin P2PKH payment transaction. In the vast majority of cases, channels are opened unilaterally, which means that just one party deposits funds ('make a payment' (?)) during the channel creation. The result is that the channel partner just has a balance of 0, so the channel is maximally unbalanced. That can be fixed as soon as you have more than 1 channel or by spending e.g. towards your own on-chain address through a submarine swap or buying something online.@OP, maybe start here. Take your time, it's worth it.",

Did you sell a business or a house to them?",

You know most times these scammers tend to use some gibberish words so as to be able to deceive those that are not familiar with the system. If someone who had never used the program before should see the \"Required Minimum Hash Power on Reflection ID:\" they'll think it's something that's necessary for the transaction to be done.",
