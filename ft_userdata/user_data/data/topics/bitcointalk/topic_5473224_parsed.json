It's the first time I've heard of the domain 'democrat' and as much as you base the game on smart contracts I don't know what relevance the word democratic has in a game that is based on wanting to fleece the other guy (I'm not saying it's undemocratic or anything, but the word is irrelevant).I don't see what 'democratic' difference there is between playing poker there and playing on a fiat site like Pokerstars or a crypto site like Stake.com (which by the way has a much better domain).I wish you good luck anyway.",

I appreciate your opinion and respect your point of view. However, I would like to explain why I think poker.democrat is a domain name that is suitable for poker and gambling websites.First of all, the .democrat extension is a new and trendy domain extension that appeals to a large and diverse audience. According to Namecheap, .democrat domains are ideal for anyone who wants to express their democratic values, beliefs, or opinions online. They are also great for political campaigns, organizations, movements, or causes that support democracy. Therefore, poker.democrat is a domain name that can attract more visitors and customers who are interested in poker and gambling, as well as in democracy and its principles.Secondly, the word \"democrat\" in poker.democrat is not irrelevant or meaningless. It suggests a place where people can play poker and other gambling games in a democratic and fair way. It implies a sense of community, freedom, and fun. It also differentiates the website from other poker and gambling websites that may be perceived as unfair, rigged, or fraudulent. Poker.democrat is a domain name that can build trust and loyalty among the users and create a positive reputation for the website.Thirdly, poker.democrat is a unique and catchy domain name that combines the words \"poker\" and \"democrat\". It is easy to spell and pronounce, which makes it more attractive to potential customers. It is short and simple, which makes it easier to remember and type. It is relevant and descriptive, which helps to attract more traffic and increase conversions. It is also unique and distinctive, which helps to stand out from the competition and build a strong brand identity.In conclusion, poker.democrat is a domain name that is perfect for poker and gambling websites. It has many benefits and advantages that make it a valuable and profitable domain name. It is not just a random combination of words, but a meaningful and appealing name that can create a successful and popular online platform for poker and gambling enthusiasts.I hope this clarifies why I think poker.democrat is a domain name that is suitable for poker and gambling websites.

There is no doubt that the .com extension is the most popular but this doesn't mean it's the safest. Someone can purchase a very nice .com domain and will later pull the rug. The idea of domain extensions and domain names is for branding and easy memorization as it has nothing to do with reputation.Whether Op chooses .democratic or .undemocratic, it doesn't matter so much only if they find a way to prove to the community that they are reputable.",

Wish you luck with the selling of your domain, it has potential, but it would also require quite a big advertisement investment. I agree that using the domain name poker.democrat to attract poker players who support the Democratic Party is a creative idea. It can be a way to stand out from the crowd and appeal to a certain range of customers. Smile However, I also think this can be a risky move, as it might alienate or offend some potential customers who have different views or political preferences. It can also cause controversy or unwanted criticism from the media or the public.Good luck!",

I have seen more blatant political advertisement for the sake of boosting attractiveness of products and services. Besides, I would dare to say that in Las Vegas there are both Democrat and Republican gamblers. In general, those Republicans who complain about things which we may consider to be ridiculous have more to do with gender theory, taxes, gun control. If you pay attention to it, No republican campaign has actively targeted gambling and there must be a good reason for it, don't you think? If OP was able to also acquire poker(dot)republican, then he could appeal to the 100% of the political spectrum in USA (who are gamblers)",
