  "content": "I have been doing solo-camping for years, but I have not left the borders of my country. Recently, I decided to do my first solo-camping experience in a new country, and after research, many advised me to go to Tanzania (specifically Zanzibar), since there are direct flights from my country at reasonable prices for an average-income person like me.I have studied almost all the details of the trip and only one point remains, which is that I intend to stay for several months in Tanzania and perhaps visit a neighboring country. But my country sets specific conditions for the amount of money that I can carry with me (not exceeding $2,000). Of course, the ideal solution is to use Bitcoin ; I mean, I buy bitcoin from the black-market in my country (since crypto is not legalized in my country) to use it later without having to use fiat money in the first place.I have some questions that I would like to find answers to from local residents or from those who know the nature of life and economy in East African countries. And That's why I decided to bring it up here on the forum :- Is Tanzania a crypto-friendly country? And what are the limits of that?- How can crypto be exchanged into local Tanzanian TZS currency in a completely safe way, and are there services in Tanzania (Zanzibar in particular) that accept bitcoin payments?- If there are difficulties in using Bitcoin for a foreign traveler like me in Tanzania, are there countries in the same East African region that provide easier solutions?- What suggestions can you give me to help me with any parts of the trip? Knowing that I intend to travel beginning of next July.",

      "body": "Quote from: coupable on May 01, 2023, 08:54:55 PM- Is Tanzania a crypto-friendly country? And what are the limits of that?Tanzania has a large population that uses Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mostly in the urban area. The government of Tanzania is discouraging the use of cryptocurrency which is why they are planning to introduce the central bank digital currency (CBDC). But for now, there is no legal framework that regulates crytocurrency operations so there might be no restrictions to crypto operations since it is not banned. The country is crypto-friendly since citizens are allowed to use it without restrictions.Quote- How can crypto be exchanged into local Tanzanian TZS currency in a completely safe way, and are there services in Tanzania (Zanzibar in particular) that accept bitcoin payments?There are many functional crypto exchanges in Tanzania which include Kraken, Binance, Remitano, BitPesa Tanzania, etc, but they all require KYC and might ask for a bank account to which you might not have access to. But some online banks issue credit and debit cards with just emails but they can not be trusted. So basically the problem you might face is how to have a bank account where you can withdraw your funds after using these exchanges. Quote- If there are difficulties in using Bitcoin for a foreign traveler like me in Tanzania, are there countries in the same East African region that provide easier solutions?I am not sure if there are many business that accepts bitcoin for payments. If they exist they might be very few. P2p transactions are also few so the major difficulty you might face is how to convert your bitcoin to the local currency. Kenya will be my best option because it is more crypto-developed than Tanzania.Quote- What suggestions can you give me to help me with any parts of the trip? Knowing that I intend to travel beginning of next July.The first and most important issue will be security. Ensure you get all the information from the embassy before entering the country. Avoid keeping late nights and don't move around with large sums.",

In addition, the use of automatic translation tools for posting in local sections is prohibited according to the forum rules.In fact, I expected to get many answers from local Tanzanians or even those living abroad.

I don't know if this is positive news for crypto enthusiasts.Because we know that when it comes from or directly from the CBDC, it is clear that it is under the regulation that someone controls. In which is for us it is not good.

In addition, solo camping is a really difficult task, and no margin should be left for any error. I will stay in my tent, cook my own food, and maybe buy a bicycle for transportation. On this basis, the amount of $ 2000 seems sufficient, but I want to put guarantees for any of the contingencies that may occur. I read on the Internet that the city of Dar es Salaam (the economic capital) is relatively dangerous and has high crime rates, and this is the city I intended to settle in. Therefore, I chose Zanzibar because it is a tourist destination and is fully secured by the authorities. Campers come from all over the world, and I am in the process of communicating with some of them. Bitcoin is the most important security for me, since I am not limited to two thousand dollars, and since I am not required to declare it or for anyone to know about it.",
