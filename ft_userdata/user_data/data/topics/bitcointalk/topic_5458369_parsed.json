I see that you are asking for a loan of 250â‚¬ which is a small amount for someone trying to promise you that you will make $50,000 a month.This type of trading is closer to fraud because you depend on the speed of your bots to achieve your profit, but why not try to start with small amounts and then prove that these bots are worth the investment?I do not see an opportunity to make a profit unless it is within a pumpanddrump group, which requires a lot of liquidity or scamming customers by giving them false promises.",
