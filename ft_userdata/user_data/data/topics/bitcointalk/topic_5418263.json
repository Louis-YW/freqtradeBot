The economic theory behind the situation is that , investors,people more keen to get fixed and sure income streams. people tend to deposit their money in to banks instead of investing volatile crypto and shares. I mean not all the money. So money will flow to crypto to banks. so then we can expect a crash on BTC.",

I mean not all the money. So money will flow to crypto to banks. so then we can expect a crash on BTC.well I have been talking about this for over a month.So we all know the feds will do 0.5 or 0.75 this will flatten rally.But and this is a very big but in a very high stakes game. the CPI will post Dec 15 and if it stay drops to say 6.0 or less btc will go up as people will expect feds to not raise rates. This CPI/FED hike/ BTC loop will last til Dec or Jan or Feb or March or maybe even April  but it will not last forever.I hedgeBTCBondsSilverand BTC mining gear.",

So money will flow to crypto to banks. banks still pay nothing as far as interest goes. any interest they pay doesn't even keep up with inflation. and no one is making alot of money sticking their money into a bank account just to collect 0.1% apy. or even 10 times that.",

      "body": "In my opinion this is still the beginning of the recession and I say recession about the USA but also European countries are feeling it as well. I think globally and more so due to Ukraine and Russia conflict there is increased gas and oil prices which is felt on all transportation of goods thus the prices go up. USA economy and housing market is topping out as mortgage rates are hitting all time highs of 7-8% which pushes house prices down. Nobody is buying as borrowing. A mortgage loan at these rates is ludacris. Us stock markets are stillIn bear trend. I predict the Dow to hit a bottom of around 26500 before hopefully rebounding in the end of first quarter of beginning of 3nd quarter of 2023. Sure there is always money to make in bear markets but it’s more risky and harder to time. Side note what does this mean for crypto? I think crypto follows the greater stock and world economy more then anything lately. We’ll see a small rise up but following the weekly and monthly charts were still in a downtrend // bear market as well and I just don’t see it coming out until said next quarters and possibly quarter two of 2023. Bull run hopefully next year ? Idk just my opinion as always and not financial advice ! Comments and thoughts are welcomed.",
