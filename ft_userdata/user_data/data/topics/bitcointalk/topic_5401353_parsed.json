The problem is that we are founders, artists, developers.We have a marketing person in our team, but at the moment she does not have much time. So we need a new person in our team. We call it PR manager. Here is a list of the PR Managers responsibilities: 1. Make a marketing and promotion strategy.2. Prepare and publish all our news.3. Manage marketing related tasks like bounty campaigns etc.4. Be responsible for any partnership tasks.5. Collaborate with other projects.What do we offer? 1. We offer a stable income, but of course there is a probation period of 2 months. Our success is totally your success. Stable income mean that if we get sales you profits very well.2. Long-term job with a lot of opportunities.3. To be proud of what you do by helping others. We are not looking for 3rd party service.

      "body": "Marketing is a quite complicated and important task for a project. The success of a project depends on Marketing and development. The most important is not to waste Marketing funds which are quite challenging and the most project failed due to wrong marketing. So hope you will choose the right person. However, I have been working on a couple of projects as a marketing incubator or manager. There is a couple of projects who raised funds successfully with my marketing plan and some project is ongoing. If you feel I can help or you want to see the previous project that I worked on and currently working feel free to DM me on Telegram. Good Luck.",
