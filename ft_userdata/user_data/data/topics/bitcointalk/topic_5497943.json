If you DCA then and do so during a bear market when the price is low and dropping, the profit margin will be way higher than that.With DCA, less stress for investment and with a long bear market like 2 bearish year and one warm up year before a bull run, investors have many months for DCA.With DCA, with many months, they will not need to find bottoms but DCA can help them to average their entry price around bottom price and it will bring very good profit in a bull run.With DCA during a long time like 3 years, total money spent for investment will be surprisingly bigger than imagination of investor. We don't realize how much money we spent for investment, with DCA regularly, after 3 or 4 years. If we check it after 4 years, it will shock us and with profit from DCA, like x2 or x3 from bottom price, portfolio value will be bigger a lot.",

I think simple facts like that will make people pay more attention to Bitcoin than trying to explain why Bitcoin is so great. It has a great \"wow!\" factor. You show someone this graphic and they are gonna start thinking about why they are missing out on Bitcoin. Then they start learning about Bitcoin and start understanding they absolutely should start owning bitcoin.",

These kinds of posts FOMO the fuck out of the paperhands on twitter who think bitcoin's going to be the solution to their poverty. So when they spend and invest money on it and find out it's not making them any richer any quicker than they hoped to, They sell and swear against it, urging even more people to hate on it which hampers with the progress of bitcoin in general, cause instead of having newer people who are more supportive of the coin and are gonna hold no matter what, instead we have more haters who are going to swear against bitcoin even if it became the signal to the second coming of Jesus Christ. Anyways, just goes to show how profitable bitcoin is even if it's not that \"profitable\" to us. Consider the fact that this is when bitcoin's still sitting comfortably in the 10k mark, what more could you have gotten if we reach newer heights in this upcoming bull season, which is bound to happen since that is the trend that bitcoin seems to follow through anyway? Just gets me more excited to invest in and hold the fuck out of my coins until the heat death of the universe, LOL!",

Everything, going to the supermarket today is much more expensive than in 2020, buying a house is much more expensive today and buying bitcoin is much more expensive in 2020. So I would blame the stimulus cheque rather than thank it.Besides, it's a biased way of doing the maths. The price of bitcoin ranged in 2020 between $5,000 and $30,000. For the sake of accuracy, I'm going to assume an intermediate figure of 17,500, since the checks were given after the March 2020 crash. That would be 4x, and instead of the $12,192, it would be $4,800. And if you got it at the end of the year, it would be 2.5x, or $3,000.So I don't buy the hype, no matter how pro-bitcoin I am.",

      "body": "This has been the hype before honestly. There are a lot of people who actually bought bitcoins or crypto with the stimulus checks they received at the height of the pandemic. Those who did were actually smart enough to take their chances and have probably reaped the sweet rewards after. I remember that time I was also actively buying bitcoins and ETH thinking that my expenses were dramatically lessened given that I'm working remotely and I don't have to pay for transportation or gas. The rest of what I am supposed to spend outside goes to bitcoins, and it has been something that I'm actively doing even today. Lots of times I have my coins more than what I put in and it never failed me, all because I believed in bitcoin and took the chance whenever I have it.If you missed these 'checkpoints' you can still DCA and get good returns eventually. You just have to be consistent at it and make sure that you are not selling immediately whenever the price rises.",

Overall, holding has more benefits than trading, and we all know to do holding first we must have an investing mindset. People getting this fund, are might be in need, or have other expenses, why would they think of investing it in BTC at that time?TBH, me when get some bonuses or money either from airdrops or from other sources, I don't think of investing it in BTC I think of using it to pay off debt or to meet other expenses. I don't know if it's natural, whenever I get money, or get the news that I am going to receive money, expenses come into being don't know from where. It's like they somehow know I am going to get money ðŸ˜‚.",

FTX fiasco is terrible and it makes capital of many people vanished within a week and severity of this fiasco can be bigger than Terra collapse because FTX is a big exchange with millions of users and it is related to many other companies too.However I don't see connection between people who have stimulus check and FTX fiasco. The following website has more information about stimulus checks.https://www.bitcoinstimulus.net/totalstimulusTo be honest, I don't know about the stimulus check story but years ago, there was massive airdrop with $100 in Bitcoin to MIT students. It was distributed in 2014 and most of students sold their bitcoins to enjoy.MIT students to get $100 worth of bitcoin from Wall Street donorHow many of them hold their bitcoins till 2024?MIT students to get $100 worth of bitcoin from Wall Street donorQuoteUndergraduates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology will be given $100 (Â£59) worth of bitcoins when they return to study this autumn, in an attempt to jumpstart a bitcoin ecosystem.The project is being led by Jeremy Rubin, 19, an undergraduate in his second year at the university, and Daniel Elitzer, an MBA student at MIT's Sloan School of Management. Between them, the pair have raised more than $500,000, principally from Alexander Morcos, an MIT alum who works in high-frequency trading in New York.",

Did most of those who got the stimulus in 2020 kept it and instead of buying groceries, they invested it and bought some Bitcoin.There might be some who did, but most I believe didn't do it. I mean during that year, people are having a hard time on everything. Some might not have any emergency funds at that time to help them in times when they needed it. There are some people who lost their jobs at that time hence, they needed money to survive. There are some who prefer to survive than the possible profits that they can get thus, they used that stimulus to buy some goods.I believe only a few people bought Bitcoin at that time, but for those who have bought it, congratulations because you have a huge profit currently. It's just amazing that Bitcoin outpace other asset classes in terms of profitability. Anyway, those who have emergency funds might use some of that stimulus to buy Bitcoin, but those who doesn't, didn't invest it at all.",

So I would blame the stimulus cheque rather than thank it.Although injecting money into economy like this always has its negative side effects but if you do some quick calculations you'd realize that the entire stimulus package program was too small to be blamed for the inflation situation today.For example the checks people received was coming from a $2.3 trillion budget and it was only a small portion of that budget. The rest went elsewhere like $500 billion of it went into government loans to companies, $349 of it went into other loans to small businesses, $150 billion of it went directly to local states and governments.Now compare that one time amount with the $1 trillion the US government has been printing every 100 days and you'll realize how miniscule that stimulus package's effect on inflation was...Effects of it on bitcoin price has been even smaller because generally people are not making investments in a recession. In fact this is why price doesn't like rising these days since most of the world has been in another recession for the past 1-2 years.",
