Despite this consumers will spend more on Black Friday this year. According to a new survey of 3,006 shoppers by Emarsys revealed that one in five (21%) U.S. consumers will do most of their holiday shopping on Black Friday — with over a third (35%) increasing their spend from 2021. Isn't this surprising? Why is this so? The reason is because consumers are spending more discerningly to maximize the value they get for their spending. In short, value is the topmost thing on the minds of the consumers. Interesting findings, isn't it? Lemme know what you think? Are you spending more or less on Black Friday deals?",

Even the FED(eral reserve) is sticking their nose in the ground.But the thunderstorm is most likely to come next year - this year is finished anyway. It'll be like 2008 so do yourself a favor and instead of dumping a lot of money on Black Friday, save that money to buy Bitcoin while it's still available for cheap.",

Black Friday comes every year at a fixed time so more than 90% of the spendings are actually pre planned. People don't make impulsive buying choice during black friday. They obviously tend to buy more products if they get a good deal. But the sale is mostly driven by the pre planned purchases. That's why you will possibly see a similar kind of buying interest from the retail consumers this year as well.",

Interesting findings, isn't it? Lemme know what you think. Are you spending more or less on Black Friday deals?Recession coming doesn't mean that people will not jump at any opportunity to buy things at reduced cost. There's a hype with Black Friday deals, they make you believe that the prices are down, and you can get good deals that will be available for a short period. The pressure becomes real, and even if you were playing it safe before with your spending, you can easily forget about the economy and get some things during the Black Friday.",

I am really surprise that even in the face of warning and doomsday predictions, people are still increasing their expenditure. Even if the spending is pre-planned, is not possible to make adjustment and cut these expenses. People prefer to be in debt than to cut their expenses through change of lifestyle. Like NotATether pointed out, people might not believe that recession is coming or they are finding it very difficult to cut their expenses because they are used to a particular lifestyle. I think most people in developing nations have started reducing their expenses because recession is already here.Maybe due to the sound economic policies of most developed nation, their citizens are still enjoying economic prosperity, so they still have more money to spend.",

Everything becomes a lot cheaper on black Friday, you just can't ignore it. When you see a 50% discount, even if you have money, you just borrow it from somewhere else and buy that thing anyway. Impossible to ignore these opportunities.Black Friday is where the merchants make the most sales. I always renew my hosting packages and domains during that time of the year and profiting almost by 50%. Buy whatever you can, you are not losing money, you are making money by buying stuff.",

Yes, people have been saving for this day to come so eventually if they will find good deal to buy, then they can maximize their purchase as much as they want. I guess that’s a human nature, when there are huge sale in all items, they will never let it pass. And besides, if they can go for early shopping this year with bargain prices, then they don’t have to go rush shopping when the holiday season comes.",

Are you spending more or less on Black Friday deals?In my experience Black Friday has just morphed into a day that retailers now exploit to the max, whereas when it first started you could find many genuine high quality promotions, now it is hard to find anything that has not been cynically planned to exploit clueless consumers. I remember picking up things like domain names for $1 or finding many excellent deals which saved money, when the consumer had the upperhand and retailers were still trying to join in the hype. Now it's like they jack the prices up a few months beforehand, specifically to drop them over this weekend and the customer does not get a special price at all. Sometimes prices can even be higher but marketed in very sly ways.",

We all see it that the recession is coming, and then so what? If we are still able to budget some funds for this Black Friday, then no one can stop us really. Aside from its a good opportunity to buy at a low market price, it saves our time and money than just going to regular malls and avail their original high prices. So it’s certainly an individual’s preference. Even myself I am tempted to buy, but it also depends on how much extra money I have.",

If high inflation is on the way. It makes sense to buy as much as you can in the biggest sales of the year. To maximize purchasing power and stock up in the event of future shortages. It will be interesting to see what the purchasing breakdown of black friday sales look like in 2022. Are consumers purchasing luxury items or focusing more on bare necessities. It would be gratifying if solar panels, guns, water filters, solar stoves and similar items were flying off the shelves as people prepare for economic worst case scenarios.It has long been known that electronics and store bought items are purchased as inflation protection assets.

Psychological reassurance that the product was bought at a cheaper price gives positive emotions and awareness of the correctness of one's actions.

They get used to good things very quickly, and it is almost impossible to wean them off.

Cancun broke all tourism records, and airports all over the world have done the same leaving behind 2019 numbers, the malls, the parks the restaurants are full, and it has been a pain in the ass to reserve a cabin with some friends for New year's Eve a month ago!!!Just because a recession might be at the door because we have a 10% inflation it doesn't mean the world is stopping!People need food, people need appliances, you need a laptop or a phone to post here and if that becomes outdated you do buy another one!The economy and consumer spending doesn't stop because of a thing like this, it didn't stop in 2009, it didn't stop in ww2, and it's not going to stop now. Despite all the drama people still have money to spend, and if they decide they would want to take advantage of a bargain sale, it's pretty normal to see numbers increase!Quote from: Russlenat on November 08, 2022, 09:52:59 PMWe all see it that the recession is coming, and then so what?

Or maybe people of the remotes area who hardly shop online are beginning to trust it more this days and it proportionally increases the purchase on black Friday. Outta context!!

Even people who don't need it, they want to buy it because it's cheaper products. In fact, we can call it completely creating perception. If there's a really good discount rate, that's a good thing. There are too many products that are shown as discounted and are not discounted or discounted to a very small extent. They want to deceive people in this way. I'm not sure, but when we say black Friday sale, most people will buy things, even if they don't know if they really need one on that day; it's a tradition for them to go to the mall and grab something. I'm sure this year's Black Friday sale was much quieter than last year's; on social media, there are a lot of videos of people storming the malls, grabbing items, and punching everyone; they're really feeling the economic pressure right now because even though the items are on sale, they're still not affordable, and it's better to spend the money you're supposed to spend on item sales in food.",
