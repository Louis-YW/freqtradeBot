  "content": "Let me start with November sentiment, I could not believe it would happen, FTX customers fund misappropriation later surfaced and led to more crypto bear market, this further downtrend sink bitcoin below $16000 to $15400 in November, from $21000. See the sentiment:Quote from: Oshosondy on October 31, 2022, 09:01:15 PMBitcoin highest price in August was $25200, $22800 in September, $21100 in October if it does not surpass it in few hours away to the month of November. In 2018, these three previous months were similar in a way the price of bitcoin did not have much volatility but followed by a massive bear market that decreased the price of bitcoin from $6600 to $3600 in November before the next massive bull run started that drove bitcoin up to $13970. 2022 has been predicted to be bearish and it was, just a month left to 2023 which is less than 2 hours away. It was not easy all through this year, but continuing to DCA would yield good return later on. Those that are losing should not sell by now when the price of bitcoin has reached significant lower price, it is wise and a good strategy to buy more using DCA.I saw this today which could indicate bull run later on, but I do not know if it would be in December, but people are accumulating is all I guess and that December will not be bearish, not just because of the report, but I am sentimental about it and because the bear period has been long enough and not knowing what could hallen again like FTX that could further sinking the price down.Quote from: https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1597043997041889281?s=20&t=Eez4ldqeBUPSpn7KxGBnzQBitcoin Shrimps (< 1$BTC) have added 96.2k $BTC to their holdings since FTX collapsed, an all-time high balance increase.This cohort now now hold over 1.21M $BTC, equivalent to 6.3% of the circulating supply.There are some positive news coming is all I could think now and I do not think there would be further decline. But what FTX has caused has still not gone, but the price of bitcoin may not decrease much further, though no one knows if it would decrease further or not, but good to DCA and continue accumulating for the next bull run is knocking, but we do not know how soon it would be, but very close to us for it to come true.Let us guess what the price of bitcoin could be in December. Is it going to be bearish or bullish or just boring with little volatility?",

      "body": "Good thing that we are now seeing green marks in the market such as with 'main' tokens. A good indicator in my opinion but won't guarantee recovery before this year end. Problems and issues are still fresh on investors perspective which might give them hesitation whether to invest or not at this point. To some, it would be good to invest already but we cannot blame those investors who are waiting for a clear trend line before they engage investing in tokens of their preferences. I'm guessing that the market price could go up to $18k if green marks would a bit last long before this year end. And if not, maybe it would be firmed with $16k. So for now holding and waiting, I guess, would be the best thing to do.",

Crypto-market is still in the effect of the long-term bitcoin bear market and the recent issue involving the FTX, it contributes more to the possible long-term extension of the ongoing bear market.With that said, I don't think there will be a sudden rally and this situation will remain at least until the end of the 1Q next year.Again, just speculation.",

Well, hopefully, Bitcoin will become bullish by next month but as of now, no one can tell.  Continue buying through a DCA way would be the best idea as of now.

Fed raised interest rates, and many news that they will lower interest rates this will be positive information for the market but this month, OPEC will officially cut oil production, which is likely to exacerbate the energy crisis and will worsen the economy. Along with that, the downward trend of FTX has not stopped when the next notable name is Genesis, if they declare bankruptcy, this will have a significant impact on the market. My personal prediction is, bitcoin can't hit $18k by the end of this year.",

Here the trade has been very good.  And currently I am in profitable stage.  Because the market has risen so fast that it is beyond imagination.  But I am very happy with the trading because currently the bitcoin market is very fast.The decline that occurred in Bitcoin is also faster, and you also need to be careful when you see a faster increase in Bitcoin even if only in a very small size. Because the increase that occurred in Bitcoin from $ 16K to around $ 17K is very little and it is still not enough when viewed from the hopes of many people who want Bitcoin to be able to re-create ATH in the near future. A slight increase is only good for trading in the short term, because everyone can immediately sell with a small profit before buying back at a lower price.",

No big moves imo, Also still doesn't have any basis to think about having a bull run since FTX issue is huge and maybe one of the reason why people might not trust to invest for a while knowing how bad the market drop so far. Also December is the season where mostly people take some money to spend so there are possibilities that this could affect there investments and might we cannot see any good changes or huge bull next month.",

If bitcoin get to $20000, it is good, it may stay there or fall slightly less, but staying there for awhile would be an indication that more people will buy just to leave this bear period, this would be what will lead to the next bull run in which bitcoin may rise above $30000 to $40000. The profit from just  buying at $16000 if it grows to $20000 is not small amount of money for those that bought at low price. But that is not the main point, the main point is that buying bitcoin now is going to be highly profitable, the best time to buy is when some people are not buying because of the market condition is red for a long time which is a time like this. I too expect $20000 to be a resistant price, but likely before next three to four months, bitcoin would have surpassed that price again.",
