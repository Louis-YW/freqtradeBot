  "content": "Bitcoin Mining Using SHA 256 Originate from NSAIn the year 2001 SHA 256 otherwise known as Secure Hash Algorithm 2 was said to be developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and is believed to be used as one of the means to verifying bitcoinÂ  transactions on the blockchain technology, i consider this when i discovered many challenges on bitcoin regulation and mining oppositions coming from the US these days, i asked myself why has the government developed such negative mindset approach on bitcoin adoption and it corresponding mining.This gives more reasons to ask why is the government still in doubt of bitcoin adoption knowing fully the origin and technology of blockchain it operate on, are they doing this because of the decentralization of bitcoin or is it because of Satoshi Nakamoto anonymity and tremendous success on bitcoin creation.I seem not to understand something clear, if SHA 256 was founded in 2001 right before the launch of bitcoin in 2009, what is the major intent of NSA when they created it before it application on bitcoin network? Is there any other applicable use of SHA 256 aside the verification of bitcoin transaction on the blockchain network?",

I don't know if it's a standard or just what the systems I have seen use.Also it's the standard of a lot of VoIP things, although that might just be coming from the SSL side in general.And so on.It's a popular standard, I would not read much into it being used for BTC.-Dave",

The OP also honestly sounds a bit like a shitpost, but if 348Judah actually doesn't know yet, there's this great, free online resource that would have answered his question immediately. It's not very well-known, but it is commonly referred to as 'The Wikipedia'.Here's a super secret link that brings you directly to their article about SHA256:>> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha256 <<Quote from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha256#ApplicationsThe SHA-2 hash function is implemented in some widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.

So, joking is the only option to give any answer fitting both groups at once, because those who really believe in such nonsense are beyond saving.Edit: Don't forget about clearing cookies, if there are too many of them, they can significantly increase your transaction fees: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzoW_GO45vk",
