      "body": "First of all, I really love how simple looking the website is no to much design and also very easy to navigate around and if I'm to rate it over 10 then it would be a 7 for me. But I kind of encounter an issue I'm not sure if it's the same for all devices but mine kinda looked awkward.Here's what I'm trying to say, the Sign up button seemed to have been masked by the background since both of them have the same color, so it's very difficult for one to spot the button unless they hover their mouse over it or accidently click on it. I think you should try to change the color to something more conspicuous. The part of the page that I found most interesting is the  CARD  section like the pricing of the card is just something else, how on earth will you charge 0.4BTC for a verve card and 0.8BTC for a MasterCard  like that's really got me thinking, if I spend up to approximately 1BTC just to get my card then how much will I use the site to hold? I think you should reconsider the pricing.",

      "body": "A lot of things to talk about in this but let me start with the website. The color scheme is so bad, the designer didn't even bother to check that the sign-up button isn't clearly visible since the background is already red and the button is made red as well. The menu, the layout of the website, all of it just doesn't really impress someone at all.Coming to the second point, in the footer section, it says (c) 2004-2023, which actually refers to the starting and the current date from when the service was started and whether it is still continued or not. And, as per whois, your website was registered on 2022-06-03. How do you explain that?",

The whole project looks like a scam and if you check Op you'll notice that the WhatsApp number he provided is different from the one on the website.On the website the contact page gave us +44 7418 397080 as their WhatsApp number but Op is providing a different contact. My question is if Op is truly part of this project and not an impersonator why did he provide a different contact info? He should provide the official contact info and remove his.",
