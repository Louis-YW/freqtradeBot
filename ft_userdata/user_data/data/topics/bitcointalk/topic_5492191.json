Unless you're trying to fool some ridiculously incompetent adversary, this probably wouldn't work and would essentially be a confirmation that you use Bitcoin. Distraction won't work at all, and a decoy wallet that contains a small amount of Bitcoin would probably be a better idea.",

If your idea is to create a decoy wallet then simply add a passphrase to your seed phrase and then halve a little amount on the seed phrase wallet without passphrase and the main wallet will be that with passphrase. Or better still just keep to the different wallet and different seed phrase technique",

BlueWallet allows you to define a different password which will decrypt a \"fake\" wallet set up. For any situation where you are forced to disclose your access or for when you don't want to show your real wallet.Also have you heard about duress mode on Unstoppable wallet? Re: Unstoppable wallet {User experiences}. It is a good feature also. With the duress mode, you can give different wallets different password and that will be the only wallet that will be seen. I mean the wallet that you enter its password will only be seen despite that you have more wallets on the Unstoppable app.There is another feature on Sparrow wallet. It will require you to enter your password first and then followed by passphrase. If you enter a wrong passphrase, it will give you different keys and addresses. The only time you will be able to access your coins is when you enter the correct passphrase. I prefer Sparrow wallet.Testnet bitcoin is completely different from mainnet and ranochigo is correct about this.",

With the different security configurations during testing, the testnet functions just like a safety net to encourage innovation and learning and earning, but the tokens earned isn't real money that can be used on the mainnet.Thus, only good developers and those with better understanding and intelligence of the Blockchain network, would be able to create testnet wallets and use it to conceal or use it as a distraction to prying eyes and often so switch to the mainnet when they intend to do real transactions.",

Someone who compromises your machine and gets access, can compromise both your mainnet and testnet wallets. They might be disappointed that the testnet wallets are worthless, but they will provide absolutely no security nonetheless. Just really secure your wallets and don't depend on security through obscurity which is evidently not wise.",

If you are in a situation when someone has access to your devices and can threaten you, they will not stop unless they get something, and if they for some reason have a good idea about how many coins you have, they won't stop until they get them all.Obscurity rarely gives security, it's just an obstacle. The best defense is to never get into these kinds of situations.",

For more additional layers like 2fa and other different wallets that provide different ki nd of features set, make sure to find the open-source decentralized wallet.",

Maybe the fact that they need to introduce the password if they want to switch from testnet to mainnet wallet is the secure step, but they would have to introduce that password if the software wasn't running. And the fact that you are running the testnet node doesn't mean the block on that main net is on a sync process.",

During a period of frank honesty, he stated that it was not possible to protect property from determined thieves. All you could do was to spend more to make it harder, and buy time before they could achieve success. There is a point where the perceived time involved, and the risk of being detected is not worth the rewards. It seems to me that the more diverse and obscure ones investment structure, the less likely one is to lose many assets.  This is a policy that was adopted by the knights templar when they created their veil of tiers trusts to preserve their wealth. It has been so successful, that their descendants and associates still control over half of the wealth in the western world.Multiple wallets and drives in various locations is one easy way to utilise this concept. There have been many suggestions in this thread, and, of course, they are all good and practical solutions to include in the mix. I just though that the inclusion of a testnet wallet could be one additional method to add to the mix.",
