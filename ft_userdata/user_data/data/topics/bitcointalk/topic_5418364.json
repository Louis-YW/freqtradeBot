In fact, in most EU countries (Czech Republic, Lithuania etc.) VASP registrations are being managed by the registry of commerce (Trade Registry, Registration Office).That may also come as surprise to you, but even actually regulated financial institutions (like electronic money institutions, payment institutions, investment funds) do usually operate from completely different address than one stated on public file. From my experience, and believe me or not, I have worked as regulatory compliance consultant for some 5 years, it is completely acceptable by standards of, for, example Financial Conduct Authority in the UK when you show them 12-month agreement for a fixed coworking space or two plus pin-coded locker and only store some basic stuff related to company activities there. Of course, if for example, inspection comes to your formal place of business you're supposed to be there, however in 99% cases notice is made well in advance to ensure you would be available, so in the meanwhile you would be good working from Starbucks/home/another office, you name it.Now, to the OP. My advice to you would be: stop planning what you are thinking of doing to localbitcoins staff members now, refrain from stalking or incentivising someone to bully or incite harm on company that operates on legal basis. Even if you are angry/frustrated. Even if you think that you've been scammed. That would not help to return any of frozen funds and would only create many more problems for yourself and anyone you're going to drag into stalking LocalBitcoins employees. Finland is no kind of banana republic or drug dealer state where you are Judge Dredd and your rights enforcing instrument is loaded gun.Research thoroughly Terms and Conditions again and learn what you may have done wrong. Even if you have done anything wrong, you still have rights to return back your property (bitcoins in this case). Consult with someone competent (paralegal, lawyer), draft a formal letter of complaint/demand, send it via registered mail by real post. Don't use any hateful language and threaten them with anything apart from legal proceedings. I personally do rarely deal with such cases as you may have already have told the support something that raised all AML alarms (it is a well-known risk alarm when someone is trying to evade due legal process and starts making demands with threats/harassment), but still you may drop me a line on Telegram (t.me/fintechops) and we can discuss what could be done legally to unfreeze your btc's",
