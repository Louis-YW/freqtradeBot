I hope I was wrong as I wasn't sure about this project will even more grateful than BNB and Solana, and even those on the top 50. In this bear season, it is too hard to figure out a new project to become a new asset in the market. This basis is not enough to say that this is a hidden gem but as I've said unless it was proven. I would say OP, it was just a speculation and marketing strategy to compare a NEW project vs the most reliable Bitcoin.",

This comparison is being used as an advertisement to tell the story about a project that can overcome the whole of projects that already exist before. This is BS. All of the features are LIVE, working, audited code.It's fully decentralized, has it's own decentralized, on-chain governance model.It has much better features than bitcoin, you can stake it and the system can be regulated. Staking has amazing features. \"Team tokens\" are locked for 4years+.It's a great system.It's not listed on coinmarketcap because of low volume and low liquidity. This is intentional, low liquidity allows quick and explosive price appreciation and liquidity will be added later on(you can buy from the contract at 5M$ and 10M$ marketcap, funds go into decentralized treasury and will be used to be added to liquidity)Even a small amount can go a long way, you can swap from any chain(Polygon, ETH, BSC). IF you want larger quantity, you can buy from the contract on site",

High volatility allows for big price increase, and the liquidity will be added later on to stabilize the price.People start to believe when the price goes up. So it could be rewaarding to take the risk on now.",

A hidden gem means something advanced with great potential that has yet to be discovered, accepted and believed in. Which i believe this 100% is.You gotta buy early on. If you buy when everyone thinks it's a good idea, you will buy the top and suffer a big draw-down after purchase. Buy for the technology. When people buy because price is going up, it's a bubble. And all bubbles eventually burst.Those who were buying bitcoin at 5$ or even 100$, did so because they believed in the technology. Those who bought at 69,000$ bought because they thought they were going to get rich quick and earn easy money. If you bought at 5$ and held through the dip, you are still up x1000s on your investment and you do not really care. If you bought at 69000$ top you are down more than 60% and are REKT.",
