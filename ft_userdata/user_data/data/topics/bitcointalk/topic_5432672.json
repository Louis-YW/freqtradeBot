The current price of Bitcoin is 16,532$ But on January 2, 2023, Bitcoin's position is slightly downward.  Because the Bitcoin market predicts the price of Bitcoin to hit $30k between April and May 2023.  If Bitcoin stands in this position then the price of Bitcoin will touch the highest level between September and October.The Bitcoin market is at its peak and this is one of the biggest opportunities for us small investors.  If an investor can invest in this opportunity, he can grab millions of dollars by the end of the year.  Positions that currently hold bitcoins will no longer hold positions.  2018 to 2019 was in the current phase.  So we can never miss this great opportunity.  This is the biggest investment opportunity.Assumptions I think the price of Bitcoin will reach its peak by the end of 2023.  Estimates can hit 100k dollars.  This is the biggest opportunity for us to invest.What is your comment?",

But you are right, this is a good investment opportunity, those who do not own or want more bitcoin should take advantage of this moment because the opportunity will not come many times for us to choose freely. And I want to tell you, bitcoin has the potential to be profitable, but it's not easy to make millions of dollars. Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick tool.How much do you need to invest in bitcoin to make millions?",

It's just bitcoin alone but the whole crypto space. Some projects literally had to shut themselves down because they lost more than enough money due to collapses which was supposed to be their trading volume and liquid money. I think it is safe to state that Bitcoin is still doing great and we should continue to HODL it no matter what. With the 2023 we will surely see some good hikes because one it is still strongest player in the market and two we are closing towards the halving.",

If there are in fear right now then they can be the hodlers who are inexperienced. This bear right here, can be their first long time bear so they are worried and thinks that the market won't recover anymore. I hope they can still be able to control their selves as this bear shouldn't take too long anymore.I know that the bull run is just around the corner. That is right, we shouldn't be focusing on something that is terrible because that is not beneficial to us but if there is something that we should focus on, then that is to buy more coins and continue hodling because we know that we will be rich from this one day.",

Recent events have forced Bitcoin price to remain at a declining state for a while but the break-out stage may come as the year progresses and investors and traders start having a positive reaction to the market because what effected Bitcoin price was external factors arising from bad news and events in other cryptocurrency projects. That \"discount\" is something people fear because they see themselves as the product owner whose product is not discounted, not as the buyer whose item they want to buy got discounted. If you switch the side then you would be happy about it, but they somehow can't switch the sides.I also own bitcoin and I do not consider the price drop as something bad for me, even though my portfolio has been down a lot recently, I still see this as a good thing and yet they do not, which is not terrible and I understand that, but that doesn't mean that we should be focusing on anything terrible neither, I am fine with it and I do not see it as a problem at all.Discounts were supposed to be a good thing because that simply means you will be getting the item for a cheap price, so why will they fear it? If there are in fear right now then they can be the hodlers who are inexperienced. This bear right here, can be their first long time bear so they are worried and thinks that the market won't recover anymore. I hope they can still be able to control their selves as this bear shouldn't take too long anymore.I know that the bull run is just around the corner. That is right, we shouldn't be focusing on something that is terrible because that is not beneficial to us but if there is something that we should focus on, then that is to buy more coins and continue hodling because we know that we will be rich from this one day.Gold went sideways from 1992 to 2003.about 400 in 1992 and 400 in 2003 never going over 450 in that time frame or under 200.so who is to say that we simply stay in a 14k-30k slot for next five years?I suspect all of 2023 we are in 12k to 25k slot. Prep for that.be like JJG and just dca.say x dollars a week. for all of 2023with preset dip buys at 15.5k and 14.9k of 4x",
