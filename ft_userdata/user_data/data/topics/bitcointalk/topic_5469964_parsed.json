  "content": "What happened:: Circa 2017 UQUID was offering a crypto debit card service and later ran an ICO which earned them quite a bit of money. I was promoting their services via an affiliate link and got to earn quite a few referrals. Up to the hundreds iirc. I was one of their most prolific early supporters. This activity wasn't very lucrative to be honest. I believe that in spite of the fact I was referring hundreds of new registrations to them, they weren't very honest with their statistics and payouts. But what I'm making this scam accusation about is that after the ICO, Uquid rewarded their early supporters with a (then) minuscule amount of tokens. Back then that amount of tokens they gave wasn't even worth the gas to send out of their platform. And I thought that since it's the utility token of their platform, it would be pointless to withdraw to my ETH address as it would have little to no use elsewhere. So I just left my UQC tokens in the uquid platform. Years passed and Uquid became quite successful. I looked back at my tokens and they were worth something now. I tried to log in to my account but much to my surprise the account's balance was ZERO... See the conversation I had with Uquid after I noticed that below. Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=844100Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2161156Amount Scammed: at least 50.95 UQC tokensPM/Chat Logs: Additional Notes: As you can see in the above images, it's clear that Uquid scammed me by denying me access to the ICO tokens that were deposited to their platform on my behalf and I fairly earned by promoting their services. And this is just a single commission payment. Presumably I must have earned more from being an early user and having referred tons of early users, but as there's no record of that, I'm simply asking for the UQC tokens I can account for, nothing more. It's not like Uquid is a small mom and pop shop, they're a recommended Binance.com payment partner and have a lot of sales volume from digital goods and payments. They CAN pay me, it's just that they don't want to. And it's not like this is a lot of money either but it really touches a nerve to know that a big company owes me money... They should be responsible with user records and balances. Simply saying \"it's not easy to access the system\" isn't a good enough excuse when you handle other people's money.",

That is what I want to know, if (1) they did have a swap, (2) you never initiate the swap and they require every token holders to initiate a swap.If that's the case, maybe we can still recover this, you probably can tell them that you had the old token and ask if it's still possible to do a swap. Many platforms allow manual swap [basically the admin personally credit you with their token, instead of the swap being automated by sending to a contract] for \"late\" participants. Of course, that is unless they specify otherwise, that any swap after certain date is not possible.It wont hurt to ask them about the swap.",

Most of the time, it's because the part of their security (They cannot do anything for user balance) unless is by their user it sefl. If the swap policy requires you to leave the balance in your account without any action, then is not a problem.One thing, I want to point out for @OP. This commission is from ICO, right? you should know, that every token earned during ICO by commission/buy always needed withdraws from the ICO-Dashboard Campaign. Some projects advise users to not store it on the page otherwise the token will be lost (If you keep the token on ICO-Dashboard). Seem like they don't have any data left right now because they already deleted the data (the user is required to withdraw the token, otherwise will be lost).UQUID response: https://t.me/uquidcoinofficial/93335 & https://medium.com/@uquidcoin/6-things-you-need-remember-after-the-ico-is-finished-837ce52323b9. It's not effected for commission/referral but also everyone who are invested and leave the balance on the platform. They already give the user deadline for withdraw the token.Just take the lesson, never leave anything and keep your self up to date for the project token you are follow.",

The reason, after the deadline withdraw token from (ICO-Dashboard) being passed they shutdown the dashboard due everyone has being given the deadline, timeline and warning to withdraw their token from the platform.After the deadline passed, any token left on the platform are considered (lost) and you cannot get any information from them due the data has been deleted since they told you + give you some deadline to withdraw the token.

Sadly, this is not how it is. As ryzaadit also attach to his post, they had deadline, and has announced it to their community. Clearly this is in reference to those that actually BOUGHT into the ICO. Commission tokens where given to users AFTER the ICO finished and were available into each user's user ACCOUNT, not in the ICO page. Uquid is clearly in the wrong for not keeping logs of user balances and they even admitted to not having kept this data in a direct email to me. Googling about this only brings up irrelevant data so no need to spread misinformation if you don't know, even uquid themselves haven't provided good enough documentation. Did you see how long it took them to even investigate this matter internally when I had contacted them? If you look at the screenshot of the 2017 email I provided it's clear that the coins were given as a user transaction (same format as if I had received referral commission which I was able to either withdraw or spend via Uquid.com as user balance).",

Nope. You're wrong. idk why some of y'all are so adamant about this... As you can see, the crediting on the UQC tokens happened in the same format as comissions for affiliate rewards were given. These were paid out directly to uquid.com user accounts and had nothing to do with the ICO. These balances were spendable or withdrawable from a different account than the ICO page, with uquid.com user accounts. Even the date the UQC tokens were credited to me even appears to be outside of the the fund raising happened.",
