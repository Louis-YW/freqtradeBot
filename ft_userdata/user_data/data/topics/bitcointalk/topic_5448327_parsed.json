  "content": "I havent touched on solidity at all. for those who has been programming with solidity, i have an idea of a coin:something related to living will/trust.I have created traditional living will it is more thna 100+ long, extremely difficult to interpret. i dont feel comfortable leaving such document for my child and other beneficiaries. so i thought digital will that can have following capability:1.can specify time of distribution with big flexibility: xx percent on year 20xx, xx-1 percent on year 20xx+x, xx-2 percent on year 2022x+y.2. can specify distribution percentage: xx percent to whom etc.,Once times specified in #1 comes in, coin will be automatically be distributed.3. Override capability: specify X number of persons who can override. Number of percentage of X persons to agree to override if disagreement arises.",

      "body": "That is surely possible.If you want to create a new token, specifically designing such a requirement is feasible. I think even if you want to use a native token(ETH) instead of a brand-new token is also possible. The thing you need to look around is Hash Time Locked Contract or HTLC, you lock the coin on a predetermined hashtime which can be calculated around the specific date you want to redeem.For further information, take a look at the GitHub repository that seems to implement the three things you want: https://github.com/chatch/hashed-timelock-contract-ethereum. Do your own research, I only skim the repo.",

      "body": "Of course you can if you have a real will. It will be a little difficult and it will take a long time if you are not used to dealing with programming languages, but it is definitely impossible.The matter is sensitive and I think it is wise to seek the help of an expert, even if you know what you intend to do. Ethereum provides smart contracts for many projects, including the launch of a cryptocurrency, and the matter only requires changing some values in the code according to the characteristics of the token that you intend to launch, but in any case, the opinion of the experimenters is necessary, and this is difficult to do only by sharing the project with the community.",
