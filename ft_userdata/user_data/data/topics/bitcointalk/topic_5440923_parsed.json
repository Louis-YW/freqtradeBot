Slash Web3 Payments supports more than 1400 tokens from at least 6 different protocols and is constantly expanding to increase those options.Another key difference is that Slash does not charge their merchants any installation fees or transaction fees. Instead, a percentage from the slippage is taken.As an example, in order to pay for a transaction in USDC, payers are not restricted to paying with existing USDC tokens in their wallet. They can choose from their own available tokens, such as, perhaps, MATIC.Slash will compare and select the best on-time rate from decentralized exchanges and do the conversion automatically.It is required to have a Metamask wallet or any of the Walletconnect-supported alternatives.After clicking the generated payment link or scanning the QR, the payers will see the amount and will have the possibility to choose from their own available tokens the currency that they want to pay with.Slash is working actively to increase its customers and partners primarily in Japan, but also, in other regions across the globe such as LATAM, USA, Canada, EU, Africa, and Asia.Among the current targets, Slash is appealing mainly to restaurants, retail & e-commerce (fashion, travel), luxury, and multi-payment providers, among other industries.The startup raised 1.5 Million USD last year in a seed funding round from MZWeb3Fund and several private investors. It is currently raising a Series A. This will help with Slash’s efforts to become one of the global leaders in cryptocurrency payments.If you want to learn more about Slash, have any questions, comments, or wish to send collaboration requests, please contact the team directly at discord Slash Web3 Payments.Website: https://slash.fi/Twitter: https://twitter.com/SlashWeb3Medium: https://medium.com/@SlashWeb3Discord: discord.gg/JHFFAq7zNa",
