  "content": "Hi guys,Lucky me actually..Something happened while I was playing QUICK PICK on L0tt0.com yesterday, normally, my maximum bet for each number picked is always the minimum which is $0.25 cent, and I always pick not more than two numbers which costs me $0.5 cent per round, but while playing the game yesterday, I did not know when my finger touched the \"Select bet value\" slide bar and increased my bet value to $1.75 dollars for each number picked, I then picked my usual two numbers and I was billed $3.50 dollars for that round, this was a total mistake which I didn't even take note of until i saw that I won $28. I was like wow üòç, with $0.5 cents for two numbers, what I normally won if one of those numbers played is $4, but if both numbers I choose plays, I win $8, but this time, I saw that I won $28, I was like how come? I began inspecting and discovered that my bet was not $0.5 cent, but $3.50 dollars, I was like what the heck, a mistake that turned sweet for me üòãüòã.So by this experience, I am moved to ask you guys if any one of you have ever made such a mistake, but it turned out in your favor? Please share with us.",

      "body": "I have not made such mistake before, the ones I can remember is in crypto trading, to use too much leverage which is the default. Despite the leverage is too high, I use exactly the amount I wish to use but the default leverage which can be high as 20x make the mistake to happen. But in gambling that the gambling site set the staking amount to the lowest amount which is the default or the amount I set it, I do not make any mistake like that. I always look at the amount I want to use to stake while gambling before staking at all.",

      "body": "I also made the same mistake as that, but that too with a smaller bet, when I bet on the Limbo game where I should have bet for $0.2 but instead I typed in the number $2 and by chance I bet for a bet of 5.50x and that was really correct. touched it and made $10 more, usually I often make that mistake but often fail too and only succeeded once from that $10. it all comes back to luck because without it it would be impossible.You might be lucky, friend, so it's an unwanted win but it's a sweet fruit. After all, we know that sometimes as gamblers we often experience mistakes like this and not many are lucky, only a few might be lucky with the wrong number of bets. Fortunately, you're on a streak.",

Please share with us. I did, but it's not a lottery game like you have here it's a basketball ending number where you will pick the last two digits in the final score in a basketball I made an error of picking the wrong number to shade, the rule is once you shade it, it's yours and since I don't have more money to include my original pick I have to contend with my wrong pick but it ended to be the winning combination.I end up winning $100, this is really the concept of gambling you never know what to expect so don't be too sure or don't have a doubt about what will come out, what will come out will come out, and that is why its called a luck game.",

Even in choosing which way to bet, I also review that most often, so that there‚Äôs no regretting in the end. We are already talking about money, and when it comes to that we should be more cautious and careful where and how much to bet. Maybe for some gamblers who have a lot of spare cash, committing errors will never be a big issue for them. But for low budget gamblers, it‚Äôs very important not to commit mistakes.",

One time, he brought us to the gambling site, with my brother, and we used to observe what was happening during those fights. When I noticed that my brother won in betting which chicken would win (50/50 chance, either A or B), I somehow got jealous and I made a gesture which in fact called someone to bet. Though I do not have any intention to bet anything whatsoever, I just thought that it would be nice to just get over with it.To cut the story short, I lost all my money and it was my birthday at that time. This experience really gave me the push to avoid gambling as much as possible.",

I experience betting 10mbtc instead of 10 USD on a roulette game which I didn‚Äôt notice until my bankroll depleted quickly. A painful experience that makes double checking the currency before I bet is my habit.Nice that the result is favorable to you but I believe that there‚Äôs a lot of incidents like this before when casino feature doesn‚Äôt have many safety precautions such notifications when using max bet an so on that is not available before.",

Even though it ended up favorable for you it may not happen the next time so you ought to be very careful with the amount you want to bet and make sure that is the bet amount you entered cause I believe it is also part of being a responsible gambler and managing your bankroll as exactly as how you want it to be.I can see the probable reason why it happened because you played on a mobile device and it is prone to accidental touches like that in that case if you are someone who is betting via mobile more often then be extra cautious and disciplined with your bets can help minimize risks and ensure a more sustainable approach to gambling.",
