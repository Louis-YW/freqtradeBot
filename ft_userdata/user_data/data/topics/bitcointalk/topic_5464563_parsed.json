What exactly is it, and what makes it stand out from other trading competitions?Is it really worth trying?KCGI is a crypto trading competition hosted by Bitget .. Different trading activities involved includes spot, futures, demo and futures copy trading. Personally, I see it as more than a mere competition cause it also lays emphasis on community involvement and learning; which is a standout feature.The event offers webinars, discussions, and insights from industry professionals, enhancing participants understanding of trading. So, it's pretty cool imo",

Can you senior members  give newbies room to grow in this forum? You were once like us I believe . That was my post and I was sincerely looking for people to form my team with. Secondly, Bitget has made this announcement on full blast on their announcement channel and twitter handle I don't understand why you're saying they should have done what they're already doing.  Here's their official Twitter handle in case you wanna verify because (I'm a newbie and shouldn't be trusted 🙄)  https://twitter.com/bitgetglobal?t=7zY7zNYNc9cUHvvwLeiiaA&s=09",

What exactly is it, and what makes it stand out from other trading competitions?Is it really worth trying?It's not that it really stands out from other trading competitions but since the prizes are really big and insane (Up to 2,650,000 USDT, Airbus H135 Helicopter, Tesla Cyberquad, and an iPhone 15 Pro Max, etc.) it was different from the usual trading competition we do see at most cases.Is it worth trying? Well, only you can answer that if you are really interested in participating. I would be silent about some possible irregularities that might happen here or inside jobs of some sort but doing such will just make Bitget ruin their reputation. By participating here, you trust them to be fair and square.Anyways, it's mentioned in the FAQ that you are not allowed to register after the registration period ends. As of this posting, around 6 days left to register and have a spot. You are the one who needs to decide if you will participate here or not. Just read carefully all the terms as much as possible.",

Further, it is posted around the same time as this. Frankly, I have no idea why people think employing easy-to-spot sock puppets is a good thing.",

Frankly i don't see how these are even still legal. Name one actual stock exchange that would allow something like this.I would totally get trading competitions that require skill, where the people who en up with most money with the start amount wins. That would be actually interesting. Now it's just the amount of trades that wins. Brining volume to the casino so that they can seem like a high volume exchange.It's more legit then exchange faking their volume by themselves but it's still misleading and boring.",

Generally trading competition is for the marketing of the project, boosting the volume, attracting new investors, etc. Most of the time the high capital holder enters such trading competition trades as you and I with average capital mostly avoid such type of trading competition but it can be a good opportunity in a side way.During the completion due to the hype and volatility by taking a few precise trades you can generate a decent profit, except for that the trading competitions are not recommended for newbies and early traders.",
