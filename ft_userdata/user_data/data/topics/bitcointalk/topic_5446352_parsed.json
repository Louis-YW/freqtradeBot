I am in Ukraine üá∫üá¶ . We are under daily rockets and drone attacks, long power outages when i don‚Äôt have internet and cell phone signal. This is our new reality now. We will survive, we will win, all Ukrainians believe in that. And YES, I DO NEED HELP! You can adopt a dog from my and my moms shelter or help with the dogs food. My mom was evacuated from Donetska oblast, East Ukraine where the war turned into the hell now. She brought the dogs and cats she saved from the war. We have 33 dogs as of the moment. I am the only person to finance and maintain our shelter. My mom is the only person who can look after the dogs. Dogs and cats need food, and heat . It is winter, it‚Äôs cold, it‚Äôs snowing. And they need forever home. I can personally bring the dog to the US or Europe. We have some nice breedy dogs and just cheerful street dogs, and the puppies. You will help me a lot by adopting one or two. We have also 9 cats. If you would like to help but cannot adopt a dog right now, you can help us with food and wood to heat up the house¬ª Dog Shelter Ocheretino Ukraine: ¬†Facebook https://www.facebook.com/dogsocheretino/ ¬†Instagram¬† https://www.instagram.com/dog_shelter_ocheretino/ Dog Shelter Ocheretino - Lubov Ivanivna with her dogs and cats were evacuated to another part of Ukraine - village Byrlivka in Vinnitska oblast.
