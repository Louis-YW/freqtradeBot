Central banks--and central anything--should not use blockchain because they don't need this added complexity that will raise the cost to consumers while not adding any value. The blockchain architecture's sole incremental benefit--thwarting government oversight into transactions--is a feature that is only interesting to certain users in certain situations (e.g. public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin).

What is wrong with a country replacing its paper and metal money with digital money?If you consider all sovereign currencies a \"joke\" (and if so I would assume you don't use such currencies in your everyday life), then I guess it would make sense that your view of a digitized version of that currency would also be a joke, regardless of it's technical implementation. But every day, billions of people make tens of billions of transactions with national sovereign currencies using physical cash and coins, and there's no blockchain-based cryptocurrency that could come even within several orders of magnitude of handling that demand, let alone at a reasonable cost. Governments need a technical solution to replace physical currency, and blockchain ain't it.",

Blockchain is not possible with centralization, because the basis of this technology is that copies of block chains are stored on many different PCs independently of each other. That is, there must be decentralization.Well, sadly, you \"can\" create a centralized blockchain, and there are actually a lot of centralized cryptocurrencies out there, some of which are reasonably popular. It's a stupid idea, akin to buying a business jet and using it as a spare bedroom in your backyard, but people \"can\" do anything.And I sorta get how they got there. Decentralization comes with an enormous cost in terms of computing and latency. There's no way around it--you are up against the speed of light as a limitation. A truly safe blockchain implementation will never scale beyond a few hundred transactions per second and still have a really slow latency even compared to a credit card transaction--to say nothing of being able to handle large numbers of overall transactions on a permanent basis.So faced with:1. The push to make everything \"like Bitcoin\" because Bitcoin has been so successful as an investment; and,2. The insurmountable technical limitations of true decentralization;People paint themselves into an architectural corner by speeding up their implementation the only way possible, which is to centralize it. But even that doesn't get you anywhere near where you need to be for mainstream transaction loads.But of course if you were just going to create a centralized currency from the get go, you wouldn't do it that way (you would do it this way  ).QuoteQuote from: legiteum on March 10, 2024, 03:41:00 PMJust because Bitcoin has become an incredibly popular investment doesn't mean the technology behind it is the solution to everything.

But from what I can tell, many countries are simply in the middle of the learning curve--and many seem to be going the right direction. The limitations of the blockchain architecture are self-evident the minute to you beta test the product--if not well before that if the dev team is diligent and does the proper benchmarks. Governments do a lot of stupid things, but in the long run at least some of them get things right. There have been some good stories of self-service and automation of government functions in various countries. Sometimes it only happens on the third try, but it happens.",
