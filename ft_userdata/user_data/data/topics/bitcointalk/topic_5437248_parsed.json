So keep that in mind.Yeah, i am sure there may be many more of such scam exchanges which are too easy to setup. In a real world, no one can open up an exchange, no one can become a currency exchanger unless they fulfill the state requirements top open up an exchange firm.But when it comes to an online crypto currency exchange, we just need a domain, hosting and a script and we are ready to scam. Don't know how it can be controlled.",

There are a lot of scam exchanges, so many of them lack popularity, and once their customer deposits any money into the exchange it is not possible to withdraw it, or they would ask you to deposit more in order to withdraw the money, they want to scam you of more money if they do that.There are also bigger exchanges that have used people's money inappropriately and have lost it, to most people these exchanges can be called scam exchanges even if they wouldn't just take your money once you deposit it, though they can go about it by confiscating your coins if they don't like it, or like you, or like where your money is coming from. But for people who want to use centralized exchanges, they should use the popular and bigger ones, and withdraw to their self-custody wallets once their trade is complete. All exchanges are risky, but the unpopular and small ones are more risky.",

Its better whatever you guys check by clicking the link, just mention what you find absurd, and if possible please mention country if you find one mentioned on the site..

The security history of MEXCGlobal is one that marvels me as they've never had any real case of security breaches in time past. I also go further to read up about the CEO of any exchange I intend to invest with and if I'm not convinced, I avoid the exchange completely. I try to play safe out here.",

If you feel any listed which should not be .. please post or if you believe any other missing the list ..Your efforts are greatly appreciated but scam exchanges and scam projects appear every day so we cannot list them all. Also, I feel it will take a long time to find scam exchanges, it would be better if you just focus on creating a list of trusted exchanges and a fake list of reputable exchanges. Using centralized exchanges is risky as they can freeze accounts or worse, crash like FTX. So use only top exchanges like Binance and only use it to trade, buy and sell, don't leave assets on exchanges.",
