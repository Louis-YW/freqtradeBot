      "body": "Printing more paper money means extending the inflation contract. Reserves pegged to gold do not apply to the US. I don't like war as a reference for picking up more piles of paper, because you have a heavy responsibility to give 2.5% of what you own is regulated by taxes. If not, then you are dancing on a pool of blood. The point is to stop the war, repair the damage to the economy and grow trust in the store of value in some places. Think more comprehensively and don't light a fire in a pile of dry wood.The increase in interest rates does not only have an impact on one particular asset, but almost all experience the impact. If we look after the FED announced a rate hike, the real estate investment market also felt the impact.",

      "body": "To sustain long term longevity science much solve some of our basic and fundamental issues.Populations in many places have doubled from the 1940s to the present. Most of that growth comes from the poorest and least educated demographic. The pie slice who know the least, who support the worst candidates and policies. Improving conditions involve elevating the lowest income bracket of humanity in terms of information, income and better means of preventing unwanted children. This could imply better forms of contraceptive being developed. Or better means of incentivizing abstinence. Elevating the lowest income bracket, will in turn reduce crime and foster job creation and growth. The united states having a population of more than 300 million should mean we have roughly 300 million chances for someone to start a business that goes on to become the next amazon, apple or microsoft. The goal should be to empower people towards having the background and education necessary to make this a reality.",

They have higher fallen GDP and little profit is consumed by feeding. Countries that are merely consumers have low income earners because they are majorly labourers and unskilled workers. These set are highly poor as nothing commercial and industrial in most of the towns and so they are home to inflation.",
