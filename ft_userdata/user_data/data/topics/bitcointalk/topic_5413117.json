  "content": "Crypto Wallets & Their Types All you Need to know.History:The Concept of the EFTS was a next step to evolution of money and trade system and it was introduced in 1978 and a first ever web based ETF was introduced in 2004. In 2009 a unique concept by the Satoshi Nakamoto of World wide currency fully decentralized and fixed supply changed the concept of the Money and its flow in 2022.Digital wallets are the software programs or electronic devices used to store the electronic funds and access online services & transactions. Digital wallets were develop to explore the new era of trading and transparency. Digital Money & Wallets made the access of world wide IOT services accessible easily. E-commerce is the majour application of digital wallets. Crypto changed the whole concept of money application of digital money and storage.Crypto Wallets: Crypto wallets are the more advanced form of digital wallets where a device or protocol is used to store public and private keys for storing different types of cryptocurrencies. Crypto wallets are more functionally enhanced as you can access encryption and signing capabilities.Simply a crypto wallet address/ public key is combination of alphanumeric characters from 27 to 37 ranges.Terms used in Crypto Wallets Encryption: Private Key, Public key both of these terms are used on the crypto network to perform transaction a public key allow the user to receive funds and private key allows to access the encrypted funds on the public key.Types of Crypto Wallets: Basically there two type of crypto wallets on the basis of their utility as Cold Storage Wallets and Hot Storage Wallets.Cold Storage Wallets:These are the highly secure personalized wallets used to store the crypto currencies preferred by the users as for storing the long term crypto investments. All hardware wallets are cold wallets as these wallets are offline wallets due to this feature these wallets are considered as most secure type of wallets.Hardware Wallets are example of Cold storageFeature: Used to Store Large amount of investments & High SecurityExamples / RecommendationsLedger Nano XPrice: 149$Source: KryptodotsTrezor Model TPrice: 189€Source:FinderELLIPAL Titan BundlePrice: 159$Source: AmazonPros and Cons of Cold Wallets: Cold Wallets provides the maximum possible security to the funds as user require. These wallets allow full efficient environments to make all possible secure investments.These Wallets are expensive maximum users who own a little funds cant afford them. As these are used as primarily for storage you cant trade with them.Hot Storage Wallets: Hot Wallets are used by the traders for making quick and time to time transactions with the market. These wallets allow the users to access different types of services on the block chain rather than assets transfers as decentralized finance & tools. NFTs, MetaVerse & Staking etc.All type of these hot wallets are same in some properties but the major difference between them is the control on the assets in Self-Custody users manipulates its funds accordingly but on the exchanges offered wallets funds are managed and controlled by the Exchanges ( Not recommended for stroing crypto) . Common point is used for trading and accessing crypto related services using instant crypto. Mobile, Desktop & Web Wallets are types of the Hot walletsThe List of Hot wallets according their type and accessibility and support. Metamask: Decentralized Self Custody Wallet. Used for Altcoins.Trust Wallet: Decentralized Self Custody Wallet. Supports many Blockchain Networks.Electrum: Decentralized Self Custody Wallet. Only Bitcoin.Electrum can also be used as the Cold Storage.Pros and Cons of Hot Storage wallets:These wallets are cheap even free to use, user can access trading as its primary feature. Users can explore the the crypto services and access decentralized finance and other technologies as the meta verse and NFtsThese wallets cant be used to store large amount of funds as there are so many security issues with them. For safe investments these wallets are non recommended. Note: This information related to the products has been taken from different blogs the graphics i have used all have the refer link or source mentioned. This post is for the information superpose to guide the new users to choose the best and avoid scams. There is no plagiarism as after my own experience and analysis i made this list.",

Unfortunately, many people are going for convenience, but they do not know what is happening when they are making use of a wallet.The use of a walket should not be about trust, you do not have to trust a developer that do not make the source code of the wallet they developed to be available to the public to see. Definitely some developers are available to view the code and check for vulnerabilities.If close source wallet is having spyware, how are you going to know? How are other developers that have interest to review the code going to know if it has spyware and other malware included, no one would know.Because a wallet is open source, that does not mean it is not vulnerable, only the ones I mentioned are recommended by people that have reviewed the code and the bitcoin community supporting them, not just that I recommend an open source wallet, use the one that the community also recommend. But for close source, none should be gone for because you do not know what your wallet is doing internally because you can not check the code, other developers can not check the code, no one can check the code. Trust transparency, not close source, close source wallets have no transparency.",

All hardware wallets are cold wallets as these wallets are offline wallets due to this feature these wallets are considered as most secure type of wallets.The hardware wallet is nothing else but a convenient tool to interact with the transaction data, namely, it is primarily used for signing unsigned transactions and generating and storing cryptographic keys. It keeps all sensitive keys in an isolated offline environment, which is why many people consider it cold storage, but the necessity to interact with the online world makes it more vulnerable to attacks and is the main reason why it cannot be called a \"true\" cold storage. In the case of cold storage, you more often than not generate your seed offline, create several public keys and addresses, fund them and forget that you have a wallet. The moment you spend from one of these addresses, your cold storage loses its status and becomes rather \"hot\" since, upon transactional process, you had to somehow interact with the real world. Just create another cold storage, and you're fine. With hardware wallets, you continuously interact with the real world, exposing your transaction data to the Internet and implicitly associating this data with your hardware wallet via some type of communication. Basically, you make \"hot\" transactions in a very secure manner that unlikely is going to lead to key leakage.

But in my view, \"true\" cold storage solutions shouldn't have signing capabilities at all because in order to sign secure storage must be paired with software to communicate. Communication through QR codes is close to ideal because it is both secure enough and convenient, but here is the rub: even though an electronic device stores your keys securely, it is still an electronic device that may break down or be maliciously altered by firmware you didn't properly verify, and you will lose everything it contained. No matter how expensive it may be, it is unlikely to outlive and outperform in terms of security a piece of paper or metal plate, which can store information written or etched on them indefinitely. And given that you can't use paper or metal to sign transactions directly, it makes them a better solution for long-term custody, whereas, with a signing device, you are incentivized to spend and make transactions because why else would you buy a hardware wallet if not for making transactions?",

You may not see hardware wallet signing transaction using QR code as cold wallet just for your security consciousness. But see this as to what could only lead to a debate or opinions that may be different from other experts. In reality, the QR code contains information pertaining to signing of transaction and nothing more. Or can you prove how a malware can pass through a QR code to infect a cold wallet that is used with only QR code for transaction signing? In my opinion, I regard hardware wallet used in that way as a cold wallet. But if you are extra conscious about your security, it can give you the feeling of ease and help you in protecting your coins as you prefer a device that is completely airgapped and not used for transaction signing, but that does not mean that such devices or hardware wallets that are used for transaction signing through QR code not to be regarded as cold wallets.",

Or can you prove how a malware can pass through a QR code to infect a cold wallet that is used with only QR code for transaction signing? The problem with air-gapped devices and hardware wallets, including those communicating information via QR codes, is that they cannot be upgraded this way - in order to install a new version of firmware, you need to use either a USB cable or something like SD card, both of which imply direct injection of physical things into your secure hardware. Once you physically transferred the information onto your device, it stops being \"truly\" air-gapped since, like it or not, the interaction with the outside world has taken place. It is no different from connecting your cold storage to the Internet since the moment you connected, you can't be entirely sure your device remains safe. Of course, you may choose to never update your device and leave it potentially vulnerable to different attacks, but these attacks can also include remote connection to your air-gapped device, so not upgrading may do more harm than good. All things being equal, non-electronic media for storing information is safer than electronic; it is going to be more difficult for hackers to access them remotely, let alone maliciously alter them.",
