Germany has already qualified for the tournament by virtue of being the host nation. Italy are the current Euro Champions after they beat England at Wembley Stadium in the delayed Euro 2020 tournament (which took place in 2021) because of the issues related to the COVID pandemic. This thread can be used to discuss anything related to the Euro 2024 tournament but keep in mind that low-quality posts will be deleted alongside posts from attention-seekers, signature spammers and trolls.",

If Rudiger did not head in an own-goal Scotland would have lost 5-0 because they were not going to score themselves.Switzerland are said to be playing in their final tournament with their golden generation and they will want to make an impact. Spain had a good start to the tournament too.We are only three games in to the tournament and apart from Germany, no other team looks like they will win it (maybe being the host nation will give them a boost)  There is one more game to be played today: Italy vs Albania edit: Italy 2-1 Albania Italy came back from behind to win the game after Albania scored after just 23 seconds (which is the fastest goal ever scored at a Euro tournament).",

Full credit to Italy for mounting a comeback and winning the game with two excellent goals of their own but that cannot take away the brilliant start that Albania had.I have no idea why at the throw-in the Italian defender felt appropriate to throw the ball in his own box but Bajrami still had a defender and the goalkeeper to beat from a tight angle yet still managed to hit the ball with ferocity to squeeze in to the net.Greece will have to wait for the next tournament  Quote from: alani123 on June 16, 2024, 10:56:53 PMMy favorite moment was Albanian fans breaking spaghetti in front of Italian fans before their match.

What I liked about this video is how the Italian guy was playfully begging the Albania fan not to break the spaghetti  It was nice to see rival fans not letting the rivalry of football make them enemies instead it brings them together because that's what football should do, it should bring people together.The big shocker in the Euros today was Belgium vs Slovakia. Nobody, including me, expected Belgium to lose that match. Belgium were horrible today. The midfield was so poor, they couldn't break the defence and Lukaku was something else. They were horrible. Slovakia defended really well, everything went according to plan for them. If I were to make a hundred predictions, in none of them would I not give Belgium at least a goal. This is what makes gambling so damn difficult.",

I absolutely don't have the same opinion with you on the Turkey topic. We played the first 30 minutes amazingly. However Georgia became the side to control the game later. After we got ahead again with Arda Güler's great goal, Georgia found so many chances to score the equalizer. Their 2 shots hit the post and we cleared the ball just over the goal line once. We need to change some things before the Portugal match.By the way what do you think about England? My favourite was them before the tournament started.

I also put England as one of the favorites - but the performance of the players is not completely reliable. But anyway - England should have progressed to the next round and they have collected 4 points from 2 matches. The performance of star players between club and national team levels is very different - even this is very unexpected.Just finished - Spain vs Italy. Italy played under pressure until they had to accept defeat due to an own goal. Italy and Spain are also favorites - but Spain is particularly passionate as far as I can see. 1-0 in favor of Spain - that alone was enough to lead the group standings with 6 point. About the next match - Netherlands vs France will be a match I will be looking forward to.",
