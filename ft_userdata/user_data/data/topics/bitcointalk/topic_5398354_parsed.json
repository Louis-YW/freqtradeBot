  "content": "So where wich country no btc taxes ?Even if there is you cant rreally easy open bank account there ?For example you use revolut card in portugal wich is tax heaven for crypto but even if you receive gains from crypto in to ur revolut card or binance card you still are in the country you received card first place and you have to report taxes to your own country.I wamt to know in wich country or wich card gives me the 0% taxes i mean 100% tax heaven i just use my money from crypto and nobody dont ask anything just my money and i spend how i like it.Second point is if i go to tax heaven country unless i dont use their banking services it dont matter by law where im physically ....so my question is what are the actual steps to pay no taxes or just very little taxes from my crypto funds.For example i have btc now i sell my btc to cash but this cash must be deposited on some bank account so me as foreigener can open account in tax heaven country ??And deposite my funds of sales of crypto or btc there and nobody dont ask any questions ?Lets forget about crypto for the moment the btc and crypto not money its h st the digits online without nation and without legal base.Money start when you receive transaction of sales of ur btc or crypto..i know its not a lot like that but where was the goverment tax guys to collect taxes when we all used e-gold and liberty reserve payment services ? Its little bit funny situation here. Back to the topic...so in wich country i can move money of sales crypto and nobody dont ask anything i just use my money on protected of this country laws my funds in their banks ? Sure i can do cash deals but its not convient and safe i want money deposited what ever account and i use it with card and nobody dont ask anything.If this is something what not done yet it should be done crypto needs a tax heavens and cpuntries who try to check over btc traders too much people simply leave from there....but then again it works only if you can also open bank account in tax heaven country",
