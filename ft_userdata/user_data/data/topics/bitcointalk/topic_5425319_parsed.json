I'm not sure I agree with this, except that people may be a little freer with their coins.For myself, I tend to price non-funded collectibles in fiat as I will always feel the need to replace watever BTC I spend on the purchase.MHO for what it worth I'm keeping an eye on this auction because the watches are dope and the collection is awesome!",

      "body": "I definitely see your point sweeteye. I see one of the OG whales picking up a beauty like this for a 1/4 or a 1/5 of the amount of bitcoin the OP is asking for once bitcoin rebounds. For a relative newbie like me it’s hard to justify using bitcoin to purchase a watch like this… I’d rather be accumulating btc right now. Once the price rebounds though, this watch would definitely look amazing on my wrist.",
