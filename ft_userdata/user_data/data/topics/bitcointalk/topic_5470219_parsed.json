  "content": "Right now well all get one president it not important if you like it or not the main thing be say our president be Bola Ahmed Tinubu, so I would want us to reason as a country and not as divided party supporters, by now everyone suppose don hear about the news on the president forging his certificate this news has already brought in native attention to the country and this is to add to the already existing stigmatization caused be the internet fraudster In England some Nigerian nurse who falsely acquired their certificate has been detected although I like the development but those who are legit are now having a had time due to stigmatization. And I don't think we in the crypto-currency space are safe. A friend of mine who is a Crypto-currency freelancer and had an existing job told me about his boss all of a sudden requiring him to prove his qualifications and all this is happening because of the negativity brought by this news.So guys what's the best way to approach this situation if you were caught up in the web as a result of the president forging certificate saga. And do you think it's true or false regardless, I think I would advice everyone to always be sincere and avoid false acquired qualifications.",

No country in the world label someone with a crime that they didn’t commit unless they are been misjudged. If you’re asked about something like that, then you must have one way or the other involved in such act. So there’s no need for panic if you didn’t forge your certificate. And the presidency forgery shouldn’t have anything to do with cryptocurrency enthusiasts.",

If old man like that go get so much scandalous activities all around him then wetin him go teach him pikin and kids around him, nothing more than snatch it, grab it and run away with it.See the whole saga about the Nigerian presidential election regarding the person wey INEC select as winner and the court case including the way INEC no gree release evidential materials and plus this certificate alleged forgery, the thing dey make me see oyibo pipo as accomplice to the ills of Nigerian economy, dey benefit alot. Otherwise, why dem no ban tinubu from attending all their gatherings, meetings. At least if Dem use because of that close him out from flying into their shores, stop him and Nigeria in UN, WHO, etc den we go know say dem wan do the right thing instead of disturbing products of Nigeria why the makers are allowed to walk freely. Is this not injustice on the citizens of Nigeria. Why will they begin to scrutinize nurses certificate when dem never ban tinubu. Hypocrites and neocolonialism dey go on very strongly.",

I am even more surprise that we can link the conversation of the President's alleged certificate forgery with cryptocurrency. In Nigeria, we allow our emotions to drive us more than the reality of events on ground. The case of Tinubu's certificate was not even lodged properly in the court and doesn't have any legal backing to it. But since it was raised by the opposition who are claiming to be saints but in reality, baffled and frustrated by the results of the general elections, BBC Verify took it upon themselves to investigate the matter and have since falsify the issue.I don't really like to talk about these things as I see them as distractions bur for cry out loud, the case doesn't hold any water to me. Honestly.",
