It looks rather fragile.However, I can appreciate this tutorial being out there for people who may live in a country where Bitcoin and crypto currency in general are frown upon or even those holding it being prosecuted. Realistically, one could buy the parts on internet and build it oneself. It is an alternative in that context. I am not familiarized with the Jade wallet, but I must admit that the original/official model looks interesting.",

The firmware that will be used in this DIY HW wallet is from Blockstream jade hardware wallet itself. Blockstream is the developer of Blockstream wallet, jade HW wallet, Blockstream explorer, the bitcoin liquid and the devs who acquire/continuing the development of GreenAddress wallet. It's much more technical than other existing HW wallets and more interesting to be exact as personal project. Knowing the source code of the firmware is open source and used the same on its official jade HW wallet i assumed this is audited by other developers so it's i guess its safe, only if followed the correct instructions since its more in technicality and NOT a newbie friendly.",

Meanwhile, we already have good reputation wallets like Trezor or Ledger, they are certified as secure for our bitcoins. Although they cost more, it guarantees the safety of our bitcoins. If you are really serious about your bitcoin, don't be afraid to spend a few tens of dollars for a better and more secure wallet, I think everything has its price, nothing cheap but good.",

It rather more preferably done as a hobby instead of making it as the main hardware wallet choice. The original Jade HW is 65$ and this guide ranges from 10$ to 50$ and still has different features compared to the original ones. Regular users might want to try it to get a grasp of how HW generally works, but should not use it as a way to store bitcoins.",

I already own a hardware wallet, so I'm not too concerned about this. But I also recommend everyone to buy a wallet with a good reputation in the market like Trezor, because its price is not too expensive compared to the bitcoin value we are holding. For new, unpopular wallets, do not rush to buy cheap, it will be very risky, wait for more reviews from the community of tech-savvy people.",

I believe the market for each product is different anyway, I doubt anyone who would happily buy a Ledger is interested in DIY products or something similar. Of course, some exception does exist, but the majority of them is definitely not an enthusiast. If anything I believe this product compete with other alternative such as an air-gapped USB device with Electrum or something similar. CMIIW.",

On the contrary, I will pay more money in order to obtain the highest protection.Yes, when it comes to cheap hardware wallets, it is wise to consider the quality of the device and the level of security it offers. It is possible that some manufacturers may cut corners on security features or use lower quality components, which could put your bitcoins at risk. While DIY projects can be satisfying for those who enjoy crafting, they may not be the best choice for less experienced users who are unaware of potential risks.But, if someone is buying a cheap hardware wallet, then it is most likely that they are looking for something to store a small amount of bitcoins. I disagree that it is not possible to find a good quality, cheap hardware wallet. There are some high-quality hardware wallets out there that are very affordable and easy to use, so you don't have to spend thousands of dollars on a device. Besides, a cheap commercial wallet is still a safer option compared to using a hot wallet on a computer or mobile device. In fact, there are far more instances of funds being lost due to malware or phishing attacks than those resulting from hacking a hardware wallet, since the latter generally requires physical access to the device.",
