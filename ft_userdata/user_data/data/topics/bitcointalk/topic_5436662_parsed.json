  "content": "I need someone in the USA to do me a quick favour. It involves renting/streaming a feature film online on the Sundance website and taking a few screenshots of the end credits ie cast/and crew. A video would also do if you prefer that. You need to be a US resident as they're blocking proxies (unless you know how to bypass that. If you can figure out a way I can do it online I'll just give you the $10). You don't need to watch the film just skip to the end credits and take a few screenshots. The film costs $20 and I'll give you an extra $10 for the help so $30 in total. It takes a few minutes to sign up and then probably a few mins to take a few screenshots. If you're interested just send me a PM. Thanks.",
