      "body": "I believe that most men in life seek power because having power gives you control and influence. And this can be applied to just about everything that a man does, from his personal life to work. Take for example a person that just got hired at a warehouse for an entry-level position, he wonâ€™t have that much power or authority over other coworkers or employees. As opposed to a supervisor or manager that knows the operation of the job along with other necessary skills. In this position not only do you have a certain amount of control but as well as the power to either hire or fire a worker. This also means that by having control and power you shouldnâ€™t be diminishing other peopleâ€™s egos, instead be an example by being a great leader with a humble attitude. People or coworkers will recognize you for being a great guy with them and not letting power get to your head.",

If you were a true-man you would know thatÂ  everything a man does, he does it for his family which are the result of his sexual activities in the past, but deep down if you check the lives of every man, you will see that their lives revolves around table and bed.Table could be office table or food table, bed could be for sleeping and also could be for the other type of sleeping, you know oh yeahhhh stuff.ðŸ¤£",

It is important to remember that not all men have the same desires or goals in life, and that societal and cultural factors can also influence what men may prioritize in their lives. That being said, some men may value power, wealth, and respect, as well as being seen as the primary provider for their family. Others may prioritize personal growth, relationships, or creative pursuits. Ultimately, what each man wants most in life will depend on his individual values, experiences, and goals. It is important to approach each person as an individual with unique desires and priorities, rather than making assumptions based on gender.",
