      "body": "Did you tried to check the hashboard physically it should have something a name under ASIC chip like a100, a101, a102, and etc...Â  And then from the logs start counting it to the right after that compare it to the count and the ASIC chip name. This is how it works on other Avalon model so maybe a1246 is the same.",

      "body": "Thank you very much for answering. On the physical board the chips are numbered from A1 to A120. For this model I am not sure if it follows the form of the previous ones since the chip array starts from 1 and not from 0 as I have read in this article:https://bbs-zeusbtc-com.translate.goog/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=13&_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=es&_x_tr_hl=es-419&_x_tr_pto=scI need to be sure I have the correct chip.I am not an expert in electronics but I need to do something with this chip that is resetting the miner. I'm assuming re-soldering or replacing it will solve the problem. The chip reaches temperatures of 98.Thanks again for your time.",
