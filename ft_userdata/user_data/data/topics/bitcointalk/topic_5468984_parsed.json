And this they do without even asking for our opinions.In most cases I don't see a much need for a cbdc but while certain factors may influence the creation of cbdc some governments tend to implement this without painstakingly examining the potential risk concerned.",

But if your question if we really need CBDC? maybe for legal talks if this is widely introduce by our government then yes since we need to use to to make our transaction legal to them but if not and declared this as an option only then we don't actually need that since we have a lot of stable crypto to choose and its up to the people if they adopt what those people created. But CBDC existence is not really a bad idea since somehow we can assure that there's legal authorities monitoring its circulation and maybe for using this we can be away from harmful hackings or any illegal conditions.",

So as long as the government still controls us, it is mandatory for us to use fiat or CBDC in the future, we have no choice whether we want that to happen or not.Â  But I find it inappropriate to compare bitcoin with CBDC because they are completely different, if you want to compare you should compare it with stablecoins rather than bitcoin. Since CBDC is just a digital version of fiat currency and fiat cannot compete with bitcoin, and neither can CBDC.",

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, by decentralization they don't have any middle man that control it's operation. The performance is based on peer-to-peer people around it's ecosystem, the network security is also dependent of the people around it.Â CBDC is a stable digital currency that central banks like to issue, it is going to be control and manage by the central bank, it's affairs are not restricted by commercial banks, anyone can use it any where and anytime but they are regulated in a such a way that you can be restricted if you violate any rules of the CBDC, this is Hy it's not good to use it in the first place because it's not your key or your coins. Stablecoin work in this manner. The difference between CBDC and stablecoins is that one is control by central banks and the other is controlled by group of people that form a company.",

This entity is trusted by many people and therefore they are forced to deal with it if the government issues a decision to do so. It is true that adoption will take time, but in the end it is a form of institutional and central money and the opinions of individuals.
