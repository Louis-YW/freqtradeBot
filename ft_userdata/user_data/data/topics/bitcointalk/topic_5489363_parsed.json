If the issue of faster payments is raised, then i believe what we should be discussing is scalability solutions.Without a good internet connection Bitcoin users will face some issues. Internet cables are most important for everyone who is using internet and if those undersea cables start getting affected then the whole communication system will be non-responsive. Those cables are planted undersea and because of them we are able to use internet effectively, even wireless internet is dependent on such cables. I'm talking about traditional wireless internet setups like 3G, 4G, and 5G.I believe we already have good alternative which is Starlink. It could be a good alternative for us when the cable issues make internet communications slow or not responsive. Starlink works via Satellite and it's not dependent on those undersea internet cables. It also works well in remote areas, the only problem with Starlink is the high cost of the connectivity. Starlink's connections are fast with low latency and that can be useful for transactions when traditional networks get slow or they stop working fully. I believe the Starlink could be another good alternative when traditional networks stop responding due to cable severing.",

How many investors in bitcoins can really afford the Starlink? and its monthly subscription?This illustrates the point. Surely it would be possible to have a local mempool to accept transactions. If a country has one or more large mining complexes, then they could select transactions from that pool, and connect to the blockchain via expensive alternative networds. This could result in confirnmation times of around a day or so, depending on the success of the local miners. However, this would be better than no access to the blockchain for the majority of Bitcoin users.We must face the fact that we are in a period of banking, political and economic turmoil. There is also increasing military activity to change the status of many countries. For example, who would have thought that Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso would have become major influences in Africa, The US has strengthened Putin, and as a consequence, it has made the Russian military into possibly the world's strongest army. Their economy is booming, and they are gaining an enhance reputation in the world. The US has lost its war in Ukrain, and its support of the actions of the Zionists is turning many populatiions against them. They are neglecting US infrastructure and the population in an attempt to posture against China, Russian, Iran and other countries. The attack on the Yemen may have initiated the cutting of Internet cables. It has certainly caused massive disruptions in shipping, and this will affect the US significantly. As individuals, we need to plan ahead to enable us to weather the economic and political storms.",

This could damage Bitcoin usage. This can truly affect the use of bitcoin by the people since it involves the use of the internet in most cases to perform a bitcoin transaction and the network failure seems to be going beyond the limit, but we must not also learn to attribute everything happening the negative way to US being the cause, what i heard some saying was the international cable while some say it has to do with the fallen of one of the 4G satellite or cable as the case may beQuote from: Jet Cash on March 18, 2024, 12:03:26 PMIt occured to me that one possibility would be to have a number of national networks similar to the Lighting network.

How many investors in bitcoins can really afford the Starlink? and its monthly subscription?It's a really good question, last I checked, starlink was quite expensive, I can't remember the exact amount it was then, but what I did remember was that, I had the intention of buying one, but after I saw the price, i withing myself acknowledged that it's not affordable to me at that moment and even now, and this is even outside the monthly subscription.And back to the op discussion, it is really annoying, all through the week, the entire cities in Nigeria, as well as ghana and some other African countries had suffered a very severe poor internet connection, to the extent that even accessing this forum was a very huge challenge for some of us.I am not quite knowledgeable when it comes to how things like this works, but with all sincerely, having an alternative would be really a good idea, for what if one day, governments around the world wake up and decide to pull the plug on internet, just to stop bitcoin - very low chances of happening though, but just imagining.",

I can understand the OP concern about the internet being compromised, it can disrupt a lot of things that depends on the internet connection to function effectively, especially for Bitcoin that is completely digital, so it's a good idea if we're thinking of alternative ways to carry out transactions if anything were to affect the internet connection. I live in Nigeria, and for a couple of weeks I've been finding it difficult to connect to the internet, even to access this forum will take a long time, initially I thought that it was perhaps the network in my area, before I started hearing of others that are complaining too. Development of more alternative means of manoeuvering the internet for Bitcoin transactions will be very welcomed.",

How many investors in bitcoins can really afford the Starlink? and its monthly subscription?If you ask about investors then most of the investors who earn more than $1000 per month can afford it if they keep their expenses minimum. The cost of per month subscription is around $120 at the moment but someone can further reduce the cost by sharing it with others. Let's say if 4 neighbors need internet in a country where internet is poor then all four of them can contribute $30 per month to enjoy fast satellite internet. What if instead of 4 neighbors 8 neighbors contribute for that? The cost will be $15 per person for a fast internet connection.I'm very sure that for a fast connection many of us would spend $15 per month without thinking twice. However, the initial cost of $600 could be an issue which can also be reduced for each person if 8 of them contribute $75 for the first month of having that type of internet facility.",

It has become such a norm in my country that the internet connection is slow. When we visit other countries, we always get surprised how fast the internet connections are. Of course we are still lucky to be able to connect to an internet connection but it’s definitely not as fast as it would have been in other countries. To me, it doesn’t really come in between transactions. I don’t think the internet connection is what is affecting the transaction process although of course it’s a factor, it’s more about the congested mempool that is primarily the cause,",
