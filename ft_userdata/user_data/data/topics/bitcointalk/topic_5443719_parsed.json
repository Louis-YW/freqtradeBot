      "body": "The thing is.  When you link Social Media engagement to earnings for every body, you get nobody using the platform for its intended purpose but to earn money off likes.  They will post anything just to pull as many likes as they can.And then one more trouble we would get into.  This Blockchain you are talking about, if successful, will have such a large size it will be impossible to sustain.  Imagine Facebook's servers but every body who posts anything can earn off their likes.  Would be filled up with scams, spam and useless posts really.Third point.  This will have to be so centralized to work properly that its existence will ultimately be useless.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "Tell me in which parts does blockchain is required, essential, and utilized to develop social media. There is no way it can be useful.Building social media does not require blockchain. The current alternative popular social media, mastodon and Nostr Protocol, do not use a blockchain because there is no way it can be essential and beneficial. Forcing blockchain to be incorporated into social media only would bloat it with unnecessary systems. I don't even sure cryptocurrency users would use such platform even if it exists.",

      "body": "That's a good idea to be heard but honestly, there have been attempts of doing that type of social media but it didn't avail the attention of many people in the space.Those ideas that have been brought like this look fascinating until no one uses and invests in them. And with poor management of the team, there will be no traction on it.It should usable and that's the use case of the project if ever there will be a token out of it, that will gain some economy on that chain as interest increases from the gathered users. But as I've said, those that I have seen attempted to do it, the majority were unsuccessful.",
