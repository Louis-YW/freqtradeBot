  "content": "First of all, I apologize for being late (reading my nickname it seems rather ironic) but some real life problems kept me away from the PC and made me miss my account creation  tenth anniversary.Even though I am not a person who loves being the center of attention or showing off, I think this is an achievement that should be honored, that I'm proud off ( I never gave up my faith in crypto) and above all a tribute of gratitude to this place to which I owe practically all my, albeit limited, knowledge of crypto environment.I enjoyed all the 136 days, 20 hours ad 37 minutes I stayed logged in   ad above all I never experencied a boring day in crypto.Thank you all for making this place my online safe haven. On a side note , just out of curiosity, I digged back to my first post here and rereading itQuote from: hopenotlate on December 03, 2013, 10:06:35 AMHi all,my nickname says all.I first heard about bitcoin during 2011 but didn't understand it, folded and moved on.Last days I read about their value near to $1000 and it ruined my days because I was near to get this train but didn't.Now I would like to enter and hope someone can address me to the first steps to do.First of all, I guess, I need to make a wallet, right? Where/how can I do this?Do I need a wallet for every cryptocurrency I would like to hold?Thx in advance for your patience and cooperationit definitely seems I wasn't too late.   I love this place!",

I hope you have taken advantage of having known this forum so soon and you are much better off now financially than if you had not known it, which does not always happen. Although from what you say I get the impression that it does. How do you see the next 10 years in this forum and bitcoin?",

I’m not so familiar with the username, I’m sure those in the Italian local board need no introduction to your works. The consistency is admirable, the time we spend here and the relationships we build with others make it easy to get attached to the forum and very hard to leave.

Not sure how many users who registered their accounts in 2013 still post regularly today, but my guess is there aren't many of them anymore. Many users have left for any reasons, in fact we never know how many users have left the forum due to Covid or previous difficult times. I hope you will stay longer and enjoy it. I am also happy to be here, who will turn 6 in March next year.Quote from: hg_away on December 11, 2023, 03:40:57 PMCongratulations @hopenotlate 10 years is not a small period and that you were able to continue to survive is something unique.

You're old time member, but I'm a bit surprised that I don't remember your name and probably I haven't interacted with you before. It's probably because you spend most of time on Italian and Collectibles boards.And your first post looks good, especially considering that it was 2013 when there weren't so much information for beginners.",

I played alot of poker on what was then called seals with clubs now known just as SwC. I heard about the forum and how bitcoin was more than something we could gamble with on poker, so I made an account. Bitcoin then started to change my life.Now, I feel like bitcoin is here to stay.
