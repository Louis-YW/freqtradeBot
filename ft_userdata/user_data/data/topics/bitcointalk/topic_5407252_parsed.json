      "body": "What is the benefit of the generator of electricity for the doomsday? Mostly, you will not find any fuel and you will not be able to operate these devices, so the ideal case is to use solar energy, wind energy or any renewable energy sources depending on your region.As for preparing for it, it is to try to live on the minimum and when you have fears, you buy a plot in the countryside, which has a water well and generates electricity with solar energy, and then you prepare with a few trainings and learn how to farm and raise livestock.As for the preparation, most of them will not be ready, but they will be ready in a short period of time.",

Banks aren't some charity that's out there to save you. Banks are a business, and the goal of such business is to profit off you, not necessarily to help you or save you.If anything, most banks are scums. Heck, it's not uncommon seeing banks revoke people's access to their funds.",

Exonomoic crash big crash and shortages of moneyEconomic crashes happen all the time. I'd be more worried about the nuclear \"doomsday\" scenario. Seems the world is getting closer to global conflicts in an age of nuclear weapons. We essentially have to rely on dictatorial maniacs keeping the peace. WW2 would have looked a lot different in the Germans were able develop their nuclear technology at the same rate as the U.S. In the true doomsday scenario, I would not prepare. Surviving a nuclear winter, even living in a bunker, would be miserable. Stocking up on a few extra cases of water and cans of food isn't going to help much during a nuclear winter. At that point, it'd be worth it just to accept your fate.",

Let's say am to go down that path of imagination with you...I haven't been around much and so I can't tell what the 1st and 2nd world war was like but if you ask me, the closest we could get to a doomsday is in a 3rd world war. It could get really ugly, given the level of suffistication of war machines of our time and the places I think would be hit the most are the places we seem to consider safe. Every nation with a stronghold becomes a target and you can never be prepared enough being in the hot zones.",

Most people couldn't afford to prepare for it. But a year's supply of canned food, a well and a few thousand round of ammo are in most people's budgets. Don't be totally vulnerable just because you can't afford a nuclear bunker.",

Any catastrophe on a planetary scale, whether man-made or natural, will inevitably be associated with the movement of large amounts of water from the world's oceans - and this is a priority threat direction if you are interested in surviving. Therefore, the islands and coastal regions of the continents are unreliable havens, regardless of their degree of prestige.",

At that point, it'd be worth it just to accept your fate.Everyday I prepare for doomsday by living a day per time. Sometimes one worry about what tomorrow would bring but what would our worries change? The world is controlled by selfish and power drunk politicians. Their actions and inaction is causing more harm than good to the people and they don't care. Hence, for one not to develop health issues such as high blood pressure because of worries and anxiety, we must learn to enjoy every moment of life. I have learnt to accept life they way it unfolds. But the economic doomsday you are predicting is already happening in most countries. There are some countries that is lacking power supply, ravaged by war and battling currency failure. Hence, you doomsday prediction might be in developed nations.",
