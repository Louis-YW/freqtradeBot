I've not seen a report similar to this before (there have been cases where people have broken windows because someone's left their kids/pets in the car while they went to the supermarket and it got too hot but that's not as relevant as someone gambling) - these are normally social media posts too and aren't normally in the news.",

I even read about adult one on the news in my country after some people slept in a car overnight after leaving a bar, they all dead. Also about the one that jackg is talking aabout, I have read about the one that the dad went for shopping but forget his kid in the car, he child died.This one is just related to gambling, but several ones has occurred in the past that is not related to gambling.What that do happen is that the father or the mother forget their kid in the car, before they remember, they child could have died, especially if is in a hot sunny day.If the news is true that the woman left his two kids in the car for over 6 hours, that is carelessness. Maybe she thought she has dropped them at home. I couldn't think of what let to this, but all the news may not be true than how a mother left his children in a car and they died. The mother is seeing support from his husband and family, which is what that do happen after such bad incident occur. There are many in the past that is not about gambling, other events had led to it in the past.",

I think it sounds ironic if a tragedy that makes the casino a factor in the death. I certainly agree with your clearly parent-focused assumption. Because here gambling or a place to play punches at the casino you don't see it as a mistake.",

I am an online gambler than visiting a casino. Visiting a casino could be different, there is more pleasure derived from visiting casino, just like going to bar to have some fun. But regardless of what we would call it, it is her carelessness that led to her children's death. Her carelessness led to his children'd death, but it may not be willingly like you said, there have been many that have happened in the past that a mother or a father would forget totally that her or his child or children are inside the car. We must be careful, watchful, be vigilant and be a good parent. If the women is innocent, she would also now be in pain, like her life is taken from her already. That is why I just hate this kind of thing to occur, but it do occur. This has been the first I have heard of, that is related to gambling.",

Also it's highly not recommended leaving your children in those hot area are like vegas which turns to same this unfortunate incident.Found some local news of car-related incident of elder or young ones or pets inside the car who seeks help due to suffocation or something then someone break the window too like what you and jackg mentioned.",

Casinos would usually ban such visitors from playing. Unfortunately, many people choose to ignore these rules and still go for a few wagers while their kids wait in the car.That's the result of gambling addiction, reckless, didn't the woman think about leaving her child in the car in the heat, didn't she think about gambling without remembering her sons and daughters were in the car, This is an omission from the mother herself, clearly the warning from the casino states as above, prohibited.For me, this case should be given a severe punishment for the mother, so that other mothers who are addicted to gambling will be reminded with punishment if they cause their children to die because of carelessness.",

This is a classic example of uneducated people who doesn't know the consequence of keep a child inside a car parked in open during daytime. It's bad parenting and no mercy should be shown to these morons who risked their child's life for some mare gambling activities. Honestly I have never seen such incident before. People don't even leave their pets inside a car without keeping the AC on and this was a human baby. Deeply saddened to see a death resulting out of this incident. It's a moronic act and these people should be treated in a similar way by the court of law.",

Basing on the incident on OP then now that mother will really be facing up on the consequences yetshe let her kids die because of negligence or on that severe addiction.She would not able to play gambling for long years or in forever inside prison.",

Man idk how the idea of leaving a 2 and 3 year old kid in a car for 6 hours was a good idea on her end. And it's even more so considering how her cousin described her as a \"caring mother\". QuoteThe culprit’s cousin, Lisacious Williams, meanwhile, said that the situation couldn’t have been deliberate. According to Williams, Battle was a really caring mother and the whole situation must be a “careless mistake.”It wasn't a simple \"careless\" mistake,  it was a lethal mistake. One I'd consider a \"caring\" mother wouldn't make imo. Quote from: bittraffic on September 07, 2022, 01:06:06 AMI wonder why it's called murder though.

I don't doubt there are gamblers who play online and still don't pay attention to their children, don't feed them, don't talk to them and don't supply every other basic demands children have on that period of their lives. Many of these cases remain in silence until something more extreme happens, like the event shared by you reported on the news.Unfortunatelly from times to times we hear stories about kids who died locked inside cars at the parking while the parents are shopping on the mall or supermarket, but I must say it's the first time I hear kids have died because the parent was actually gambling at a casino.
