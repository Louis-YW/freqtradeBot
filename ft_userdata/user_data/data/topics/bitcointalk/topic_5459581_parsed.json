I don't think so. Number of factors at play that leads to the massive devaluation of the twitter stock and just cause they are up against a twitter clone doesn't mean people will choose them over the latter. For one, Threads actually provides more access and liberty within their platform, against the opinionated Twitter userbase. Another would be the fact that Twitter as it stands today is already a dying platform, no thanks to Elon's belligerent moves that lead to people losing trust in him in the process. I don't see the price of twitter stock increasing any time soon unless Elon passes the ownership over to someone more capable than him, and someone who really knows how to run a social media business more than charging people 8 bucks so they could enjoy the full experience that they were able to anyway before he came in.",

Getting the old one working without problems should be priority. But let's play with the idea: No, it would not. People have been leaving the twitter platform even before the alternative was launched. I have been invested my time into it in the past but now i am just looking for the password for several accounts that i want to shut down. I am getting more and more spam that it's getting worse than telegram private messages. And the amount of trolling...

Thread came up with a more flexible policy and user-friendly option and it also gives users more options. If Twitter comes up with a clone of Twitter, its success will depend on the innovation, operation, and terms and conditions of the app. People want something new that will clearly be better than its rivals or alternative. And if the new app is widely accepted by the end users, the stock price of the company will increase. If Elon Musk comes up with a product that is better than Twitter people will gladly embrace it.",

Since the social media changed ownership, there have been some unfavorable changes made by the new CEO, Elon Musk, which Twitter users have cried out about. I can recall reading through a few articles where a lot of interviews with Twitter influencers were posted, and most people openly cried out for an alternative option that might serve the purpose of Twitter since they are no longer getting what they expect from it. So the hype this thread is getting is as a result of what it offers; if you take a good look at the app, you will see that it's something competitive to that of Twitter. And even if Elon Musk tries to clone Twitter to get another new version of social media, it will not get the same hype because, because of him, most people are already looking for alternative options instead of using the giant social media as they used to. Twitter has now fully been turned into his personal business, where anyone he doesn't want will be kicked out of the forum. And verification is now to be acquired not by originality but by whoever is willing to pay $8, which is going to increase account impersonation more than it has ever been.",

In the long run? I'd say it depends. I mean look at Twitter, Elon made it such a shitshow and yet there are still quite a lot of people that use it. Facebook might have a little bias from me, but it's close to useless imo, but people still use it quite a LOT. Plus, isn't thread less of an insta clone and more like a Twitter clone? I mean if I recall correctly Elon took it as such (I've never used it, and probably never will unless twitter permanently tanks for my commissions). On Elon releasing a new twitter though, that depends. Meta has been pretty stable in their social media dev, if you temporarily remove their mess of a VR game. Elon on the other hand, sucked at it, at launch even. A lot of people have been hating on the man and there was even an API issue with Twitter a few days (or weeks) ago? I reckon anything new out of this man in the social media industry wouldn't make big money.",

Why go through the hassle of creating a replica when you’ve got the original thing. Aside from whatever controversy that may be surrounding his handling of twitter, if he does create a replica of twitter, I highly doubt that app would be a success compared to twitter based on registered users. Threads was born with the aim of attracting users from Twitter so the solution is to fix whatever is broken in Twitter so people would want to remain and more people would be interested in signing up instead of creating a whole new app.",

If the point was that Elon may end up doing some Instagram coıpy, because Mark did twitter copy, then that makes more sense. Because in that case, he already has that too give or take, of course not the same but twitter allows images, he could still build some app on mobile that is mainly focused on images, he can copy that and do something like that to piss off Mark, and not like it would not be used at all, but I feel like it would be an inferior one, he even ruined Twitter itself, so creating a new thing would not be easy, would probably not get that much people.

However the largest issue I see here is if Elon in the future starts to limit twitters views like he did last week due to data scraping from AI. If he keeps limiting people on how many tweets they can read and Threads wont have that issue then I can see many people switching over out of frustration.Another issue is the poor way of how twitter deals with bots. Especially with any type of crypto tweets. You got bots and bots posting fake tweets trying to phish people. Most likely with Threads it will be alot harder to make these new bot accounts. So many people might switch over if they notice Threads doesnt have the same level of spam as Twitter.",

But, that guy with his business mindset didn't really cared about those users because his main intention was to earn a lot of revenue from the platform within a short duration of time.

Meta created the clone in order to grab those users who were dissatisfied with Elon's plans for the Twitter, and Mark Zuckerberg knew that in such times creating an app like Threads could grab those users because they hated the Musk's idea for the future of Twitter. If Elon Musk wants to regain the trust of the users then he will have to convince the users that Twitter is still the old Twitter and the ones who will be using the platform wont be affected in any way due to the recent announcements. Or he may directly declare that he has changed his plans related to changing of Twitter, and even with a simple statement like this the stock price of Twitter will gain a pump within days. But, if Elon continues to stick with his announcements and ideas then in future the stock price of Twitter will fall further down to unexpected levels.",

I think most of the sign-ups are just bots, because how could a huge number of users sign up at the same time? I know it is not impossible, but what one can say is that it is unpredictable.But one thing I can say for sure is that bots are the main characters on Twitter, and many old members do know the skill of making bot accounts on Twitter, and they also know how to keep them alive for longer periods of time without getting banned. So, such characters will also come up with some hacks to make clone accounts in the new Twitter clone app that will be released by Elon Musk.Elon Musk is not trying to compete with Mark Zuckerberg by making another rival app; instead, his intention is to sue Mark for copying the idea of Threads, which was included in Twitter. But the mind of Elon Musk is also unpredictable; who knows if the next morning he comes up with such an idea?I think if Elon made another app or clone of Twitter just like Mark did then Twitter will surpass the number of users as we know both apps have a huge number of users and Twitter has the lead in that if I am not wrong.",
