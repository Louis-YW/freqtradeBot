I’m using traveloka app that gives me discount when I book using fiat so it will be waste to use Bitcoin if I can’t get any discount.",

Thanks in advance!For sure there's something huge brought by NFT and it awakes the curiosity of the people to participate then earn in the world of crypto. And for seeing this posted by media for sure this could create more noise to the government so that they will do something good on it terms of regulation.For now this is good news but for sure BIR is now looking at this statistic and I will not get surprise if they came and ask about taxes on it.",

      "body": "This is simply a resort which would accept cryptos or Bitcoin to be more specific, a mode of payment. Indeed a great contribution with crypto adaptation but people in PH are mostly unaware of what this blockchain, really is. There's still this image of it being a \"fraud\" due to instances wherein investors lost huge amount of money from investing into it. Also, there's no assurance yet whether this plan on the article would last for a long period of time because in the same country, there are establishments who once accepted such mode of payment but eventually chose to stop.Quite unsurprising still, the days for this technology is still young and is still separated with stocks. Businesses who would use such payment method will have a hard time dealing with volatility and maintaining profit for their businesses given how fast market prices moves, especially during bearish market, wherein they will either be forced to just hold, or to 'stop before it get worse' situation. A matter of tolerance with this market's nature.",

So in terms of Bitcoin acceptance, that wouldn't be a problem at all. But in terms of whether there will be a significant Bitcoin payment turnout or an increase in revenue or tourists following this, it's something that's beyond their control. However, I don't think it is easy or even possible to establish \"a micro-economy running entirely on bitcoin.\" Boracay has been catering international and domestic travelers all year round. It isn't an isolated island where activities are very low. So, quite frankly, I doubt this would be feasible. On another note, it feels good that Pouch is a lightning wallet. At least it could easily support small transactions on the island.",
