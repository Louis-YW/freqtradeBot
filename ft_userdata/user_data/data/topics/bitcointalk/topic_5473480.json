  "content": "Hi everyone,It's been several months since I started digging into the technical aspect of Bitcoin and finally, I decided to run a node myself.And I heard this thing that Raspi isn't a sustainable option for the Bitcoin core node. And here's what he said.Start9 no longer recommends the use of PI for Bitcoin. Even the 8 GB is beginning to have trouble with IBD due to the increase in the blockchain size when ordinals. Matt Hill addresses that here “The Raspberry Pi, even the 8GB, is rapidly becoming obsolete. The UTXO set has grown tremendously over the last year and is now around 8GB in size. The Pi has very slow disk speeds over USB, which causes disk cache to build up. Once the cache nears 8GB, all operations will be sent to disk and become extremely slow. This is made worse if you are trying to run other services as well. We no longer recommend the Pi for Bitcoin under any configuration”I was actually looking into getting a Raspi on either StartOS or Umbrel OS to enhance my self-sovereign computing journey with many apps on top of it. Should I refrain from getting one? What are some best \"starter packs\" out there for node nubies?",

For example:https://www.amazon.com/HP-EliteDesk-Quad-Core-Professional-Bit-Multi-Language-English/dp/B08KSGKHVS/ref=sr_1_2?c=ts&keywords=Mini%2BComputers&qid=1699531680&refinements=p_n_condition-type%3A16907720011&s=pc&sr=1-2&ts_id=13896591011&th=1This one costs about double of an rPi, but it has an i5, 16G DDR4 ram... You'll need one with a bigger disk tough, but i've seen them being sold for about the same price in the past. I'm not affiliated with amazon, nor with the seller of this device... Always use your due diligence and only buy from sellers with a good trust rating that offer some form of reasonable guarantee.If you don't mind spending in the ~$250 range, you could even go for a new one like this: https://www.amazon.com/KAMRUI-Desktop-Computers-Computer-Dual-Band/dp/B0CF21D846/ref=sr_1_3?crid=39L6B2YW22OEE&keywords=mini%2Bpc%2B1%2BTb&qid=1699531997&sprefix=mini%2Bpc%2B1%2Btb%2Caps%2C148&sr=8-3&th=11Tb Nvme ssd disk, 16Gb ram, a mobile cpu (which isn't all that great, but it should be sufficient)...I realize the price difference between one of these mini pc's and an rpi is steep, but you do get more bang for your buck...",

Should I refrain from getting one? What are some best \"starter packs\" out there for node nubies?UmbrelOS looks fine for me if you still going with the Raspberry Pi. The interface is very user-friendly. Good side-effect: If you decide to use other hardware over time, you will most likely be able to continue using UmbrelOS because it is compatible with most hardware options.If you asked me for a personal opinion, I would recommend an Intel NUC.There are of course many versions of hardware there. I think with a good i5 and 16gb RAM you are on the safe side. As storage I would recommend 1TB SSD to ensure enough speed and storage for the blockchain data.You are then also flexible whether you want to use umbrelOS or a full node via Bitcoin Core.Of course there are also cheaper solutions as @mocacinno already mentioned. That's up to each individual, but the NUCs have proven themselves time and again to be the most powerful Mini-PCs over the years.It's a shame that the production of new devices is now stopped.",

I even think you could youtube,netflix and run the node.I should did up my thread and run some netflix while it does the node.using linux really helps it. and if I want I can add ram to it and go to 16gb vs 8gblet me find the asus I got for free on ebay.https://www.ebay.com/itm/266476012232?To be clear my buddy has a business and they got rid of old laptops grabbed new ones to upgrade.So I got the model above for free.My model has all parts working I pulled the windows ten 500gb spinner put in the 2tb sata ssd.I loaded linux mint.

I can't just order hardware in New York without high shipping cost and import taxes.Quoteso add 100 bucks and you destroy any rasp piFor continuous operation, I'd look at energy costs too. A Raspi is designed to use very little power. Since you're into mining, I assume you have very cheap electricity. Here, the Optiplex will cost more to run a few years than it's initial price.That being said: I like cheap laptops too. They're much more versatile.Quote from: examplens on November 09, 2023, 01:23:10 PMbtw. Speaking of this, based on personal experience, what is the recommended minimum hardware CPU/RAM? Does it make sense to start a node on a laptop with 1 core?I just checked: bitcoind currently uses 6-9% of one Xeon core, and 3% of the system's 32GB RAM. Except for the IBD, it really doesn't take much resources.It's been a long time since laptops with only 1 core were sold, so it depends on which CPU you have. And if it's 15 years old, chances are it lacks RAM too.",

Should I refrain from getting one? What are some best \"starter packs\" out there for node nubies?Big advantage using Rpi4 for me is that it spends little electricity and it can work silently (in same cases), but I am not if it still works fine for Bitcoin node.There is new Raspberry Pi 5 released recently and it is 2-3 times faster than previous generation, and I think this won't have any issues for bitcoin in next few years.This is going to be more expensive, so if you already have old laptop that you don't use you can just use that instead.found a linkhttps://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/\"Does Raspberry Pi 5 need active cooling?Raspberry Pi 5 is faster and more powerful than prior-generation Raspberry Pis, and like most general-purpose computers, it will perform best with active cooling.
