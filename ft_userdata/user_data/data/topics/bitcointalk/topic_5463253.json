  "content": "Greetings my follow Naija bitcoiners, I bring this topic for some of our doctors and nurses in this forum to join other users to put mouth on this matter so that it will help some of our users in this forum to be more concentrate on their health than other investments because, there is a popular saying that health is wealth which I believe. Your overall health and well being should always be your number one priority to spend or pay more attention to because, once something bad happen to your body, it will make you not to have access to all those things that is keeping you busy night and day not to allow you to take good care of your body.HERE ARE SOME OF THE HEALTHY FOOD BITCOINERS NEED TO CONSUME REGULARLY:1) WATER:[/d]  Water is among the healthy food we need to consume every day to maintain our body fluid balance, and there should be no other beverage passing through your mouth or lips other than water.2) REGULAR EXERCISING: As a bitcoiners you need to make your exercise daily to enable you to experience good health, which is the wish of every one here to experience good health till old age. Regular exercising burns calories and helps you to manage your weight, and it will also prevent you from stroke, which is very common among young boys and girls these days. I guess, we need to take a good care of our body than others businesses we are doing around our various environment. Don't you think is a good advice to bitcoiners? Do You believe that your health is your greatest wealth and assets to pay more attention?. Your opinion is highly welcome.",

I don't no wat it will profits u to mix interpret someone topic. Well I assumed to take this as a misinterpretation of my comment even though I already apologize before I started my comment,  you have the right to make whatever interpretations you wish to but I will put every efforts to make sure I pass the right information and points that I have carefully formulated that I think it will be helpful to you and other members of bitcointalk. My friend please note that,  English is not our native language and at that we may read wrong meaning to each other comments here in the forum,  which is why many of us both newbies and legendary alike have some misconceptions with ourselves based on diffenrces in our thoughts knowledge and experiences. It is only in Africa that we think that a critic is an energy just because his thoughts oppose ours,  well my friend I wish you whatever you wish me and wish yourself. Based on our common goal in Bitcointalk forum which is what connect me and you to involve I a discussion that is why I advised us from Nigerian mostly newbies to get involved in cryptocurrency related discussions and we should try to aligned our threads content with relevant cryptocurrencies information that are provable verifiable and tested. Because of the need for financial knowledge and and risk management that we need coming from a third-world country like Nigeria,  a few of us are lucky to be exposed to contemporary inventions and innovations that can help us in our poor microeconomic system. Engaging in cryptocurrency related discussion in the local board will help most of our newbies to build the needed knowledge that will guide them to become quality members of the forum in the future.",

Like you said \"health is wealth\" which we all know it is only a person who is healthy and alive that can make money to be wealthy so therefore it is wise and wisdom applies that one needs take good care of their health. But I think your research is very poor to start with it. It would have been better you did a good and thorough research work as it bothers health matters for us to learn very well as this post is just scanty and nothing to hold unto.Anyways you did well to have brought up this idea of we taking good care of our health as we only have one life to live here on earth and this requires utmost importance and attention be given to our health.Do well to go into research properly before coming here to feed us with information.",

Health is wealth, as it's basically said, and every investor should be reminded about that so they don't forget. If there was an off-topic sub-board on this local board, then I would have personally reported the thread to be moved to off-topic because that's where it belongs.",

Like the sayings goes \"health is wealth\", one must be in a stable heath condition before thinking of doing anything work to earn a living.

Exercise is very good and it keeps on younger and fit,exercise also burns out fat and helps in proper circulation of blood in our body. Among all what man takes into his body for growth that can never be excess is water,because it is good for our health. The rest intakes might be harmful to our health when they are excess. Eating balance diet is the major key to good health,I believe that OP is only reminding us what we were taught in elementary school.",

You are very correct , as unfortunate as this may sound , I will also have to confess that for several weeks now, or should I even say months,  I've not really gone out of my room, my wife is the one managing our business , she goes to shop with the children(in this holiday period), while all I do is just sit at home working (trading )with my laptop.And due to the constant sitting, leaning forward while typing on my laptop , Ive been feeling a very serious and severe pain in the back of my neck/shoulder area for like several weeks now , I've spent some money on body pain drugs but the drugs seems not to work , and I can also confess that I've not had time to exercise at all for several months now..So right now, I am going to try to come up with routine exercise plan, that will help eliminate the pain, and make sure I stay as heathy and pain free as possible, even while spending more time at home ..This is just to confirm that indeed , some kind of pain or health issues we fave or experience sometimes, is as a result of lack of exercise, it's important to exercise, just the same way it is important to drink water , eat good food , visit the hospital for routine check ups and so on .",
