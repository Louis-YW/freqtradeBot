  "content": "I have learned something so important in the previous bull market that got to about $30k . When the price of bitcoin was $21k I bought some bitcoin and after getting this amount of bitcoin I had target if it gets to $30,000 I will take profit, luckily it got to the price I was targeting but I was reluctant to take profit like I planned thinking the market price will go beyond $30,000 to get more profits but unfortunately the price didn't continue to increase,  but I'm not worried about that because I know the price will definitely increase again and I will get my profit of target. I'm saying this because of some people who may have a target,  it is important for them to hodl to their target and not be carried away by the increase of price of  the market. The market can never be predicted, hold to your target and never be too greedy to make more profit. There is another day for another profit. This is important for people who have been patiently waiting for their target .",

      "body": "I think you should edit and correct your figures; $30 is different from $30,000.  One thing is to have a target; another is to hold onto your decision. If you eventually meet your dream target and, out of greed to make more profit, you miss the chance to sell at that price,To me, it's advisable for you to hold your coin and never sell low, because selling at a lower price when you have already seen a higher price might make you look like a fool. At some point, it's good to sell below your target if you see that the market is dropping. In order to stop losing money, you can sell below your target. But it's always good for you to hold onto your target very strongly; don't allow greed to control you.",

      "body": "It is one of the best strategies to have a target where as the best target is to hold for a longer time but short targets aren’t bad either. I don’t blame you for getting a little greedy when the price was on an increase it was Human. Sometimes I feel when we set target we can Atleast twerk it to gain more if at all the money you invested isn’t an amount that would be of a problem if it runs into loss. But if the money is for a specific purpose and one invested it into bitcoin with a target which is tricky it is better to withdraw immediately the target is met. Regardless do not invest into bitcoin to get a profit at a certain period because the market doesn’t actually have a specific trend.",

This is important for people who have been patiently waiting for their target.From all indications and predictions next year will be better in the Bitcoin space. I know it is not certain because the price is affected by so many uncontrollable economic and political factors but I believe 2024 will bring more profit, so you have not lost anything. You just have to restrategize and set your benchmarks again.But like you advised greed can make us miss great opportunities to make profits. That is why it is better to always follow our investment plans. If your plan states that it is time to sell, you should obey because delay might either lead to loss or a lucky gain.",

      "body": "If it's bitcoin, maybe everyone has a very high selling price target, especially since the price of bitcoin has reached almost $ 60k. So people might have a sell price target of over $60k, maybe over $70k-$100k so they won't sell their bitcoins until they reach their target price.But some will still hold their bitcoins even though maybe the price has reached $100k but they don't sell their bitcoins. That's probably because they realized that the bitcoin price could go up to more than $100k so they're still holding on to the bitcoins.So set your selling price target and wait patiently while accumulating more bitcoins, especially in times like today. If you can keep buying at the low price you are now, you will have more bitcoins and if you sell at your target selling price, you can make a very high profit.",

There's nothing like exceeding your target in that if truly you understand that the Bitcoin market price will rise again and the recent dump in price that happened was just strengthen the market's bullish momentum. Therefore, if you are planning to set a target now when the market is yet to reach a new ATH price you may make a worse mistake, and to prevent that from happening I will advise you to hold for at least a year.",

I mean if you have a plan to sell an asset at a target price, then you can stick to it. but if you have a plan on a time target or the accumulation of the number of assets you have, you also have to be consistent about doing it. this will not be easy for a beginner, but it will be profitable for those who manage to stay consistent with what they planned from the start.",

Don't jump to the conclusion that this year's bull run in bitcoin starts at the $30k price point. There is nothing wrong with someone setting their target price of bitcoin higher than they actually intend to sell it for if they believe the market will continue to grow but later run it didn't. One thing about investing in bitcoin that I can say with certainty is that, as long as you can hold on to your bitcoin assets, you won't be at a loss even if the price of bitcoin doesn't rise as quickly as you had anticipated. With time and patience, the target price will undoubtedly arrive.",

This is important for people who have been patiently waiting for their target .Good advice for yourself. If you're giving yourself a target, no heart feelings and just follow what you've set for. Many of the people that have set for target during the last bull run didn't take their profits because of greed and think that the price of bitcoin shall continue to a higher price. I've learned my experience from 2017 bull run when I didn't take profits. It's normal for someone to feel that there's no need to take profit yet because price might be higher eventually. But then if you've seen in the past that bitcoin is highly volatile, you'll miss that moment within split seconds of not selling it. Always try to convert your profits into stable coins first so that you can comeback and buyback anytime the market goes in a correction. I've got my expectations set for short term and I've got mine as well for the long term. You need to put that boundary and target and do the necessary when you're at the right time.",
