  "content": "I only have a nano ledger s and been using it for a while.  I have btc, bch, btg and waves app on it.  I have coins on btc and bch and waves.  I do not do transactions that much so it is more of a long term storage.  I also have never done any trading before.  But if I want to start doing lot of trading, let say with btc but also with eth and those other coins, i should definitely get a 2nd hardware wallet for this right?  I have heard of metamask and never used it ever.  But I heard if you connect to bad contract or something not good, you could get hacked?  But do many of you just keep it in exchange until you need to cashout?I would llke to try and trade those strange coins like meme coins and I believe these coins are only available in places like uniswap and pancakeswap?  Is that correct?  What exchanges would I even use for this?  Also, I feel it is better using say a nano ledger s plus and thus a 2nd hardware wallet strictly for daily trading with all these altcoins?  That is certainly better than using the nano ledger s since I have add and remove coins since of the limited space?So I want opinion from people who trade those other altcoins .Because it seems less risky with another 2nd wallet where it is more like your daily trading hardware wallet?  So anything you do on it even if you connect it to a malicious contract, it won't affect your nano ledger s right?  The other thing is do many people here use both their 2 hardware wallets on ledger live?  Because I would still plan to have btc wallet in the 2nd hardware wallet.  But it would not affect your main nano ledger s wallet right?Also do people who trade daily keep their coins in say uniswap, pancakeswap or those things.. do you keep the coins there or you move them to your metamask or hardware wallet daily?  Seems like you would be wasting lot of money if you keep moving the coins back and forth daily if you are a trader?  I also recall sending eth is expensive so can't imagine one is sending eth tokens at end of the day everyday to their hardware wallet due to the fees?",

      "body": "1. You don't need a separate hardware wallet. Just use a separate Ethereum wallet address (a.k.a. account). MetaMask supports Ledger, and supports multiple wallet addresses.2. Most \"strange\" coins use DEXs like those you've mentioned, yes.3. Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc aren't like traditional centralized exchanges where you deposit your funds. You swap your tokens directly from your wallet. No deposits and withdrawals needed; unless we're talking about some platforms like dYdX where you do deposit your funds to a smart contract.",

      "body": "If you are a day trader you are likely to just keep your coins in the exchange. Its easier on exchanges than moving from time to time. Hardwallet is for coins you are to keep holding.Memecoins require incredible amount of volume to make it which SHIB do have in binance and this is where you should be going too. Not going to swapping exchange that ask for higher fee where you can't easily see which price is best to pick.",

      "body": "If you are daily traders, you must store your coins in- Your accounts at centralized exchanges if you want to trade- Your non custodial wallets if you want to use decentralized exchanges and swapThe first option can give your cheaper trading fee. The second option (swap) might require swap fee with on-chain transactions with which fees can be cheap or expensive. That depends on each blockchain as well as different time of swapping.I know it is not safely to store your coins at centralized exchanges but if you are daily trader, you have no choice (if you don't use decentralized exchanges). But if you want to be safe, don't use all capital for trading and store all of it at centralized exchanges.",

Not only these days but even before its already recommended to have a hardware wallet and then keep most of our funds there to attain maximum security because we don't know what can happen in an online exchange and even if they claim to be the best or trusted, it will still be possible for them to be hacked or they themselves can cause a problem to the traders where they can freeze or hold the funds of the traders for some (not really valid) reasons like on what we hear on the stories of bank users because both of them are the same.They are both centralized entities but unfortunately, there are still some traders who are lazy and think they can save more money in terms of fees so they don't do that kind of practice.",

What should be the case is whether the questions are valid or not. If the questions he ask are valid and reasonable, there should always be answees irrespective of how often he asks or how bulky they appear to be.It could also mean that no one has answered the questions to his satisfaction that is why he is creating more questions . If he surely understand the answer given him  I don't think there to be need asking similar questions again.
