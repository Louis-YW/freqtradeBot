  "content": "Hello, Setting up a little over 300 Asic Miners (s19j pros mixture of 92th, 96th, 100th, 104th) all of which will be immersion-cooled. I am looking for suggestions on any mining software that can achieve the following:1) Overclocking capabilities up to 5000W2) Fans will be removed when immersed, need software to spoof the fans.3) Farm/Miners can be remotely managed, this will be vital. 4) Capable software that can be flashed for beaglebone5) Decent Dev/Pool Fees I have heard of VNISH (all 3 of them), Awesomeminer, and Braiins. However, I have no experience with them and I would like to gauge the opinion of the community to understand any pros and cons and what the best software may be for me. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you",

You already mention the 5 pros of this firmware but the dev fees are different.Like awesomeminer developer's fee is 2.8% and then Vnish firmware Dev fee 1.6-1.9% only for S9/T9, 2.6- 2.9% for S17/T17 and above units and for braiin's dev fee 2-2.5%.",

      "body": "So if you listen to kano you would pick the non violating firmware. Why violate when you don't have to.That would be braiins which means you pay a fee of 2-2.5%If you are buying 300 s19j units I would suggest you run 10 on braiins and see if they clock well for you.Then you can slowly shift the other 290 units over.Some claim brains fees are not transparent but if you set up multiple accounts with viabtc you can see exactly how well it does.  10 braiins via account 1  10 stock   via account 2280 stock   via account 3run for 10 days see the difference in accounts 1 and 2then do  20 braiins via account 1  20 stock   via account 2260 stock   via account 3run for 10 daysthen do 30 braiins viabtc account 1 30 stock   viabtc account 2240 stock  viabtc account 3match the units ratings ie  do 2x 92 2x 96 2x 100 4x 104. for the test of 10 against 10match the units ratings for the test of 20 vs 20match the units ratings for the test of 30 vs 30you will have a decent idea of what is best and feel very comfortable with the decision you made.With 300 pieces of gear that cost over 1 million dollars my test design is worth doing. Not hard and fairly scientifically done. Along with no violations of software.BTW kano rails against VNISH, Awesomeminer, and braiins for various reasons.But in your case you really do need aftermarket firmware and braiins is the only one that really fits the bill.Good luck mining.",

Let's remember who is putting the money for the miners, and others...

Those \"J\" miners that came from factory with PSU rev d,e,f,g are currently unsupported.As for overclocking, i have seen them work with the Gullpower at 191TH (S19 Pro 110), though i don't condone that practice, I'm much more in favor of efficiency, especially with the current hashprice. But yeah some crazy people out there did use those 8000W PSUs with Braiins OS+ just fine. The current version has a powerlimit max of 6500W, which could at the wall end being more so you must very careful, start with defaults and only after Tuner is \"Stable\", slowly try higher values monitoring everything especially temperature. Do note that not all aftermarket PSUs work.Only factory firmware requires spoofers.You can use third party programs for this, in this very forum you can check some like foreman, mineitor, awesomeminer, etc. Or set up a VPN or leave a remote desktop app running in a pc onsite.Braiins OS+ runs from micro SD cards ONLY, there is no flashing due to manufacturer hardware locks in place. Testing is only a matter of inserting the microSD card, and you just remove it when you want to go back to factory firmware. No NAND or EEPROM writes of any kind ever.Any miners with Braiins OS+ you point to Braiins Pool (formerly known as Slush Pool) will have the pool fee from the hashrate of those miners returned to you. The pool fee is 2%. Other pools take 2.5% or more (when they don't keep your money by \"suspending\" withdrawals...).",

SD card like Sandisk is the easiest one to find genuine or authentic, unlike Samsung SD cards you need to manually check them using an SD card checker to know if it's authentic or not.",

      "body": "Actually they can stamp whatever if you pay them, even \"Sandisk\" so that's not very useful in many countries. However, the largest capacities and fastest speeds tend to be faked more, so you use reverse scammer psychology and aim for the smallest and slowest which were unlikely to be faked.Ideally you would not immerse the control board, but if you do, when you take out the sd you need to degrease the contacts in both the control board and the sd card from the dielectric liquid before inserting it again.",
