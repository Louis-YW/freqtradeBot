I now combine trading strategies and it has helped me to better filter my trading signals for greater performance. And if any of that strategies did not confirm the same signal, I do not go for it.Do you mean trading indicators? Becuase it is indicators that can be pointing to one direction.Using little amount of money, stop loss, take profit, martingale (very risky), the type of trading (like swing, day trading and scalping), the leverage used, how you analyse market with indicators, the type of mode used and everything you are doing to make profit from trading can be regarded as strategy.Everything a trader did to make profit, or that result to loss is called trading strategy. So it would be good to specific on one part, like the indicators used, the trading type and the likes instead of generalizing on the strategies used.In trading, most traders naturally developed different strategies as one is not working, the trader move to another to see if it would works. Traders prefer to focus on the one that best worked for them to achieve the profit they want from trading.",

The best for you will be a strategy with some indicators that work for you and it can be a strategy you copy from someone else or a strategy you build it up by yourself.QuoteI now combine trading strategies and it has helped me to better filter my trading signals for greater performance. And if any of that strategies did not confirm the same signal, I do not go for it.It is not true if you only open your position if all strategies show a same signal. Because each strategy works for a specific trading taste, risk management so you can not requires all strategies give you a same signal.In market, there are sellers and buyers. A signal that works for sellers will not work for buyers.QuoteWhat about you, what is your preference, and why?Whatever trading strategy you use, don't forget about investment which will help you rich.",

In case you have one very well performing trading strategy, then it makes a lot of sense to put all your money on that strategy to maximize your profits. The problem is if something goes wrong than our whole money is at risk. When we put all our money in one basket than the risk is much higher than in a diversified portfolio that runs multiple strategies. On the other side is the upside potential also lower for a portfolio with multiple strategies. The chance that all strategies lead to the highest possible return during the same time period is limited. So I think it depends on how well you can handle risk and how much time you have at hand to develop your strategies. Running multiple strategies requires more time in oversight and analysis compared to one strategy. Personally I would always prefer to have multiple strategies that focus on different indicators compared to have only one strategy.",

Trading strategies are not meant to work forever, they are only effective for a duration of time. Knowing more than one strategy and knowing the most effective to use at a time is what a good trader should know. If it is indicators, keeping it as simple and effective as possible should be the target. The more complex your indicators, the more confusing it can be.",

When you're doing that, changing techniques quickly, it can be a little confusing, leading you to believe that they're all the same and only 90% to 100% effective. And I wish that if I could go back in time, I would stick to one strategy. As a result, I've decided to utilize only one method that truly works for me, and I prefer price action trading, which I've merely updated by adding some indicators for more confluences in my trade to increase the probability.",

You have to browse the internet and get updated about the market. I guess you know that sometimes the news plays a significant role in the market. Positive news can help the market to grow, and negative news can make it down. So, You should keep your eyes on as many things as possible. You have to be aware of market manipulation so you don't lose. Make a strategy that works for you. Sometimes it doesn't go as planned. So, even though you use a strategy, be ready to do something from out of the strategy when needed. Do you believe in signals? I don't think any pro traders believe in some trading signals. Most of the doesn't go as planned.",

And when that happened, in my mind flashed \"good luck\" using the strategy I chose. For me it is a wise choice, because it is like depending on luck.Whereas when using just one strategy, even if it's wrong then I can find out the location of my mistake and it can be used as a lesson in the future.",

Sometimes using another strategy in the trade helps like you have rightly pointed out. Like indicators can at times coverge at a point which is either a support and resistance and for me if I see such, I have more confidence that is a good trade to take but stop loss is activated because anything is possible in trading..Quote from: EarnOnVictor on June 03, 2023, 07:47:26 AMWhat about you, what is your preference, and why?Yes, I do experience such.

Even if the trading results are not very good right now, you can continue to improve and a working strategy will be found.Worst of all, when a trader does something chaotic, without any strategy, it seems to me that such actions will always lead to only one outcome, this is the loss of the entire trading deposit. And if you lose money during the strategy test, then some one should work for you, or you will choose different strategies for yourself and be able to combine them for yourself. This is not an easy job, but if you can do it, then it will bring profit.",
