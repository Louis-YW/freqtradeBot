  "content": "I never wanted to share this with the forum but i felts it would also help most of us here and also let people be more conscious with their phones or devices especially in this bull run. Yesterday night i was walking with my friend who happens to have invested in bitcoin and also he is a bitcoin trader, though i took him as my guider whom i am following gradually to know how to trade and understand how the cryptocurrency market works. Even though here is more greener for bitcoin related discussions but i didn't have that satisfying urge to follow up here rather i love someone whom i will be seeing face to face and how he is doing it practically to enable me follow up his steps. Last night he called me on phone to come accompany him to the nearest mall that he wanna get some things for his girlfriend that he made some profits with recent bitcoin increase and he is living a very open life, which i don't support such acts and of his showy lifestyle. When he called, I step out to meet with him where he said he was waiting for me, on the process since is late i had to go keep my phone knowing too well that is already late to use it at night, so while we moved out get all everything he needed to get from the mall, along the line we were waiting for taxi to board home while standing along the road, some boys (about 4) stopped from tricycle and snatched his phone from him and zoom off. I was like what could be the problem or could it be that some people already gotten information about him to have come to rob him this way? This easily speak to me that is a results of his showy lifestyles and if he is that calm or doesn't always show off about his bitcoin investment there wouldn't had been a day such incidents could had happened to him, or just imagine I came out with my phone i could have also lose my phone. The funny thing is that he doesn't leave his assets into a non custodial wallet, instead he keep saying that he preferred leaving his assets into exchange to enable him to trade when the market requires to trade or when their is a sharp buy or sell. But now, he lost everything; his phone, assets.What i learned from that accident is that; - At night we should always learn to keep our important device at home.- Always store our assets in a non custodial wallet and keep seedphrase safe from same device.- Always use phone that we do not attached our crypto trading apps.- Move out important assets to other wallets instead of using that same phone or personal computer, which we have only access, keep our seedphrase out from same phone we are using. The run is here and bitcoin recent increase has spike up the space and has gain more attention than ever, so anyone who is trading or holding bitcoin should do that in a calm way without letting the next person knows about their holding. Most importantly do not always move out with your trading device be it smart phone, ipad, ipod or whatever the case maybe.Welcome the bull run!",

You always need to be careful with your device and wallets, not only in bull run. If you lose 1 bitcoin, in either bull market or bear market, it's the same, 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin.Don't underestimate your loss in a bear market or overestimate your loss in a bull market.Be OPSEC and secure your devices, wallets, with good habits when using your devices and are on Internet as well as trying to keep your low profile. Your investment in bitcoin need to be in secret and private mode too. Don't try to be noisy and inform others that you are a Bitcoin investor.It increases security risk on your devices, wallets and your life safety can be damaged too.Physical Bitcoin attacks.Bitcoin and security resources.Security checklist.",

They could just easily reset the phone and sell it but thanks to the irresponsibility of your friend, they might just have landed in a (digital) gold mine.Though if they are amateurs and not exactly technologically advanced, maybe his funds will be safe. But I am not sure if he can have it back anymore. If you know you are handling sensitive information and is holding assets in your phone, take extra precautions. This will serve a big lesson to him and to all of us.",

No matter how secured you protect your funds if you let people know your source of wealth and amount There's a likelihood of been attacked and worse case cost a life. Well what's really rampant during Bull market is the increase in scams But security and privacy should be given priority even in Bears. 2 FA could help and if I'm not mistaken your friends phone should be locked How were they able to gain access to the phone?Since it's on CEX even if they were able to gain access before anything he should have had the time to move the coins to other wallets.",

Scammers do not DCA or have any plans to invest, their overall plan is to steal from someone, you have to make sure it is not you that fall victim to them. It will be very painful to loose the investment yo have in this period.",

You have to understand your environment and ensure that you are security-conscious at all times. If you live in a country where there is a high rate of crime, then you shouldn't use your phone in public at night. People who fluent their wealth are also targeted by these criminals. Nobody in the neighbourhood knows that I am involved in cryptocurrencies because there is an assumption that Bitcoiners are rich. I don't also stay late at night except I am using a personal car or a booked cab.
