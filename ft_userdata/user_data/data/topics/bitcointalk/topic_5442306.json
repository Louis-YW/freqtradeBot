Don't blame your self though, everyone has gone to that same painful start and think that bitcoin is a scam.And what makes it hard like in my case I fell on a bitcoin doubler scam in 2017. But still though I remain very positive and keep pushing and truly understand how bitcoin can be very positive as you can gave financial freedom.",

All other cryptos have followed it's path but have failed to deliver what bitcoin has provided as most of the altcoins are actually centralised setup for personal benefits first of all and there are many ponzi scams also in shitcoins but is there any specific coin you have been victim of?Quote from: Kara3 on March 04, 2023, 12:47:54 PMWhen I started my bitcoin journey is when I knew how ignorant and misinformed I have been all this while.This is what happens with most of people like they have been under some negative influence which says bitcoin is not good or say too expensive like they can't afford to buy satoshis with small amounts also or any other misconceptions but they all break once you are familiar with the true working of bitcoin.If you are interested in watching more videos about bitcoin then you can see it hereYou can also read Mastering Bitcoin by Andreas Antopoulos which will give you enough knowledge about it and you will be more interested in this coin and why should invest in it.",

If we know that investments that appear too good to be true do not work, ponzi schemes are easy to spot. However, there were times when we were able to comprehend, but our greed caused us to put some of our hard earned money at risk. This year is an ideal time to purchase bitcoins before the price explodes. It could also help and a friendly reminder to DYOR as always.",

BTC is not just about establishments and Government that makes it real but massive bitcoiners who for no reason have no doubt about the well doing of the project. Is not too late you decided to queue in but you still have to learn, I hope you're aware BTC is not a get rich quick scheme but a financial technology that operates on principles of trading, investment and mining. Anything you wish to engage in I advise you learn effectively, no business that do not incur losses including BTC but BTC required time and patients to navigate through the market.

I lost bitcoins to Ponzi as well as I often share here in this forum whenever a topic like this is raised and was misinformed too for a while, but with some extra effort I was able to find out quickly compared to some others that bitcoins were very real and different from any Ponzi.

You won’t make it profitable unless you have the knowledge and experience on how to do grow your bitcoin investment. Otherwise, you might only be buying it at a low price, and sell it at an even affordable price due to panic selling because you can’t understand how the crypto market works.",

For example back in 2012-2013 someone introduced bitcoin to me by telling me something like \"you get paid by using your PC to solve mathematical equations\". Obviously I thought that is a dumb thing and logically I ignored bitcoin altogether until about 2 years later in 2014 where I was introduced to bitcoin again but this time as a \"censorship resistant currency that you can use without needing any middle man\" and obviously I was hooked right away regretting the lost couple of years.Nowadays things are the same still. There are people who introduce bitcoin as a lot of weird things like as a \"profit making\" tool which you invest in! This is obviously one of the reasons the adoption is this slow.This is also why I have always tried to introduce Bitcoin to others as a currency not an investment or something you mine, etc.",
