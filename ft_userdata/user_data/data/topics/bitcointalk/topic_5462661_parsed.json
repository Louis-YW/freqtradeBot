For ending of 2021 bitcoin price was not going down and instead it was going up and the bear market come at the second quarter of the 2022 and from November which was the last quarter of the year 2022, bitcoin market changed narrative, the price was rising and till date bitcoin price has not gone down to $16k again. And the next halving will start either from the last quarter of this year 2023 or early part 1st or 2nd quarter of 2024. So from the past years I have witnessed bitcoin prices, it has not been a bad market for the end of each years. And from the prediction and speculations, bitcoin price will not too bad at the end of this year. And I don't know how you saw yours in the past years and how you are going to see this year price as well.",

My point is why does this happen as we draw to the close of year so far?What's your take on my observation? Have you noticed this too?What could be the reason behind it?Your response is appreciated!It is not usually like that, there are some end of the years that are probably next to halving year just like this year 2023 and they are end to a year after halving period like end of 2021. And some are between the halving period just like 2022. Now let’s take a look at that of 2021, the halving period which happened in 2020 caused the bull run to happen in 2021 where last quarter of 2021 saw bitcoin hit a record ATH of $69k on Nov 10. Then that of 2022 was a little different because the entire year was filled with bad news around cryptocurrency as some Altcoins eat the dust and some exchanges faced went down which caused it to be in state of bearish period entirely So looking at both years ending on different trend we can say that they are not always a bad end to each year but the market and economic situations sometimes are the result of each years ending price and not necessarily a regular low price at each year ending. Some of the years after halving have always been bullish and some before it are filled with bearish period. So each year ending is quite different.",

The dip back in 2022 December was due to FTX shit and some other shits and back in 2021 the price of BTC dropped why? here are some factors to shed an eye on --> https://www.reuters.com/technology/bitcoin-extends-downtrend-falls-121-47176-2021-12-04/I think we should not take these measurements as indicator because these are not.",

It could be an opportunity drop, but it could as well become an ETF approval and then you'll not see sub 30k bitcoin for a long time. Maybe never. If you don't have any bitcoin buy some now and leave yourself some money in case it really drops. If you have some bitcoin, procure some money to be ready to buy the dip. Don't sell your bitcoin to wait for the dip that may not come. IMO it's going too far in one direction without considering the other.",

I wouldn't tell you yes or no but my advice is this; if you have the intention to buy bitcoin, do so ad don't procrastinate about it, my reasons are is because it is at the point where you wouldn't have loss if you hold in for the long term, the demand in this support zone are massive and market makers are also doing anything possible not to go beyond $29k, halving is fast approaching than we anticipate, so, there is assurance that this force will help you minimize your risk if you invest wisely.",

Bitcoin wouldn't, in my opinion, ever again increase in value the way it has since its inception if prices were to fall sharply around the end of each year. It would have been a rise in price from Q1 to Q3, and a sharp decline in price in Q4 of every year (causing it to dip below). Having said that, you should be aware that the bitcoin market is circular. We have a bull run and a bearish market in that circle, which has halving seasons every four years. When halving season is approaching, it is normal for bitcoin's price to increase a little bit at the end of the year before to halving season. There are predictions that bitcoin will soar in price to at least $35k-$45k by the end of this year since next year is the halving season of bitcoin.",

People are scrambling around trying to find money to fund their christmas celebration and gifts and that's why bitcoin falls tremendously during these times. It's been like that except way back in December of 2020 but only because it coincided with an impending bull run thanks to the belligerent Elon Musk and the anticipation of the people over 2020's halving. Next year's probably going to be the same thing, and this year too. So it's not something that's out of the ordinary or something that should concern you. Every Valentine's day I notice that bitcoin also falls in value although not as much as when December comes around. Same for every regular holiday in the US for some reason lol.",

For example, towards the middle of 2021, the bull market started to settle in until the end of the year, but in 2022, the bear market started and lasted throughout the year. You can't really tell what it will look like this year, but if you feel that the price of Bitcoin is really going to provide a golden opportunity towards the end of this year for you to buy lower than what the price is right now, then you can reverse some fiat till then, but never stop DCAing, so that if the opportunity doesn't come, you wouldn't have to regret it.",

Between the two years, which one presented a better price to acquire more Bitcoin?From the stats above, I think what the OP ought to realize or should take out of all that is the fact that, there isn’t a period of the year for buying. The sentiment about festive seasons is that, people tend to spend more rather than invest and for commodities like bitcoin investments, there are those who would liquidate a portion of there portfolio to ensure the festive seasons remains one of merry for them and when that happens on a large scale, the price of bitcoin is being affected but that ain’t the case is it?Bitcoins price isn’t determined by seasons and times of the year, it has no particular element to it although, the halving has been speculated to bring the bullrun and that’s just about it but then, your better of @OP using DCA in meeting up with your investments.
