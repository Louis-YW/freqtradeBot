      "body": "Obvious reason is, these bets kinda 'share' the same outcome, so it's just common sense for the bookie to disallow certain bets to be parlayed for this reason. Most bookies that I see only implement this type of restriction on parlays and nothing else. If you can give an example on some bets wherein parlay isn't allowed, that would be great, and we can even help you understand the reason why this isn't allowed.",

What do you think are the reasons for that?It is against their advantage to do so,in fact it poses a huge threat to them.Let me make you an example,you cannot make a bet in F1 for the winner to be also included in the same bet that the winner will be also in the top 3 and included also that it will be in the top 10,this means that they have to give you three odds but if you win the bet for the winner you automatically win the other bets that made the parlay.I think this is the reason why 99% of the sport book don't allow that.",

Another possible reason aside from the outcome would be the interest of their users since a lot of gamblers would still prefer to go with single bets due to how juiced SGPs can be. On the other hand, SGPs are slowly becoming popular as some of the top bookies have them as betbuilders.",

The current gambling websites are quite simple, some people might want to just play single bets instead of interlinked multiple ones which are even much harder to predict as well. I do think the sites generally wants to make things easier and avoid giving huge money to the gambler incase they win. You can look at this :  https://bookiesbonuses.com/us/parlay-betting-sites maybe there might be some sites that you can use as well.",

Maybe because if a game goes one way, like a really high scoring game, then all those things can be easily connected in which makes the parlay a lot easier to win versus a parlay with a multitude of games?",

I am not so familiar with NFL games, so I would show an example on the NBA game tomorrow which is the Celtics vs Heat. On my bookie, we have Celtics that thas a spread of -8.5, and the over/under is 201.5. If I decide to place a  parlay bet on (-8.5 + under 201.5), this is not possible because it's on the same event.",

Almost all the advantages are on the bettors, especially if the team is played by heavy Favorites. Bettors can take advantage of combining the Moneyline and Handicap odds for the Favorite team. The low odds given to the Favorite for Moneyline are useless anymore and the market won't be balanced.",

      "body": "There is a very obvious reason for this. Imagine if they allow parlaying on the same event then it's possible one would parlay events like over 2.5 goals, over 1.5 goals and over 0.5 goals because technically if you are betting on 3 goals then it's also higher than 1.5 and 0.5 and this can be abused in many other ways. Another example would be betting on runs in cricket and betting on over 300.5 let's say and then you can parlay for over 250.5 or 275.5 and so on ..There are bet builders available for some sites like sportsbet and stake so you can use them to build your bet on the same event since they are designed in such a way that they won't allow you to group similar markets or markets that have an impact on each other. I am personally not good at making bet builder bets so I rather go with singles and parlays for multiple events.",

But I don't think it is enough reason. At the end of the day, the numbers on the over/under for example are coming from themselves. And I am sure that these numbers are the ones which are 50:50 to happen. If there is a dominant team which is aggressive and has a high tendency to hit high numbers, they are always free to adjust the numbers. They don't provide odds on easy wins after all. I am also confused on disallowing parlay on the same event.",
