Some are like, \"This delay is killing the momentum. We need that ETF to surge the market!\" Others are more cautious, saying, \"Maybe it's good to take time and get things right. Quality over speed, right?\"And let's not forget the impact of the first US BTC futures-based ETF listing on NYSE back in 2021. That thing kicked off a bull run like nobody's business. People are wondering if history might repeat itself. Could we see another surge if the SEC finally approves this one too? It's like waiting for a sequel to unfold, with fingers crossed.This a mix of excitement and anxiety. People are speculating about how the price might react. Some think the uncertainty will lead to a temporary dip, while others believe it's just a bump in the road, and the long-term trend will keep moving up.Personally, I'm all about hoping for that approval. I mean, it's not just about the price for me; it's about the wider impact. If the SEC gives the green light, it's like a signal to the whole world that we're moving forward.",

They typically just delay Bitcoin ETF decisions and then when they can't delay any longer they reject them. Gonna be the same thing for all the current ETF applications. As long as Gensler is head of the SEC there will be no Bitcoin ETFs getting approved, which means we've got minimum 3 years before a BTC ETF unless Gensler somehow gets removed from his office.",

Now that they delay the decision to be on 2024, I guess they figure it's too early to decide this year and it doesn't coincide with the 4-year cycle of bull run. SEC must have planned all these as well so we are right on time still. BTC Futures Market approval on coinbase however was approved but it plunged the market down. This is how it affects the market when it's related to the Futures market compared to Spot ETF.",

It's somehow the part where we couldn't understand why they were doing it and making it possible to accumulate more BTC for the people who believe it can increase in price. For sure we cannot know the real reason but at least we can do something about what we are going to do about it. More and more time would be great for us if we really want to accumulate more. It's best to maximize the profit opportunity if it launches.",

Market is bleeding right now. Do not know exactly what is happening wrong here but i think this is just temporary or i should say the news like PayPal which avoid the direct buying and selling through BTC and USDT is no longer be available on 3 different blockchain but i am not seeing any direct relation of this on BTC but finger are crossed. Even according to one news 1005 BTC are just transferred from one place to another which also a alert because they are active after 13 long years. Well, all i can say for now is, i am also in the favor of the acceptance of these approvals because that's the only way the price will get a huge boost because interest rates are not going to help any near soon.",

The ETF is based of Bitcoin and the thing is confirm that as soon the ETF gets approved the price of Bitcoin will see a surge without any doubt. I think SEC is delaying the ETF only make weak heart people to sell off their Bitcoin because in fear of no price increase such investors will get rid of their holdings.I'm more than sure that SEC is delaying the ETF for upcoming bull run because they know that approval of such ETF would increase the confidence of investors on Bitcoin and as a result Bitcoin may get higher in price. I'm very sure that the bull run is going to start from the 2nd quarter of 2024 and that's the best time for approval of such ETF's. I'm quite sure that as soon as the ETF gets approved the price of Bitcoin will get a huge surge, and people at that time would think that why they haven't invested in Bitcoin when it's price was still under $30k.",

However, to be fair to them 2024 is when we have our halving, and 2025 will be the new ATH probably (based on history but there is no guarantee), so I assume that if they wait another year or two and then accept it, and if its Blackrock, one of the biggest companies in the world, then I am guessing that its going to be pretty great to have it be approved right at the bull period time. It will be something special, the price will go up a lot at first, but then it will also go up a lot more with this news, everything is a FOMO material during the bull market so this will be a great timing.",

To further increase the role of centralized corporations in the circulation of bitcoins? Large funds that will accumulate huge amounts of bitcoins in their accounts by offering their clients ersatz bitcoins, which are essentially little different from fiat? The fewer bitcoins left in free circulation, the easier it will be for centralized corporations and governments to impose rules that everyone else can only use ersatz bitcoins in the accounts of these centralized corporations, and then bitcoin will no longer be the same as Nakamoto dreamed of.Yes, bitcoin is open to everyone, including these corporations, and there's not much we can do about it.
