      "body": "Thank you, I will check them.Edit:I have looked at those suggestions, downloaded and started looking at the code.  This is my first foray into Github.  The level of comments in the code is just horrible. But I am looking.Then I found this:  https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_formatI presume this is the method to translate the private key to the public one.  In my words:Add 0X80 to the msb end and hash it.  This is the majority of the key.Hash it again, but use only the first 4 bytes and put that on the LSB end.Encoded it as Base58 and this is the WIF (Wallet Import Format AKA Wallet Export Format) of the public key.Do I understand this correctly?",
