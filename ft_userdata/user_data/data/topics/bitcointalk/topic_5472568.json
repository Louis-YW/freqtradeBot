  "content": "One fascinating aspect of altcoins, especially the good ones, is the potential for significant profits. I'm aware that not everyone agrees with this, as there are often arguments that altcoins are just another form of 'shitcoin' meant to deceive and exploit people, with Bitcoin being the only legitimate cryptocurrency.First and foremost, it's true that Bitcoin is considered the king of cryptocurrencies, and that status is unlikely to change. However, let's talk about the profit potential. Some coins, which we hold before the altcoin season, can provide substantial returns compared to Bitcoin. Speaking from experience, I held AGIX, INJ, RUNE, and ETH before the recent positive trend in the market. We can observe how much the market has appreciated, and it may continue to do so until the end of the month.Imagine if you're the type of person who held these coins earlier, even when the market was in a downturn. You would understand how much you've earned just by holding.Identifying a good coin requires thorough research, and more coins are continuously being developed. I recently noticed TIA listed on some exchanges and has been doing significantly well in price upsurge. Maybe due to the altseason we are in. But, If a coin has a strong community and utility, it's likely to perform well in the long run.The essence of all this is that some individuals might not openly share this, but the world of cryptocurrency is versatile, and conducting in-depth research is key to achieving profits.EDIT: Okay, it seems that many people don't fully understand what I'm trying to convey. Not all coins are fake. While I know that some do understand my perspective, let me clarify some misconceptions.I'm not generalizing all altcoins as worthless. No, I understand that some individuals view altcoins negatively, possibly because they invested late during the coin's peak hype or chose the wrong coin.The easy way to navigate this is by: a. Trying out Centralized Exchanges and conducting in-depth research, as I mentioned earlier.How can this help you (I won't go into detail, but I'll keep it brief. When I have more time, I'll write a post on how to find profitable coins).Steps to find good coins, as I mentioned earlier:Using a centralized exchange offers security. Why is that so? There is a multitude of coins being developed daily on DEX, and verifying their legitimacy might be as low as 10%. This is why many people end up getting rug pulled when trying to get in early or buying a coin expecting it to rise. Those who do this are called \"Degens.\" Unless you have mastered the method of buying a coin on DEX that favors you, what you buy is often referred to as a \"Shitcoin.\"By using a centralized exchange to obtain a coin, you have a 50-70% chance of avoiding a Shitcoin or a rug pull. The two exchanges I prefer for buying altcoins are Binance and Bitget. However, the latter lists more altcoins than the former, so I primarily use it as they continue to add good altcoins. The remaining percentage is for me to conduct my own in-depth research, including checking their Whitepaper, community, and other factors that can qualify the altcoin as a long-term or short-term hold.So, it's essential to understand that there's always a distinction between \"Bitcoin, Altcoins (offering both short-term and long-term profit potential), Shitcoins (promising quick profits but with risks), and Rugpull coins.\"",

These factor made them to dislike altcoin. It might be that some benefited but majority didn't benefit. There are altcoin with good potential but too much flooding of fake altcoin in the crypto space made people not to spot the difference between them. If you ask me the best altcoin to invest on I can't tell you neither, because I was also a victim. Now I chose Bitcoin over all other coin and it's my decision. Anyone has his own choice.",

If we compare it to the real world, Bitcoin (BTC) is gold, while altcoins are just FIAT currencies from various countries. Altcoins are indeed the most conservative way to earn multiple profits than Bitcoin (BTC), but they lack fundamentals on the sustainability side.

I bet many veterans in this forum would not even care about replying to this kind of thread because they have seen this a lot of times. Still, I do believe that we should take the \"research\" seriously and not just take it for granted. Don't stop at reading just the whitepaper although it is boring. Check the team, check how they are marketing their project, look for what products they can offer that are essential in the economy today, and more. I have supported a lot of projects before and some did success while most failed. We should also look at how the market will behave because we could be supporting a good project but what if it's at the wrong time while something else is being hyped? We may be wasting our time in doing so.",

Although they are not as widely recognized or used as Bitcoin, they have real value and are traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. However, as with any investment, it is important to do research and understand the risks before investing in altcoins or any other cryptocurrency. Yes, that's right. The cryptocurrency market has seen the rise of numerous altcoins, some of which have turned out to be scams or fraudulent schemes. It is essential for investors to do research and exercise caution before investing in any cryptocurrency to avoid falling prey to such scams.",
