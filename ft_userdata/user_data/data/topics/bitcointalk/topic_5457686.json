  "content": "Hello online casinos and other crypto related businesses.I manage a news and opinion website focused on a Western European country. I briefly had Google Ads on this site, but I want nothing to do with Google. I'm looking for BTC-related companies, such as casinos, crypto trading platforms, or anything that fits the website.It's a website targeting a more traditional audience. By traditional, I mean people, especially those aged 30 and above, who despise globalization and value their privacy. Particularly now, as money seems to be centralized and cash is at risk of disappearing, all these people are seeking alternatives but don't know where to start. I think this audience has value for many of you.I build the website in 2019. I went up at the 1st of october 2019.We have a newsletter-email list. It is not an affiliate website. There is just 1 ad from a reader. People on my platform come because they are interested in what we write and which news we bring to them.And people from all audiences gamble and many beginners want to know more about cryptos and safety and privacy. Who sees an oportunity to work together with me?I can place my website here or by PM. Advice me if it is responsible to post my website in this topic.There are some more topics where I explain myself here. One here:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5457440.msg62455218#msg62455218",

      "body": "well, when a person intends to expose their services or an investment opportunity or want a partnership, that person shows their product so that people can see what it is about and if they are interested or not in the product they are seeing, now you have come to the forum , wrote a lot but didn't post evidence, you didn't post your website link, you didn't post a picture of your website, you didn't post data liks that show your website traffic. so it will be very difficult to get attention that way. if you don't post any of this and wait for people to send you PM to show this dataso you're making a big mistake, it's not the people who are anxious about closing the deal, you're the distressed one who wants to close the deal early, so you need to post all data in the thread and then wait if you can attract a lot of attention or not and if you need opinions so that people are better at something people will tell you in this thread, in my opinion this is the best way to proceed, hope you will think about it.",

I briefly had Google Ads on this site, but I want nothing to do with Google. I'm looking for BTC-related companies, such as casinos, crypto trading platforms, or anything that fits the website.Posting your website will give us an idea of what kind of websites you have there and check the popularity of your website maybe we can recommend your website to potential partners, and we can add suggestion on what to add to your website.QuoteIt's a website targeting a more traditional audience.

I think this audience has value for many of you.And people from all audiences gamble. Who sees an oportunity to work together with me?You have to be specific about what kind of partnership is this, are you going to advertise on these platforms that you're looking for or they are the ones to advertise on your website or you are going to link back or promote each other you have to add value to what you're offering, if its better to include the stats of your website to make it appealing to your potential partner.",

The best way for you to attract potential interest is by elaborating on demographic and traffic analytics and starting off a fixed cost per click/cost per thousand views. You can check the going rate on affiliate networks. Speaking of which, if you can't find direct partnerships you can always check out crypto affiliate networks like coinzilla, who work similarly to AdWords for publishers.",

You already have 1 merit so that's stopping you from ranking up to Jr member (which will enable you psot image properly) right now is your activity and if you're not patient enough to wait for the next two activity circles to come then you can proceed to buying a copper membership[1] which gives you similar features as a member rank.
