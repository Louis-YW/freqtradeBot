  "content": "The value of a cryptocurrency, in theory, should also be related to its practical utility. In my opinion, a cryptocurrency that is worth \"a lot\" should also be used \"a lot\".I therefore find it interesting to be able to analyze how many cryptocurrencies are moved every day within the various blockchains and understand if the data is increasing or decreasing.Unfortunately, on the various crypto analysis sites, when talking about volumes, those declared by the exchanges are always used. I find this thing truly absurd, I think that the correct analysis should instead concern the volumes actually present within the various public blockchains. It is those volumes that determine how much the blockchain has an actual reason to exist. The billions of cryptocurrencies moved on Binance do not give value to the relative blockchains but remain within Binance and at most give value to the exchange and its token.As for Bitcoin, I only found these two sites that analyze how many Bitcoins are actually moved within the blockchain:https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/estimated-transaction-volumehttps://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd (in dollars)https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-sentinusd.html (only in dollars)How come if the blockchain is the same, the graphs on blockchain.com and bitinfocharts are so different? Why is this type of analysis not taken into consideration by the various analysis sites or is it relegated to the background compared to, for example, the useless graph of the number of transactions per block?Are there other sites that analyze the amount of cryptocurrencies moved over time within the various blockchains?",

      "body": "Your analysis as it is on the OP looks at used case from a side view. A view that is dependent only on the parent blockchain like we have it in Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain.However, swaps on exchangers is also a used case as, a coin could be swapped for another and that in itself is a used case. Using one coin to purchase another as a commodity of equal value.It is in itself that expressive even within an exchanger. Should we have the blockchains used that much, you wouldn’t find the fees really easy to coupe with due to the priority given to fees per transaction.That’s why, hodling as an activity is one that not only helps investors to accumulate but also, is a plus to blockchain utility.",

The coins been swapped for another is done using the coins held by Binance and as such, there isn’t a need to utilize the blockchain to authenticate this transaction.Mind you, there is always a transaction ID for this transaction and it exists within Binance without the rest of the world being a part of it except, you need it for some third party verification with Binance which is possible. Don’t mind my extensive use of Binance here, it’s just using one to exemplify for the lots of exchanges out there.It’s why, you pay a relatively low fee for this transactions and it could be done without using an address, just choosing the desired coins and some exchanges  could be done between parties by just usernames.Why you should trust them?The singular fact that you deemed them worthy of having a deposit from you regardless of the amount and should you be able to withdraw that back when need be.",

      "body": "Then you're going to have a hard time doing so.The transaction volume that you're looking at depends on how each blockchain counts their transaction volume. Naively, you would assume the following:Most transactions have two outputs, the transaction volume can be defined by the total amount of Bitcoins that are being sent to the two addresses in the output. However, this number is naturally bigger on cryptos that are more valuable because most people would move a large proportion of their holdings for each transactions; one to the actual payment address, and the other is to their change address. There is no good way to discern either.Next, certain blockchains runs on Layer 2, where the settlement happens on Layer 1. Your methodology will only work if all of the transactions are happening on Layer 1 as it would mean that each of the transactions are settled on the blockchain. I agree with your point that exchange volumes are not representative of the actual utility, because of the way that cryptos that are more attractive to traders will always have a higher volume and that is not a good indication of its true utility. The only somewhat good methodology would probably involve blockchain analysis to string together individual identities to identify the number of active users. With how Bitcoin works, any estimate that you're getting would probably be wrong.If you were to continue with measuring the volume of cryptos being transferred, I suggest using a single point of data. A good example would be: https://blockchair.com/compare. Reason being that each website has different methodology of measuring it; some only measures a subset of transactions, different timeperiods or different value of crypto.",

There are many micro exchanges and P2P services and they account for some amount of bitcoin movement. There are also lots of sweep transactions and transfers from wallet A to B both owned by the same user. You cannot draw a line between when a digital currency is used for trade or as a utility currency.- Jay -",

      "body": "It's pretty interesting that while all Bitcoin on-chain transactions are public, estimating real transaction volume is a challenge. In any case, that doesn't amount to usage. For example, someone might send BTC to a certain address just to sell it (because of getting fiat in exchange). At the same time, someone else might have some BTC on a centralized sports betting website/Bitcoin casino and use BTC actively for betting/gambling, but those transactions happen inside the system and aren't on Blockchain.So even knowing the exact on-chain daily volume wouldn't be a fair indicator of usage of Bitcoin, in my opinion.",

Because the total number of transactions goes out and coming in a day is much and it is not decreasing instead it increases daily and transactions are vary in every day. Some might be increasing while others might be decreasing. You can only know the transactions that are taking place at the Blockchain at the time of your transaction. Knowing the total blocks before yours. Even though Bitcoin transactions are public it is not easy to track all the transactions in the day and I don't think anyone can has that patient to do that analysis.",

If they're moving that amount of BTC, then it is likely an organization or an exchange facilitating on-chain deposit or withdrawals. I don't think it would be representative of the actual utility if that is what you're looking for.Quote from: bitcoiner180 on August 16, 2024, 08:21:32 AMI agree that the volume of Bitcoin moved in the blockchain does not exactly represent the number of coins really traded, but I think that the data is still more representative than the volume of bitcoin traded in an exchange that can be falsified or the result of operations made by people who have no real interest in the blockchain.It is not a good metric by any means because you cannot ascertain the distinct entities on the blockchain. There can be 5 people controlling thousands of addresses and Bitcoins and just moving them around on a daily basis and it would skew your data quite a bit. I don't think this a good direction for you to go to.Quote from: bitcoiner180 on August 16, 2024, 08:21:32 AMI am surprised that the volume of bitcoins moved, which is a public and objective figure, is much more difficult to find on the internet (just blockchain.com and bitinfochart, but they rappresents two different data) than that declared by the various exchanges, which is instead a self-declared and approximate figure (you need to ask to all exchanges on earth... and moon and trust them).As I've mentioned, their methodology could be different. They could be counting the volume of Bitcoins transferred by excluding funds that could possibly be sent to change addresses, calculating in different timezones, different valuation, etc. If you want an objective comparison, then you should rely on a single website and/or code it out yourself. If you're willing to, then it actually shouldn't be difficult.",
