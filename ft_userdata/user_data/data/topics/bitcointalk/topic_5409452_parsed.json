So you say you're identity was stolen?  I wonder how that could have happened.  I mean it's not like you're sharing your personal documents with random anonymous strangers on the internet or anything.  If those that you offer are actually yours to begin with.  Also, this is not a charity board, it's a lending board.  None of your documents can be validated by any of the lenders here, so no one will accept them in lieu of collateral.  Most lenders will require an altcoin as collateral, and will request at least 120% of the amount you want to borrow.Since you're broke, I'm guessing you have no collateral, so you're very unlikely to get a loan here.  Try the bank that allowed the thief to rob you, like normal people who have their identities stolen.  Only a scammer would show up on an anonymous forum asking for $5000 with an unbelievably stupid story such as yours.",
