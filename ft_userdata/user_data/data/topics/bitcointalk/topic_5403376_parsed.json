If you don't, it's the same as having a Facebook account. All of Meta's products have the same privacy policy, which can be described shortly as:We store your data, whether you have an account or not.We sell your pictures, videos, texts, identity ultimately to advertisers.We can read your private messages.We know, and sell, your browsing history.We store deleted content.Quote from: The Pharmacist on June 20, 2022, 05:51:10 PMI don't know how anyone could upload personal stuff to that site, but millions of people do, and it's baffling to me.Personal stuff such as stories, selfies and videos? Indeed. But, stuff like private messages (which aren't private, lol) are needed, to contact your friends, co-workers, employers etc. I don't say there aren't alternatives, but since that's what most people use, you're, essentially, forced to have it too.",

Europe has attempted joint development projects, between multiple EU nations, like the eurofighter which fell short of success. Non US nations appear to lack the technical capability, resources and investment capital to deploy large scale social media. Which is one major bottleneck preventing it from becoming a reality. European and asian nations are also subject to super injunctions (court enforced gag orders) and greater regulation of freedom of speech in contrast to the USA.The harsh truth may be even if social media servers were housed in international waters, outside the jurisdiction of major countries. They still would not escape regulation and laws imposed by major nations. If the servers were located on mars or the moon, outside the reach of regulation. Maybe freedom of speech would have a chance. The way things are now, thepiratebay and others have long tried to escape that net without success.",

There are Facebook and Twitter analogues all over the world, like for example Russian Vkontakte, which is very popular in Russia and many of its neighbours, much more than Facebook. They can't become global because of the network effect - there's already global social networks and no room for two.And if you think that the grass is greener on the other side, then think again - China and Russia do so much surveillance that the US is a bastion of privacy, compared to them.The actual alternative to social networks owned by companies are decentralized social networks that run on open-source software.",

So censorship to a certain extent is also needed. If there's no censorship, the powerful political groups will use social media to push their agendas. That's not desirable.",
