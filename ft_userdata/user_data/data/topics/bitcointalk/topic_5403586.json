  "content": "I know there are two account modes in trading on exchanges, the USD-M and the Coin-M. In future trading, if you want to trade some altcoins, you will need to use either USD-M or Coin-M. Example is the use of a stablecoin like USDT for it (USD-M) on many exchanges, but USDT is a stable coin that can be good for bear market, not bull market, unlike the use of unstable coin for it (Coin-M).If I use the Coin-M, it means you are using a particular coins to trade for its derivative coin in future trading, example is the use of bitcoin to trade for bitcoin to earn more or to lose your bitcoin, or the use of a specific altcoin to earn more or lose the altcoin you have.This time, I will like all my holdings for trading to be on only bitcoin while I want to trade some altcoins daily. Which means I need multi asset mode. Binance support that successfully, but I recently use OKX too, but on OKX , you need $50000 to activate the multi asset mode unlike Binance that you can just activate it without even having any trading funds on it. Aside Binance, is there any other exchange you can activate the multi asset mode without having any trading funds on the exchange, or with just having less than $500 as trading funds? I will prefer no KYC exchange. The holding I am talking about is the coins/funds that I am using for trading, excess are transferred to a noncustododial wallet which I have control over. Do not hold on exchanges.",

You are right, on Binance, it is called multi asset mode, when I checked OKX, it was on the trading setting and it is called multi currency margin, is it not referring to coins? Maybe I guessed it wrong. I was unable to enable it, that made me not to know what it is as it requires someone to have $50000 in his OKX account which I do not have.",

I think it's referring to a future contract that includes coins and USD. I'm not so familiar with this multi-currency margin it is new to me compared to the Binance multi-asset mode. Maybe this link below might help to give you some idea about the multi-currency margin mode on OKX. - Multi-Currency Margin ModeAbout the required $50k I think it's a future contract price.",
