      "body": "I think itâ€™s perfectly normal to have reservations about things not returning back to normal. There are definitely no guarantees with crypto but at the end of the day I find it highly unlikely the technology is going anywhere for the foreseeable future. The utility of the blockchain has been expanding exponentially over the last few years and investments globally are increasing. Overall adoption is up as well so I donâ€™t there is much to be concerned about. Obviously, thatâ€™s just my opinion but I think BTC is a fairly safe bet of getting back to at least 60k by 2023.",
