Powerful people are making independent small creators silent with this fear. A better approach in this case will be if Logan Paul tried to contact the responsible person himself and settle everything with communication like matured adults. We do not always need courts to settle disputes for us.",

Personally, I’m shocked he was able to raise a penny after the disaster that was DinkDoink. Anyone familiar with Logan in the crypto space after that should have known to avoid his products. He’s clearly chasing easy money.",

      "body": "Another libel / defamation suit? As if the world hadn't had enough of that with the Johnny Depp and Amber Heard scandal.The last few years could have been terrible for Paul financially. Not only does cryptozoo not appear to be doing well.Logan Paul also claims that Floyd Mayweather Jr and Mayweather Productions still haven't paid him for their exhibition boxing match in 2021. I don't think that this defamation suit will go to court. I think Paul is only trying to clear his name and set the record straight. He doesn't want his reputation damaged.",

I bet in the end he'll have an exit scam hack to bring it all down and into his pocket.",

He’s clearly chasing easy money. I agree but it kind of still is surprising how little seems to be happening when people lie in order to raise money. Isn't that a classic example for fraud and should be punished according to US law? He was clearly lying at several points and when things went South he should have been obliged to be transparent about it towards the investors. At least he should have warned newly incoming investors that the story he spread over several months isn't true anymore. He clearly misled people and obviously the various social media channels were abused to keep people in the line and make them believe in the project (and even make them buy more even when it was known that shit already hit the fan). I wonder how many of these scam artists seem to get away with it despite the public spotlight being put onto them.",

      "body": "Actually a natural outcome, a class action lawsuit was filed against Logan Paul for his role in the scandalous CryptoZoo scam. Despite the fact that earlier Paul offered the deceived investors a compensation plan for $ 1.5 million Also on the list of defendants are other well-known influencers such as Jeff Levin, Jake Greenbaum (known as Crypto King), Eddie Ibanez. It remains to be hoped that they will get what they deserve and it will also serve as a lesson for others to be more careful when promoting dubious projects.Source:  https://cointelegraph.com/news/logan-paul-and-cryptozoo-sued-in-class-action-lawsuithttps://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1205016/gov.uscourts.txwd.1205016.1.0.pdf",

Yes, you're right, even for less, youtube blocks accounts, but google is in no hurry to apply sanctions to those who bring it profit, I think after the court decision, which of course may be delayed. google will still take the right side.",
