You are just seeing activity / merit / posts. So if instead of just posting 1 malware link and getting banned for it, the person who compromised that account could go back through the older posts and change / add links to malware or whatever. Yes the reported posts are removed, but what about the ones made a while ago. Yes, it's a forum we are not you mom, people should know better then to just blindly click on links. But, still if you see an old post that is still up from a long term member you are more likely to click on it.Just a thought.-Dave",

This is an important feature to me, as I want to know whether a person is banned or not while I'm browsing through posts and participating in a discussion. It can be as simple as a red flag that displays next to their name, or it could be something more subtle. I see no such thing here. Sure, we have a BPIP extension, but it is not a standard part of the forum and I do not know how many people know about it. I think it should be a standard part of the profile information, similar to how banned users have BANNED next to their names when using the BPIP extension.",

I believe >90% of ban cases is because of plagiarism, and that is why forum admin does not bother to tell the exact reason.Quote from: DaveF on November 06, 2022, 12:25:06 PMYes, it's a forum we are not you mom, people should know better then to just blindly click on links. But, still if you see an old post that is still up from a long term member you are more likely to click on it.If i understood you well, you feel that the reason why a member was banned can save other members, e.g if the member was banned for posting links to malware, a \"this user was banned for posting malware\" banner in the member's profile can save people from clicking on their links. It is not a bad idea if you look at it objectively, but after some months here i understood that the forum wants member's to look out for themselves for scam, malware, phishing, etc, the forum wants member's to identify & learn about them and know how to avoid them, the network is a 'do it yourself one', so people are directly or indirectly taught how to do things themselves, because in their bitcoin journey they'll be exposed to other bitcoin sites, wallets, social media (Telegram, Discord, etc) other than BTCitcointalk, and they'll have to protect themselves there too.",

In particular about the ban taken due to ban evasion and reported plagiarism, moderator may easily reference the link to the reported finding to banned users. That will help users know what the reason for the ban is and may make it easier for them to create an appeal thread. This would be a great proposal, but I haven't found the link anyway.",

That shouldn’t be much of an overhead in time, and it seems like a reasonable thing to do with regards to the banned account.As to displaying the motive for others to view, I wouldn’t place it in a location that distracts the reader of a given thread, but rather, somewhere on the user’s profile. As stated by some, a mark or such to indicate that a profile has been banned would be welcome somewhere more visible though.",
