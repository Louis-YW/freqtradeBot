Are you trying to buy at spot price?I would pay over spot but not as much as ampex or jm want.If I buy from them they want sales tax and 3 or 4 bucks over spot.While I want maybe ten 5 oz bars. say a buffalo or a silvertown they want too much between 7% sales tax and 3 or 4 over spot.here is jm pricehttps://www.jmbullion.com/5-oz-sunshine-silver-bar/they want 137.66 a bar if I buy 5 bars it costsa lot more than spot close to 700 for 25 oz. spot is 21 so 525 would be sposurely there is room between 525 and 700 for 5 bars of 5 oz silveror maybe 2-3 bars of 10 oz silver.",

      "body": "Yeah it ridiculous. Jm charging 5-6 per oz over spot on their bars. Ive noticed their rounds are a little better $4 over spot. The silver store down the street from me is charging 3 over spot. I say the days of 1-2 are over for now. I asked them and they said its a supply issue. Until the con artists who control precious metals lose control of the price. Then the true price of gold and silver can emerge. Im guessing the true price is much much higher. Good luck in your search. If i see anything ill let u knowCheck their sales. Heres the cheapest on sale round at $3.99 over spot. Probably your best bethttps://www.jmbullion.com/1-oz-silvertowne-saint-gauden-silver-round/",

Probably your best bethttps://www.jmbullion.com/1-oz-silvertowne-saint-gauden-silver-round/What kills me is the sales tax and the 4-6 over spot combined.https://silvergoldbull.com/5-oz-silvertowne-buffalo-silver-barif I get these above and use PayPal I pay 123.35 which is almost 23 over spot about 4.60 an oz.then I have a 5% PayPal discount so 123.35 x.95 = 117.18 x 1.07 (sales tax) = $125.38 a bar.  which is very close to bucks over spotI buy a lot from them I may just get them as I like the 5oz buffalo bars. Just that I hat going that much over spot.ie 200 or 202 spot  is costing  over 250",
