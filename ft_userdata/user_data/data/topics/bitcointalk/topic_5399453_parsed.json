  "content": "Hello good people,I used to quite a bit in the early days of Bitcoin and there is a question that has been bothering me for a while.Do any of remember the first pool that allowed you to mine bitcoin and namecoin at the same time?I remember you were able to merge mine both coins during a certain period, but for the life of me I can't remember the process or the pool.This would be during the days GPU mining just started.If any of you remember this please let me know, it has been annoying me for a while.Cheers and I hope you all have a great end of your week.",
