The difference between a hot wallet and a cold wallet is that the hot wallets are those are connected always to the internet with all his keys prone to hack example is the trust wallet. While the cold wallet are those are stored offline and only comes online only for signing of a transaction example is the hardware.Just like the what little Mouse said the exchange uses both hot and cold wallets. The address generated for you on exchanges are hot and custodian wallet. While the exchange use cold storage to save those huge funds so as to keep it off from hack",

Is it possible for someone in this forum make me understand first what is hot & cold wallet and then how it function on an exchange.In terms of exchanges, a hot wallet is a wallet that is online and is used for storing small amounts of coins that are needed for day-to-day transactions, such as withdrawals and deposits. They are more vulnerable to hacking and exploit attempts, and therefore they are not recommended for storing large amounts. On the other hand, a cold wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that is not connected to the internet and is used for storing large amounts of coins that are not needed for immediate use. Cold wallets can also have additional protections, such as multisig, so that there are multiple keys needed to access the funds. A hardware wallet is a typical type of cold wallet that stores the user's private keys on a dedicated device, but there are other types as well.",

Many people think if the exchange is using cold wallet, then their coins will be safe. It's true cold wallet is safe and not connected with internet, but what if the exchange store the cold wallet private key in online and claimed if they got hacked, so the hacker have access to their cold wallet.",

After receiving sufficient confirmations, the database in the platform is updated to update your account balance with the deposited amount.Here ends the role of bitcoin or cryptocurrencies and everything that happens after that is centralized as your balance is managed in the database.When you withdraw, everything is verified, a transaction is created from the balance on the platform, and money is withdrawn, while reducing the amount withdrawn from the database.The previous process is hot storage, and any extra funds funds are transferred to cold storage to avoid being stolen, as the platform only needs the necessary funds to withdraw at that moment.An example of *wallet* that a small platform can use https://btcpayserver.org, larger platforms hire developers to write from scratch",

If these exchanges are so keen to use cold wallets why do they lose so much money when they are hacked.",
