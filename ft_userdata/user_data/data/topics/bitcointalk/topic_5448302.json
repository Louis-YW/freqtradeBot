There are 1000s of things to consider.It's not just get power and plug them in and mine.Even here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5446794 just by providing your own transformer you can save a ton on money but then you take responsibility for it. And then the locality can change their mind about if they want your type of business overnight.You seem to be trying to do this on the cheap, I can tell you that will not happen. To put a proper mine together takes a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of effort.Yes anyone can buy a few dozen miners get a few hundred amps of power and tons of cooling and go. But if you want more then that you are looking at serious investments. You need security, engineers, tech people to run the back end nodes and software and a ton of other things. It's not just plug and go. Even if you just rent warehouse space with a lot of power and cooling, how much are you going to pay your programmers / IT people. You have to make their pay more attractive then doing a crap job and you loosing blocks due to poor coding.-Dave",

It all failed and imploded but that was not the fault of foundry. (or the people I knew for that matter)-Dave",
