To show how you have a screenshot where some \"big numbers\" are written?The only reason I can think of is that he wanted to start creating a positive credit history for the @goku88 account. Probably after 2-3 \"repaid\" fake loans, there would be an attempt to take a real loan from someone without collateral, because \"saiyan people have word of a stone.\"   , but of course he would simply disappear with the borrowed money.He got a lesson and learned not to make stupid mistakes. He will for sure try again, so this is example why everyone should be wary of loans without collateral.",

Hilarious! It's a good tag to make it clear what it's all about. There are a lot of naive people out there, even on this forum, and the scammers rely on preying on a minority of the clueless or naive. The weapons we have are the red tags and it is convenient to use them in cases like this.",
