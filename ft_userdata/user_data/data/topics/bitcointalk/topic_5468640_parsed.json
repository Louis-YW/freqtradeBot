  "content": "When the situation of the country is too hard to comprehend, youths who are supposed to be the future leaders will start turning into criminals in front of us.This is the third case that have happened to someone very close to me ( not family ), and they all have one thing in common, SPOUSE ABUSE and CRIME. I knew this gentle soul growing up in my street, who just turned 24 years old and now he was into gambling without anyone knowing at home for the past 1 year, the only point that I hold unto from his mother is how he maltreated his junior brothers and sisters and he also have anger issues. I have come to understand that having a negative impact on people close to you or your family could be a sign of compulsive gambling, to the extent that this boy start maltreating his junior ones, I mean inflicting pains on them.The other two cases that I knew about gambling addict ( one in the family ) also have something similar to this behaviour, anger issues, criminal activities like burglary and disrespect of parents, I think countries with high rate of struggles and hardship will always have this type of problems.Is there any effective way to make sure youths stays where the are told to stay instead of looking for quick money? Gambling isn't the solution to poverty it will possibly drown you deep into more poverty.",

Having a bad mind or not having any sign of sympathy for your loved ones and family members up to the extent of maltreating them is inhuman, and that's not a problem caused by gambling; it's a personal disease that the person needs to work on himself in order to get those rides out of him. I know the disappointment that always comes when someone loses a game and the anger that will be attached to it because no one will feel happy about losing money, but that one alone does not warrant maltreating someone who has nothing to do with the game you lose. Most times, our relatives are supposed to be the ones whom we look up to, and we use their expressions to chear ourselves up instead of turning them to our punishment receiver. Even if the said person has been stopped from gambling and no longer has access to gambling, there is still no guarantee that they will stop that reckless behaviour; it's inbuilt in them, and they need to work on it. Even if they are chasing a different carrier, any small thing that will provoke their anger can still bring back that beast in them.",

The thing is, people always looks for whom to apportioned blame on because those who made didn't involved themselves in gambling or turning to gambling addicts in a way to influence their environment negatively.If youth are devoted in acquiring skills and learning hand works for those whose country aren't making any ways for should focused on self developer and employment, to cry loud I have also seen people doing pety business to help their lifes they made it through that business and today the employer of labour, they created employment opportunities for those who can't create any and by doing this, they have also help to build the country as well.",

Gambling isn't the solution to poverty it will possibly drown you deep into more poverty. In my opinion there are several ways that can be said to be quite important and quite effective to avoid this problem, I think environmental factors have a very important influence in this problem and also the role of parents cannot be forgotten, parents must really be able to limit whatever their children's activities are especially in the problem of the playing environment because obviously it can really bring negative or positive influences. And besides that, both parents must also be able to emphasize to their children that nothing is instant especially in terms of making money, and what is feared is that it is very possible that they will assume that gambling can be a solution place to make money. It is very clear that this is not a place for your poverty solution, instead of getting a win but the fact that happens instead you get worse in financial problems, it is very possible and many have experienced it. Well I understand that for teenagers they are still very young, and that is very dangerous because as we know their curiosity about something is very high, so if they know that there is a chance of winning in gambling then it is very likely that they will like this activity, even though the reality is the opposite. The bottom line in my opinion is because they are still unstable so it must be the parents who try to prevent, keep away from everything that can make them gamble, such as the environment or social media.",

      "body": "Sometimes such things happen because our greed shuts our senses and we really don't understand what we are doing. Such youths who fall into gambling addiction are the ones who want to earn a lot of money in short duration of time but they really don't understand much about economics and find gambling as a way to quickly get rich. Actually they don't understand gambling as well and think that gambling will allow them to multiply their money many times, but when they lose bets they get frustrated because of the losses and due to frustration their personality starts changing over time.Those people start to mistreat their loved ones because they got addicted for gambling and find gambling more interesting than their family and loved ones. Some people lose the bets and believe that they lose the bets due to the luck of the others who are close to them and that's another reason for such behavior. The best solution is to teach youth about the principles of economics and how money works. One should also teach them that earning money quickly is a type of scam that fake influencer install in our minds. Everyone has different struggles to reach financial freedom in their lives and if someone is born into a financially weak family then that person has to struggle a lot. The struggle can be in the form of learning of skills and making money by utilizing those skills or the struggle can be in the form of education and other qualifications that would allow them to get a proper job. Gambling is good for entertainment purpose but it is not something that could end up the bondage of poverty and if someone thinks that they could get rich quick by following the path of gambling then such person as to lose a lot things in his/her life.",

Gambling isn't the solution to poverty it will possibly drown you deep into more poverty. Best solution? Parental guidance simple as that, without the correct guidance of their parents then they will be exposed in not just gambling but any crimes that they can learn. Solution to poverty? Well maybe what I will say is easier that said, I think there 2 main factors to blame why people be in poverty, 1st government, 2nd the person itself, I will not elaborate more. So I agree gambling isn't the solution for poverty it is only a hobby for those fortunate that waste their money for fun and entertainment, for those who don't? Then it could be the start of their misery life.",

Gambling isn't the solution to poverty it will possibly drown you deep into more poverty. The only way a youth can be save from gambling addiction is when his mind becomes open to the reality of the world. Youth should focus on study and finding a decent job to have good future because most of the gambling addicted usually have family problem and doesn’t focus much on his career that’s why they choose the shortcut way on earning profit.I grew on an environment which gambling is very common. I was exposed on gambling as a child since my father and neighbors is always playing gambling with small money. I’m at the point of being entertained much on gambling as young child. My mother transfer me to my grandma living on the province so that I will get away on gambling and focus on my study. This really works because I finish my studies with good career. Since I already knew the reality of gambling, I never become addicted despite I’m always playing now because I experience worst as a child and improve myself while I understand what to priority in life.",

Otherwise, people will be push to enter get rich quick source of profits most likely with gambling. Thus, instead of working for daily survival, they put all their time and efforts into gambling and eventually develop addiction. That’s when things become uncontrollable for them, that they become prone to committing crimes due to consistent losses of their money.Youths are more susceptible to fall on this type of situation.

In order to prevent such things, it is necessary to prevent people who are minors from having the opportunity to gamble, which is much easier to do in physical casinos, while online casinos still cannot see who is on the other side, and even when they ask for KYC, a minor can use the documents of his family member or friend to verify the account.Unfortunately, the situation described by the OP is very serious and cannot be solved by itself, because such things only get worse if the person does not get adequate help. Gambling is supposed to be fun, and the moment it stops being, everyone has a problem which should not be ignored at all.",

Yes, dormitories are the best solution for today's young people, you know the internet, Android phones, laptops and so on have become habits and life among young people, Not to mention the addition of online games that are easy to access anywhere, of course the dormitory is the best choice for those pursuing education for the next generation of the nation and state.For this reason, currently in modern life there is no internet and technology that is separate from young people, so the dormitory does not allow students to play on Android phones, laptops operating in dormitories are supervised only for studying, not for gambling, they are educated to be the best generation in the future, without being touched by gambling, in my opinion that is the best step for the current generation to avoid gambling.I believe every country has schools and dormitories in their respective countries, from elementary schools to universities, especially countries where the majority are Muslims, such as: Masir, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and so on, In England, where the majority of the population is not Muslim, there are also more dormitories such as: Oswestry School, Langley School, Morton Hall Girls School, Bredon School and many others that cannot be mentioned one by one here.",

I don't know which country you referring and really the hardship of the country make the lazy youth sort to do things to survive and in most cases, those youths refused to go to school, they are school droppedouts and turn to criminals in their compounds. There is one case in my compound right now and finally he was arrested by police yesterday. Family/domestic violate is not a new thing and it has been on ground for years, abuse now is part of family DNA in many families. And one thing I will say is that the story you presented about the boy is nice but the boy decided to choose his destiny and not because of gambling. If the boy disrespect his parents and sort crime activities then it was not gamble that made to be like that but I believe it was peer influence. Gambling can make someone to be a criminal and not to disrespect his parents. If he did that then it is not gambling again but another thing. People go into crime because of their losses and they want to recover what they have lost and since no money to gamble to recover the lost they have to look for a way to get cash and that caused the stealing of people's phone, laptop and later increase to arm robbery. There are sometimes the disrespect attitude was born with the person so probably he was just like that from beginning not gambling. When a gamble maltreat his family members and friends outside then it is transgression of anger. It is because of the lost in the bets, and other casinos games made him to behave in that manner. And not necessarily it is because he is an addict. An addict can still do well in his family if he is winning games. Frustration make people to misbehave they way they do. At that stage what they think is different from the normal way of thinking. They are always angry because of the losses.",
