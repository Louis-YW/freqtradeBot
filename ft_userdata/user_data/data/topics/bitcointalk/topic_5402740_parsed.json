Best practices to protect myself?List one card at a time.Try to keep it at under 700 most cards are under that price.Insure it ask for signature.Realize you will get returns yeah it sucks but they can simply break the fan blade and get a return.So offer returns.  Or consider seeing if you can sell to trusted people here.There is a marketplace.and there are escrows.I escrow. Escrow is decent as the buyer gets a day or maybe 2 to test but cant claw back later.and escrow fees are lower than ebay by far.what are you selling and what do you think it is worth.",

However with a market like we have right now I don’t think many buyers will be miners but gamers instead.I prefer selling to gamers because they usually don’t create headaches. For miners who are buying they might make a claim or switch the GPU out with their own defective unit and say it was broken. You can try the photo of serial but I think eBay will side with buyer anyways.",

Exactly.Do not lose time with Ebay compared to the section of Hardware that we have here in the forum.Good old trusted members of the forum will offer escrow and most transactions with escrows ends smoothly here if not all while you will find always problems in Ebay if you happen to sell the card to an irresponsible person and no matter what Ebay will side with the buyer,I have tested this on my own,I tried to sell physical goods there and most of the transactions went well but the few with problems were always resolved to the buyer side no matter I had not done anything wrong.",

Best practices to protect myself?Ebay has very low prices and high competition. It's too late to sell video cards now. Better mine ethereum while you can and don't sell below $4,000. Or try to sell in your country, because it might be more profitable.",

Best practices to protect myself?I stopped selling equipment on eBay because they don't care at all about their sellers.  They will allow returns for any made up reason weeks after the item has been received.  This is bad because basically all newbies hop on eBay, buy mining equipment thinking they'll get rich overnight, then after a week of mining they see they made like $10 and ask for a return.  I've heard eBay has gotten better about this lately, but I won't test that theory.I've found Amazon to be far superior when it comes to selling hardware.  They will at least allow you to charge a % restocking fee, so the buyer has to decide if they want to stick with their purchase or take an immediate loss.  So I'd advise you to take a look at Amazon over eBay if you're wanting to sell for fiat.",

      "body": "The issue with the hardware section on bitcointalk is that unless you sell very cheap, nobody is going to buy those GPUs right now since the profitability is low. Selling there during a bull market is a great place. Not during a bear market.With Craigslist and Kijiji and Facebook marketplace is that it’s good because you get top dollar however it’s a lot of labor work. Especially answering messages, arranging time to meet, most will buy 1 or 2 GPUs max.If you got like 100+ GPUs to sell, eBay would be the least labor method out there. Just need to print a label and ship it off. However there is the trade off with these returns.",

I've sold a few items on Craigslist and now Facebook Marketplace. Bought a RTX3090 Ultra FTW3 on Facebook from someone locally. Card was barely used because the seller went with a different water cooled 3090. He sold it for me for $50 below retail. Card has worked great since the day I first used it in late 2020.",
