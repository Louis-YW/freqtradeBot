They want deposit for account verification for withdrawing Where did you get such a site? It's like someone trying to learn how to create a website, there's no indication that it's an exchange, I thought it was a news site.They claim that they have about 369286.15 BTC (24 hour volume,) although the date of creation of the site did not exceed a few months.QuoteExpires On2023-11-20Registered On2022-11-20Updated On0001-01-01It's a scam, don't fall for such a cheap scam.",

They want deposit for account verification for withdrawing Any suggestion pls ? I am not familiar with \"crypto-exch.com\", so I cannot speak to its legitimacy. In general, if a site is asking for a deposit for account verification before you can withdraw your funds, it is a big red flag. And in this case, it is probably a scam. Real exchanges do not operate this way, so proceed with caution.",

In order to engage in any trades via the Services, you must create a Crypt-exch Account and provide any requested information.

Why not register there? I do not know what leads you to sign up for such exchanges?",
