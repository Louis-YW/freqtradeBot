  "content": "I don't know if many will be happy with this news because it's another centralized company that's stepping to the market. I remember the CEO of this company, Jamie Dimon, that has said too many negative things about bitcoin IIRC, that was around on 2018. And then afterwards, he changed his heart and said good things about it and it tends out that he's been investing already to the crypto market. Here are some short details about what this Morgan wallet and the said trademark is all about. And read more from the sources attached to this post.Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/jpm-crypto-wallet-6831467KEY TAKEAWAYSAmerica’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Either way, this is a terrible step towards decentralization. Adding to that, these entities use BTC to channel what they really want - more money so that they can fund other companies / businesses - they don't have any aim to develop/sustain the organic growth of BTC or any other cryptocurrency because they go against what they fear - not having control.

Whenever I question why, they just tell me it's easier that way (  ). I'm always available to guide them to better options, but it seems that they are waiting for something to happen to their funds so that they finally wake up...[1]https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=90071872&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch[2]https://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn90071872&docId=APP20200728090857#docIndex=25&page=1[3]https://help.revolut.com/help/wealth/cryptocurrencies/getting-cryptocurrency-exposure/sending-cryptocurrency",

Or maybe not yet.And then, instead of giving their money to a random Ponzi, a reputable bank could be the better choice.We do have to keep telling that IOUs are not the real thing, I don't deny that, but this is for those who don't want to read deeper.

It's like the users are only playing with numbers but in reality, they don't hold anything but only see the projections on how much they own inside the platform. They got no keys but only usernames and passwords plus the numbers that they believe they really own it but unable to withdraw. On this case with JP Morgan, that \"trademark\" that's being hyped by the media is likely what they're capitalizing for them to have more users trust them with their crypto.",
