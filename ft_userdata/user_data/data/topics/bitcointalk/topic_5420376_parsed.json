The best thing for us is to just ride it out in the next twelve months.I know it's long and hard and deliberate, but that's how we are going to survived this bear market.",

      "body": "This is the most notable information in the last 2 months of the year, the Fed will rely on this month's CPI to consider whether to raise or lower interest rates and it will decide the trend of the market. But for better or worse, I don't think it matters anymore as we've probably experienced bigger crashes like this since the start of the year so there's no reason for us to worry about CPI this time around. Just looking ahead, no matter how bad things are today, it will all be over soon and recovery will also begin.As for Sol, I think the news only affects solana holders and has nothing to do with bitcoin, it's just shitcoin out of thousands of shitcoins on the market.",
