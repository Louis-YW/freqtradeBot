I agree with your statement about Tron's being fast and cheap with its scalable infrastructure. But why aren't many projects coming from that blockchain? Tron was supposed to lead the gaming industry but that didn't happen. Justin suns approach to manipulating the market by using his own token as collateral and mint stable coin in the tron blockchain gives him bad images. His stablecoin projects are not very transparent about their proof of reserve and i am not sure how he is managing SEC but i think there will be lawsuits against him in the future.",

You only have to pay 1TRX as fee for transferring $1000 worth of Tron. Since the price of Tron is so low it makes it the cheapest transaction free regardless of any cryptocurrency in the market.

Tron is cool, it has the same feature but when it comes to popularity XRP did great by winning partially the case of SEC against them. There's a chance investors of XRP will be back and the demand will climb one more time just like it did before because of all the news that was created while they were fighting against the SEC, it's not easy to be on the front page and end up being a piece of good news. And the other thing is, they gained more reputation because they could just surrender it but they didn't which means they are serious about their work. Just like Bitcoin who have Ethereum in competition as assets. I think Tron will be competing with XRP when it comes to payment options.",

Share your thoughts and insights below!TRON is great. But don't expect it to be used massively anytime soon. The project lacks originality and strong marketing/promotion efforts. Developers are much more interested in building dApps + tokens on other chains than TRON itself. With founder Justin Sun facing controversy within the crypto industry (he's a shady person, after all), I'd consider moving to alternative chains such as BSC or SOL. It won't be long enough before TRON becomes another \"Dogecoin\". A \"meme\" coin driven by hype/speculation than anything else. Mainstream adoption is important for a project to withstand the test of time. And that's something TRON doesn't have despite being used by some for stablecoin transactions (mainly USDT). Crypto land often behaves in many strange and bizarre ways, so expect the unexpected. Just my thoughts",
