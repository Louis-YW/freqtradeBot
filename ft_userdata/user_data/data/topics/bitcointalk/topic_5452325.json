  "content": "100 posts I've made so far that look mediocre compared to 100 posts made by other users who are probably of a higher quality.100 posts visible on profile. Actually, I have made 104 scraped posts, but 4 posts have a value that is far from standard and may not be feasible so it should be removed by a moderator.Through this post, I want to say that there is still a lot that is lacking that I have to fix so that entering 200 to 1,000 posts and so on can be of higher quality like other users' posts.Maybe it deserves the Member rank for me at this time because there are many shortcomings that I need to improve and I am very excited to continue to improve quality so that I can be at a more appropriate rank.From the ranking system, the number of posts and activities that I currently have have not been able to rank up. I am very aware of this system.But there are some users with quality posts that are not much different from my quality, but they are already ranked above me. I asked what they did to make it so easy for them to get it.There have been several user posts on this forum that I found asking if it's possible to send merits to yourself?Actually the question really represents how I feel but don't want to look like someone trying to fish.Regarding merit, I don't want to ask excessively which leads to begging.But is it possible if I ask to review my post history. Does it look too much or too bad?But I feel that being able to get merit is very difficult even though there are several threads made for users who want to get merit with terms and conditions that must be obeyed.",

Also the board you are posting play an important factor on getting merits. Most of merit source hang out on Bitcoin technical discussion or Bitcoin diccusion alone but you need to have a deep learning on how Bitcoin technical aspect in able to join them.Local is the number one place if you want to start on getting merits since you can easily expressed your thoughts and know what the user preferences since that's your local hangout. You can also use a merit thread like this [Merit] Share your best posts/threads with Fillippone to be merit assessed by @fillippone or a merit thread on your local board. There's a lot of active users here that same like you which is eager to earn merits for rank up and possible campaign opportunity. Giving your best effort is must and don’t look on the number of post you made. It's about quality and establishing good/ healthy communication with others that moght potentially gave you a merit.",

If you don't get merit, this mean you need to learn or improve something, nothing less nothing more.Some people might say the section you posted could be the reason, but for me isn't.

You are on a forum, and earning merit also means that you will in turn send your merits to other people. But I don't see any movement in you, although, of course, your balance is not great.Since a person behaves in relation to other posters, namely, he keeps his merits for some significant post, you can think the same about other people. Until you see people to whom you are ready to give your merits, the movement of merits that the administrator meant will not occur.Look at things more simply, do not demand much from people, and do not value yourself above others, and people will be drawn to you.",

I asked what they did to make it so easy for them to get it.Your current activity is 100 posts which is not enough for the next rank even if you reach the merit requirement, but it is a good achievement if you calculate the ratio between the number of posts and the amount of merits you have earned. This means that every 10 posts you publish have the potential to earn around 1.3 merit points (cmiiw).I don't know who you are talking about, but first try to take a closer look at the number of posts of the user you are referring to and then calculate the ratio.",

There can be different reasons: may be the post gave some important information, may be it showed the depth of analyzing something, may be it was fun or anything else. You never know. And while you try to get merits instead of just communicating it will frustrate you and you'll even probably get less merits. Chat at your pleasure and don't pay too much attention to merits and you'll get all you need with time. It is not a race, you will get your rank even if you will not get it first. Just talk about what is interesting to you, share information you get, ask questions you find interesting, and you'll get both pleasure from communicating with others and rank up on forum.",

I asked what they did to make it so easy for them to get it.Don't compare yourself to other users because I think every user will have a different forum experience. The quality of your posts is judged by other users and may never be the same as you think. I can say that I have a quality post, but still other users may judge it differently. You only need to make posts as unique as possible and of course with the best quality, then let other people judge your posts based on merit. Having someone randomly review the quality of your posts is probably undesirable as some people will think you're begging, while others won't. Let merit flow as naturally as possible for you and never compare yourself to others.Quote from: BTCGalaxyA12 on May 11, 2023, 06:13:24 AMRegarding merit, I don't want to ask excessively which leads to begging.But is it possible if I ask to review my post history.

I asked what they did to make it so easy for them to get it. You may see some newbie accounts got plenty of merits with low post count. Well, even though their rank is newbies. They might not be a newbie. Did you get what I mean? Maybe they have been in this forum for a long time and know how to earn merit and where to post for merits. Multiple accounts in this forum are allowed unless you evade the ban rules. So, It's not always true what we see. Moreover, there are plenty of newbie accounts that are genius. I remember of n0nce and PowerGlove. You will be surprised if you see their merit ratio. Even though they ranked up already, they were newbies at some point, and look at their merits and post quality. They are genius at solving various issues. Powerglove was a newbie, and he was able to patch the forum. So, don't be disappointed. We are not the same. Some forum members like n0nce, PowerGlove, LoyceV and o_e_l_e_o are genius in coding and solving various issues. They have some skills, and they help others using their skills, leading them to earn a decent amount of merits. QuoteBut I feel that being able to get merit is very difficult even though there are several threads made for users who want to get merit with terms and conditions that must be obeyed. Some people might say No, it's not complicated. Well, As a newbie, Yes, it's challenging to earn merits. Earning 13 merits from the first 100 posts for an average Joe is not bad. Eventually, You will get familiar with the forum environment and understand where you must improve. Keep reading posts, and don't engage with threads where you do not have a genuine interest.",

For a long time I earned merits at a slower pace than my activity, and I think I remember that since LoyceV helped me to rank up to Sr Member was a kind of turning point where I started to earn more quickly until I reached almost twice as many merits as activity, but since I reached Legendary the speed has slowed down a bit.Don't worry too much about the result, the merits, and enjoy the process more, your activity on the forum, and the merits will come on their own.",

I asked what they did to make it so easy for them to get it.@OP, earning merit in this forum is not measured my how long a user have registered your account but it mostly depends on how active you are in the forum and how good quality your comments or topics are, for example, I try so hard some week to make sure I am on the first page of comments on topic I find interesting and some times I luckily get merit on the first page. When you are so active on the forum and known by the level of good comments you make, you luckily will be earning merit, even if not every day but at least two or three merit each week. Also sometimes, if you are not so active, you could miss out some topics were your reply is supposed to have earned you merit but before you even get to see the topic it might have gone down the board. I might be totally wrong be but if you stay so active on the forum, you will easily get to discover some thread were you can be earning merit and you may also have a favorite merit fan that can be giving you one or two merit when they come across your post.",

You don't have to kick yourself too hard about merit because basically if you care about quality then merit will find you, not the other way around.After all you have earned 13 merit so far since you started forum activity. This means that you are also a good poster so that some merit source or other users get your post. It's just that you need to be patient and keep working hard, but don't compare yourself with a number of other users.
