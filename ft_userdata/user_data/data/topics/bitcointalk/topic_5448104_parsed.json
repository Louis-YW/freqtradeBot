      "body": "The most important part of bitcoin evolution before even holding is the fact that it is a currency for payment of transactions. It is hard sometimes to want to hold on to something but we usually get stuck with natural/human disasters that we can just ignore. It is not bad that your holdings came to your rescue just when you needed it in fact it is the sole purpose of holding in the first place, not just to make profit but to save it for future use without it losing value. Theirs is still a long way to go before the halving and the anticipated bull run so you can still save some before then. When next you are holding them bitcoins make sure to now split some of your savings into fiat currency so you donâ€™t run to bitcoin every time you need some funds",

As you said above Bitcoin bull run might happen on the next year, no one will lend their money for a year since it's too long.I don't think the @OP should regret to convert his Bitcoin to fiat for his family needs, family needs is more important than money. It seems like you're don't want to spend any money you get, it's better for you to stop eating to save more money to invest more Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin is not just for storage; you can start over and buy it a little later.There is a good expression that says you cannot earn all the money. If your spending went on health, loved ones, or something else much more important than Bitcoin, then no one can tell you that you exchanged it in vain.Above all, no one here should teach you what you should and should not do. This is your life and your money, and you should only listen to yourself. And frankly, you should not report it here by creating a topic about it.",

You may need urgent cash for a Family emergency (Just like this). But, The need for money should depend on the level of emergency. If you sold it just because of a festival coming soon and you want to buy something. I wouldn't say it's an emergency. It seems you were holding your coin on Binance, which is not good if you planned to hold it for a long time. Why are you letting someone else control your coins? Hold your coins in a Non Custodial wallet. I didn't get what the trouble was selling your Bitcoin. Didn't you know where to sell? Did you hear of Binance from this forum? Because you said, you are grateful to this forum because you found a solution because of this forum. IDK what did you mean.",

It is not big matter if you sell it at profit price but it is matter if you have to forced sell it at loss.Well said. Surely the OP has a complicated financial situation, living paycheck to paycheck, and was hoping with $360 invested in bitcoin, he could significantly improve his financial situation. But without starting from a good base, it is difficult. Most likely the peak of the next cycle will be between $100K and $200K. How much would the OP have been able to hold without selling even if he had not been forced as he is now? If $360 is important to him, in beating the ATH, above $70-80K, he would have $1K? Would he hold on, knowing that the price might drop drastically? That's what happens to many, in the end, they are forced to sell on the spur of the moment. To avoid this, you have to start from a good base, but I understand that for some people it is difficult.",
