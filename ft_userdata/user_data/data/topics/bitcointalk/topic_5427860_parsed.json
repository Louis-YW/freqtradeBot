Are you asking that could someone build stable coin and app for you? What app? Stablecoin is not a normal token anyone can just pull off because they can make a token or a coin. That requires some next level resources.And why would anyone build you anything for free? Especially when you are not even explaining what you need.",

Obviously it will have to be tested to make sure that everything is working as design. Also if you find a freelancer, just be careful about those newbies, not saying that they are scammer, but don't pay first or at least put the money in an escrow to be safe on both of you.",

Try to explain more the concept of your ideas so the concept is clearly addressed, in addition, you might be able to get a somewhat some market research through the discussion in this thread. Otherwise, if your thoughts are that a simple one coin and one app are enough to build the next-gen cryptocurrency platform, you are on the wrong board. If you want to pay the development fees via bitcoin, post a thread on Services board, if it is an altcoin, go to Marketplace (altcoins) board.",

Just my cents.He thinks that it's an easy task to make his own stable coin and then he'll just withdraw real money from it. If this is done before, I think he might give it a true shot to it and there's a chance that he'll successful when the market wasn't yet too regulated at all.The government won't think anything on him and his project even it will be named after a fiat or his local currency. But today, it's just too different to look at because the government's eyes are over it.",

This income must come from somewhere. How are you going to earn money with this app?These ideas seem too simplistic at this point we are in cryptocurrency, where there are many exchanges and staking platforms accepting hundreds of different cryptocurrencies, besides the fact there isn't a clear indicative on how it's going to be profitable for you, as the app operator.",

People who staking that coin will get the reward and OP will heavily advertize that coin. The problem is that kind of staking is already lot there. Just like Defi, which booming on 2021 but now it's almost dead. Hoping that coin could stable also very very hard, as the reward from staking, people will dump or sell it on market, so in the long run, that coin price will keep low and lower.",

For example, eth is a coin, and mana and sandbox are tokensThe token is easy to create even a kid can create it. You don't need to learn solidity language for this you can take source codes from the internet. While creating a blockchain is difficult and you need to hire a dev who can do this for you.Second, building a mobile application costs between $25,000to $40,000 ( according to some sites) and you think after spending so much money someone will hand over to you his project for marketing?
