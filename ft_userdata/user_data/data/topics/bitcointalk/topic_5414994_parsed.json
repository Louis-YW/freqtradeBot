When we talk of projects associated with gambling, the tokens are used in the gambling site for gambling and it doesn't have any more usage.

One of the longest-running crypto casinos out there is Primedice which has been trusted by many gamblers out here. Primedice offers a quite simple casino game which is a dice game but if you are interested in other gambling games such as slots, sports betting, and other casino games then I suggest you visit Stake which is created by the same makers of Primedice. Also, other than Primedice, Freebitco.in, JustDice, and other casinos that you can find here at the Gambling board has been running for a long time and is still active up until today.",

Also what are the things that kills such project because even one or two survived for long I don't see many alive till now, they fail easily or turn scam later. It's a bit of a bizarre question to ask in a forum that is packed full of threads about different gambling companies that have existed for many years already. Are you looking for smaller scale projects that maybe revolve around one game? The thing is, these companies have to grow big and fast or they might get stamped out by all sorts of effects. These days if you want to successfully launch a new crypto casino or sportbook you really need to have deep pockets because there are a lot of factors conspiring to put you out of business and the basic infrastructure you'll need requires a lot of upfront costs. Then you have to plow in a lot of cash in advertising along with offering things like welcome bonuses, and maybe run at a loss for the first couple years while building a reasonable user base.",

A very good example are freebitco and primedice, and honestly, I knew these sites before knowing this forum.I believe a lot of users here are also long-time players in those 2 mentioned sites. We can understand about the question of the OP as he is a newbie in the forum.But if he tries to read the gambling board itself, he will surely understand that there are several casinos that are still active today.",

They just focused on their brand and just did what they do best, and people supported them for that. Community relations also go a long way.

Just like the usual business, success depends on how site owners will manage properly their business to last long. Since the competition in crypto-gambling is so tough, site owners have to think of the best possible promotions and features to lure users to play on the site.Lastly, big capital is really necessary to run gambling projects that will last for a long. If successful, that big capital can be soon achieved its ROI and what's next is pure profit.",

Most times there are always similar things that kill business or projects. Firstly, the foundation of the business or projects is important. If you want to begin and casino project that would last for a long time then you must ensure you study the market and come up with your goals, objectives and roadmap to achieve them. Most casino projects die because of lack of planning.Some casino owners view the business as a get rich quick scheme. Hence, when the profit is not rolling the way they projected, they tend to close the business and run away with customer's deposits. You must note that business takes time to grow, hence there is need for diligence and patience.Most online casinos fail because of lack of cybersecurity and privacy management. Most of them are hacked by scammers or sometimes information of customers are stolen and used to carryout criminal activities. Qualified human resources is very important for the success of an online casino firm. Most casino firm die easily because they don't have the right team or staff that would drive the vision or goals of the business. It is very important to recruit and consult the right personal, if you want to succeed in the crypto casino industry.",

The competition here in crypto gambling is huge, as we can see almost every month there’s a new site and they are competing with the top site which already have a good number of players if they failed to market the project most probably they wont last and the worst case is, they can turn into a scam project. There’s a lot of old site that is still here, they are also on the top simply because they offer great service and their platform is exceptional.",

I’ve been with stake for years already and I can say that this is one of the old yet best site to bet with. Don’t look for small site OP, they are usually the one that turns into a scam.",

Mismanagement is the number one issue that kills the project.  Since mismanagement involves the overall operation of the online casino, being poor on that will lead the gambling project to being bankrupt.  Others to save the financial status of the project often rely on dirty tricks that are borderline scamming the player of their winnings by using holes on the TOS that is easily exploited by the project owner.Becoming a scam I think is planned even before the project is created, so it is actually the end goal of the project owner, to run away with the fund when right time came.Quote from: passwordnow on September 26, 2022, 09:30:48 PMQuote from: KiaKia on September 26, 2022, 05:18:36 PMAlso what are the things that kills such project because even one or two survived for long I don't see many alive till now, they fail easily or turn scam later. It's because tokens are not really that necessary at all, there could be from little to no demand if you're also accepting other cryptocurrencies into your casino.It depends on how the project uses it.  If players find the token to be beneficial to them, they will gladly avail of it, the sad thing is project owners often disregard the important ideas that can be integrated on the token making them useless to the development of the platform and just use them to money grab.Quote from: Baofeng on September 26, 2022, 09:25:55 PMOne thing that kills gambling projects is obviously if they don't have players to begin with, and those who don't processed withdrawals and then who are blatantly scamming gamblers.
