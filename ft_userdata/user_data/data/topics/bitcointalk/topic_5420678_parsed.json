      "body": "Time appears to move faster as you get older because the more you experience the less exciting new things are. As a child, a simple car ride is a fun new experience. As an adult, you rarely \"stop and smell the roses\" so you get stuck in routines. These routines make time go by much faster. The key, is to live life with a childlike wonder and appreciate each moment that you are given.",

Since life is short, I try to have the best quality of life that is possible and there are foods that have vitamins that make you age more slowly, Omega 3, Vitamin C, d3+k2 etc... You also have to surround yourself with people who are not toxic, and if you have a sentimental relationship that you are happy with it and have \"stability with it\". I met ukrainians women, but before the war, and I like them more than western ones because of my way of thinking, which is very similar to theirs.

With that you just keep going and sometimes it is pass lunch time and you had not taken a moment to give your body to stop and have nutrients. There is that \"rat race\" lifestyle and living a daily routine life-style we tend to forget to slow down. Slowing down is not something we all can do, but it a lifestyle one can adapt and build upon on. This will help our mind and body as we do not want to be in senior age and have dementia.",
