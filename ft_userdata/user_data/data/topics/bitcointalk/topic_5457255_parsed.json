The more you engage topics, create topics in the forum; the better your post count grows.The more knowledge and zeal with in your posts and comments in your forum will lead to you earning merits. So the core focus should be making valuable contributions in the forum and the other will follow suit quite easily. The truth is the forum is a happy place to be..So the question would be how valuavle is your posts and comments (contributions) in the forumIn addition to your other question, I do not think You need a time table to use the forum, you can use the forum every hour of day; it all depends on your own schedule. If you notice, you would see new threads being made in the midnight, morning, afternoon and in the night. If you have a thread or post you want to track, you can set up notifications for the replies of that topic (thread) and you can easily follow up on the topic",

When you read and understand, if it is a topic that you know, there will be a contribution for you to make to it. Quote from: Black susano on June 22, 2023, 10:25:23 PM how you  share your time table for the forum,  I am on the forum most times because I can access it on my phone, the moment I pick up my mobile phone, rather than wasting my data subscription on irrelevant things on social media, I always try to access the forum to read up and engage in new discussions. I can be outside my home and in the forum, I can be in the midst of other activities and take a break to read forum discussions. At some point, the forum just becomes a part of you, not something you make out time to do because you feel obligated to, but something you just do. Become consistent with the forum, and it will become a part of you.",

As I earned more bitcoins, I became very interested in how Bitcoin works and what awaits it in the future, I started participating in discussions and started earning merit for my posts.So my advice to newbies is to not force yourself doing something that you don't want to do.",

There is no magic for post count because if you post actively your actively your post count will increase gradually. But you may ask about how you did magic on Merit count. To get Merits regularly you just need to help others, share resources, contribute in the forum. So I also tried them and also we need patience beside contributing in the forum regularly. 2. This forum is a place to discuss about Crypto and many more. So anyone can ask or open a topic to discuss. This forum is also a perfect learning place so learning and helping others will be the best to do.3. As I am a student I have a low of free times and I don't waste so much time in social accounts but I enjoy spending times in this forum. So when I am free then try to spend times here. So I have aparted some time to browse forum from my daily routine.",

Depending on the course taken, laziness or proactiveness will make the path easier or more difficult.Most of the newbies right now have 1 goal in this forum. To post bounty threads a proof of authentication on a weekly basis. That's why they still at newbie rank even though they've been registered here in the forum for years already. Well, the problem with some newbies right now is that, they are looking this forum as more of a source of income rather than a place where you can gather information with regards to crypto. Like what @hatsheput93 said, forcing yourself to do something you don't want will just make you more stressful, and in the end you will be the one that will suffer.Quote from: Black susano on June 22, 2023, 10:25:23 PM~I just shared what I know, and that's it.There's no secret formula on how to rank up here in the forum. You just know what you are saying. You just need to make quality posts, and merits will be given to you. Of course this isn't 100%, but bottom line is if you are contributing to the forum by making quality posts, you will be given merits. You still have a long way to grind that's for sure unless you've been into crypto for a long time already then you can contribute here already even though you're a newbie. Always research. Always contribute. As for me, when I was a newbie, I can consider myself as a shitposter at that time, but I'm slowly learning the basics at that time. I might said wrong things when I was a newbie (might still until now), but I'm more confident on what I'm saying since I gathered enough information that helped me construct a not-so high quality posts.",

Example of many of those links I have in my collection is this thread by @Pugman which is all about questions and answers about bitcoin https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2968050.0 I therefore ended up having a collections of post links where I can always go back to read those posts by just clicking on the link seamlessly.

Despite my efforts, I realized that creating discussions and replying with an extensively-written reply did not equate to me earning merits. So, I shifted my focus to reporting scammers and hackers across the forum.The beauty of doing this act is that you receive the best of both worlds- not only do you help cleanse the forum and warn users about hack/scam projects under the ANN board; but you also receive merits due to your hard work.Again, let this not cloud your goal of contribution.
