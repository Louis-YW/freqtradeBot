Comfort, its the very reason why they keep giving their coin to third party members and give away their personal information/government documents to faceless entities. When will they learn the two most important lessons in the world of cryptocurrency and blockchain?First: not your keys, not your coins. Second: be your own bank.Those are the two only rules you need to never be tricked into giving up your money/anonymity/control.And of course the affected people will find a way to blame Bitcoin/crypto for this, instead of improving themselves...",

Sir DaveF said the topic has already been discussed here but I'll still drop this comment here.@Doan9269, I don't think the OP is worried for himself, but his worries are for some of us who love KYC without knowing how unsecure it is. Even if the OP doesn't use CEX that requires KYC, I guess that's what you mean to say, but there are still a lot of members for whom this information is vital.Â  I have a question: if a user passes KYC in an exchange, can the user's information be erased if they want it in any way?

However, in a real world business, no financial services firm can operate without \"knowing their customer\". That's the rule everywhere! I am sure companies are learning from their mistakes and they will make themselves better over a period of time to secure their user's data. But at this point, no legal entity can operate without implementing KYC framework. Unfortunately that's the law! I believe, companies will be more serious about data security of the government starts imposing heavy financial penalty for each data breaches regardless of the fact why and how it happened. Then only these companies will take data security seriously and start investing there!",

Though this type of data leak is not new to us, it is unfortunate that centralized exchange failed to project users' personal data, which is extremely harmful to us. It's also adversely affecting when we get random emails from scammers with phishing links. When it comes to centralized exchange of personal documents, we are helpless. Moving a decentralized exchange completely is difficult for a variety of reasons. But every incident involving centralized exchange reminds us that we are not safe there.",
