The pool mining seems to work only with rental.It does not. it works with any mining software, cpu, gpu, asic, rental, owned, everything.If you have Nvidia GPU on your computer, download your preferred ccminer and run it like thisCode:ccminer -a sha256 -o stratum+tcp://eu.mpool.live:5205 -u LCN=<your wallet> -p d=<your preferred difficulty>",
