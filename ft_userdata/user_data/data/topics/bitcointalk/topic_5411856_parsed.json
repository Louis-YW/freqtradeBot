But to have a separate session for it? not sure how it will be effective for students. Maybe they will just go and attend but without putting their hearts on the lesson itself.Â  For me, everything starts with the students family and the environment because that is the first influence as far as gambling or even other addictions are concern.",

That is, to tell children about gambling addiction separately from addiction in general - alcohol and drug addiction. I think at school it is necessary to teach, first of all, the sciences, and parents should teach the ability to live. And by the way, I am against any ideology being imposed in schools (like we see now in some countries where crazy teachers tell children about their imaginary genders and sexual preferences). Gambling might be worth mentioning in the emergency response lessons (in my country it's called Life Safety), but it's not worth devoting an entire lesson to it.",

Countries in the world are not accurately organized by our governments, a lot that children supposed to be thought but they were not, example is the personal hygiene and how to avoid diseasons, all are given to only parents to teach, but many parents can not be professional like teachers. It can even be in the same subject that includes gambling and the health disadvantage of gambling, how it can lead to emotional stress and depression, but all were left to only parents alone to do. There is nothing bad to organize what could teach children about what is good for their health.",

The emergence of gambling addiction behavior or drug addiction is caused by choosing the wrong association. The wrong choice of friends can lead children to negative attitudes and behaviors, so parental supervision is needed to prevent children from falling into gambling addiction.Providing education through school designed can be done to warn children not to approach gambling, but any effort made will be in vain if children do not try to stay away from things that can damage their behavior.",

This must be applied when someone who addicted with it goes to the rehabilitation. I think that if school is not a way for people being addicted with gambling but yeah sometime there are some cases for people who under 18 being addicted with gambling but this must not become the answer. They will be going to the psychiatrist",

Secondly, knowledge about how gambling works (if it is decided to tell children about gambling at all) must be taught in mathematics - if a person really understands the mechanism of gambling, he will not be reckless.",

You can give them all necessary info, show presentation and etc, but how in IRL they will test that knowledge. We have all seen people addicted to alcohol, how bad they look, in what crap conditions they live. We have all see people addicted to drugs, the way their body look, their behaviour. But have we seen how people, that addicted to gambling, differ from other people ? For example when you walk by a casino or a place with slots, can you tell who is addicted, and put this person as an example (like look kid, if you gamble a lot, you will look like this), and who is just a regular, rare player ?",

Maybe teaching them to know when and how to ask for help would be better. Cause afaik, what and the types/samples of vices are already taught in school as part of a general curriculum (at least in my case) which I would as far as I can remember, also discuss addiction and stuff like that.

In a social management there are some issues that are tried to be solved by raising awareness through education. And here is the education system for gamblers, I think it is not possible to teach only on this subject institutionally. However, it is necessary to include in the national education system about the evils of gambling and drug addiction and its consequences. Because now little boys and girls are getting addicted to drugs. If they cannot be controlled now, they will be uncontrollable in the future from which there will be no way back.",

Although most people understand the importance of protecting youth from gambling addiction, the best strategy to address this issue has yet to be decided. How should those who work with youth discuss the risks of gambling with their students? Is it enough for schools to teach about the odds of winning instead of as well as proper money management? While some may be motivated by a desire to raise awareness about addiction for the benefit of students, others might argue that such lessons could actually have the opposite effect. In other words, some students may end up taking pleasure in gambling, not recognizing it as an inherently flawed behavior. Ultimately, this is one of those issues that will likely depend on how it's implemented and the intentions of individual teachers in the specific situation.",

Because parents can do it to remind children or their children. Apart from that, the teachers are also reminding in that matter that gambling does not have a good effect on anyone, especially minors.Then gambling addiction seems to be part of drug and alcohol addictions. The teachers in this school taught that according to my knowledge on this matter. Have a good day to all",

Considering and seeing the current situation with technology that is quite sophisticated, internet is easy to access, Wifi is moldy in all stalls and cafes plus children at school have to learn to use Android phones, it is very likely that if the supervision of parents is tenuous, it is guaranteed that 100% of minors will fall into the world of gambling.For that, if there are schools that carry out teaching methods regarding the effects and dangers of gambling addiction, I strongly support that it deserves to be prioritized as curriculum lessons in schools, not a separate lesson, it should be made into the main subject, if you remember the times like today.Understanding gambling addiction for children, from an early age in elementary school, about the effects and dangers of gambling is the right way to be developed, plus about the effects of alcohol and drug addiction, ok.",
