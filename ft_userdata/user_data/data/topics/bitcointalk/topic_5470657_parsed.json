And even uses the face of Dana White.A month has passed since this theft incident happened to the Stake platform last September. They have already resumed all their services after the security breach and processed deposits and withdrawals, and the platform has returned without any affected customers. What I see from this phishing site is that it has nothing to do with the previous incident. But it is targeting the Stake communities and attracting casino players to this phishing site to lure them with a considerable sum of money, estimated at $50M, to participate in the giveaway and to securely connect their wallets after seeing the picture of Dana White. Unfortunately, phishing sites are created by fraudsters easily and at a low cost and are widely spread among players and investors. 1 out of 100 may fall into this scheme, so we must report them to the registrars of these domains. Anyway, thanks OP",

Anyway, thanks OPI think what the OP meant is the Stake has been a target now by this elements because of the theft that had happen to them. So they might think that Stake and it's community are vulnerable already so this criminals wanted to strike again. But it's so funny though to see Dana White, is he related to Stake? What the criminals should do is maybe used Drake face here as he is a brand ambassador of Stake. Nevertheless, any crypto related that will ask you to connect, despite being the source is like a trusted one, to think twice not to do it because obviously your wallet are going to be drain in a snap at they have setup a bot already to do that in an instant. So this is a heads-up to Stake community as well.",

I have to say though, they've got the most legitimate looking website if you don't look at their URL, scammers are getting more and more meticulous in their schemes now huh?

Imagine if they've just find a web developing job, they seem to be proficient at doing that part.Maybe the scammers are in a hurry to create this website, and so they think that it's good if they put a picture of Dana White. But we all gamblers know that Dana has no connection to Stake, although Dana is a big gambler, but I haven't seen him going into crypto based gambling sites to bet. He loves to go face to face on table in a traditional land based casino.True, scammers is also very meticulous in choosing website names. At least it's should look at the site that they are trying to impersonate. And this domain registrar are willing to help them as long as they are getting paid by this criminals. Yes, if this will just used their talents in somewhere else that will not include scamming and stealing someones money. But it is what it is though. There are those kind of people in the world.",

Maybe some of them started at a young age, at their parent's basement and then grow up to be that criminals, who knows. So doesn't matter if this looks like script kiddie scammers.

At least the domain registrar works with this report. But I do agree that this will continue and hopefully there will be a lot of like the OP who will give us the warning and for all we know, we really care about this kind of members. They help sanitize the market and with the bull run just around the corner, this scammers are going to create more phishing websites for sure.",

Although the stake hack and theft has got nothing related to this, apart from raising Stake's moniker on news media once again after the primedice hack, people should be careful what they are stepping into.Of course the more famous you are on crypto the more scams will happen impersonating you. So if any newbie reads this, the above mentioned site is a scam and should be avoided and that new \"friend\" of yours on telegram should be blocked (why even bother reading their message? )Reported the same from my side, hope everyone else follows suit.",

Once Ive been informed of a phishing attempt in any form where we can submit a takedown request, I action it pretty quickly. They're usually taken down promptly.It'd be nice if there was a community-driven thread (Or datadump) thats easily maintained of all phishing attempts with relevant information to streamline this process and keep everyone else informed.",

But it's up to the mods to the that and it has been discussed many times already.So now for, specially for newbies, to make it a habit to visit this board not just to avoid scams, but also help the OP to report this fake and scammy sites so that it will be taken down immediately.",
