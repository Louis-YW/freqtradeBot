Regulated and licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore._______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________     WEBSITE | TWITTER  | TELEGRAM  |_______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________ABOUT CHINTAINETWORK RWA's are expected to be a $15T+ asset class by 2030, but hasn't really kicked off yet. Seems like it will kick off in 2024.Several years ago the Chintai team recognized this, pivoted their existing business and spent years building a top-notch full-service platform to support compliant tokenization & trading. They missed out on so many \"get rich quick\" opportunites that usually teams take advantdge of in crypto so they could take a long-term approach.But not only did they build a top notch team + tech, they also had the foresight to recognize that in order to play a leading role in the tokenization trend they will need to obtain the requiste licensing to tokenize + trade securities, and they need to do so in a global financial hub. They spent several years applying for RMO + CMS licenses from Singapore's MAS, and ended up being successful. Obtaining these licneses isn't easy.But why are these licneses important? Securitiy tokens represent 80% of the RWA asset class - and none of these RWA projects can legally issue them. If you want to tokenize billions of dollars of assets, you ahve to work with the big banks and financial insitutions. Therefore, you need to be licensed + regulatory compliant. Chintai (CHEX) has those licneses, but their competition doesn't.Ultimately, several years ago the team recognized the potential for RWA's and were thinking in decades while others were thinking in months. As a result of this long-term commitment, they are extremley well-postioned to be THE dominant player in RWA's.They are truly the Coinbase of RWA's, and in 2024 they will tokenize billions of dollars of assets. At that point, we will move beyond speculation - results will speak for themselves.The number one thing for me is licensing. Every RWA group I go into I ask them if they have a license and they ll all say the same. Oh we don’t need one. Or we re going to get one really soon. Or our partners have a license. This is all bullshit.  Even if they wanted to get a license which it’s very hard to get it will take them 2-3 years. Chex started this process 2-3 years ago. Other companies say they re going to tokenize like art or some real estate or maybe a building. That’s like a few thousand bucks. Chex has deals with oil companies worth billions. They do carbon, securities, bonds. Big partnerships. While the others do small deals. They can’t get the big fish because they can’t do it legally by law. It’s just a matter of time before the sec comes for them.$CHEX was very under the radar, no marketing at all and living only in the ghost EOS chain. Moved liquidity to ETH and BOOM.Chintai Nexus platform will launch early January and retail marketing will start with it.WHY CHINTAI VS OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE RWA PROJECTS LIKE DUSK?It is a different business model. They are selling a software package to financial institutions. Those kinds of models don't typically scale with the amount of business the FI produces. Maybe they charge $50k a year or maybe it is $1m, but the point is, the real money is being made by the FI who is further selling it on to the actual issuers.Because Chintai has licenses, we can act as the FI. that means we can make much more scalable revenue streams.Also, where companies like Dusk can ONLY sell their product to FIs, we can sell it to ANYONE who wants to raise capital, our potential issuer base is much larger.Another major element is the compliance and regulation. If Dusk doesn't have licenses, the FIs that they onboard will have to do the compliance themselves. The compliance side of things is a LOT of work, so that is going to drive the price up for the end user issuers. Because we have automated our compliance systems and we are confident in them, we save a ton of time and effort with checking financial records and making sure our system is up to scratch. In this way, we can save 30-70% of the compliance costs that would further be passed along to the end user issuer.Finally, consider the infrastructure that is being sold and the advantages and disadvantages of it. Why are they building on a blockchain? If it is for the audit trail aspect, then it doesn't matter whether they do it on a private or public chain, but we have already established that it isn't their responsibility to handle the audit side of things, so most companies are talking about using blockchain for liquidity, essentially tapping into a new source of potential investors.Fine, then you have to launch on a very liquid chain already like Ethereum, but you still have to make sure (because the FIs will insist on it) that only KYC'd people can access the token. So you have to set up a smart contract system that associates KYC'd addresses on Ethereum with whitelist access to specific assets that you have minted on the chain. Doing this instantly cuts your liquidity down to zero on day one. Now you have  to onboard users just like you would if it was a private blockchain, but now you also have to deal with all the terrible UX features of a public blockchain.To me, that is a pretty hard sell.So the issuers in general will get a much better deal with Chintai or Chintai working with an FI than they would going with an unlicensed entity, and Chintai would typically get a bigger piece of the pie as well, and the whole thing will just be a better experience for everyone.ARTICLES (FAQ AND WHY CHINTAI) Join Telegram Group      WEBSITE | TWITTER  | TELEGRAM  |",
