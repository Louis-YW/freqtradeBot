Gox hacker ☝️Please see into it, it has been transacting big since last week and it looks like this wallet, being under the possession of US Government or Mt Gox itself, has now been moving the funds.Either this caused panic, or they sent the coins to some of the traders who lost their btc during the hack, and the traders might be causing this dump.One more thing to watch for: DXY moving upwards will be the continuation for BTC to dump more.",

Gox address, and no spending has been made on that address, unless I read it wrong. In the last few hours, the market was really recovering real quick, which made me think it was part of a price correction and that it was just the beginning, and we might see more of the green market. There is definitely something else behind this price movement today; the price moved from 27k to 30k and is now back to 28k+, which I believe we might see again this night.Maybe this could be a result of the tax month coming to an end, according to Franky1 calculation.The bitcoin market might experience more dumps if that address actually starts selling those holdings, which will result in another panic, which caused a similar panic when the Fed gave an order to liquidate the 50,000 from a few weeks ago.",

And checking the price right now? it bounce back beautifully to $29k and I wouldn't be surprised that we might see $20k at the end of the month. Maybe there is some entities who likely wants to manipulate the price to crash and then there are traders who just fall for it and push the sell button, hence the nosedived to $28k.So overnight, it's going back and forth, and as you have said, the demands are still there, very high despite the market acting weird in the last 24 hours.And it's interesting to follow this news:QuoteFirst Republic Bank's (FRC.N) market value plunged again on Wednesday as investors waited to see if it would be able to find buyers for assets and engineer a turnaround without government support.In a brutal sell-off, the bank's market capitalization briefly sank as much as 41% to about $888 million and the first time under $1 billion, a far cry from its peak of more than $40 billion in November 2021. It closed around $1.1 billion.https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/first-republic-bank-shares-plummet-day-after-hitting-record-low-2023-04-26/It's interesting because of bitcoin's narrative, and we might see more investors putting their money on the market because of the continuing banking crisis.",

      "body": "@Stedsm. According to some people in social media, it is being blamed on the fake alert from Arkham Intelligence. The alert had the information that the American government has begun dumping the coins from the Mtgox hack. We cannot be certain if this caused the flash crash, however, the dump occured 6 minutes before Arkham Intelligence's fake alert. Head shaking because a whale can short sell on the pump, leak the fake alert then have the fake alert released by Arkham Intelligence. Am I being too skeptical? I might be but after FTX, after Luna, after 3AC, we can assume that anything is very much possible with the hustlers of the cryptospace.",

The volume seems to be picking up as well, which is always a good sign.Yup, i was surprised when the price had eventually gone up in a short time after that huge red candle had appeared. No one had anticipated for that kind of sell off and on which this one makes really an unpredictablemarket.Just like been said that what matter the most is that the price had eventually gone back up after that some small declines i would say. Getting that -/+2-3k per day movement isnt really that much nor shocking anymore. Still wondering on why there are people still get surprised whenever they do see up these things? Arent they get used to those days where price could move up this way or they arereally just getting used too on slow pace and gradual increase that we do have today? Important thing is that it did really recover which means that 30k might be the new bottom or ground for us to starting to take off. $32-35k is what we are projecting and if ever the resistancesabove would be breaking out then we might be seeing 40k soon but of course it would be better not to make yourself get hyped on, because it would really be just be makingyour desperate on whatever decisions you would be taking.",

The situation looks strange after unclear information circulates on social media. I believe flash crashes are heart wrenching and I don't want to see this again.Yes, since the false alarm was issued, the market turmoil changed instantly which made the market return strong in the percentage of new entrants with a level of confidence to take advantage of this moment. well I agree with OGNasty that this is a rally that has not stopped where people want to buy under $30k during the market situation that has not stabilized enough.",

It appears I also made a mistake. I thought the fake alerts were released 6 minutes after the big dump. It was really after 1 hour after the big dump hehehehe which makes this mistake worse from the perspective of Arkham Intelligence. They should remove Intelligence and call themselves just Arkham.The flash crash now clearly was caused by traders who were pumping on leverage then were used as exit liquidity by sellers hehehe. There was a rumor that one of the big sellers was Jump Capital.",

We've seen the price had already recoveredand there's no any issues been raised up. If ever this would really happen where funds would be released out then it would really be making out some significant effect on the price but it would really be just simply be eaten up bybuy orders which it wouldnt really be that shocking anymore as long the demand would be there then it wont really be that something that new thing.Flash crashes and price recoveries could happen in a short span of time on which it would be not a shocking thing anymore.",
