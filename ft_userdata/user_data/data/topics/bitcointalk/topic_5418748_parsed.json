I feel that anyone who controls so many businesses really wants to make sure all it's businesses are in right hands. By right hand i mean not only skill wise but someone who matches your mentality as well. So obviously this decision was very right by Elon and he has full rights to do such things.",

It is nothing new to hear that a new sheriff fires those under him. This is to announce his presence and seriousness for business. Moreover two captains don't stay in a ship. Tweeter is likely to have a new look and changes to it. Elon musk have been battling for this to happen and finally taking over. I believe he will need to work with new people because that will bring new energy to the platform.",

In the year 2022, twitter's leadership teased the introduction of an edit button as if it were cutting edge next generation technology. If a CEO spent 12 months as head of a tech corporation. And had no better ideas in the development cycle than an edit button. Should anyone question what they had worked on for the past year? When people think of silicon valley and cutting edge billion dollar technology somehow I doubt a year of development to produce an edit button is what they expect. If twitter's CEO was a liberal arts major with a degree gender studies and no technical background, it might explain their lack of development. If a high percentage of twitter employees had no job qualifications other than degrees in gender studies, that might also explain the high firing rate. At a bare minimum, I hope people recognize some of the strange occurrences at places like twitter.",

If done well it might become much bigger, then he might be able to ipo a part of it for less than he bough it for (like was done with Tesla) if done badly it'll probably suck money from him until it gets shut down, resold, reinvented or open sourced.

Tesla engineers probably aren't constantly working on Tesla firmware so moving some across or getting teams to work on both was the best solution.Most tech firms have done well from inventing/selling actual innovative technology and selling it (there's a lot of ads for offerings from companies, like Meta's Portal). It's strange to be talking about a person as if they're a company though.... Has Elon dehumanised himself somewhere? (popularity and/from controversiality doesn't sound that great).",

Earlier, Elon Musk had announced that he would cancel the ban on all banned accounts, and this may be the reason for Trump's declaration of a position in favor of him.",

Twitter is important for the whole crypto space and elon just brought one of the biggest weapon on the fields. Though i do not like doge at all but its good news for doge holders after all.How he fired head of the twitter officials right after joining because of trumps ban from twitter is festinating. He really meant about freedom of speech and he is not joking. His declaration about twitter monetization is also important and one of the greatest business mind in the world must have some surprising strategy for that.",

That shitcoin makes the whole crypto industry a joke. If a meme coin can have a crazy market cap like that, it means this industry is not serious or the people live in it. I can see what is elon up to. His business mind can be trouble for lots of investors in the future.I know he loves crypto but we should also remind him that he loves it because of the enormous wealth he could make out of it.

I mean dude just wanted to give up and didn't like it, and I really dislike Elon but if Elon decides not to buy your company then you should be happy about it. If you are forcing him to buy it, and sue him for giving up, then when he takes over the company it would be his first job to fire you. On top of that, the \"censorship\" deal will be a very hard one, \"freedom of speech\" propaganda that he uses allows people to tell each other not just \"mean\" stuff to \"hurt their feelings\" but literally cultural breaking stuff. If you tell a black person in america to \"shut up n...r\" then thats not just freedom of speech, thats literally racism, and if you allow millions to do that at the same time? Well thats culture moving stuff right there.Imagine a scenario where Elon owned Twitter when Obama was candidate, and he allowed everyone to call him the N word on twitter, nothing against freedom of speech, you wouldn't be jailed, so imagine millions doing that. How would any black person feel? Wouldn't that divide the nation and prevent progress and betterment of the nation as a whole when you have people fighting inward?This is going to blow up in everyones faces, there is no doubt about that, its going to be very very dangerous. This isn't about just some SJW person going \"I wanted them to call me she but they called me he!!! ban them!!\" no, this is about trump saying \"they stole the election, do something!\" and then people rushing into the capitol and one of them died and 4 policemen were beaten, THATS what twitter wanted to prevent, thats the type of thing we are scared of (trump was banned already by that time btw, this was an example).",

He could not have fired them sooner. Watching the meltdown and protest this garnered from the U.S. press was amusing. It's as if the monopoly they've held on big tech having come crashing down is somehow going to destroy the democratic institution that is the United States republic. How hyperbolic.
