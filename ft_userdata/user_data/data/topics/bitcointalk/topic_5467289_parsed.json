  "content": "This is good news for everyone who uses the Brave browser in India and is part of the Brave reward program. I was making a decent earning from Brave Reward a few years back. Earlier rewards were claimed using either of the two wallets, that is the Gemini wallet and the Uphold wallet. I was using Uphold Wallet, which I found difficult to operate because of the complex UI. Later on both these wallets stopped providing service to the Indian community. There have been demands by the Indian community to bring back the reward program to India.Earlier this year the Brave team did give a hint that they were in discussion with a new partner for India. Frankly, I was not expecting it to be zebpay exchange . I would say something is better than nothing in this case. You can read the detailed announcement by the Brave team here.",

      "body": "Brave partnership with Zebpay does not add a lot add anything to Zebpay's reputation. Being the first Indian exchange it is still not to be trusted as its reputation has been always questionable. As of now, it is considered, as an exchange with a bad reputation. I am saying that because of my experience with this exchange. I am happy for some of those who were earning free $BAT tokens every month through the reward program. They were left helpless as Brave Software could not find a solution at that time. They found the solution and did a tie-up with a questionable Indian exchange. I would add this event to my thread regardless of my thinking. The simple reason is, that I only post news that is good for the Indian community.",

      "body": "This is good news! Someone has to be a partner for Brave in India. A lot of Indian content creators did register to the rewards. They are slowly capturing the Indian market with their fast and ad-free internet browsers. I have used it in the past, later on I shifted to Safari browser. They do give BAT tokens to their users monthly which can be redeemed. I never did as it requires you to pass KYC. It will be easy now to withdraw those token using zebpay.",

I personally want to avoid all Indian exchanges at any cost. Zebpay is definitely an Indian exchange and strongly tied with the government compliance. So I will continue with Crome I guess. Brave should have chosen a decentralised or non-Indian exchange for their reward program. They could have received better response from the userbase.",

That is correct they could have partnered with other platforms where KYC is not required. The problem would be the Indian government and its law. If they need to operate and promote their product the would need their customers to pass KYC, as they would be distributing crypto to those eligible. If it was INR then they won't need a cryptocurrency exchange as the payment would credit the bank account. The reward plan is similar to Google Adsense. I still agree zebpay is not the partner they should have considered. There were other exchanges like Wazirx with whom they could have partnered.",

I holded it for around 6 months thinking they will make rewards available in india but they didn't. now i have 0 BATs because i fresh installed windows.Brave is private browser then why partnering with zebpay?it will be good if brave comes to India, there are many indian jugadi's who can try to get more BATs out of it. (Like me made around 6 profiles and earned 20BATs on each profile but unclaimed it, that's why many platforms like this are not available in india because they will earn less profit from indian people)",

      "body": "How will it really help Zebpay? First they need to revamp their exchange in India which also is not at all profitable considering that Indian market is too dry to actually catch some great profits. Also, I think BAT rewards aren't profitable at all these days, especially with the price of each token down to just $0.18, even if you are able to collect 6-7 BATs after each month of surfing and browsing it generally translates to nothing, earlier when the price was high it could still mean some good 1-2k INR for you for free each month, also yes the KYC problem.",

I cannot say how it will benefit Zebpay as I do not know anything about this exchange. I can confirm that this might be a strategy to add those users to the exchange userbase who were once earning a good amount every month using BAT tokens. They promote their browser using the incentive plan for those who use it for surfing. Other browsers do not offer such incentives, that is one hell of a marketing strategy. Yes, you are correct BAT rewards are not profitable anymore. I went and checked the charts, and what I found is that the price of 1 BAT token reached its ATH in 2021 which was $1.45. It was the same time when Bitcoin was pumping resulting in multiple ATHs for Bitcoin. If someone still holds those monthly tokens to date they would get a good ROI when the next bull run starts.",

They stopped BAT rewards sometime in 2021 before the bull runs. It was better than what it is now, I used to earn somewhere around INR 1000 or more using three browsers in every 2 months time. At the moment it would be very hard to make that kind of money in that timeline. You would need more than 10 browsers to earn a small amount of INR 1000 in just 2 months' time. When the next bull run comes the value of BAT should increase and at that time I am sure a lot of users will use the same trick to earn those tokens.",

      "body": "Well lets analyse this in several ways:1. Adoption of crypto in a community - Positive for that, it is a method by which people can earn some free tokens and eventually sell them for usable cash at hand.2. Privacy and device wellbeing - Negative for that, Brave even though claims to be privacy oriented, you can never completely trust any tech company. Microsoft broke their promise of Windows 10 being the last and Jio broke its promise of free calls at one time. But at least these two were honest and owed up, rest of the tech sphere never owes up but does a lot in the background.3. Market making - Negative for that, as more free coins come in the selling pressure will gradually increase reducing the cost of 1token. So only the early baggers will get profit than the ones who join late.Points to ponder over, we can go back and forth on these already. Let me know what you all think about my points.",
