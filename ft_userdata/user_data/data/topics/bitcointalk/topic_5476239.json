  "content": "I have noticed this a lot about the lack of caution from some people who have attained certain ranks in the forum. At the point when they were rising from newbie to jnr member, then member and going upward, you will notice the caution they use in ensuring that they follow up with the rules and regulations guiding the forum as well as ensuring that their contributions to the forum is topnotch and that their posts and replies has no reason for a plagiarism check to be carried out on it. But along the line, because they've ranked up and might even be participating in a serious signature campaign, you see this tendency of relaxation in them and before you know, they start defaulting most of the forum rules and regulation and their account might even be giving negative tags and in some worse situation, there account might even be banned.Ranking up to a particular position should not be all that you're known for.  if people see that you're a full member or snr member who is known for giving out topnotch information and guidance in the forum, it had serious respect to your name. you see the account of jayjuangee, even though he is one of the highly ranked members in the forum, the quality in his replies goes a long way to how his level of growth, experience and development not just with regards to the forum, but also in the total bitcoin space.While you strive to rank up, make sure that you as a persona is also growing your IQ and intellect so you don't grow to be a hero member or legendary that makes the kind of contribution that a jnr member should be making. Or make the same mistake the newbies do at the beginning.",

      "body": "For you to be able to create an account that is active on the forum and the account earns the required merit needed to reach the next rank up to full member or legendary, you have been obeying the rules, and if by any chance such an account falls victim to plagiarism, which is an uncommon mistake to be made by an experienced member, I can only give two more explanations of that, which are:1. Those members from the beginning were already either word-spinning or plagiarising, and they were good enough to cover their tracks so as not to get noticed, a mistake that could occur at any time in the future.2. Or those high-ranking accounts found in doing so could have changed hands from the original owner to another person. I know cases of such could occur, but the majority of such cases will fall under the above-mentioned categories, which we can't turn a blind eye to.",

Secondly, at a lower rank they need every merit they could get and as such they are very formal and too serious. Those who later get negative tags might be something of reputation damage either through engaging into shady business or two users have differences and they resulted to the use of tags. The banning due plagiarism could be as a result of just getting caught late but surely has been on it from start or a ban evader that ranked up new account.

Newbies only have to start with that thread, read before doing anything next like posting. Read rules, understand it, ask about it if they don't understand rules. Learn about the forum first and learn about Bitcoin, they will become more knowledgeable about the forum and Bitcoin.They will become a more valuable member in the forum, even they have low ranks and only slowly rank up with ranks.IQ? It's not what newbies have to mind about because there is no IQ test or IQ rank in bitcointalk.",

      "body": "@ OP, you indeed made a  very broaded points.It  is like the more you are growing(ranked) is the more experiences and more posts and replying skills is obtained.On a serious note, the newbies (beginners) are more liable to breaking the chain of the T&C between the forum and its participants but while time goes and accounts is ranked, the conciousness members are to cushion the red tags that is to stake their accounts to baned.I think the referers are really doing good jobs this time because the nature of some posts made by some beginners is overwhelming whereas it is very well vital and reasonable that is almost beyond their ranks supposed to be measured by the level of their knowledges via Bitcoin and the platform at large.We all are not only in here to discuss about Bitcoin or just about discussion but also to the credits of earning rewards through joining the signature campaigns and of course occuring of diverses knowledges.Hence certain measures and expected rules and qualities of contributions of members whom are potentialed to join or being in the signature campaigns is expected and also penalizations of members who are gone contrarily to the policies of the forum is highly observed.A must read:Here is the Global Moderator who has brought down the forums signature guidelines about members Stated to be  who will be assigned or has been assigned to the signature campaign (s).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1684035.msg16904309#msg16904309",

      "body": "I disagree. People who have been through thick and thin—that is, have been on the forum for a long time—value their efforts and will be very careful about what they write about. Yes, there are some, but they also make random mistakes, which cannot be said about beginners who do not understand the entire structure of the forum.Newbies always play by luck, thinking that if they copy something from other sources, they will not be detected, since it is easy to get lost in a large forum. However, they don't understand the things that experienced users usually notice. Yesterday, a person still presented himself as a newbie, but today he creates posts indicating that the person has a high level of knowledge. Thus, newcomers are subjected to a thorough check of their posts, which, as usual, always reveals deception.But if you are the OP, claiming that you see many ranks who are relaxed and do not care that they can be detected, one thing can be said: everything takes time, and they will be caught too. It’s very disappointing to lose an account that has become big and is banned for the mistakes of youth. But everyone is the arbiter of their destiny.",

Thesame rules that applies to a newbie is also what applies to an old experienced member of this forum, if you plagiarize and get caught you will be banned, if an experience member is doing so and yet not caught, that means his sky is not yet full with cloud to have drop down dew, once they are caught, they got banned, so everyone enjoys equal opportunity together being here.Quote from: Agbamoni on December 01, 2023, 08:58:54 PMBut along the line, because they've ranked up and might even be participating in a serious signature campaign, you see this tendency of relaxation in them and before you know, they start defaulting most of the forum rules and regulation and their account might even be giving negative tags and in some worse situation, there account might even be banned.This is a lie, show me a good example of a reported user found violating the rules and yet is not banned, except if he's not caught, also about drop in performance after ranking up, some are not dropping in their performance, they only believer that i single line or sentence that is accurate to the reply needed or question asked should be enough than writing up contents like an article when a short or brief answer is needed.",

The case of a member who starts behaving poorly in the forum when he/she gets a high rank wouldn't be the norm, imo, but the exception. As you said, once you have more to lose, you are more careful too.There are a few cases that seem to be kamikaze, yes, and some OGs that seem to have lost their way and behave as if they were omniscient or worse, and we can fill many pages here talking about these guys, but imo that's not something generalized for most members, as I said.",
