  "content": "A lot of debate has been ongoing regarding the high fees in Bitcoin transactions lately. Many ideas have been suggested: blocking Ordenals or the massive use of Layer 2, while others propose increasing block space. In short, numerous ideas have been put forward, lacking unanimous agreement but fueling discussion and analysis.I would like to present another idea, perhaps less popular than the previous ones, but which I consider to be minimally viable. This idea wouldn't significantly alter the current functionality; rather, it would serve to ensure that all transactions can be processed in a timely manner. The idea is as follows: Ensure a percentage of space in the blocks so that older transactions, regardless of the fee amount, can be processed.I'll try to explain. Imagine that 10% of the block is allocated to process transactions that are over 48 hours old, regardless of the fee used. Similar to the current process, transactions still enter a queue, arranged from the highest to the lowest fee. However, an additional element is introduced to create the queue: the transaction date. In this way, if a transaction is not processed after 48 hours, it enters the queue based on its release date. From that point onward, the blockchain will process the oldest transaction first, regardless of the fee.For example: imagine that when a transaction is sent, the average fee to be processed in the next block (approximately 10 minutes) is 80 sat/vB. However, the sender only includes a fee of 50 sat/vB. The network continues to operate normally, and after 2 days, the transaction is still not processed. At this point, it enters a waiting queue where the oldest transactions are processed first, in sequential order. Since there are still 100 transactions ahead of it, it will have to wait for several more blocks to be processed. In the end, the transaction is processed, for instance, 52 hours after it was originally sent.Now the question arises: won't everyone start using 1 sat/vB since they know transactions will be processed in a minimum of 48 hours? Yes, that's a possibility. However, we can consider two factors: if there are many transactions at 1 sat/vB, it might take significantly more hours for them to be processed; secondly, even within the system, rules must exist.For instance, if two or more transactions have the same date, which one takes precedence? The one with the higher fee.What if there are thousands of transactions at 1 sat/vB? They will still have to wait their turn, potentially taking many days, similar to the current scenario.One could also establish a minimum for a transaction to enter the queue based on the waiting time. For example, calculate the average fee of all transactions in the queue after 48 hours. Then, process transactions above this average fee first, maintaining the principle of prioritizing the oldest transactions rather than the highest fee.This is just a different suggestion to try to minimize the impact of high fees. It provides a minimally viable perspective for ensuring that a transaction doesn't linger for weeks waiting to be processed, even with a reasonably acceptable fee. This approach allows everyone to plan their transactions more effectively while retaining the freedom for each individual to set their fee. The only difference is that there is a probability of the transaction being processed more quickly than in the current model.",

In short, numerous ideas have been put forward, lacking unanimous agreement but fueling discussion and analysis.Since the increase in the ideal percentage of blockspace has birth to having the numerous capacity to contain more than one transaction leading to layer 2 protocols and reduced in thebrate of mempool congestion, this same available space after the increase of block eize to be able to accommodate more transactions leads to how the ordinals swindles it way forward into the increased blockspace for efficiency but now turni the whole network into a competitive survival of the highest bidders between the normal users which are the bitcoin transactions and Ordinals.Quote from: joker_josue on December 25, 2023, 09:48:40 AMThe idea is as follows: Ensure a percentage of space in the blocks so that older transactions, regardless of the fee amount, can be processed.We may not want to decrease the blockspace anymore because it has already solved the problem of delay in transaction confirmation time and mempool congestion,none thig I Know is that the mempool cannot be always thst busy, there will be times it will be more less congested and the fee rate could be as low as less than $3 during weekends or weekdays, in such regard, we cannise viabtc to accelerate our transaction, or make protocols the priotize bitcoin transactions first over Ordinals, but onna real sense the Ordinals are paying more than the host are for their transaction confirmation to be fast.",

In other words, the person still has to pay a high fee to transfer from L1 to L2.3 - There is no guarantee that L2 rates will not increase. With increased usage, channel operators and node have found an excellent opportunity to make money from fees. While miners still make a return on the base block reward, channel operators depend their entire return on fees. For these reasons, I see it difficult for L2 to solve the problem. In 10 years, are we discussing moving transactions to a future L3? In 50 years, how many layers will we have?Now, if they say that L2 is to support everything other than transactions, it makes perfect sense. But to do that we have to take them there, which seems to be difficult.",

This can be so frustrating if the person is forced to use Bitcoin for the transaction since some people do not have a choice but to follow the directive of the parties they are dealing with. All the businesses I know are not looking for alternatives and advising their business partners otherwise. This is unless the money dealing with is huge and the party do not care.Be it as it may, we can't be wrong to continue giving suggestions on it can be better, and I know that the developers would have been racking their brains for the same purpose as well. Besides, I have made a similar solution to this one on the Mempool issues in July or thereabout, this is to curb the menace in the network, particularly that of miners that have monopolised the system. They are selling it to the highest bidders and this is not helping. Since miners will not stop as it is business as usual for them, the only solution is for the developers to make them stop. They can do it by writing codes that will mandate them to comply and stop rejecting the lower fees transactions. This has consequences too but they can still work around it for the common good of all.",

That hits multiple birds with one stone by addressing all the things people discuss regarding this attack!1) It will reduce bitcoin tx fees as the spam would stop2) Nothing would be \"censored\" as some users love to call it3) Miners revenue would increase which is another false argument some users use to justify this attack4) The scam called Ordinals will still use the \"bitcoin\" name so it can continue ripping idiots off5) It is a completely separate chain/network so it can have its own consensus rules and it means the said transactions would become NFTs for real as opposed to now that they are arbitrary data6) Being a separate chain means it is not going to be limited by Bitcoin limits (block size, script/smart contract limitations, etc.)They will never do this though because of a simple reason: they never wanted to create a smart contract platform.

Higher rates than the traditional system, more time to process payments than the traditional system, more difficult to use for small holders and dedicated only to tycoons.Suggesting to use other currencies instead of Bitcoin is an attitude that is completely contrary to the idea of making Bitcoin popular.

I don't think LN is enough,  as it is still hard to use imo.Ordinals in LN would be amazing for everyone.Layer 2, in my opinion, has three problems:1 - We move on to custody services, as it will be difficult for everyone to have it on their own and in their own channels.2 - The fees are still there, but camouflaged. In other words, the person still has to pay a high fee to transfer from L1 to L2.3 - There is no guarantee that L2 rates will not increase. With increased usage, channel operators and node have found an excellent opportunity to make money from fees. While miners still make a return on the base block reward, channel operators depend their entire return on fees. For these reasons, I see it difficult for L2 to solve the problem.1. People can choose to use non-custodial LN wallet.2. That's true. It's not practical option for those who don't make much transaction.3. But with increased usage, there'll more route where your LN wallet choose route with lowest fee.Quote from: joker_josue on December 25, 2023, 03:00:56 PMIn 10 years, are we discussing moving transactions to a future L3? In 50 years, how many layers will we have?No way. I expect people simply use multiple L2 for different purposes.",

You can have thousands of channels, without a doubt, but everyone will seek to obtain the greatest profitability from having equipment connected 24 hours a day to keep the channels open. In addition to the obligation to keep Bitcoin staked in these channels.",
