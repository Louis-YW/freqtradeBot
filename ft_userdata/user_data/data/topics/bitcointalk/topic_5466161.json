      "body": "wow these are interesting purchases.  this generally happens in collecting when they are niche items. there are buyers who do not monitor the market on a daily basis. there are other buyers who do not buy at market prices.For example, I was risking selling a collector's tax stamp from the 1800s at auction for 10 euros (symbolic figure) when usually the fixed price would be between 300/500 euros... or a collection of proofs/essays from 3000/5000 euros to less than 100 euros... (both cases in ebay)solution? better  starting prices and of course if don't sell just wait for the right moment.related arbitrage for collectors or sellers is pretty common practice not surprised too much... well there are not already available large lots to be checked, but I guess in 100 or more years, this practice will become pretty usual.",

      "body": "Thank you for sharing this. There's really something to get if you manage to see the value of something before it even reaches the point where it is really valuable like what we are saying now like \"Wow, this is a steal\" and many more. It's definitely something that could be worth studying and maybe verifying to see any \"steal collectibles\" now and invest in the future in just 5 - 10 years.That's definitely intense.",
