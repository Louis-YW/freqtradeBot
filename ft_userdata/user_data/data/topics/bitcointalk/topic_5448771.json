Thanks to the reply on my post I have changed my point of view.From my understanding, you have to first drop the thought of being productive. One should improve the quality of one's work without considering the result as important. We can learn to improve the quality of our own posts by looking at the posts of seniors. That's why you have to spend more time here and read the posts of different people, read the replies to improve your quality. And remember one thing we all make mistakes sometimes no human is without mistakes but the main thing is to realize your mistakes and correct them.",

Maybe you can try to be more active on there and build Nigerian local boards to become bigger and more active.",

From your nature of posts I found out your someone that creates too many posts and many I would say they are needless. But maybe you actually are of the thoughts that this could fetch you merits. Excessive post creation will only land you into an ignore list of many because it is termed spamming. If you really want to be productive in the forum you need basic knowledge about bitcoin and cryptocurrency and none of your posts suggest you have some so I will actually advise you post less for the main time and learn. Through learn you could help others by sharing your knowledge not just by creating new thread but also by answering questions",

Thank youLooking at your account you are already doing great here in the forum. I mean this wasn't some kind of competitive or anything so could pretty much post or share what you want here in the forum. I guess you just need to continue your journey on cryptocurrency and Bitcoin from that you can share your experience, suggestions, and tips with other members. Ranks don't really matter a lot these days unless you want to join campaigns in the future, as long as you post a lot of useful content you're going to get merits for sure.Just be yourself and share your experience and expertise I guess, also manage your time here in the forum you don't really need to be online 24/7 if you have something to share or discover something you could post it. The important thing is you learn here in the forum and other members learn from you as well.",

What can I do to improve my posting style and make it better even if it's not perfect? Am I even contributing to the discussion I engage in?Just take your time and ponder on those questions; and try to make amends to your posting style and another thing again, your thread creation. Creating multiple threads without engaging in them is a sign that you're only just creating those threads for merits, once you create a thread try as much as possible to engage with those that are commenting in your thread don't just create a thread and then move on to a next one make sure they know that you're interested in that topic that's why you created that thread.This was what I did in my early days here in Bitcointalk my posting style is not the best but at least I believe I have improved more than when I started the forum and I also believe that with time and constant reading and development, you'll also improve.",

Here is the question to the ChatGPT: How do I become productive on the bitcointalk.org forum?Here is the answer from ChatGPT:Quote1. Before posting anything on the forum, make sure to read the rules carefully. This will help you understand what is allowed and what is not allowed on the forum.2. Determine the reason why you want to participate in the forum. Is it to learn about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Or are you looking to promote a project or product? Having a clear goal will help you stay focused and productive.3. Look for topics that interest you and participate in the discussions. Share your thoughts, opinions, and ideas, and ask questions if you have any. 4. When participating in discussions, make sure to provide value to other members. Share your knowledge, offer helpful advice, and provide solutions to problems. 5. Be respectful to other members and follow forum etiquette. Don't engage in flame wars or arguments, and avoid spamming the forum with irrelevant content.I hope this was helpful. Good Luck!",

Thank youFor my fellow newbie, I just started a week ago and this forum was introduced by my friend here that told me there's a lot of opportunity here that I could learn. He'd introduced me the basics on how to control things and the rules in the forum. I guess that if you only aimed is to always have interactions maybe you'll feel that way. I've been learning a lot here by just exploring and reading, I have idea on crypto since my friends were teaching me even before and engaged to crypto. And every topic it enlightens me but due to my schedule I can't keep my eye on the forum for a long time. Maybe I suggest to study more about certain topics for you to have informative communication with people here in the forum.",
