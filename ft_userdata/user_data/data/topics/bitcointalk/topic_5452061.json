  "content": "The idea for Offline Bitcoin Sending / Receiving Via Short Messaging ServicesThe Problem: We know very well Bitcoin can not be sent without an internet connection. While spending bitcoin from your wallet you need an internet connection via which you broadcast your transaction. This is picked up by the network/miners for further confirmation and is then included in a block forever. The entire process will use your internet connection. From broadcasting to giving you confirmations, the wallet will keep synching with the blockchain via the internet. It has been almost ages since we are hearing and read that this is one of Bitcoin's disadvantages as not everyone is blessed with the internet. Or even if we have it, is it possible to send it offline? The Theory: A possible solution is around us since the time cellular phones were invented and we got the capability of reaching out across the border via towers, satellites, and much more. This is without an internet connection obviously. In the initial days, humans knew we have broad-spectrum radio frequencies which can transfer sound waves across hundreds of miles in one go. They started building towers for specific distances to cover the range even further. As we advanced, we invented the texting system. In this one data packets with 160 characters (including all alphabets, numbers, and special characters) were possible to send and receive almost instantly. Slowly, SMS is literally going away since we have the multimedia capability which uses the internet and we chat, call, and video over the internet via different apps. However, the forgotten SMS could be the potential key to sending our bitcoins across the border, and that too almost instantly. The Core Concept:The SMS works on the principle of sending data packets over cellular networks. A packet is sent from the sender's device to the nearby cellular tower. The cellular tower then bumps the packet to SMSC which is Short Message System Center. This center then locates the nearest tower of the \"receiver\" and thus it transmits the packet to their device and they receive the readable message. This does not require any sort of internet connection. Pros: If somehow the receiver is not within the reach of the cellular network then SMSC stores the packet and keeps trying to send the SMS until they get it. This means, there is a high probability of reaching the receiver's device. How we can use this method to Send Bitcoins without the Internet?A sharing protocol can be integrated within the wallet. Let us say I am having a wallet that isn't connected to the internet at the movement. Since I will be in possession of the private key, then I should be able to generate the offline transaction by signing it. Since it is not connected anywhere it will be air-gapped. However, I should be able to download the desired transaction in text format so that I can send it via SMS. The Blockchain Receiver:This is again one of the biggest air gaps between my text containing the transaction seed and adding it to the blockchain for further confirmation. This isn't difficult to achieve. For example, we are flooded with OTP's these days. OTP is a one-time password generated through cell phone communication and sent to users' devices. As soon as a web-based application receives this OTP it verifies the user's data/device etc. [ Continued..]Broadcasting and Synching the nodes:In a similar fashion, we can have a Host/mining pool integrated with SMS receiving protocol. This will help the pool/host to keep track of any messages that are getting sent to it. Once it receives the message with valid transaction information, it should be able to download it and add it to the current block for confirmation. Once the miner confirms the transaction it should be able to send back the information in SMS format to the receiver's device. Once the users' phone receives the SMS, their wallet should be able to read it out and synch the wallet with an updated balance. Moreover, pool/host should also send the same message to the \"senders\" device thus their wallet will be synched and confirmed as well. Air-gaps:Between the soft wallet and blockchain Between the hard wallet and blockchain Between the sender and recipient Â All of them can be filled with the Short Messaging System without the Internet. This will take technical upgrades on various ends that is wallet, miners, pools, and devices. However, since it is going to be only soft update I believe it's achievable with the devs who have complete knowledge on both sides. If this is already discussed, then what happened with the idea and what were the challenges other than above mentioned theory?",

To drive a car, to go from point A to point B (and this can be considered a form of transfer), you don't need the Internet. But you can't do without roads. We would want to go back in time because we have an entire infrastructure spread out throughout the world for sending an SMS.That is the whole point here. We already built the road, we do have space roads in the form of satellites. An SMS can be sent overseas without internet connection and that's the beauty of it. The network and the internet are two entirely different things here. Consider this, you can still send an SMS with GSM.GSM: A Global System for Mobile Communication. As far as I know, most of the countries are developed way above GSM which is mostly a 2nd generation network. This would be minimal infra or network that would be required by locality and everyone does have this. All you need to do is set the air gap protocols at every end and send that SMS. (obviously without an internet connection). I know this is not as easy as the above sentence but that is where the group work comes and the greatest mind sets the fire.",

      "body": "@all, thanks for the healthy discussion. Well, the cellular network is surely possible everywhere but the internet is not. They use high-frequency bands for sure. I mean you can even send the SMS over the GSM network which is 2G band and it is the lowest frequency right now and after that, you can have EDGE. Our modern phones are definitely capable of catching them everywhere they go. So it's not necessarily contradictory that the Internet and SMS are available together. The security concern:I am not sure why this would be a security concern if we are just sending out txid or txid hash. That's literally just a string of characters that no one can break or understand anything from the same. If you have seen any financial app, mobile banking app, or an app that requires an extra layer of security then it would do the secure SMS verification. Check out the image below which shows how one of the wallet apps verifies the true ownership of a device, SIM, and installed app with the SMS. As you can see there is a string of characters that the installed app generated itself and is ready to send to the server. This is how they understand and provides access to the installed app. This authentication system is already in existence. Why would we bother about the middleman if they are just seeing some gibberish anyways?",
