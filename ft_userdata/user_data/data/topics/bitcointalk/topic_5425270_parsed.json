I have read different tweets about it, and it seems they have been scamming people for a long time. They just decided to exit.Check out this Trustpilot reviews - https://www.trustpilot.com/review/hoo.comIt's really sad, but I hope people learn a lesson about trusting centralized exchanges, worse still, shit exchanges.",

Probably because of high promised return for yield farming tokens, number of accepted tokens that came from airdrops, and other token related service, etc. It's my first time hearing this exchange actually, but their user base is somewhat large, they have 100k twitter followers although not sure the legitimacy of the followers. Knowing they have huge user base if this case is too all of their users, then this might be a very huge problem to begin with.",

Hoo has been inactive since July keeping their users in total suspense about their funds then woke up to delete their website. With the number of registered customers amounting to over 1.2 million with claims that over 60% are foreigners from Brazil, Russia and others. Big exchanges are crashing an alarm to be wary of centralise exchanges because more will crash as the bear market persists.",
