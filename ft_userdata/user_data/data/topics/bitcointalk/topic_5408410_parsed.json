Aside from the feedback, I looked at the people who trust him and more than half have negative and/or neutral feedback of negative spirit. One with a flag. It doesn't give a very good feeling, to be honest.",

But based on DT voting[1], he was trusted only by EFS and that makes him a DT1. While it is mentioned that it should be at least two trusting you.Ooof, i was confused, he was trusted by bobita and Vispilio who has lots of negative feedback.Quote from: theymos on January 09, 2019, 06:03:26 PM- You must have at least 2 people directly trusting you with an earned merit of at least 250, not including merit you yourself sent.

I just changed my trust settings to view RaltcoinsB's trust list in 'real time' and this person includes 9 'people' along with the 'DefaultTrust' account. Both 'DefaultTrust' and 'OldScammerTag' are actual accounts in the forum database, so any algorithm that checks for a number of accounts will take these accounts into consideration.I think the 'OldScammerTag' is likely obsolete at this point, although I am unsure if it is appropriate to outright delete the account (along with the associated ratings with the account). The algorithm will need to be updated to exclude these two \"accounts\" or a decision needs to be made that including as few as 8 accounts is acceptable if these two are included in one's trust list.",

But it's simpler: the accounts haven't made any posts, and Trust-relations from accounts with zero posts are already excluded.QuoteI think the 'OldScammerTag' is likely obsolete at this point, although I am unsure if it is appropriate to outright delete the account (along with the associated ratings with the account).OldScammerTag left a lot of negative feedback. Deleting it won't do any good.QuoteThe algorithm will need to be updated to exclude these two \"accounts\" or a decision needs to be made that including as few as 8 accounts is acceptable if these two are included in one's trust list.I guess that decision was made already. DT1 requires to include 10 users, it doesn't matter much that my Trust list viewer can't show all of them.If a user adds 10 Brand New accounts to his Trust list, he can reach DT1 while having 0 inclusions shown on my Trust list viewer.",

However, this thread isn't about your reputation. It’s about the possible bug or rules I'm not really aware of. If it was about an user (in this case you), I would definitely post it in reputation board.",
