In a mining pool, a group of miners work together with sharing their power over a network and in this way, they increase the chance of finding blocks. The block reward that is earned by a mining pool is shared among the miners according to the power owned by each of them.",

It happens in PoS blockchain, masternodes, and so on. It is inevitable that those with a lot of money can spend and earn more than retail users. If big spending doesn't equal more profit, I don't think mining would be as interesting for them. CMIIW.Fortunately, there is a solution as mentioned above.",

      "body": "What's really important isn't owning \"1% of the total hashrate\" or more, what's important is that your mining reward is greater than your infrastructure and electricity costs (once your ASICs are paid off).It's indeed a complex calculation, bearing in mind that in around 300 days we'll be heading for a new halving. However, if your electricity is dirty cheap, and you have access to good prices for your ASICs, you can do as suggested above and join a mining pool. As long as you're profitable, no matter what scale you organize your mining operation at, you're profitable. And that's all that matters.If owning 1% of the total hashrate were a simple thing, we'd know about it, and it's long been out of anyone's reach (especially private individuals who mine at home).",

Not everyone gets to keep the Bitcoins they have earned for many years.When investing in mining, one shouldn't think about being a millionaire in a year or two.

You're making it sound like it's a waste of time for everyone in the world to grow food because Cargill Meat has 10 million cattle and General Mills has god knows how many acres of farmland, so just give up! It doesn't work like this, if you have dirt cheap electricity you can easily compete with the large companies because you don't need to pay employees, you don't need to pay rent or security, and most importantly you have no shareholders that need to have a return on top of that.Also, the price of that miner means also nothing, it's the return that counts, if it were 100$ and it would have earned you 10 cents a day it would have been better?

If you look at what the block reward will be in 5 or 10 BTC halvings, you can still come to the conclusion that in the future, people will still be having this argument and would have started mining today if they could.
