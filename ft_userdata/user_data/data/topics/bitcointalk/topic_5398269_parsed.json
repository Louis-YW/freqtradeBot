  "content": "Hello,I just got a miner and it has these stupid YD12038B2G 4.5A fans which use a molex micro-fit square 4-pin connector.The fans are WAY over the \"65\" db rated, the miner has no speed control for them and they spin at over 8,000RPM while delivering less CFM than a standard parallelminer fan. Wouldn't be such a big issue if one of them didn't vibrate itself to death already, sheering off its casing because of the uselessly high RPM that also sent vibrations to the other fan and throughout the miner itself. I'm surprised the other fan didn't bite the dust too.https://i.imgur.com/XC4zExs.jpgCan someone please tell me where I can find an adapter so I can use the fans I already have with this machine?Thank you",

      "body": "That could always work as a last resort, thank you. There are also 4-ping molex micro-fit 3.0 (such a stupid name for a port, I swear) wires so I can always rewire them but wanted to take the easy, less-hassle route My idea was to use a controller and with a supposed \"adapter\", split the two 4.5A fan ports into four so that I can run two sets of fans in a push-pull configuration. The fans I have are rated at 2.8A so with a fan controller, I can keep that at 4.5A or lower. This way, it can run cooler and also way quieter. Was thinking of something like this:https://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=1775",

      "body": "Yeah, for your purposes I don't see the harm in making the adaptation but they can't Mass produce such a thing because someone will hook it up wrong and burn the whole block down.You can only connect one fan to one port because the two lines that are not black or red are intelligent speed control lines. If you cut them or otherwise corrupt their signal you'll be back to running full speed all the time.Cheers,J",

      "body": "My miner (Cheetah F1) doesn't seem to care if the fans spin or not, it hashes anyway (auto-shutdown at 100C though), so I think I can getaway with 2 fans on a Y adapter on one port since clearly it doesn't give an F about fan speedIf that doesn't work, I'll just use a fan simulator, a Y for one of the PSU cables so I can power the fan controller and go from there. Please correct me if I'm wrong, I'm going on this by hunches. I'm not much of an electrician but I can splice a cable with a ton of black tape as good as the average Joe Thanks again for your input, this will save me weeks of waiting on parts",
