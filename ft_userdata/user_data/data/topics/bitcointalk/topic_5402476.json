  "content": "QuoteThe World Bank on Tuesday slashed its global growth forecast and warned that many countries could fall into recession as the economy slips into a period of stagflation reminiscent of the 1970s.Global economic expansion is expected to drop to 2.9% this year from 5.7% in 2021 — 1.2 percentage points lower than the 4.1% predicted in January, the Washington-based bank said in its latest Global Economic Prospects report.Growth is expected to then hover around that level through 2023 to 2024 while inflation remains above target in most economies, the report said, pointing to stagflation risks.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resultant surge in commodity prices have compounded existing Covid pandemic-induced damage to the global economy, which the World Bank said is now entering what may be “a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation.”“The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions, and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries, recession will be hard to avoid,” World Bank President David Malpass said.Growth in advanced economies is projected to decelerate sharply to 2.6% in 2022 from 5.1% in 2021 before further moderating to 2.2% in 2023, the report said.Expansion in emerging market and developing economies, meanwhile, is projected to fall to 3.4% in 2022 from 6.6% in 2021, well below the annual average of 4.8% from 2011 to 2019.That as inflation continues to climb in both advanced and developing economies, prompting central banks to tighten monetary policy and raise interest rates to curb soaring prices.1970s-style stagflationThe present high-inflation, weak growth environment has drawn parallels with the 1970s, a period of intense stagflation which required steep increases in interest rates in advanced economies and triggered a string of financial crises in emerging market and developing economies.The World Bank’s June report offers what it calls the “first systematic” comparison between the situation now and that of 50 years ago.Clear parallels exist between then and now, it said. Those include supply side disturbances, prospects for weakening growth, and the vulnerabilities emerging economies face with respect to the monetary policy tightening that will be needed to rein in inflation.However, there are now also a number of differences, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar, generally lower oil prices, and broadly strong balance sheets at major financial institutions, which present room for maneuver.To reduce the risks of history repeating itself, the World Bank urged policymakers to coordinate aid for Ukraine, counter the spike in oil and food prices, and set up debt relief for developing economies.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/07/world-bank-cuts-global-growth-outlook-and-warns-of-70s-stagflation.html....More economic doom and gloom. It seems that big economic crisis are like the alien clown from Stephen King's IT. They return every 50 or so years to wreak havoc among the living. After a period of years they may eventually return to hibernation, only to return in another 50 year cycle.I think this is the first article I have seen which considered the possibility of the crisis being a global one. This could parallel the crisis of 2008, the falllout of which provided motivation for Satoshi Nakamoto to create bitcoin. While the harsh realities of economic crisis are terrible to behold. Perhaps we will witness similar trends where people invent and create new platforms like bitcoin in an effort to buck the trend and give people new options and tools to help them stave off the next economic crisis down the line. There could be a positive aspect to it which will provide opportunities to early adopters, the way that BTC did.The recent TV series Mr Robot proposed deleting all bank records in an electronic attack in order to force a financial system reset which enabled some degree of debt forgiveness. While this approach may not be feasible, I hope someone has a good idea for how to prevent future economic tragedy that they can implement to better society.",

There's a good chance that if we see one it won't last as long as one preciously mightve due to greater global connectivity (through systems like the Internet) and the evident rise of future technology that's still being produced and conceptualised and being adopted where it's useful. Stagflation in the past had been worsened by not having these kinds of offerings at the time (eg the 1850s [Europe] 1870s [US]).",

Recession is inevitable, we are forced to experience this, the moment the world shut down because of the pandemic and we are still on that situation the worst is yet to come most probably. I just hope for a world piece and unity, hoping that no more wars because many can’t handle that anymore.",

Which some critics claim does not exhibit true economic growth in the form of jobs, business and wages.",

I believe that the problem of our world is NOT that we don't have enough global economic growth. We have plenty of wealth as a planet, but the way it's distributed is incredibly uneven. First we have inequality within one country which can reach very unreasonable levels. It's one thing that one person lives in a 1-bedroom small flat while another lives in a luxurious 3-room flat, but it's another thing when there are homeless people while there are also people who have literally dozens of flats that they own. Then there's inequality between countries, where we have countries struggling with very high poverty rates and famine situations, and countries where obesity is among top problems and an average person throws away a significant amount of their food. Even if global economy enters recession but distribution practices change to make life a little more reasonable and ensure minimum things like nobody dying from hunger and everyone having at least some place to live in, that would be a huge success and prosperity. So I think we're focusing on the wrong things.",

It's not going to be of any help in the long run because the money is too much, and it may have spread worldwide, causing it to be a global aspect.Now that people have received stimulus packages to save themselves, it has become stagnant, hence the stagflation that economists use. There's no more reason to use or operate the business because some industries have little to no movement. Hence the crisis.I'm not sure what approach the people should have when it comes to stuff like this, but it's essential to preserve the value of your money and have a minor effect on the devaluing of money.",

Id say we are doing pretty decent right now compared to last year but getting 2.9% growth is still something though. Probably something to do with the world economic is pretty stable right now after recovering from all those pandemic effect",

The prices of oil and gas and related products are hitting all time highs. COVID has been ravaging the world for years now. There's a war in Europe going on for months now and with no end in sight. Inflation has gone through the roof. All prices are increasing no end. So I guess a little growth is better than no growth at all, at least at this point in time.",

While this approach may not be feasible, I hope someone has a good idea for how to prevent future economic tragedy that they can implement to better society.To be honest, economic tragedy is part of the capitalist societies we live in. On average we face a big crisis every 7-10 years and in fixing the current crisis we usually create the next crisis that will hit us. Just in the last 20 years it was a perfect cycle for the boom and bust philosophy created by the politicians. In 2001/01 we had the Dotcom bubble, the low interest rates afterwards resulted in the 2008 mortgage crisis. Then in 2011/12 we had the European Government debt crisis which again kept the interest rates near 0%. Only the Covid pandemic was a  crisis that didn't fit into that pattern, but helped to keep the interest low for a few more years. It's been now 10 years with ultra low interest rates, facing high inflation was inevitable. As long as we live in an economic system that is based on capitalism I don't think there is much we can change.",

China's onshore credit market will also be in trouble, if the defaults in the property sector continues, which may cause a contagion to other sectors of their economy. It will be very bad for those countries that consume cheap goods manufactured in China. The top consumer which is the United States of America. Ironically, Russia is low in that list.https://www.worldstopexports.com/chinas-top-import-partners/",
