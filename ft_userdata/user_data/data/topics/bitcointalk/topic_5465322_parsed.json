That is why I say, with greater control and security features comes greater responsibilities.If we had ever seen the kind of security measures taken in control of the financial vault, we will understand the reason why we should tightly secure our asset from any invaders from reaping the labour of our asset into their own disposal on a thin air, only if we could also know why securities are employed to safeguard a property or any physical asset then we wouldn't mind if handling of our financial asset would cost us, we can go at any length to secure them because the cost to that is very little to the lost that may set in if we are unable to take enough security measures.",

But still, I do not have words to express my thanks.This will be of great help in the future, and I will try to read these threads. I will also try my best to include some useful topics in the lists if Ratimov will accept them, but of course those will be unique compared to the ones in the encyclopedia.And I totally agreed with your point that with full power comes more responsibility, and that statement suits us best because when I came to know about decentralised systems, I also lost some money due to the wrong selection of blockchain networks, and I realised that now I cannot do anything but be careful next time.Then I also realized that I am the one who is fully responsible for this mess, and I will be punished alone; I cannot blame anyone else. This feeling of realizing mistakes makes one more independent, and this feeling is also very awesome at the same time, even though I have lost funds. The point is that you passed the bank's management systems and avoided handing over your funds to them so that they would manage them for you; instead, you took the responsibility into your own hands. But it is not like we have to develop our own wallets, write codes, or spend a hell of a lot of money too. Instead, we just need a little knowledge of the things we are preparing to do, and boom, we will be OK to go.",

We didn't ask for Satoshi Nakamoto to create bitcoin but we've bought into his vision and principles of decentralization and control of our own money. We are tired of the traditional banking and want to be our own banks. You are so right about this thing. I have also experienced the fear of thoughts that I am the only person who is control of my assets like in term of death I sometimes think what will happen if I die and the assets I have will be abandoned as there is no one in family or friends who have access to my wallets and giving them the access also makes me vulnerable. I am not saying I do not trust my family and friends instead even if I gave them the access then it can be compromised from there side too even if I took care of all measures. At the end, we have to admit that we are responsible for our assets and we do have to be aware of all kinds of attacks either they are ransomware attacks or phishing attacks or anything else. The knowledge is necessary to remain secure in the network. Even if we are using open source platform, we still need to be sure before using them or importing our wallets on them because phishing scams are not top not.

This thread says some companies lost millions of users' assets just because they lost track of their seed phrase or recovery key. I mean what better could be a better example than this to understand how important it becomes to secure your assets on your own? No doubt this might be an exit plan from that company but to emphasize the importance we can assume if we do not take full care and will not follow the norms that we should follow then what outcomes we might have to see?Giving your assets to companies like these is wrong in the first place as you will own the coin only when you will own the key if you lose the key then you also lost the funds too. So keep track of your key and seed phrase and try to increase security by 2FA too. They were holding these assets in a Hardware wallet and lost the recovery key Well if they have a ledger then they might recover it otherwise they can not.",

That's true about clicking links so that the best starts from yourself knowing what you're clicking, what websites you are downloading and what applications and software you download. Because if you're familiar with your browsing activity, there's no amount of anti virus can par with that. On the other hand, even if you've got the best antivirus and you have the latest update but if your browsing activity isn't as safe as what individuals do, that's a useless thing to have so discipline. still.",

We have to learn to be incharge and not give power back to those we're trying to take control from. Been in charge of our finances is empowering and we have to learn to accept that responsibility by been security conscious. Been your own bank isn't that hard but people don't have confidence that they can protect their own wealth and that's why they look for others to take responsibility for them.",
