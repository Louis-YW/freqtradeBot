A virtual block :- what I meant by that is, a block that will accommodate more transactions increasing scalability which will run on a full node operated by the bitcoin.org (developers associated with the whole project) and the virtual block will be associated with its parent block which was mined prior and basically storing off chain this data of the virtual block can be copied by any node if they want, and the transactions will be secured by the miners increasing incentives for them also keeping them motivated.And also the lightening network being added increases the transaction speed.I don’t know if this might be just a problem, or something similar to this concept may spark one of the developers leading to increasing the required scalability.",

This may impact bitcoins price in the future.Just a thought that cannot be over my mind, why not leave the security to the developers.Just in as the picture, bitcoin may slowly come into the union of three sets.As for leaving security to the developers, while it could streamline some aspects, part of Bitcoin’s charm is its decentralized nature. Relying too heavily on developers might shift this balance. It’s a delicate trade-off between control, trust, and security.Personally, I think maintaining the decentralized aspect is crucial for the integrity and trust in Bitcoin. It’s what makes it unique and has been a foundational principle since its inception. Any changes should be approached with caution to preserve these values.Quote from: Oshosondy on April 15, 2024, 10:51:27 AMBitcoin mining hash rate can not be reduced in a way that more miners will quite mining in a way it will affect bitcoin price. If some miners quit, other miners will gain more and there will become a time no miner will want to quit. When bitcoin price was falling in 2022 which was a massive bear market, bitcoin hash rate continued to increase in the year.It’s true that if some miners decide to quit because it becomes less profitable for them (especially after a halving event which reduces the block reward), the remaining miners could benefit from less competition. This might stabilize the situation temporarily as the remaining miners would find it more profitable.However, the overall network security can be impacted if too many miners drop out. Less computational power means potentially more vulnerability to attacks, though Bitcoin’s design and large network size mitigate this risk significantly.The economics of Bitcoin ensure that there is always a balance. The difficulty of mining adjusts to make sure that it remains feasible for enough miners to continue, maintaining the network’s security and functionality. If the cost of mining outweighs the rewards, the network adjusts to bring things back into equilibrium.In essence, it’s a self-balancing system. While some miners may indeed quit, the network is designed to adapt. Over time, as you mentioned, it’s less likely that miners would want to quit en masse because those who remain find it worthwhile to continue.",

Just a thought that cannot be over my mind, why not leave the security to the developers. What you are proposing is abandoning one of the pillars of Bitcoin - decentralization. Instead of it, you are proposing to centralize the mining process to a chosen entity, and introduce some type of virtual blocks which wouldn't require the usual PoW to be mined. The invested energy and hashpower is important to Bitcoin's value. Bitcoin is valuable because it's difficult to mine/produce. If you were to simplify that process, Bitcoin couldn't possibly get more expensive. And what about the mining rewards per block? Would they also be included in your virtual blocks? You would be doubling or tripling the block production.You would have a less congested blockchain, but a more centralized network. No one will agree to it.",

Shifting control towards developers, even if well-intentioned, could compromise the trust and security inherent in the system. Instead, like you said, why not improve upon the scalability solutions already available, like the Lightning Network, which maintain decentralization? It seems like a safer bet for preserving Bitcoin’s core principles while still addressing growth challenges.",
