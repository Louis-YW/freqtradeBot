  "content": "Hi i write this post so hopefully it can be found in search engines by  anyone is thinking to open a Coinsbit account My withdrawal is pending since  6 days 2 times canceled and again tried and its pending for 2 days This Exchange used some trick to fake the daily trading volume so they could rank up at Coingecko and Coinmarketcaps ( there where i foud them ) After i joined for sure the trading volume in that mentioned sites doesnt match the real trading volume in coinsbit as i bought and sold some coins and there was no liquidity  so lost over 50% just for slippage or to find liquiditySo for sure tbey used some trick to fake the trade volume so they could lure victimsI checked the TG group and a lot of others complaing they didnt get the withdrawalsAlso at Trustpilot . It was my fault to not check those 2 before depositing at Coinsbit as i always trusted the data by Ccoingecko and Coinmarketcap.",

The original site is coinsbit.io which does not have a good review on Trustpilot.

I do not think the trading volume is not true, but there service may not be excellent or good the way you want it and that is the reason for reviewing sites. With the revie on Trustpilot, https://www.trustpilot.com/review/coinsbit.io, I will say you should avoid such exchange. Why don't you try exchanges with better trust score, like not less than 9 score on Coingecko: https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchangesQuote from: noorman0 on July 10, 2023, 04:37:41 AMAggregator sites are not sufficiently likely to detect moderated trading volume, and that is not the first reason to conclude that the exchange is good overall so you can easily send assets to them.Trustpilot is a review site which I think is what you are talking about too. If you see good reviews, you may still doubt it and make further research because good reviews can be bought, but if you see poor reviews, believe it and stay away from the sites with poor reviews. I have found most that are rated poor to actually be bad or scam.",

      "body": "OP I checked your profile and it happens that you have been a member here for this long and should know what is obtainable here. Conducting  due diligence before engaging  is one of the basics of this platform. So i was surprised seeing this complaints from you although anything can happen and it is natural that way. AS for coinsbit, they never had a good remarks and review on trust pilot, they are likely to be according to you a scam which is not alright based on the reviews i have read about them.Lastly, Oshosondy was of the opinion that you should have also dropped the url link to the exchange so we cold know if it is the original or fake because most times things of this nature occurs and people would think it is the real organisation not knowing it is a clone of the real organization website thereby causing people to loss funds. He also made recommendation  which i think should guide you to selecting exchange for use.",

You get much more relevant feedbackThere has already been a lot of talk about Coinsbit here, mainly pointing out the omissions and fraudulent ways of doing business. It should always be remembered that it is necessary to do research before using a service.I'll leave some of the threadsCOINSBIT.IO EXCHANGE THREAD BOTS POSTING!!!BEWARE OF SUPER SCAM: P2PB2B claim to be worlds biggest exchange !COINSBIT.IO SCAM EXCHANGE + PONZI SCHEME !!!BEWARE: Coinsbit Scammers Create Their Own Investbox (Yobit style)There are still a lot of individual complaints, but they all point to the same thing.",
