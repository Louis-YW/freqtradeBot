      "body": "Security bug bounty are the reward given to hackers after the code of a software for an application or a platform has been created and have finished work on. These hackers would test for vulnerabilities to see if there is no bug. If there is any bug known to them, they would fixed it. After bug fixed, the software would be available for users. Is that not the work of developers to check for vulnerabilities by all means? Or a site would have to first pay to developers and later pay for hackers for it. I do not know much about that though, but I know that some sites do that too. Despite all the hack I have been hearing about, I have played on many gambling sites, and recently most especially on this forum, the gambling sites are getting more successful in a way they can lay customers money. Even if I do not know much about how security bug bounties is with gambling sites, what that matters is that the gambling sites are getting successful day by day and able to pay their customers and rendering their customers good services. What that matters most is to use a trustworthy gambling sites and you are good.",

The situation is like when you build a website with WordPress and you've been notified that there are vulnerabilities on your site, what will you do? You just wait for the next WordPress security patch and pray it will solve your problem. There's no incentive to fix the white-label product since you buy it and hope it works OOB.If you want to do bug bounty, try to contact the white-label provider or sites that have proprietary code.",

Maybe the casinos are using \"old school\" methods for testing software, or maybe their vulnerability tests are just not as well known. I'm sure there's a ton of people willing to work on bug bounties. But in the end, it really comes down to the casino's incentive. If the casino has a system in place that fixes bugs and closes vulnerabilities quickly, then they likely don't see any reason to offer a bug bounty. Basically, their cost-benefit analysis says that it's not worth the time and effort to offer a bounty program. If they don't have any kind of bug bounty program, it's probably because they don't see much value in having external parties help them make their systems more secure. However, if the casino has a poor security record, then they may be more willing to offer one in order to improve their security profile.",

If I am wrong what gambling project do you think have the most secured system?, peace. As someone already mentioned in an above post, most casino owners do not bother writing their own code from scratch. Why? For the same reason why they do not like it when people start winning big money. Greed, basically. The owners would rather buy some white label code and add some fancy user experience design of their own without changing what runs the games underneath. And from a perspective of cost, its really the smart thing to do. Unless you want to create something which is unique. But why would anyone want a unique casino? Clone copies make the same money.And those clone copies have gotten so advanced and audited all this time that bug bounties do not make much sense. Its just too hard to find a bug in something like that.",

I think the real serious ones have hired a team to continuously monitor the security of their websites because the bigger the website is with a lot of databases and other critical infrastructure the better the cyber security team should be.They the serious gambling platform do this but of course they do it in private and they do not need to disclose this information by making it going public,this is a secret of course between the penetration testers team hired to try the security of the site and offer improvement when found bugs,that is why you don't see it.",

Â There are also some services that offers Bug bounty services but yeah Only FortuneJack put a campaign for bug Bounty and yes they are successful in this task and now their site is running good without any or at least without major bug problems .I also believe that New gambling sites must conduct the same bounty for the betterment of their site in long term , this is also to show how serious is their site and having business not only for profit but for servicing their players.",

I think it might be because gambling websites already have their own security team to deal with and anticipate any vulnerabilities on their website.But I think I've seen one or more casinos write an article about giving prizes to those who can find vulnerabilities on the website.I don't know if the site could find the vulnerability and in the end, the casino site gave the prize.Or maybe if the casino or even someone discovers the vulnerability, they don't make it public.",

If I am wrong what gambling project do you think have the most secured system?, peace. I'm sure that big casinos are doing that thing to test the security of their site from time to time. They're aware that the possibility of getting attacked by hackers is too big so for sure, they're finding ways to test their security, especially those who have experienced hacking before. It's one of the important things that a website is protecting because, without the guarantee of security, they will surely have their reputations ruined.",

Why would they launch a bug bounty when we have no report of casinos getting hacked, you did not mention casinos that were hacked for you to ask why casinos should launch a bug bounty, they are using and subscribing to white label its the Whitelabel casino script maker that should launch a bug bounty and besides there's no need of that because these white labels have their own developers and they are the one hiring hackers to test their site before offering this to casino operators.",

Same to presume that they had already done that earlier or before they do launched up the site in public.Just like on the previous post or response of a member above that there's one i have seen on the past too which is Fortunejack.They do set out huge or significant bounty if ever there are ones who do able to seek out for some holes or exploits.Most of them had already set out those security measures.They do have the staff or the one who do take care when it comes to security.This is why we dont really see bug bounties.",

If I am wrong what gambling project do you think have the most secured system?, peace. I think it's a bit of a novelty and consequence of them relying on such an anonymous form of currency. If a \"whitehat\" hacker really wants to get a reward for finding a bug, contacting the support team and asking to speak to someone involved with security might illicit the same sort of response as any bug bounty page. On the flip side, it might be more apt for someone who wants to help to seize the funds directly via the exploit because they could be taken by a criminal who would not be so willing to return them at any point. We never hear about hacking activity taking place, as it would ruin such a site but it does seem like a bug bounty program would be sensible to offer.",
