I failed to accumulate in the last dip. Personally, I believe we all can't buy during the bottom, the reason is we don't know exactly the bottom range. So this is a lesson that doesn't invest all in dip, then you may miss the real dip.",

Latest case happens to LUNA, when Luna down, people trying to buy, they are thinking if LUNA price will be back soon. In the end, they are loss a lot of money.

This make some to borrow money to invest which can be risky.While borrowing money to invest in crypto is somewhat of a 'crime' nobody should think of, if you are accumulating Bitcoin in this dip (of course with your own money), you are doing absolutely nothing wrong, whether you are doing it out of fear of missing out or whatever, the only thing to note is that you should never expect quick returns, or hope to jump on sudden wealth, that is not going to happen, grow a Bitcoin porfolio, it doesn't matter the pace at which you do it, you are actually not supposed to even go in all at once, that would be investing more than you can afford to lose. DCA works perfectly, you can buy slowly but surely and hodl for the long term.Quote from: masulum on May 30, 2022, 06:48:03 PMLatest case happens to LUNA, when Luna down, people trying to buy, they are thinking if LUNA price will be back soon. In the end, they are loss a lot of money. Luna has been in the news for a couple of weeks now (for obvious reasons), what happened to Luna can happen to any altcoin/shitcoin, and that is what investors fail to understand, sooner rather than later another altcoin is going to come on scene, create some hype while investors start putting their money there, after a while it crashes just like Luna did, rinse and repeat; investors need to understand that the problem isn't with Luna, but it is that most altcoins have no actual utility, and as such you can't expect them not to dump.",

It's quite possible that the market could suddenly reverse and you will be buying Bitcoin for an increasingly higher price, thus having less coins than if you invested with more money earlier. Both DCA and lump sum investing have their own merits, but what's really important is waiting - not selling BTC if you are at a loss, not basing your decisions on media hype and narratives - simply wait for years, and take profits during bull markets if you want to spend your money.",

I would never try to do stuff like that in high-risky altcoins I think the smart money here is investing in a cryptocurrency that has long-term potential , and which is likely to maintain that potential with minimal risk of permanent loss. I believe Bitcoin is such an opportunity, and expect it to attract an influx of smart investors who, for once, are not expecting a quick return. I think DCA is good strategy because it doesn't require big capital but can still provide a fantastic return if you are patient.",

None of us is capable to predict that its already the dippest price, so this is the reason why we should keep on buying in times of dip. And i think there won't be losses for that as long as you hodl them after buying, but if you are planning to sell them after short term hodling, that will certainly bring losses on you because its hard for the coins to recover again once their prices stay in dips. However, if you do DCA, you will never be in a loss, instead you always have the chance to buy just in every price drops.",

One of the main points of doing DCA is that you have no idea what the markets will do hence you're putting money in regardless of price and market sentiment. For me, that is the safest strategy to use because you are only giving yourself more opportunities to earn especially if its bitcoin as you  never miss any chance to buy in every price decline. And this is also a smart move if you have low budget funds as you don't want to buy all in but certainly just buy whenever the price of the coins keeps on dipping. So definitely buying with DCA is always an advantage regardless of how the market we'll be in the next possible days.",
