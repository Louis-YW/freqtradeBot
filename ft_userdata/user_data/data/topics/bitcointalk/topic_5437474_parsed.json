Assuming their picks are actually taken from 1xbet lines, you'd really really struggle to find comparable lines on other sportsbooks that aren't 1xbet clones.That said, I also don't see the point in this thread. Showing that they're beatable doesn't accomplish anything new.",

And maybe the OP is a part of their team?And also encourage people to play on them but yeah it doesn't make sense even if the OP's picks are true and we can win our bets because like I said earlier, our withdrawals won't still be processed. If there is one way to stop them then that will be to report them on the higher government authorities so that these scammy betting platform will be taken down for good.",

Do they tell you the platform needs it? I see the gimmicks involved. So you would be giving out odds making members to be fast in registering and depositing funds ten after that we start another round of complaint to resolve without any headway from your 1xbit casino. I would advise you to stop all these play and be realistic with your time as no one here would think of Identifying with 1xbit casino. Already, the casino is having a tag and all her promoters are also flagged so anybody getting involved with them automatically gets it too and pray you do not fkget flagged too.",
