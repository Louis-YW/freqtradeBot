  "content": "This an animated chart created with data from Rikafip post [CHARTS] Brief monthly overview of the local boards activity.I scraped the data from each chart and added here in this new animated chart, as suggested by dkbit98 Â and Rikafip.We can see the evolution of each local board activity since 2020.https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/12312077/I hope you guys enjoy. I am open for suggestions.I was thinking about adding flags on each board, but I felt this very complicated as some languages/board might be shared along many different countries.",

(Do you know the reason?)And the most interesting board, Russian from Jun 2021 to July 2021. Why did this board have only a few posts in this period, disappearing from the top 18?",

Some time ago I was curious to see what were the numbers back in those early days and from what I saw, Russian was always the most active local board. At the height of the ICO craze in the late 2017-early 2018 Russian board was regularly going over 150-200k which is insane number compared to situation now. Big part of that was probably bounty spam, but number was impressive nevertheless.Quote from: yhiaali3 on January 01, 2023, 07:42:33 PMThrough the animated chart, I see very little activity in some local boards. I don't know why. Is it because Crypto is not widespread in these countries, or is it because members from these countries write in English most of the time?If I have to take a guess, its probably more about people from those countries probably using some other mean of communication rather than anything else.

This is why many members do not write in their local language.That's probably a factor too, but I never really understood that behavior. I was in a campaign that didn't count count posts in local boards for a year and a half and it never crossed my mind that I should write there less, or to avoid my local board all together.",

I'm sure if we would go back to 2018 / 2019, Indonesia and Pilipinas sections would be much stronger as activities dropped off a bit there but formerly less active boards like Portuguese and the Italian section are looking stronger right now. It's also interesting to see our Nigerian board as a TOP 10 local section already, showing once again that it was overdue to give a local board to our Nigerian members. Pakistan is also looking strong currently on rank 12.

      "body": "Good work @bitmover, with this animated chart, of course, it will be very easy for us to see how the evolution of posts on each local board. But I have a little question about this.Do we get important points from the chart you made? I see that the animated chart that you made was taken from data for 2020 to November 2022, besides that the data also doesn't accumulate from every month data.We (at Indonesia's local board) have our own topic for monthly charts which are regularly updated, besides that, we also evaluate and discuss there. Therefore, I think that's better to have this animated chart made for quarterly, or yearly. So, someone from 1 local board can bring it to their local board and get points from the quarterly or yearly data (for local board evaluation purposes to make it more good). And it would be better if we have quarterly or yearly data accumulated from each month.Example:January = 200 posts | February = 230 posts | March = 100 postsSo, the result for the Q1 data is 530 postsNote: I know that what I'm saying can be done even without this animated chart, but it would be better with animated charts. This is just a little suggestion, accepted or not it's @OP's right.",
