  "content": "Yeah, I could be a curious cracky dude that is concerned about my endivoirs surroundings.Every Bitcoin investors has been craving for the pro-incomes seasons of the bull-runs to gaining more Bitcoin in the Bitcoin markets and same time, everyone has been preaching about \"hodling Bitcoin for a long time and never them nomatter what\".If I am not mistaken, I learnt that the bull-runs is approved activated by the ETF on the intervals of 4 years gaps then follows the bear-runs and the halving episodes.So I was wondering if those who could hodl with their Bitcoins as much as during the bull-runs still sells their coins? if not all atleast some fractions to give realistic accountable expenses benefits as the potentials of Bitcoin is to offer solutions to financial challenges as an asset it is before the market values is depressive again at the season of the halving and bear-runs where the value of the Bitcoin is depreciated.But if anyone who didn't sell after much accumulations at the bull run season of appreciation and then comes the halving and the bear runs season of depreciations, I would take the moment as a s system where incomes are decades while hoping hoping to reach same height again with the probabilities of going higher.My question is. What is your concious measures steps after catching up with the Bitcoin markets bull-run While halving and bear-run approaches?",

      "body": "There are two things which cannot be ignored nor skipped. The first one is Bitcoin bull season wherein Bitcoin definitely go bonkers atleast once in every 4 years post halving and we have bear market and sometimes market is sideways between two bull runs. We should be using bear market to accumulate and bull run to sell. Some will say hodl for long but there was a time when Bitcoin was much more lesser and this rule applies only to them now you cannot enter market during peak and hodl because it would take years if it starts falling apart. My strategy would be enter during bear market and then hodl till bull run to sell off.",

They acquire their needed BTC when there's blood in the market while taking profit when there's a bull run market.You don't invest when there's a rally if you want to make a good profit.Â Quote from: AVE5 on December 12, 2023, 06:16:41 PMand same time, everyone has been preaching about \"hodling Bitcoin for a long time and never them nomatter what\".If I am not mistaken, I learnt that the bull-runs is approved activated by the ETF on the intervals of 4 years gaps then follows the bear-runs and the halving episodes.The Bullrun market is not about the ETF approval, it was triggered by the 4-year cycle after it is a market correction, the bear/blood market, and the bull market.Quote from: AVE5 on December 12, 2023, 06:16:41 PMSo I was wondering if those who could hodl with their Bitcoins as much as during the bull-runs still sells their coins? if not all atleast some fractions to give realistic accountable expenses benefits as the potentials of Bitcoin is to offer solutions to financial challenges as an asset it is before the market values is depressive again at the season of the halving and bear-runs where the value of the Bitcoin is depreciated.There are two types of crypto investment we have long and short-term. The long term is never to sell even when the market receives a new ATH price while the short investment is meant for taking profit and doing the things you pointed out.",

And take note that they're just still applications for now, take a look back on the past bull runs, there were some attempts but they didn't really counted as a factor.Quote from: AVE5 on December 12, 2023, 06:16:41 PMSo I was wondering if those who could hodl with their Bitcoins as much as during the bull-runs still sells their coins? Yup, we do sell but we also buy whenever the price pulls back and becomes cheaper again. This is the normal strategy of the many here that we sell at the top or most likely at a price more than our investment.And we wait until the price goes down again.",
