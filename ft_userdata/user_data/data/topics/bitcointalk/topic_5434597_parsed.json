  "content": "What a SAD FUCKEN DAY this isâ€¦but before I startâ€¦I want to thank Yodasred Rocket for making us aware of this.Â  Â  Â  Now back to business. To say I shockedâ€¦dismayedâ€¦depressed and totally fucken pissed off is understating how I feel.Â  Â  To Yoggâ€¦..What have you done? Eh? For years I had to deal with your anticsâ€¦..and now this? What are you gonna blame it on? Your dog ate your fucken homework busllshit? You have destroyed not only yourself but MANY physical coin makers out there. Who will ever be trusted now? You will now be a part of the scam list for eternity where you belong. You always came back and sweet talked your way thru it all and we believed you and gave you chance after chance manâ€¦your soo fucked up.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â You were part of the inner circleâ€¦so your con was especially hurtful as I would never have seen this coming in a million year! We had our falling apart but I figured it was a mental illness thing and forgave you and moved on. I even lent you $600 via PAYPAL while I was at the airport visiting my sick father in Europe to show you what a friend I was and that a friend in need is a friend indeed.Â  As I have done MANY times in the past. And how do you thank me? Eh?Â  No good deed ever goes unpunished and you take the cake. You crawl back in that little cave of yours like the scum that you are.Â  Â Â  Â  Â  You have crossed the Rubicon and there is no turning backâ€¦.children blame othersâ€¦men are accountable for their actionsâ€¦but not you. Itâ€™s a shame as I was one of your biggest customers and supporters. Blahâ€¦I am sick to my stomach really. Â  Â  You have no shameâ€¦.Karma will be waiting for people like you. And I am sure we shall meet someday in real lifeâ€¦the world is a very small place. I look forward for that dayâ€¦and then you can scam me in personâ€¦belittle me and threaten me and we shall see who is the better man.Â  Â  Â Now back to businessâ€¦.I own approx 90 of these cardsâ€¦..I was the buyer of all the number 1 and 2 from each set.Â  I sent hours peeling and sweepingâ€¦and this is what I foundâ€¦.Â I own a proof set of the Halvingâ€¦..yogg stoleÂ  0.00625 from each cardÂ I own two golden halving setsâ€¦one set I was able to sweep the other stolenâ€¦yogg stole 0.00625 from each cardÂ I own one silver set of halving cards..Yogg stole 0.00625 from each cardI own a copper set of halving carsâ€¦never loadedâ€¦Yogg owes me 0.00625 for each card.So he LIED when he told Owlz that only the silvers were affected! HE also stole the raffle which thankfully I am not a part of.Â  I peeled and swept most of the 90 cards that were supposed to be loaded and was able to get my BTC in the thousands of dollars.Â  I checked the Time lock Crypto BONDS and they are intact. For anyone who wants to find if they have been compromisedâ€¦please send the the raw transaction( large qr code) and I can find out for you!Below are pics of proof for all the halving cards. I also am posting a pic of the stackes of cards I have.Â  Sad mother fucken day! SO fucken sad!Â  Â  SO I am owedâ€¦ 0.05BTC for my halving setsâ€¦Loss of thousands for ruining my collection and also $600 Paypal. Also a cards ordered from September!!",

I think yog doesn't care about his reputation as already has a lot of negative trust in his/her profile. And that might be a reason to steal funds. Anyway, why you are not creating scam accusations,s and why you are not creating a flag? I think it is time to create scam accusations as well as flags.",

He is one of the most trusted guys in this forum and he just abandoned that kind of trust by sweeping this collection. The value of this collection surely dropped and somehow worthless. The stack of those card are insane and I'm the one who are getting the hate of seeing it peeled and touched. Surely, The whole industry in crypto collecting is now tarnished and I don't know what kind of future we can expect from it given that one of the biggest collectables is now in a dire situation after the old project leader stole sweeped the funds.",

All the trust and friendships were ruined just because of the money that he can swipe on the loaded card.How much total premiums were lost on this scam? I believe you only mentioned the value of the Bitcoin loaded on the cards itself but AFAIK the premium of these cards especially the high rarity is very expensive for the materials it was used. I'm willing to purchase some of the cards and use them as gifts for my non-crypto friend. PM me the price if you are interested in my offer. Sorry for your loss Krogoth!Yes, it is extremely unfortunate when someone who was once reputable in the community turns to scamming and deceit. The loss of trust and relationships can be devastating, especially in the tightly-knit community of crypto enthusiasts.It's a sad situation, but hopefully, some good can come out of it through your thoughtful gesture.",
