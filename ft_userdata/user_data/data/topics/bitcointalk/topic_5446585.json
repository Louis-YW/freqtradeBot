  "content": "This world is inhabited by many religious adherents who do not look at skin color. The beauty of the world when all believers from various backgrounds and from various skin colors respect and protect each other and share with each other will find love.Currently Muslims are fulfilling an obligation to fast in Ramadan in ways that may vary from one country to another.How happy it would be if all of us from all over the world who were involved in Bitcoin activity were willing to campaign or socialize a form of love at a moment like this.If I personally give a small amount of Bitcoin which I convert into fiat (26 Maret 2023) and give it to a mosque as provisions for breaking the fast together, there may be other religious leaders with their congregations who will provide provisions by distributing them to residents crossing the main road as shown in this picture.There is no intention to force, but what I do is a form of love from someone who loves Bitcoin to them through Bitcoin. If there are friends who are willing to carry out this form of activity or in their own way, the documentation can be shared here. If this is during the Ramadan Kareem moment, we can also do it at other moments full of love on other occasions.*If in the picture there are similarities in places, people and designs that are purely the same, it is not an intentional element.",

Bitcoin is haram for Muslims even though you're use it for good, I pretty aware there's a discussion if Bitcoin could be halal, depends on your perspective. But most people still think Bitcoin is haram and they will refuse any money or gift if it's related with Bitcoin.",

You are simply helping people with Fiat nothing more, it only makes sense if those you are helping are accepting Bitcoin from you directly, I will even have more interest in this because it's not just about the \"helping\" part but you are also promoting Bitcoin. Even if they don't have time to do research about what Bitcoin is, you have simply created a chance of curiosity in the minds of the receivers, they can ask later what Bitcoin is all about.But I get you, how will they even sell their Bitcoin for Fiat when they don't know what it is all about, but another thing is they do have children at home, and educated children will dig into the curiosity more, wanting to know how to turn Bitcoin into money.Anyway, you did what you could, Bless You.",

I mean the time of Ramadan is a time to reflect, commune and also give good gifts and I think the Op's intentions are good.  If you look at this from a Sharia legal point of view, crypto and in this case Bitcoin can be a permissible gift since there's no specific prohibition for issuance and transaction embedded in the Quran. So, it could still be a worthy gift, even if it were converted to fiat.",

The crowd needs the entire information that will yield profits into their pockets with full confidence of standing firmly. Donating bitcoin to the charity organizations for proper confirmation of growth, would strive further the solid earnings of the project. Bitcoin is very important to traders because it's a hugh benefits to them.

Moreover, it only takes only someone with a good health to sacrifice for the benefit of others just like you intend doing. But from the look of the envelope, it creates no impart about Bitcoin, because whoever receives it will only see it as an ordinary fiat, of which I guess I think it would have been more better had you inscribe a written note on the envelope like this... \"Donated from my profit made in Bitcoin\"",
