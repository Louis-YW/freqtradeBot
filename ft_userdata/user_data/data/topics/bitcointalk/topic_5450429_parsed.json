  "content": "The referees are an integral part of any game I know this but tonight happened something unique and very strange,Southampton lost my bet because of VAR as I had both teams to score,the same with Athletic Bilbao as I had it both teams to score and in both cases the referees impacted the game,somewhat more in La Liga in Spain but I had really nice tickets with many other games that were lost only because of the referees wrong decisions regarding me as I saw the game and I think you cannot disallow 2 goals when the cases were to say the least doubtful.Should UEFA do something about the referees,these guys have everything in their hand and can make the game go any result and I will say again that famous saying from a local coach where I live as he were leading the first place and lost against last place at home,in the end of the game he said explicitly (With this referee even Brazil could not win tonight)?",

      "body": "We know that after the implementation of VAR many things have changed in football matches because in one match we can see that more than one goal has been disallowed after a VAR review, but sometimes that can benefit us as bettors but sometimes it can be more detrimental.Did not watch the match because there were several matches taking place at the same time, so watching the Everton vs Newcastle match and changing it to Tottenham vs Man United, and the Everton vs Newcastle match also seemed to have a goal disallowed.I don't think UEFA/FIFA will make any changes regarding the referees and also the decisions they take are assisted by technology so even an inch difference can result in a goal being disallowed, which has not happened before because the line judge will only raise the flag if the difference is big enough but with technology has all become so different, and this is not only in football in tennis it also happens and even players also protest even though the video already shows the ball coming out only a few millimeters.",

      "body": "at least in la liga there are few cases in which the referees make questionable decisions that result in losses for a certain team in a game, watch the portuguese league games you will see how the referees can get to be annoying and have a bad performance, even with var technology in the Portuguese league, var is blind when they are weak teams, and in strong team games, var works very well in favor of the strong team and destroys the weak teams, I like how the referees of the premier league, serie A and Bundesliga and Ligue1 behave, they do a good job, even in La Liga there are few cases of mistakes made with the referee.now about the technology of var, VAR comes into play when there is controversy in a bid, and there are more than two people to watch the video so it is difficult for them to make a wrong decision, in my opinion var is very well, the problem is still there in referees who have given fouls and red cards without a very valid reason and this has happened mainly in the Portuguese league. as I don't see a problem with var, I'm of the opinion that var should be maintained and more technologies should be created that allow for a fairer game, before referees give red cards, it had to be mandatory that they consult var first and only after that could decide whether or not to give the red card",

And a technology is as good as people that use it. No one can blame VAR for the wrong decision. The sole blame is on a referee. I also agree with people that says that an offside is an offside, no matter if it's by 1 centimeter or 1 meter. If a referee could decide that a player was in small offside and that did not affect the game, then we don't need VAR after all.Just to be clear, I didn't watch the games that OP is talking about. I'm discussing the use of VAR in sport in general.",

For those who understand that top sport is first of all business, and only then entertainment, nothing will be strange - because they say that the ball is round and unpredictable, just as the referee's decisions are sometimes a bit strange.",

And a technology is as good as people that use it. No one can blame VAR for the wrong decision. The sole blame is on a referee.Usually the VAR referees quickly inform the on-field referee if they have any situations they need to review or if they can let the referee's interpretation stand.But I still notice that there are still controversial situations, such as the intention of a player, or ball in hand / hand on ball, it is very difficult to make this decision and get it right, even with cameras and more referees watching the match.Quote from: Lucius on April 28, 2023, 10:58:24 AMLet's be realistic and understand that football in Europe but also in the whole world is a top business in which billions of dollars are turned over every year, and where there is money there is also corruption. For those who followed the FIFA case (great documentary FIFA Uncovered), they could see how dirty it is, and what is happening at the lower levels (national championships) is even worse.I also watched this documentary, it is revolting that people who would have absolutely nothing to do with soccer, could be the owners of confederations or national teams.And yes, it is a business, and it is also very important to take into consideration that the soccer referee would be a weak link because the average amount they pay for a referee is not much. Probably an average soccer player earns in 1 month what the referee will not earn in 1 whole year.This is not an excuse or a reason, but it is a fact that they need to rethink. But it all gets harder if you consider that FIFA itself has done and does MANY things wrong.A few days ago I saw a really cool chart where it had the average payouts for each league, now I couldn't find it, but I did a brief search and found this chart, just to illustrate a bit:Source",

When we look at the 2018 world championships in Russia, where the main character was the Argentinian who refereed the first match and the final (weird, isn't it?), and no one had heard of him before that. The final in which he did everything for the French to become champions was a steal in front of the eyes of the whole world.Four years later, we all knew that Argentina would be the champion, and after three disallowed goals in the match against SA, there was no VAR for the Argentines until the end of the championship - not a single disputed event was checked. After all, I am surprised that the majority still think that sport is still sport, and not a rigged game in which luck is the smallest factor and money is the biggest.",

But let's be real, making split-second decisions under intense pressure is no easy task. That's why we have VAR technology to assist referees in making the right call. Now, imagine if the shoe were on the other foot. What if you had bet on there being fewer than two goals and the referee let them slide despite an offside position? How would that make you feel? I get that you had a stake in this, but it's important to consider all perspectives, not just your own.",

Since VAR was introduced, there are no more diving moments for players in the penalty box, this is one of the advantages for the referee, besides that offside cases are also more effective and VAR currently only takes a few seconds to find out when a player is caught offside or not. I think VAR has contributed quite a bit at the moment in football matches, especially when decisions are made quite quickly at this time and there are no long pauses in a football match.",

Well, this is not just in FIFA/EUFA, its also happening in other sports, only if there’s a big penalty for every missed calls, referees should held accountable for that.
