      "body": "Initially, I was perplexed as to why there was a bear here when the bull was in Maui. However, after reading through the thread, I came to understand the situation better. It's encouraging to witness someone actively promoting and selling Bitcoin Bull publicly. This will likely entice current users to make a purchase while also piquing the curiosity of others. Consequently, this may lead to the attraction of new Bitcoin users, which is a positive development.",

That bull looks great, hope I can get one online. It would be a cool to see that bull in my desk.",

First time I've ever personally experienced someone saying they take Bitcoin for payment (it was just for the tip, but still cool).Ironically, there's an Apple Pay sticker on the window but no Bitcoin Accepted Here sign. As to the bull, it reminds me of a similar (but somewhat bigger) statue at the Bitcoin conference 2022 in Miami.",

      "body": "That bull should work as a symbol to restore the faith of holders that think the bull market will come soon! Aside from that I believe that the art piece was crafted very well and it really makes the message clear for the audience. Such positive things can really be helpful for the investors who have been hodling their bitcoins since last time high of $60k above.I think we should appreciate such art pieces that are somewhat related to our crypto-community. The mare appreciation would give the boost in the performance of those artists who are also working for the benefit of the community. Such artists are doing their best to reach their way toward those museums and that requires so much efforts. I'm very amazed by the art piece and I really admire the artists!",

It just means that whoever owns that place is definitely related and a Bitcoin enthusiast.That's also a good factor for awareness in the communities there that there is somehow a Bitcoin community in that area, proving that Bitcoin is spreading in different parts of the world.",

As a result, some influences believe Bitcoin's next all-time high will be even better than what we've seen previously. Many people think influencers just say whatever they feel like.The truth is these predictions are based on the adoption rate of bitcoin, which increases every year, and the higher the adoption rate, the stronger the next bull market will be. I have a very good feeling about the future.",
