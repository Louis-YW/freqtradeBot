  "content": "So around a month ago Binance's payment partner suddenly completely cut the exchange and its users off. Today However Binance announced that they integrated with a new payment partner and they platform would be rolling out EUR SEPA deposits to European users imminently. So if you're a binance.com user this should make using the exchange easier again. It will once again be possible to cash out directly to your bank account or deposit FIAT money to buy crypto directly from binance.com. Also using the exchange's debit card once again becomes much easier. Hopefully this time Binance.com's payment partner can last in offering this service to European customers. Note to those reading: binance.com is a different entity from Binance's partner that serve's U.S. customers (binance.us).",

But sadly when PaySafe cut binance off EUR markets imminently became unavailable as well as being unable to deposit or withdraw Euros. Binance having a new FIAT payments partner means access to EUR markets as well as deposits and withdrawals for European customers once again. As of the debit card, it was actually Visa and Mastercard that cut binance off. I'm sure Binance would have been perfectly happy to continue working with them but with such a persistent duopoly on the field of debit cards it'll be hard to find a replacement for this system. So indeed issuance of new cards remains unaccesible but in the meantime existing users of the binance debit card could use it once again with EUR.",

People are getting access to EUR deposit information and they will see an IBAN which can easily be linked to a bank. Perhaps Binance's ne partner is using a payment seevice provider that will be utilizing another bank's IBANs, but still with some sleuthing it would be discovered eventually. Perhaps it would be as easy as looking at the banking details, I just haven't been given access yet. As of why P2P wouldn't work, well... It's pretty simple to understand why. With Binance P2P you can pay someone to buy your crypto (or sell crypto to you) with alternstive payment methods. But without a FIAT payment partner Binance has no legal avenue to accept FIAT funds in any way. So instead of creating a supply vaccum of useless EUR deposited in the exchange they completely disabled EUR markets for the regions affected. The alternative would be Binance going rogue and accepting payment methods to accept EUR that are not regulated. But Binance wants to do things at scale and that wouldn't work for its users in Europe who are KYC'd anyway.",

In fact, of someone wants to do fraud they could do it equally at Bitstsmp and Kraken as they could in Binance. Is it really about regulators being too lazy, is it about them not making the rules clear enough to be followed, or is it on the exchange side who thinks the rules are not meant to be the way regulators have made them to be, or are they thinking they can pass some of those rules and set up their own rules, seeing that as something unnecessary for the progress? What I think is the reason why the regulators come after them with some binding rules given different explanations to what they already have. This could be as a result of the exchanges always taking too much advantage of any little licence that they have been given; they make things appear as if they are always right, exploiting citizens, and launching new services without proper approval on things that might require them to request permission before providing such service to their citizens. If exchanges and regulatory authorities can have one understanding language, I believe there will be a little favourable service that we can experience from them.",

If users wanted to do P2P transactions there already exist a ton of exchangers. P2P in Binance was in large popular among those that were seeking a funding method to access the more advanced services of the exchange.
