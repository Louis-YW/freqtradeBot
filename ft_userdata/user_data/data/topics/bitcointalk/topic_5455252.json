Back in the day, Bounty campaigns used to a thing with both the projects and bounty campaigners mutual benefiting and then came the cheats, bots and spammersLately it just seems completely pointless.On the other hand, signature campaigns (bitcoin paying) have been doing quite well in the forum. I am talking about Bitcoin projects like crypto casinos, Bitcoin Mixers, Exchanges etc. as they attract quality and high rankling users and not spammers and account farmers. If your target is outside the forum, you will have more creative to reach your audience.",

Likewise with the participants who are filled with great and qualified and most influential people in this forum, and I don't know much about campaign prizes in detail. But the truth is that some of the bounty campaigns I've been involved in have turned up nothing, and only a small percentage of them were profitable at the time.and signature campaigns are income and work that I can do regularly for a weekly paycheck, and I think of it as work that I have to do really well. And this is just my opinion, but both of them are involved in it and what stands out the most is the signature campaign rule that we have to work well, be very careful, and also be able to improve quality.",

Whichever will pay (more).In recent years, people will prefer signature campaign since it usually pays on time and therefore less risk for the participant. I still remember gathering all the stakes and getting pennies at the end of the bounty campaign. A lot of my article bounty also got plagiarized and received less stake. Hence, it's not worth it from the participant's point of view.If you are serious about your project and have the required capital, BTC paying signature campaign is the way to go.",

Trust in the sense that which of the two would attract high ranking members to your project. For a long time, the bounty has been flooded by scam and unfulfilled promises which has put more user off from the section and I don't know what kind of beautiful package that you will put out on the bounty section that will attract reputable users on the btc paying campaign to bounty. So the trust for bounty is in question but if you use the signature campaign, you are certain to get the best publicity that will expose your project more.The second point to note is where do you get trusted managers in the forum? It is with the signature campaign you get that. The managers do due diligence to ensure they run projects that won't disappoint them especially when it comes to the other end of fulfilling btc payment to participants in the project.",

We trust your expertise, and we want our marketing efforts to align with your preferences and expectations.In my understand a bounty campaign and a signature campaign are not really different things. A signature campaign is just a form of a bounty campaign because you can also do campaigns on twitter, facebook, telegram or wherever you want. That being said if a project is offering multiple campaigns, then the signature campaign here in this forum is usually the one that gives the highest rewards per user because telegram bounties are usually flooded with thousands of participants and on twitter it is similar.A signature campaign is more work for the participants and should have limited spots in my opinion.Also you would need to make sure that the bounty is really attractive to participants. Either you are offering USDT, USDC or BTC as a reward or you make sure that you own token will be worth something when the participants are getting their tokens.",

We trust your expertise, and we want our marketing efforts to align with your preferences and expectations.Signature campaign is only in Bitcointalk. It is the best one if you want to advertise the project here by hiring best posters to work for you. Best posters will want to be paid for their works, with high pay rate. They are keen on payment methods like Bitcoin or stable coins like USDT or BUSD.If you want to advertise your project on more channels like Facebook, Twitter, Discord, Telegram, Linkedin, Youtube, bounties will be your best choice. In bounty, you can include a signature campaign too.Bounties have many participants are bounty hunters, farm accounts and you can not have quality works from them. It is biggest disadvantage with bounties and your team must think about this big minus. If you hire them to work, you must pay them at the end and should not run away like \"we are disappointed with your works so you won't receive any payment\". It will cause something bad on your project reputation.",

The contribution and communication as well as the support of users to your project is more, I think it is not difficult to approach it in the bounty environment, but it is also necessary to put it back in the position of bountyhunters, many projects with bad behavior created to attract supporters and their failure to meet their initial promises has also turned them into enemies of the community, if your project is really strong enough then the campaigns marketing will be strongly supported by people and vice versa.

And spamming in the telegram is a sure way for me not to get interested. Fake onversations that are transparent ads are annoying as well.You can just use requirements like changing a profile pic and background pic and some link to description etc. Less invasive is more appealing form of advertisement.",
