  "content": "Hearing about Bitcoin ATM machines in advanced countries makes me think it's the best and cheapest way to deposit and send crypto, especially for those who know little about crypto and don't want their identity revealed when buying it.My cousin over in the U.S. wants to send me a few dollars from the US down here.I suggested she buy cryptocurrency and send it over because the exchange rate is higher when I receive it in cryptocurrency rather than a direct bank deposit (CBN). She decided to use the ATM to deposit Bitcoin because it was closer to her and easier to use—no identity verification was required.I just went through the receipts today and realized the machine price rate is far different from the real market price of 30,130 USD per bitcoin.Out of the $1,000 deposited in cashBTC worth $7,000 was only deposited to the provided address.The same thing happened with 1,800 dollars' worth of bitcoin, and only 1377 dollars' worth of bitcoin was received at the address.People's necks are being cut by these machines.If this is how it's normally charged.. then I can't advise anyone to use ATMs to deposit bitcoin but rather buy a Bitcoin crypto card from Walmart shops.",

Is it a legit ATM?Did you check its location on Coinatmradar?Bitcoin ATMs have different exchange fees that usually are between 9% and 12% in average. Unfortunately, there are Bitcoin ATMs charge you higher fees that can be around 20% or higher.Those companies must have license to open those Bitcoin ATMs and they need to spend cost for security, operation, maintenance. It makes sense to see they charge high fee. I see Bitcoin ATMs are things to explore and satisfy our curiosity on how those ATMs work. Exchange Bitcoin on P2P marketplace or on centralized exchanges are better, less fee will be charged.https://blog.coinsource.net/bitcoin-atm-fees/https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/bitcoin-atm/https://www.investopedia.com/crypto-atm-6456118",

BUT as far as I know individual store owners can set their own rates so it may not 100% be on Bitcoin depo.It's the same thing as some ATMs in certain places (strip clubs) have high fees. Or the currency exchange rate at some local place is terrible compared to what you can get in a bank.-Dave",

That sums up the reason for such high fees. Going forward, ask your cousin to buy bitcoin using an exchange like Binance and send it over to your bitcoin address directly. That will be much cheaper. But yes, she will have to do a KYC verification before she is allowed to do such transfers. Honestly, bitcoin ATMs are not worth anything unless there is a huge emergency. For normal use, take the route of exchanges which will save both of you a huge sum of money from the fees.",

Next time just tell her to register an exchange account and buy from there that way you'll be dealing with a very decent market rather than losing over $500 worth of Bitcoin to a machine she should just do the buy directly from an exchange an we also have some exchanges that do not require KYC before you can buy coin there.

One of the reasons is definitely that people are used to using ATMs, and the other is because they generally don't have to do KYC. However, anyone who pays such a large fee cannot justify it with anything other than complete ignorance of what the real price is - there is no other justification.Quote from: EarnOnVictor on March 03, 2023, 09:43:18 AMI thought the transaction was old when I first sighted the acknowledgement slips, not knowing that the price was crooked to those levels. The BTC rate of over $30,000 while the actual rate is below $24,000 is outrageous, it's extortion for that matter.It's a free market, and it's nothing new that we haven't seen before when it comes to the price difference. During the big bull runs, the difference in the price of BTC used to be several thousand dollars in some countries, so some even thought of moving to South Korea or at least finding someone there, because then you could really make a lot of money selling BTC in that country.",

I know that Bitcoin ATMs often charge higher rates because of the convenience they offer, but I can see why you'd be hesitant to use them again if the price difference was that significant. While it's true that buying Bitcoin through an ATM may not be the most cost-effective method, it's important to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making a decision. For example, buying Bitcoin through an exchange may offer lower fees and a wider range of options, but it may also require more time and effort to set up an account and complete the transaction.I heard about Bitcoin Depot ATM provider, not sure if this is the same company. Thanks for sharing your experience though, it's good to know that the rates at Bitcoin ATMs may not always be the most competitive.",

Which is kind of the same thing as setting the price BUT as the price goes higher their percentage becomes a larger number.Without knowing the backstory and location of this BATM it's difficult to know why it's so outrageous in price. Is the store owner trying to get them out and hopes by charging outrageous prices they will have no business and remove it? Was it a simple screw up?
