  "content": "What happened:: I wanted to play betting at a bookmaker, I saw the site rollbit on this Bitcointalk forum, made a deposit through the exchanger, placed one bet on the NBA and decided to withdraw, the first payment was successful, then I decided to withdraw the entire amount, but they told me that I had a manual verification by the administrator, after they tell me that I have already played on their site, although I first registered with them and never played. I withdrew money through an exchange office, perhaps they have already withdrawn money from this site, I'm not sure, but it seems to me, because they told me that I had already played here, but I'm playing here for the first time (my email registred accoint jafavoy@mail.ru) Scammers Profile Link: https://rollbit.com/  Reference Link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3067300 Amount Scammed: 500$, I made a deposit of $400, won a bet of $653, I had a balance of $731, I successfully withdrew $231, after that I decided to withdraw another 500 in full and I was blocked. I'm playing for the first time!  They stole my $331 depositPayment Method: i deposit 400$ and withdraw ethProof of Payment: https://imgur.com/a/qNnTQIf PM/Chat Logs: https://imgur.com/a/bkZBcQc    ( Additional Notes:I briefly translate my dialogue to you, I write to support that I withdraw money to the exchanger, where they will convert the money to fiat, and I will receive Rubles, I send it to support and say that, can I speed up the process, because I have 20 minutes so that you send the funds to the exchanger, otherwise my application will be closed, after I am debited from the support of the exchanger where they tell me that we will separately make an exception for you and give you two addresses where to send the ether, then we will convert it to fiat. I sent everything to rollbit support, they said we are waiting for the admin, after that they write to me that my account was blocked because I abused their sportsbook, but how? how?? This is my first time playing on their site, I made one bet! one! I didn't play anymore, and they even stole my deposit, funny. I suspect that someone has already withdrawn money to these addresses of the exchanger that is available on the network, and after that they suspect me of abuse. Funny.  https://imgur.com/a/wtNCmJZ    Here is the 2nd withdrawal request I created. in the exchanger, it is already closed and unavailable.    P.S. I am ready to go through all the checks, documents, etc., I want justice to prevail, and they gave me my money, taking into account the winnings, I am not an abuser, I am an ordinary player who decided to play on the site.",

That doesn't prove I have anything to do with the first payment. That address that is supposedly Rollbit's hot wallet contains over $1 million worth of ETH tokens. I am quite sure that there is a limited number of people that have access to its private keys to sign messages and prove ownership of it. I doubt the person controlling Rollbit's Bitcointalk account is on that list.There is another possible solution. If OP has used an exchange or a service that recycles addresses and everyone deposits into the same account accompanied with a note to differentiate different people, he should tell us what service it is, we could check it out and create dummy accounts. And if it's true, we should get the same deposit address as OP got. That would then show that the evidence can't prove Rollbit can claim OP has had previous accounts on the casino just based on the same withdrawal address. Even if that address changes every week or so, two people creating dummy accounts in quick succession should still get the same deposit address.",

That doesn't prove I have anything to do with the first payment.[/quote]For the benefit of those concerned that it may not be Rollbit's hot wallet, I have attached images showing the journey from my coinbase account, to the sweep address that then goes to the rollbit hot wallet address.Again,like you say, screenshots can be edited however transactions cannot so I've also attached the links to my transactions within the images!Attachment 1:Image one shows my 'Deposits' page to rollbit. Any user can see this page for their account by going to rollbit.com/account/deposits/ETH For consistency, I selected one specific transaction of 0.00835999ETH and that's the amount you will see all along.Attachment 2: Image 2 shows the transaction itself, which is from my Coinbase account to my unique Rollbit deposit address [so that they know who it is depositing]link to transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xbea8ca5ff45622e44d913193c30bab6b5e6a8e173cd4df9ab076bcdb946ce6e8 As you can see it's the same ETH amount beeng transacted. Attachment 3:From my unique deposit address, the funds get sent to Rollbit's hot wallet address, which is the same as the one Razer linked.Transaction from my deposit address to hot wallet: https://etherscan.io/tx/0x21fd4cd6f274166dd9c36028984b3e8d31e4d8580f5e973d33641509b2911dc8^ This transaction is a combination of my 2 previous deposits to the deposit address [0.00835999ETH which took place on June 20th 2021, and 0.00909217ETH which took place on June 19th 2021]< this deposit can also be seen in attachment one You can see from the transactions page of my unique deposit address, that all the different ETH transactions coincide with all other deposits shown in the first image",

LoyceV is right when he says that screenshots can be faked and those images can be manipulated with inspect element to fit blockchain records. But I don't think that's the case here and someone would really need a lot of time and be bored to fake all that.I am reasonably assured the address in question belongs to Rollbit. And now I would like to see some evidence from the casino that multiple accounts have been found using the same withdrawal addresses. If OP insists he never used more than one account and this is all a mistake, I would like to know what wallet/service he used to deposit that money. If it's one that reuses the same addresses, I should get the same address if I register an account there as well.",

One of the main differences is the human element for the sports our players are betting on.For example, match fixing is a very genuine threat to any site that operates a sportsbook. Should this mean every site operating a sportsbook should shut down?Considering abuse is a very small % of our overall volume, we don't think so. However, we certainly will take action against prolific abusers, with the hopes of deterring their future efforts.",

Should this mean every site operating a sportsbook should shut down?Were the users guilty of match fixing? If so, where's the evidence? And also: why does that lead to \"limited\" accounts instead of banned accounts? Is fixing matches with lower amounts acceptable?QuoteConsidering abuse is a very small % of our overall volume, we don't think so. However, we certainly will take action against prolific abusers, with the hopes of deterring their future efforts.It sounds like most users lose money, and a very small percentage of users wins. That should be normal in a casino, instead of a reason to take their funds.I think the point is being missed here, the user is permanently banned from Rollbit for circumventing our bans and previous account limits. Some of these accounts were detailed in my original reply, one with a remarkably similar name to OP's username on this forum. Those aren't just hunches, they're backed by our internal measures for detecting accounts evading our limits & bans, further backed by blockchain transactions that I disclosed.If they did not create additional accounts for the purposes of abusing our Sportsbook, they would not be banned and be permitted to continue on their limited account. The fact is they require the open limits to abuse the sportsbook so seek to circumvent our limits.We're more than happy to show additional data points from our end as long as they're not sensitive or disclose our internal security practises, making it easier for abusers to circumvent our measures.As requested, please suggest what you'd like to see, keeping in mind your suggestion that screenshots can be fabricated.",

      "body": "So the name of the exchange that OP used is called Tec.Bit.com. I went to their site and started a fake ETH to rubles exchange to see what address I would get from the site. It was a brand-new ETH address that had no previous transaction history. I am also posting a screenshot where I talked with the support of Tec.Bit. I asked them if deposit addresses on their exchange are being reused, and is it possible that a person receives a deposit address that was previously used by a different person. As you can see from the chat, they said no. For each new request, a new ETH address gets generated. The point of this is to check whether OP could have been unlucky to have used an exchange that reuses crypto addresses because he said he never played on Rollbit before. If that was the case, it could be possible that he was asked to deposit his tokens into an Ethereum address that was previously used on Rollbit by someone else who got banned/limited. Judging by the reply of the support agent, that can't happen.",

      "body": "Address reuse by an exchange or some other service is certainly possible, although in my experience I think it's very rare these days. But even if that were true, it would be pretty incredible if the only deposit to the same address also came from a Rollbit hot wallet, and only 6 days apart.Furthermore, since the screenshot posted by the OP and the transaction later posted by Rollbit Razer match the transaction amount and time, I think we can safely conclude that the address 0xd671f6bbC4998e24b575fF8178715fFB96674d89 is indeed the OP's withdrawal address.This leads to the conclusion that the OP is not telling the complete truth in this case, and that he had at least one other account and at least one successful withdrawal from Rollbit casino in the past. If not him personally, then someone very close to him (maybe a family member?).",

Even if it's the same user, that shouldn't happen. Unless the exchange keeps old addresses active to do the same exchange again (so I think I may have answered my own question).According to the blockchain explorer, it does not appear that the address is actually from the exchange. Looks like the OP lied about that part as well.Rollbit Razer already mentioned that the funds from both transactions were swept to this address: 0x1be52d9df0cc803ac8dd7f9cb1303fe8f470b144.That wallet address currently holds just over 2.56 ETH from a total of 10 incoming TXns, all in the past month.- The last two transactions are from the already mentioned OP's address: 0xd671... - Four transactions are from the Rollbit hot wallet directly, address: 0xcbd6...- The two transactions are from the address: 0xf771ef93ecc4545c79c95d6b82a742099a9cab99 which received inputs from the Binance wallet.- And the other two transactions are from the addresses: 0x07d526e735ce49f49a1c966dd5832d66e867b4f8 and 0x8423bcbe3adc57d91feda4997b70f12f4bc98782. It is interesting that each of these addresses has a single incoming transaction, which is also from the Rollbit hot wallet address: 0xcbd6...This leads me to the conclusion that all the addresses listed are private wallets and not from an exchange as the OP claimed, and that he had multiple withdrawals from Rollbit Casino in the past month that all ended up at one address: 0x1be52d9df0cc803ac8dd7f9cb1303fe8f470b144. I hope my logic makes sense.",

It seems like you are assuming that OP is telling the truth about using the exchange he mentioned, which made the mistake of giving him a reused address. Let's say he is lying about that, and he had multiple accounts that he used on Rollbit and ended up withdrawing from those accounts into the same ETH address. It's a totally different story then.",
