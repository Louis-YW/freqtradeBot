      "body": "maybe he is asking people to review it. like how development should work.. not be chastised and told to delete post.. like how this subcategory is turning into yet again*lets deal with the actual flaws of the context(skipping the finer details of all the aspects of 'blockchain' and just dealing with the bits mentioned in the slide)Quote from: BTC_Mouse on July 28, 2022, 08:20:40 AMFundamental of Blockchain...1. users create their own transactions, 2. they send the transaction to other users(peers) who send it out to other peers (called peer to peer (p2p)) via their software3. nodes[software that performs certain functions to offer utility/services] have code/algorithms that perform validation checks as well as relay/store data.4. specialist nodes [dependant on which network structure] perform extra tasks of collating transactions into a block, including the previous block ID, aswell as secure the contents using special algorithms/devices that meet certain rules/conditions/complexity[dependant on which network ruleset agreed]5. the secured block is sent out p2p to everyone and if they validate the secured block meets all the set rules of validity and security. the block is confirmed as the next block of the blockchain each node stores, which if all done correctly by all following the rules, every node stores the same chain of blocks and all see the same list of confirmed transactions within those blocks. 6. these specialist nodes creating the secured blocks get a reward for their extra task (if their block is declared the most valid block added to the blockchain), via their block containing the reward, which is then part of the valid value seen by all, to be spent by the block creator later onthis topic was in the Development & Technical Discussion sectionelitism seems rampant this month(yet again).. is it the heat?i see many issues with his slides. but it seems anyone trying to correct anyone or offer suggestions is not tolerated these daysvery very weird mindset that has grown over the years. telling a guy to \"go away your wrong\" has become the development community mantra and motto. which begins with hostile hate and then just then turns to ignorance of personal vendetta. i know i come across as brash and full on in my method of mentioning flaws and issues. but maybe devs and this elitist community should chill out on the 'delete post we dont want it' mindset, to instead be a little more hmm whats the word. OPEN minded ignoring the guys grammar and spelling mistakes(the usual silly things this development community want to attack first as their excuse to ignore content and chest beat their elitism)",

      "body": "I think the main pro and beauty of Open Source and transparency is that you can see whatever is happening with Bitcoin.  You can find flaws, see and modify the code, find out if the code has been maliciously modified by somebody else.  It does not end just with the 'you can modify the code'.  There is much more to it than that.  It provides a key security and safety and ensures you that everything is running as it should, long as the code is audited.Also, does someone else agree that boasting Bitcoin or Blockchain for 'low fees' is not the case anymore?  I personally think that Bitcoin is not that cheap to use anymore.  In fact, it is often cheaper to use a bank than it is to use Bitcoin.  Particularly if you have multiple inputs or if the mempool is congested and you need a quick confirmation.  While I do not hate Bitcoin for that simply because privacy costs, I found this 'fees are cheap' statement often ultimately pushes people away from Bitcoin as soon as they find out it is not as cheap as they imagined it would be.What is going on with the 'ANTI MONEY LAUNDERING TRACKING SYSTEM'?  Not sure what you meant and it sounds very creepy, I definitely do not like that being on a slide about Blockchain or Bitcoin!-Regards,PrivacyG",

Blockchain is a database. Talking there about fees looks to me like confusion (i.e. confusing blockchain with whatever coin)yep agreed.. and also about the \"reward\" which some blockchain devs add as a rule/feature for their blockchain, where as data driven (not value driven) dont have rewards. which is why i put in a disclaimer about \"(skipping the finer details of all the aspects of 'blockchain' and just dealing with the bits mentioned in the slide)\"i was going to mention \"blockchains\" dont need rewards. but that just adds waffle to the 6 points mentioned in the slide that obvious was leaning towards value based blockchains rather than all blockchains",
