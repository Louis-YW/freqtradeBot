This is his first step, against Fulton and I will agree that he could be the next victim of the Monster.Quote from: Reatim on January 20, 2023, 04:46:21 AMInoue needs to grow His career Up and he will not have it if not taking one step forward , he had been dominating the Bantamweight division for years and I think he becomes boring not having a best opponent so this is the best move to challenge His skills and capacity, though Fulton is really strong and skillful , yet Naoya is his best opponent for this title match.He has nothing to accomplished in 118 lbs, he has all the belts and clean up the division, beating the likes of Nonito Donaire in the process. So it make sense for him to move up and again unify all the belts in super bantamweight because it will be history.",

What I really like about Fulton is his never say die mentality, against Brandon Figueroa, he shows a lot of heart and win that fight in the judges score card. But I don't think he can last against the power of Inoue. Again even in 122 lbs, he might be even powerful in this division because he doesn't have to weight drain himself just to make the desired weight. Now he can eat without issues and then go to the gym train hard every day. Fulton's tenacity will be tested here.",

He probably becomes slower while his technique can't adjust to his speed. I'm surprised about this match because Naoya team choose the long shot of building his career before taking a big fight like this. Fulton is not an explosive boxer like Naoya but he is good at getting points against a beast like Naoya that is adjusting his weight. I definitely vote for Naoya if this match will be on lower weight but 126 is already a huge weight increase for him to perform like what he did in the Bantamweight division. I'm not familiar on new boxer anymore but only Pacquiao is the only boxer that I know that is still very good despite a significant weight adjustment.I'm sure the fight will be in Japan since Naoya is the crowd favourite in this match. His demand will surely be answered for a better profit of this match.",

It seems like this was already in the works months before this announcement, and Fulton being the perfect contender because the man isn't on the superstar level in the world of boxing, but he's relatively known by a lot in the boxing world due to his flawless record and above-average footwork. I don't see Fulton winning against Naoya Inoue if it comes to straight clashing, but if he uses his reach and footwork well, he may just win against the Japanese monster via decision. Although knowing Inoue, he probably would go for the kill early on and seal the deal.",
