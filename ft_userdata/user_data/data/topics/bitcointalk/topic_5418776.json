Your post is pointless and there's no discussion at all. What's the relation between Bitcoin price going to hit $100K and this shitcoins? you're just clickbait a title to make people interested with your worthless NFT.Another thing there's a thread about Bitcoin going to hit $100K before Bitcoin to hit $100k?",

Whilst some users might get the feeling of 'unjust' when they have their posts deleted, in your own case here you definitely shouldn't, everything about your post is wrong, the subject has no relationship with the content, wrong board to talk about NFT and subtle shilling. So don't waste everybody's time here, close this topic and follow the forum rules/etiquette whilst making a post next time and it won't be deleted.",

But on viewing the scrapped post, I discovered that the post neither fit in Bitcoin board nor altcoins board. It is a sandwich of both, which made it a total trash.Most times I'll wonder how a legendary user wouldn't know what belongs to btc and altcoins and also how to structure posts for 3 to 4 years in the forum.",

Better follow the forum rules and f you need to promote something, do it in the right way in the right section.

Look,you just need to understand where, when,how and what to post cus you've got alot of peeps out here, reading through the whole gaddamn tautology. I learnt there's a mega thread already; why create another one? don't you make use of the \"search topics \" just so you'd evade this kinda trauma ?! I have read two posts today.
