So it's bad when people generalize it and other people that were hoping to get involved would change their mind. There would always be bad actors in a system like this. Even AI that is the pride of future technology suffers from the same feat. As much as there would be good actors, there will also be bad one ready to take advantage of the network for personal gain.",

As for Bitcoin, as it becomes popular and gets into the main market, the thought changes on it as it's like becoming now a common money to everyone and an investment too.",

Bitcoin was created to make it easier for us to make transactions, but unfortunately Bitcoin is inseparable from abuse by many irresponsible people because they take advantage of the advantages possessed by Bitcoin to carry out illegal acts and crimes activity, one of which is money laundering.There are several loopholes that are exploited by people who are not responsible for carrying out illegal activities or their activities that violate the law, one of them is because it can be used without authorization from a country's central bank and there is no intervention from any financial institution or third party, so that way it would be difficult to detect and very suitable for money laundering.",

I know the reason why some people or the government are thinking that Bitcoin contributes to crime is because of the other known incident of money laundering with it, but the question they should even be asking themselves is: if Bitcoin is removed from the picture, will such an incident cease to happen? because it will take a different form. Some government officials who are in power are even the ones who are promoting some looting in some countries, because without their help, most of those looting operations would not really go smoothly.",

So if I personally, were faced with someone who asked a question like that, I would definitely answer it very concisely and concisely. Because to explain why transactions in bitcoin are very anonymous and why this is so important. Actually the answer is very simple, namely to maintain the privacy of every bitcoin user so that his bitcoin assets remain safe.Not that with anonymous bitcoin transactions, it is intended for something evil, but this is for the good of investors in bitcoin itself.So in essence, bitcoin and all the systems embedded in it, there are no elements related to crimes or criminal acts.Indeed, there are a handful of criminals who use bitcoin as a mask for their crimes. Namely by committing fraud and such. But criminal acts such as fraud, do not only occur in the world of bitcoin, but even in fiat money this has even happened frequently. So those who say bitcoin and its transaction system aim to obtain public data, this opinion is very wrong.Because according to the assessment of the US treasury department alone.Quote fiat currencies and traditional networks that turn out to contribute more (in the majority) to criminal flows than digital currencies such as cryptocurrencies.Source: https://coinvestasi.com/berita/kejahatan-keuangan-terjadi-di-mata-uang-fiat",
