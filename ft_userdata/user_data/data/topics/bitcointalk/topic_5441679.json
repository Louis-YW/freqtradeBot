  "content": "We know gold is very precious metal, but Bitcoin is much more expensive than gold. Bitcoin will cross $100k after halving in 2024 ie if I invest $3000 in Bitcoin now then there is a chance of getting 10x after 2024. If I get $30000 from investing $3000, nothing can be as valuable as Bitcoin. I explained this formula to my wife at night and she was not willing to give me her jewelery at first but today she told me by herself that you can sell my jewelery and invest in Bitcoin. At present I am forced to sell my wife's jewelery as I have no fiat money. I seek advice from expert investors/holders/users of this forum,,,,whether selling my wife's jewelery and investing on bitcoins makes sense? Is it reasonable to invest in gold rather than bitcoin?",

Depend with gold or jewelry I think Bitcoin is best investment assets but looking on stable and without any inflation gold or jewelry investment is worth option.Lets waiting until 2024 with $3,000 investment how much increasing up, will you earn double profit one years later or Bitcoin price keep stable due your decision with long term investment.",

So I am forced to sell my wife's hobby jewelry even though it is very difficult.In my perspective this act of selling jewels defeats the first act of save investment into bitcoin. From your past experiences of cryptocurrency losses I could say you’re more or less a panic trader who focuses on making huge profits and not calculative of the losses you could encounter. What happens after selling your wife’s jewels and the pre determined profit wasn’t achieved, wouldn’t that prompt you to sell another asset? Excessively selling properties for bitcoin investment will only make you loss more as you will not have the patience to bear the losses in bearish period. In as much as spending on jewels excessively is bad we can’t deny our selves the luxury of having them too because fashion is still key part of our lives Invest what you can lose",

Did you talk to your wife about it also?

Investing not only in Bitcoin but in all cryptocurrencies is extremely risky. But I believe 100%  that Bitcoin may double or triple from ATH after halving day 2024. Moreover, after 2021, the entire year 2022 was a bloody chapter for Bitcoin. If the Bitcoin market does not grow in 2023, I strongly believe that after the halving in 2024, the Bitcoin market will exceed $100k by 2025. I made my decision based on this belief.",

Its not advisable to sell gold for investing in some other sector like bitcoin. If you have extra money then go and invest in bitcoin rather its more profitable to invest small money but regularly in bitcoin. To me investing 50$ per week or 200$ per month in bitcoin is more worthy then investing 3000$ at once.If you have gold in the form of jewellery then keep it for future use.

But if you see this step you want to take now as a way to recover what you have lost, then you may be doing the wrong thing or investing the wrong way, before buying BTC, you must understand what you are doing and for how long you intend to hold, from your calculations you believe by 2024 you would \"cash out\", but what if you have to wait for much longer, can you hold on and still manage to foot your bills. Considering the amount you said you have lost in just a short time, investing too much into BTC is a bad idea, you can slowly buy BTC through dca.From the 'moral' side of things, convincing your wife to sell her jewelries so you could invest in BTC is wrong, and i am sure you said it to her in such a way that profit is sure by 2024, try explaining everything to your wife perfectly, including the risks and see if she would affirm to the decision any longer.",

Some Jewelries are very expensive when sold because they can retain their value and still have second hand value if you wish to resell. As a matter of fact, most celebrities that you see buying and wearing very expensive jewelries, wristwatches etc. consider the jewelries as investments that they can always sell in the future should they need money. That is why they never really see buying original expensive jewelry as a waste of money.Selling your wife's Jewelry to invest in bitcoin is a good move before the jewelries are lost to theft. I think every one should put this strategy to consideration, those looking to increase their investments in bitcoins and happen to have some valuable jewelries that they do not wear very often again and has a good second hand value. You can consider selling some off and invest in bitcoins.",
