Does this even make any sense? Not making any sense. When I am using just small money to gamble. Quote from: Z390 on October 10, 2023, 07:06:20 AMBecause the only place this makes a bit sense is the skills base niche like forex trading or crypto trading, how can gambling/gambler be financed? 5% of weekly income for the gambler is enough, not huge amount of money.Quote from: Z390 on October 10, 2023, 07:06:20 AMHave you heard of such before? What is the end result if you have? I have not and only a stupid person will borrow someone money to gamble. The gambler will disappoint.Quote from: Z390 on October 10, 2023, 07:06:20 AMWhy would you trust anyone to gamble better than you can when it's all about luck?There is nothing like someone will gamble better. Luck is luck. Games will favour the house more. The ending will not be good.",

Does this even make any sense?I will feel that such a friend wants to set me up. He or she wants to put me in trouble either between us or with the law. In my wisdom and common sense, I will respectfully decline. Money and friendship do not mix. I have had a bad experience from this. QuoteBecause the only place this makes a bit sense is the skills base niche like forex trading or crypto trading, how can gambling/gambler be financed? Even with forex or crypto trading or any investment at all, very extra care and caution needs to be adhered to. Because when you lose the money, that friend would show you their very bad side that you would never believe that it is someone you call a friend that is acting in that manner. QuoteHave you heard of such before? What is the end result if you have? In gambling, I have never heard of such before but in other spheres of life, yes. And 90% of them do not end well. It will lead to broken friendship.QuoteWhy would you trust anyone to gamble better than you can when it's all about luck?No. The best I can do is take your signals and do my analysis on them.",

We know too well that gambling is a game of probability and no one knows when their winning is defined or not, when you funds such people or such event it's assume that you are also adhering to rules of gambling and whatever comes as the outcome none of them would be held responsible since is a game of luck.",

Gambling has no guarantee you should explain that your friend should not lend to people who are into gambling because there's a possibility that he cannot get his money back because gamblers are looking for money to gamble they do not like paying people unless they win a big amount.",

Two limited circumstances I can think of, one being highly unethical and the other being a normal practice, is loan sharking and poker staking respectively. Loan sharking is self explanatory, the lender/loan shark can exercise unethical means of recouping funds with the large interest generally entailed for profit. Again, predatory and unethical. On the other hand, if a player who is skilled at a game where odds can be made positive, such as in poker, it is possible that other players or profiteers will try to buy some of the action. It can end badly, as all gambling and lending combinations can, however it can be successful in some circumstances.One other unethical circumstance is when a fix or cheat in the game is found, however that is another unethical scenario and is not entirely relevant to the conversation as it adds the factor of cheating.",

The end result will be very bad because the gambler will lose all that money, gambling is gambling and there is no skills to always increase your wins, you will lose and you can't escape it, the winner is the owners of the casino, they sit back and watch how you fight to get lucky, sometimes this is how I feel, like they are laughing on us, turning gamblers into laughing stocks.Even in crypto trading and forex trading, I will never fund any trader, as this move has one landed my cousin into a very big problem, at first the trader was making good return and things are going fine, and my cousin started using other peoples fund so that the income will increase a lot, one day all the money was gone and he ended up in debt.",

This question has been asked before but not in this form; it was “is it good to take Lon for gambling purposes?” And the answer we got back then was “no” if we’re to take the average of all that came out.I have never been approached for a loan for gambling purposes and neither have I seen someone that role loan just so that they can gamblie with it with the hope of them winning and multiplying the money by 2 folds… it’s seems stupid to me ngl, because I can’t just walk up to someone and take a loan from them and then put it in a place that has the tendency to make me lose it and if someone comes to me for assistance revealing that they want to gamble with it I’m definitely not going to help them unless they are rich or have an assurance of my getting back my money that is they have a source of income that won’t fail them when it’s time for them to pay back the money, that’s the only way I’ll listen to them.",

And the reason is as said, because it doesn't make sense and if you always win you don't need funds from other people, and he also definitely has a lot of money from his winnings.Unless I know the trail of gambling results that always win and also have a lot of money or become rich from gambling, maybe I will ask for it myself and even other people will do the same.",

Many people make the mistake of accumulating debts due to gambling, which I see as an addiction. Gambling should be for entertainment, with the possibility of making some small profits. I cannot provide money for gambling because there's no guarantee of winning, and I won't consider such a request. If you want to gamble, use your own funds that you can afford to lose.don't borrow money because you can't afford to lose it. In my opinion, it's unwise to lend money to someone for gambling and hope to get it back when they cash out their winnings.",

Your judgement is right. Why bother to invest into something that you fully understand that the chance of earning is at risk, we are talkingabout gambling and no one can guarantee a sure winning outcome from time to time.Even it's a friend or a close relative, there's no assurance that they can win every time or they can have that advantage in dealing with it.Though, we do have different views about it and maybe there are some who can practice it (just maybe), but still the chance of losingis far higher than the chance of making decent benefits, better to gamble according to your own and not to invest out for someone.",

If anyone came up to me asking for money to gamble I'd either very politely explain this to them (that is if I appreciated that person), or outright say no. Any game of chance is skewed by the house edge so it can be sustained. Then if we're talking poker maybe if a player is really good he can earn against other players in the long run but it also depends on chance and can lead to great upsets. In the end of the day, if someone is good at something, let him finance himself. If he needs to borrow to gamble then he should not be considering gambling in the first place.",

It's hard to enter this kind of set up though given the risk, I would rather not. This is because you will put your money and friendship at stake because you trust the person to begin with. But what if they fucked up? All you will get is an apology, you're even lucky if you will receive such and not be ghosted afterwards. So if you plan to do this, do not ever forget to have an agreement that's been notarized by an attorney as your evidence. That way, you can be assured that if things go south, you can still get your money back. It's hard to trust with verbal conversations only as proof afterall. Life is hard, so you must do your best to protect your assets and to keep connections. Just also pray that your friend is really skilled and lucky enough, because the earnings will still depend on what he will encounter for the day.

Does this even make any sense? I have done this a couple of times and I can confirm it can be favourable sometimes. Personally, my work do not allow me time for gambling sometimes so I will just send my gambling funds to a friend that is good in it and we share the proceeds. Something, the money is also lost which is normal but the few times I have done it, it yielded more profits than I have lost. There is one thing I noticed about it; when he is gambling with funds entrusted to him by me or any other, he tends to be more serious about it and this is different from when he is playing with his own funds. Because of this, he always suggested this deals which I think have been profitable thus far.

The promotion appears to emphasize the potential gains while conveniently overlooking the associated risks. In reality, such offers are typically skewed against your favor. You, as the participant, bear the primary risk, and even if successful, you might only receive a fraction of the winnings, not cool.",
