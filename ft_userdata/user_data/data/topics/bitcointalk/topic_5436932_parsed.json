Surely there are many things you are missing. Feel free to contact me for bitcointalk related promotions. I have been doing it for years now. Here is my portfolio with seven active campaigns from seven new crypto startups. I can help you in that.Anyway, to start - buy a copper membership which will allow you to post image. Once you have the access to post images then hire a good designer (I can help you with it too) and ask him to create a nice ANN thread for you. Finally, update the main post with the graphics which will look professional and will attract many people to your brand.",

WowAnd more shocking, the domain is just 12 days old as of todaySo in simple terms your exchange isn't even more than 2 weeks old, but it was voted best broker in Europe in 2019",

Also, seems like OP is not serious enough with his own project although he paid for bumping the topic. He seems to be inactive right after posting the ANN thread since last 3 days.Also, I wont recommend Royse to propose him for managing a campaign as he may run into troubles himself. Better safe than sorry.Lets see if OP can provide more evidence regarding his \"best broker\" later.",
