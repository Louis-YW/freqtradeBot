It came four years after the controversy over Frank Lampard's strike for England against Germany being missed by the officials: the goal was not given despite it clearly crossing the line.Frank Lampard's disallowed World Cup goal was a pivotal moment in the future of technology in footballGero Breloer/AP2010VAR was used in a major tournament for the first time in 2017 at the FIFA Confederations Cup. In the same year, the Bundesliga and Serie A became the first of the world's major leagues to take the plunge with La Liga and Ligue 1 following suit a year later. The Premier League bowed down to the inevitable and implemented VAR in 2019.FOOTBALL NOW is a new show that brings to light some of the global game's biggest issues, challenges, and debates.VAR. Like it or loathe it, it appears to be here to stay. But has it actually made football better or has it added another unnecessary layer of complication to the beautiful game?COMPLETE  Source HERE",

So I can actually say Var has  improved the game in a kind of way. But in some few cases,there are some possible penalties that are supposed to be awarded which are always denied,while some balls that are not penalties being awarded as penalties.They work together with the Ref,therefore it makes the work a little bit easier.",

There are some people that say it ruins the experience of the fans who are watching but even that is a weak reasoning not to implement VAR. There are far more important benefits it brought to the game. You now see less matches decided by an officiating error.",

But has it actually made football better or has it added another unnecessary layer of complication to the beautiful game?It improved football for sure, as a bettor it sometimes sucks to see the refs remove a goal or card that's in the favor of the team you bet on but having the technology to quickly replay a crucial scenario frame by frame is a big help for the refs since it'll help confirm their decisions based on the provided replay. I just think it offers more upside to football in general since one bad decision can sometimes have a big impact on the game and having the chance to overturn those due to VAR means it's effective.",

I think better would still remain to be seen, especially if its use has been limited to only the big tournaments so far (afaik anw). I wouldn't really mind the delay, especially if it was a point that could change the match decision. I don't think mistakes would be impossible to avoid, but it's definitely going to be an improvement compared to solely relying on the referee's on-field judgment.",

      "body": "It depends on the context, I believe VAR is still pretty far from what it's supposed to be, the initial idea behind it neither can we call it a finished product as such, but there have been progress, it has helped surely certain calls get made correctly and some reversal too be it cards or goals that would have looked legitimate at first glances and vice versal, however, it has taken a bit away from the fun too when there have to be checks for almost every goals and all card-worthy offenses, it takes the flow and tempo pf the game away and that could be a huge advantage for team under immense pressure they get breathing space and try to get them self together. I like the fact plays are always allowed to continue until the ball is out of play before there is a review, but there are still a lot of things to be corrected or improved on in order to make it worthy of the goal it was set out to achieve.Quote from: bittraffic on July 26, 2022, 10:11:09 PMThere had always been a camera for every game so I'm not sure how different is the VAR from what we see on NBA or boxing where we see every action being replayed whenever a violation is called.VAR is completely different with NBA video review, even though they are set out to achieve the same purposes, NBA doesn't review every basket made or every potential goaltending and it's often gotten wrong in certain instances and review are usually made in only certain instances especially with hard (flagrant) and take fouls, and there after each team gets one decision challenging opportunity for the entire game, and after that's gone every refereeing decision are as though there isn't a VAR, you can't any call overturned for or against you if it wasn't called in the first place.So, my opinion having said all that would be that VAR has been an improvement to football, because it's has always been an eyesore when blatant infringement go the wrong way, because they couldn't have been notice without further review.",

One have to wait with a fast beating heart for the result of the checks. Those wonderful celebrations we use to see once the center referee confirm it is a goal are usually cut short be he VAR observation. Another challenge of using VAR is the cost of running it. Most countries might not have the financial strength to use VAR in their leagues. But generally it has done more good than harm to soccer.",

Just like challenges on line call in tennis, where a player has the right to review a shot if it landed in or out(3 times per set). They could add something similar to that in football as well. Where a manager can review a certain play which might have been missed by the refs. A similar system has been placed in the NBA as well. I think people overblow into the fact that the play has to be stopped for a few mins to get the decision right. The fact that we can overturn wrong decisions or lack there of is worth the time wasted in waiting. In my opinion.",

Most times the Centre referee is signaled by the VAR to check if a penalty should be awarded in such cases or not but at the end of the check, the penalty may not be awarded. In some games where penalties are awarded that should not be awarded to a team could be as a mistake by the VAR or the offense that was committed by a particular player was against the FIFA rules. The VAR work with the Ref but they have more power to award a penalty even when the Ref tries to overlook it.",

VAR would be use in the Qater World cup and it will be fully active in games. As time goes on, football also improved in their technologies and VAR have the final say. But some believe is one kind of cheat in games but I see it as a new way to detects penalty, offside, fouls. All these are highly noticed when VAR is present in games.",
