The question is whether when you benefit from bitcoin, you can help your economy and your family?Yes.Actually, it is not only me. Bitcoin and Stable coins are a big deal here in my country because inflation and lack of trust in our institutions. One just needs to take a look a countries like Nigeria or Argentina to see how Bitcoin can help people to face disadvantageous economical situations.For example, here in my country it was not possible to receive remittances directly from abroad, one needed the government as third party. In the end, they kept the USD and gave inflated local currency to the final recipient. Thanks to Bitcoin we can move money however we want without permission from autocrats.",

The question is whether when you benefit from bitcoin, you can help your economy and your family?Bitcoin or any other cryptos can surely help the economy by increasing the purchasing power of the people. Those who have invested in bitcoin and are currently in profit can surely use that extra money to buy things from their local market either by using bitcoin or by fiat after converting it. That's the only way bitcoin and other cryptos can help the economy. The other way to help is through taxes. There are a lot of people including me, who like to do the taxes diligently. So whatever extra earning they get from bitcoin, they calculate tax on it and pay to the government. That's another way but the numbers are insignificant.",

My aim in investing in bitcoin is to find ways to improve my economy as well as that of my family, and I admit that my economy has improved a lot thanks to the returns that bitcoin brings. Investing in bitcoin really helps me a lot economically.

Those who lose money and always blame bitcoin are losers because they never admit their fault but only blame fate or others.",

Those that invested in Bitcoin some years ago when the price is low in the market will definitely achieve what will make their family not to feel bad in this hardship. I believe, i will be part of those that will smile soon when the price of Bitcoin hit $40,000, because I invested in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies which all those coins will definitely increase higher before the half of this year 2023",

So why ask again?Instead of repeating the same thing day after day, do something practical. Buy Bitcoin and see for yourself if it will benefit you or if you will still be loyal to the dollar.",

The question is whether when you benefit from bitcoin, you can help your economy and your family?Obviously, I will answer yes, and almost 85% of my income from bitcoin is enough to meet the needs of my family. Even with more budget, I can have a sufficient standard of living. In fact, Bitcoin played a full role in my needs for many years. The benefit of being able to prove that Bitcoin is one of the factors that has helped me from the crisis during the pandemic saved me from hospital benefits and saved me from living under a bridge. Bitcoin has indirectly raised the dignity of our family.",

There are different ways to make money from bitcoin like I can mention mining, hodling or trading bitcoin to say just these. But apart from trading, hodling of bitcoin can not feed a family because it is seasonal, it is only trading bitcoin that you can benefit but this also is not easy. We still don't need to put our eyes in one basket, we still need to do other businesses to support on bitcoin endeavour and trading.",

Those who have made profits from their bitcoin investments and converted their bitcoins into fiat indicate that they have already made a contribution to their family and economy. No, when an individual converts his or her bitcoin into fiat at a loss.Anyhow, let us talk about bitcoin in a broader context. One of the reasons why the value of Bitcoin has continued to rise since its inception is that there is a finite supply of it. Because it is a borderless currency, Bitcoin makes it possible for individuals to transfer money from different parts of the world without paying high transaction fees and third-party systems. We live in a digital age, and bitcoin is an improved version of our common currency.",
