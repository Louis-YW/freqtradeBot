But for topic I agree with you, many people are using it as synonym of thread including me while it's not. Its real meaning is the subject of the discussion/conversation/thread, the \"Original Post\" normally. OP refers to the Original Poster and the topic(subject) both but with this widespread notation I bet only the first meaning will remain here at the end.",

Platforms like Reddit also refer to the slang original poster as the starter of the discussion and a title to refer back to the person as the response progresses.",
