Im starting off the discussion with the official link of Galxe campaign:https://galxe.com/Linea/campaign/GCzWYUZXj4Also its quite comparable the last quest with 2500 points to the normal quest of Linea through on chain and off chain weekly task. 11m total participants vs 300k plus means the difference are too big for real users. It seems farmers and bots are heavily joined. Hope to cut them down for the next remaining two weekly task for its completion.",

It's not foolproof but I guess it's quite effective.This week's campaign (Social and Entertainment Week) is frustrating. There are so many gas-consuming activities while the main faucet is still unavailable. I'm only half way through and already out of ETH for gas.

This is interesting to see at least it's a good take to have the weekend completed with this, it's another opportunity coming on the way through which only those that are ready to participate will partake in such, i think it's worth giving a try, I've also been around to see something like this coming from the source i could trust their delivery ability, i believe it's something one can give a tasteful experience on each bite.",

I could say thats a trmendous effort for a testnet like this if ever.

Thanks, but it's still unavailable for me. I've also seen similar complaints from other users on Discord, so it seems like a widespread issue. I might just let the rest of the points go since we already got that 2,500 points from the First Class Citizen campaign. In the grand scheme of things, it shouldn't make a significant difference.Anyway, have you come across any rumors about the TGE date for Linea? Is it expected to take place this year?",

The final week for the Linea testnet voyage is quite compensating (The week 9). All you need to do is just to retweet a twitter post and then vote on snapshot on what you think is your favorite Linea platform use case. To vote on the snapshot site; your only criteria is to hodl 0.1 Testnet Linea Ethereum tokens. Since the first class citizen voyage has rooted out bots and spammers; every qualified participants can look forward to Linea main net launch and rewards (if there is any) to celebrate the end of the Voyage event",

The complexity of some weeks are really high and not just that but the network cant really compensate the users doing it since a lot has been using and resulting to high gas fee and congestion.

I just hope every Layer 1, 2, 3, etc., would do the same due to the Sybil issue. There are many factors that your wallet could get labeled as Sybil because of having multi-accounts, not doing transactions in other chains, etc.I started on the Week 5 of their campaign (stupid of me not aware of Linea's campaign in Galxe back then). I finished almost all points from Weeks 5 to 9 (missed one task on Week 7 which I am not eligible to mint that NFT due to not engaging in either the Bridge or NFT week. I've spent almost 30 Linea ETH just to finish all 425 points of their Week 8 quests, which I find it the most difficult and time consuming of them all.Much better to have one wallet alone but also very important for it not to be hacked by always double or triple check everything before proceeding.",

The NFTs and OATs being earned in Galxe are going to give us special privileges as a “gateway” and “passport” for future big rewards. And also those projects who are introducing their own soul-bound passports.Like in Galxe they introduce a soul-bound Passport Holder NFT. Once you own that, every existing campaign in Galxe who requires you to have a passport are automatically qualified to receive points, NFTs, OATs, etc., for their own rewarding system. If you look at Aptos and Blur respectively, for just minting an NFT those holders are enjoying big retroactive drop rewards back then. What if we speculate that for Linea Voyager Quest NFT holders we will be eligible for the retroactive drop after mainnet launch? Or maybe even just an allocation for pre-IDO price like what SUI did last time? Anything’s possible!",
