There are several pairs available such as WBTC/USDC, WBTC/WFTM, WBTC/WETH, WBTC/BRUSH, WBTC/BEETS. And AFAIK, until now there's not a single CEX that supports Bitcoin (BTC) deposits using the Fantom network, this can be seen from Binance which has not integrated it on their platform, if it doesn't exist on Binance, I'm not sure there are other CEXes that support it.",
