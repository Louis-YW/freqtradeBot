  "content": "I was reading the thread by Cyrus for TheBitcoinTalkShow[1] and got inspired about how other tools, like blogging, can be used to spread the word about Bitcoin, directly as seen here on bitcointalk.Here is my question - Who would be interested in reading a weekly or biweekly blog (mini-series) about what goes on here on the forum?As I imagine it, the blog would comprise notable posts within that week, summarized into a quick read. It would be presented in a fun way, with some featured series posts about certain members, as well as historical content for posts not as publicized as popular ones, like the BTC for pizza or Hodl thread. On this blog, members who missed out on the forum for that week can have a quick resource to know what went down, without having to read through the entire forum, and with links to the highlighted posts there, for those who wish to read more about a particular story.This can also help people who are not on the forum, or who find the forum layout off-putting to find out about what goes on here.Expected Cons:1. Compiling dozens of posts into a blog post could prove challenging and if not done well can exceed the attention span of most readers.2. Majority of frequent forum users may not be interested.3. How to include local languages in.Hopeful suggestions:1. What platform would be most appropriate to use.2. What sort of content should be highlighted more.3. Any idea on how this can work better.This is just a spur of the moment idea, and I would not be surprised if some are not in favor of it. Whether or not I go ahead with it is dependent on the response to the poll.[1] TheBitcoinTalkShow- Jay -",

I'm around the forum quite a bit and don't think there's that much that goes on to be reported every two weeks. You'd have to be careful about not feeding trolls or giving them a platform too which might be hard.Local languages could probably be included by asking someone if they'd help you translate posts from the popular sections or speak for them and give you a summary (especially mods) - but it might be something that could be arranged by the community for that section too and not included in the initial version - it could be placed on the local board itself then too.",

I am not sure if this is an SMF feature, but it would be best for the creator to be able to see results without contributing to the results.- Jay -",

If the point is to spread the word about Bitcoin as well as this forum, then it should be done somewhere else and not here. It seems weird to talk about Bitcoin and Bitcointalk in a new thread on Bitcointalk. If the idea was to summarize the events that occurred in the last week, I would agree with you on making a new thread on Bitcointalk and talking about it there. I would focus on a few boards only. One segment could be about the most important things that happened in the Bitcoin technical boards. If a new interesting Bitcoin-related project pops up in Project Development, it should definitely be mentioned. I would stay away from Reputation and Scam Accusations. If you want to bring in some new people, you don't want them to read how we have plenty of scams on Bitcointalk, come and check them out. Discussions from Meta and B&H should also be considered as well as important stuff going on in the local subs.",

      "body": "For someone like me who spends a lot of time here anyhow, I wouldn't be all that interested in reading the blog. I think the target audience therefore should be changed from existing users, and aim to bring new users in. Since, this sounds more like a newsletter for existing users, but I can't imagine that'll be all that popular giving time. The novelty will wear off. That said I can see it being useful for users that don't send a lot of time on here, especially not daily users. As for the local languages I imagine you'd find prominent figures in the local sections willing to do some work for you if this did catch on. So, initially it might be difficult to be inclusive with the local sections, but over time, and will popularity you probably wouldn't have much of a problem with it.",

But it's also good that I never thought about it before, but I don't expect this idea to be widely approved by users. Definitely not needed. However, it could potentially attract new users if it was implemented the correct way. Although, I don't think many prospective users would be all that interested prior to signing up to the forum. So, I'm not completely sold on the idea. One thing for sure is; it wouldn't hurt to do something like this. I know Cyrus was planning on doing videos highlighting top threads or whatever, I just don't think it's entertaining enough, especially for a video format. A blog might have slightly more success, but ultimately people aren't going to be reading your blog, they'd much rather read the material direct. So, I think it all depends on how's it implemented I think.",
