The primary ones are MA, EMA, BB etc while the secondary indicators are the ones that shows volume and oscillation.At least, you will have one indicators from primary indicators and another one from secondary indicators.",

All you need to know is dates of halvings and watch moving averages although this bear market bitcoin went below the supporting 200 WMA for the first time and remains there so maybe MAs are also a bad indicator.All those bullshits like a cup and handle, death crosses and such are a waste of time and effort. I remember how in 2018 and 2019 people were always wrong with these things. They'd say that there's a cross coming on 4h chart and it didn't do anything because how many people watch only 4h and decide what to do based on that? Or people were saying there's a double bottom and there was a third bottom coming.",

It is true for all investment, not for Bitcoin as it is not an exception. If you choose a good asset for investment, DCA can help you to invest successfully.Hence if in future, Bitcoin has less volatility than now, it is still a good investment and DCA will still be helpful. I am discussing about Investment in Bitcoin, not trading with Bitcoin.If you're discussing about trading with Bitcoin, I agree that DCA is not best but it can be helpful if you trade with spot. If your trades are wrong, DCA can help you in spot trading too.",

      "body": "QuoteInvestment is better than trading and with investment, nothing is better than dollar cost averaging ....For me this not true - first half of this sentence and second half too. It depends what goals you define. My first goal right now is learning and for this purpose trading is much better than investing on the long term. What should I learn if I wouldn't try to earn in trading? I learn much more if I buy and sell on a daily basis, which I call trading. DCA is easy understandable. Not much to learn about it. So it's quite useless for me right now. Of course trading means learning to loose too. But what else does DCA? If you were able to find the best point to enter a trade, this will be much better than any DCA ... and there are some strategies inbetween ... DCA may help to reduce risks, but mathematically it's not the best solution to get maximal earnings. Don't misunderstand me please, I do not suggest to avoid DCA, it's a good thing for people without much money, to which I belong too. But if you are saying, nothing is better than that, you are wrong. What would you do, if you have 20'000 BTC and willing to get some more? DCA? Maybe not.",

I think with crypto the best filter would be a liquidation chart. Usually when there is massive liquidations there is a good chance of a reversal.

If you are not too actively trading with 5-min, 15-min or 30-min chart, you won't have to use too many indicators. Applying many indicators can mislead you to what actually is going on the market. Look at fundamentals is better and with fundamentals it means you should invest, not trade.QuoteYou can never make accurate market predictions using only one indicator. However I can say based on your question if I was asked to use an indicator I would use the RSI indicator.Precisely, all predictions are wrong no matter how many indicators you use for predictions. However, a trend is a friend and if you believe Bitcoin is a trend of human civilization, it won't be stopped and you can hold it and enjoy profit. You won't have trade or make predictions and feel pressure, headache because your predictions are not accurate.Quote from: palle11 on February 08, 2023, 06:16:59 PMThe indicator that I think I prefer is support and resistance.

Strong resistance will become strong support and strong support will become strong resistance after each trend change.",

At the spot when their is volatility or bull , support and resistance doesn't change. It still remains there and not change until the price hit. This is the point I'm making that it doesn't move from such point where you have calculated it unlike other lagging indicators.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on February 10, 2023, 10:27:19 AMStrong resistance will become strong support and strong support will become strong resistance after each trend change.This is true and a fact because when the reversal happens then support and resistance also reverses, so you are correct on this",
