      "body": "Well, I see it. There's no need to be curious about everything when the date is April 1. Just look at the feature that we're seeing from the forum made by theymos.Â  It's not really a big matter to be wary about and let everyone enjoy and don't cut the fun. I checked its counterpart, coingecko and see if there's also some April fools changes but nothing they have.",
