  "content": "***EDIT 10/12/2022***I edit the first post to sum up events occurred later and new information.Updated information regarding my issue can be found in my complaint to Stake's license provider here: https://imgbb.com/hBnmgC2CasinoGuru's thread about my case is here: https://casino.guru/stake-casino-player-s-account-has-been-blockedAs you can see, even though they managed to confirm that the documents I provided to stake were legitimate, the complaint was rejected with the following motivation: \"The player from Italy has been accused of opening multiple accounts. The casino blocked his account while the player still had funds in it. The casino stated that the player's account was linked to multiple other accounts and also that the player had provided questionable documentation. Upon looking into the matter, it was determined that there was no evidence to suggest that the player's documents were not legitimate. However, the player had only used their account for sports betting. As we do not currently have enough insight into sports betting and sports betting platforms, the complaint was rejected.\"***END EDIT***Dear all,I write in hope of finding help. At the beginning of November my Stake account was suspended and all transactions, including withdrawals, were blocked because I was accused of multi-accounting. Since I am the only one using my account and I only have one account I wasn't worried, at first. I thought: \"Stake manages an absurd amount of money, why would they block my funds (around 900â‚¬)?\". I thought it was an honest mistake. But almost 20 days have passed and I'm running out of options and faith. I tried to talk with Stake's representatives through the official channels but all my communications attempts were unsuccessful. I also tried to message Stunna twice but in 2 weeks I've got no answers. Let me concisely recap my story as a Stake user. My Stake username is genji87.I first opened my Stake account last August using a referral from one of Stake's affiliates. I verified my account up to level 3 from the start providing personal information, proof of identity and proof of address, which were all accepted quickly without any problems.I had no problems until around the last decade of September when my betting limits were drastically lowered. I asked support for information but I didn't get any, they said it was not up to them and solely in the hands of the odds provider. Without receiving any sure information, I assumed that I was limited because I betted on some low-level sports events. I was told by support to keep betting and that my limits would be re-evaluated shortly. Hoping to get my limits changed, I continued playing and during October I exclusively betted prematch at very low odds on prime-time events like the Champions League and the major European soccer leagues. Obviously, I have records of all these bets and I can support my statements.On November 3, Stake suspended my account. I asked accounts@stake.com for information and they replied that: \"Due to a repeated breach of Stakeâ€™s Terms of Service regarding multi-accounting, all functionality on your account has been removed. You will not be able to use Stake in any capacity, including to place bets and any transactions. Any future accounts that are created that are linked back to this account, or any other account, will receive the same restrictions.\" Asking for further information I was told that the decision was final and would not be reviewed. I was not given any chance to prove my good behaviour.So now I can't use the platform and most importantly I cannot withdraw my funds.As I said, at first I thought it was a mistake. So I wondered what could have triggered Stake's alerts and I probably should say that during the time I used Stake I also used another betting platform and made numerous transactions between the two. This other platform, OrbitX, doesnâ€™t assign personal crypto addresses to their users, so every time I made a transaction between Stake and Orbit, the address would be different. Also these Orbit addresses would naturally be used by other players which have nothing to do with me. So, maybe Stake systems think that I have multiple accounts because I made transactions between my Stake address and these other addresses that were not only mine? Attempting to prove this, I downloaded from both Stake and Orbit the transaction history for my accounts and I sent them to Stake's support highlighting the fact that there is an almost perfect correspondence between the two. The only transactions that are not between my Stake and Orbit accounts are a few transactions with my Binance account. To account for those I sent Stake support a screenshot of my Binance address and a selfie of me with the page opened on my PC.I am really worried because I now have around 900â‚¬ stuck on Stake that I cannot withdraw. It is not a great amount of money but it is very important to me. I am keeping my temper under control but as you can imagine I am quite upset.I don't understand Stake's claim. And I don't exactly know how I can prove my good behaviour but I am of course available and I would happily provide any kind of evidence necessary.Thanks in advance to anyone out there willing to help me out.",

Do you have any idea about how I can prove that their accusation is false? Beside what I already told them IÂ  mean (read below).QuoteQuote from: acroman08 on November 20, 2022, 12:40:45 PMthe problem here is they don't really know that what you claim is true and even if you say that other people are using the same address, they'd assume that you are lying. from their perspective, several accounts are using the same address to send or receive cryptocurrency.I'm not sure I explained the situation properly. Or maybe I don't fully understand your answer. I'll try to explain it differently.I have just one Stake account and just one Orbit account. The thing is, the Orbit account is not linked to a fixed ERC-20 address, it varies.So when I withdrew from Stake to Orbit the transactions would not have always the same address as destination. And when I deposited to Stake from Orbit the transactions would not have always the same starting address. But the Stake account was always just one and with a fixed address. I never had more than one account.To prove them that I'm telling the truth, I already sent Stake staff the transactions lists of my Stake and Orbit account to show that even if the orbit address was not always the same the transactions were always from \"me\" to \"me\". But as I said, I've got no answer.Anyway, I have no indication that this is the reason why my account was suspended. I'm just assuming this is the cause because I can't imagine anything else and Stake never explained it to me.This whole situation seems absurd to me. I'm a novice in the gambling world but it really seems absurd to me that they can block my money over something like this!",

Why don't you create new accounts on that Orbit site and prove that different people get the same ETH address, or get some of your friends to do it, so that you don't get accused of multi accounting by Orbit as well? Does Orbit have any support docs or a FAQ page where it's mentioned that ETH and other crypto addresses are reused?Â  Quote from: genji87 on November 23, 2022, 08:10:45 AMLet me add a few screenshots I am sorry but I don't see what this is supposed to prove. Even if that shows a connection between your Stake account and your Orbit account, that can't prove you aren't using multiple other Stake accounts as well. I am not saying you are. I am just saying it's not proof that you aren't. And like I said previously, if Orbit gives the same address to multiple people, it looks like you are multi accounting from Stake's perspective if money is coming in and going out from different Stake accounts.Â  Â  Proof where Stake.com is lie and they dont send proofs about Multiple account:https://www.askgamblers.com/casino-complaints/stake-casino-hold-11xrp-deposit",

Or maybe I don't fully understand your answer. I'll try to explain it differently.I have just one Stake account and just one Orbit account. The thing is, the Orbit account is not linked to a fixed ERC-20 address, it varies.So when I withdrew from Stake to Orbit the transactions would not have always the same address as destination. And when I deposited to Stake from Orbit the transactions would not have always the same starting address. I don't think that's the reason. Ethereum works differently from bitcoin as it is account-based and not UTXO-based, but I see no reason why you wouldn't be able to deposit and withdraw to different addresses. When Bitcoin is concerned, it's recommended not to reuse the same addresses. So generating a new one for each transaction is a normal way to use bitcoin. Â  However, there could be issues here because of that other service that you use - Orbit. Are you sure that different people are given the same addresses? For example, if I opened an account there, would I get the same address as you or some other client of theirs? If that is the case, and there are other Orbit users who also have accounts on Stake, I would understand why they might think you are all the same person.I'm not sure this is the reason for the suspension of my account. Since I haven't got sure info I have to guess. I am quite sure that other people use those orbit addresses because looking at those addresses on etherscan there are a lot of transactions that I didn't make. **edit: I just confirmed this with Orbit' support, see below**Quote from: Pmalek on November 27, 2022, 09:40:06 AMOther then that, are you sure you didn't use a VPN or someone from your household doesn't also gamble on Stake? Maybe a second account was created after the first one got limited?This I can exclude 100%.Quote from: Pmalek on November 27, 2022, 09:40:06 AMQuote from: genji87 on November 21, 2022, 03:13:40 PMI already sent Stake all the \"evidence\" I could think of.

Â  Â I know and I agree. The problem is that there isn't a way to prove that I only have one account. Or at least none that I can think of. It seems to me that it's unprovable.I sent them and published here those screenshots mostly out of desperation.To my understanding, there is an easy way to clarify this issue once and for all. If multiple people share addresses on Orbit and also have account on Stake, it should be enough for Stake to KYC those accounts. Or am I missing something?",

Quote from: genji87 on November 27, 2022, 10:29:12 AMI just asked Orbit support about the addressesshttps://ibb.co/CVQJtWv Since they are asking customers to post a hash (transaction ID), it does indeed seem like addresses are being reused among different clients. Now, it's a matter of checking with Stake if that could be the reason why they believe you are using multiple accounts. Can you post a link to the Orbit exchange? I would like to create a dummy account and compare my ETH deposit address to yours. Other people can do it as well if they want.Quote from: genji87 on November 27, 2022, 10:29:12 AMTo my understanding, there is an easy way to clarify this issue once and for all. If multiple people share addresses on Orbit and also have account on Stake, it should be enough for Stake to KYC those accounts. Or am I missing something? Yes, but the problem with KYC is that a lot of private data has been hacked, leaked, or sold in different places. Someone could be using ID cards that belong to someone else or you could pay someone in a 3rd-world country a few bucks to do the KYC instead of you.",

When the trouble began, even if I wasn't asked for any document, I tried to send them the income statement (to bring my account to level 4) but got no answer from them.To be precise, I can log into my account and talk to live chat but live chat only directs me to mail support, which doesn't answer me.I tried to bring my case to Casinoguru but so far nothing happened. I'll bring it to Askgamblers too. Thanks for the suggestion and for your interest, this whole story it's bringing me down and it's quite refreshing to find someone that doesn't ignore/dismiss/accusesofbeingascammer you. When you say so far nothing happened on Casinoguru, you mean no representative from Stake has replied there either? It will be very interesting to see how your case is handled on Askgamblers, because I don't understand why nobody from Stake bothers to reply here despite your topic and your posts on their thread, this is not professional at all for a casino hiring dozens of people to advertise them here, I don't understand their point in doing that if they don't give a good picture of themselves at the end.Quote from: Pmalek on November 27, 2022, 10:47:58 AMQuote from: stakecomisscam on November 27, 2022, 10:11:01 AMProof where Stake.com is lie and they dont send proofs about Multiple account:https://www.askgamblers.com/casino-complaints/stake-casino-hold-11xrp-deposit First of all, that's a totally different case (maybe it's yours), so it has got nothing to do with this one.
