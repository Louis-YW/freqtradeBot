  "content": "One day I followed my uncle is a politician to meeting, they could not allowed us to seat exactly where meeting was taking place, because other politician came with their drivers, what I'm telling you is life story, when the meeting started we were hearing different contributions from different person, because it's during election period, after the meeting food and other times was saved to aid's who came with them,But one stronger politician drive could not accept it found and I became furious because of he rejected the food, I did same thing when the reached to my turn, I rejected the food.Other people who came with their boss eat the food, do you know that since that day we that came with different politicians have not meet with each other and personally myself don't go a political meeting with my uncle everytime and that day was my first time going out for political meeting with him, suddenly I went to shopping I meet with the strong politician drive, i could not recognize him, i never knew he was looking at me until he called me, from the process of greeting he passed information to me that do I know that those guys that eat the food all have died, I asked him if what caused the death is the food or any other thing, he said that it's because of the food that his boss sacked him because of he rejected the food, i asked him again how of those drivers is alive, he said none is living today, I was shocked, I began to think for something that has for some months ago, is it how have die for something I don't know.I not asked my uncle and since that day am still in cooperation with my uncle.Politicians can not be trusted, i don't if the guy I meet who give me information is saying reality or it's information he is using to blackmail me or not, what's your take in this information, do we need to trust politicians.",

It is something that has happened before. Even though all this sounds a little bit dramatic and unrealistic, I would not go further and claim that OP is lying, the world we live in is too big and on internet we can find all kinds of people, with all kinds of family members and political links. Anyways, the point OP is trying to establish may be accepted by some and rejected by others, depending on culture and out personal experiences with our local politics. It is very relative.",

My question is why would these politicians kill their aids and drivers? Did you people hear any information that should have been secret? I know ritual killing still exists in Africa because I have read news about killing for money or power. It might be possible that the people that were poisoned were for rituals to win elections. Generally African politics especially the sub-Saharan region is very dirty. African political space is characterized by desperation, violence, and greed. Politicians can do anything to grab power. They don't care about the consequences of their action because they are desperate to loot the resources of the country. It is risky to associate with corrupt politicians because their thoughts and actions are always evil.",

But yes, most of the politicians today really cannot be trusted. And although your story may seem hard to believe, such cases really do happen. This is because world of politics is such a messy place. A lot of things that we don't expect to happen normally on our daily lives happens behind the scenes. Deals with huge businessmen/people and political parties happen and sometimes even with some illegal organizations. This is because most of the politicians out there are desperate for money and influence that they badly need to secure positions and gain power. Which is why in some places, accepting bribes branching out from top government officials to the lowest becomes the norm.",

How many years ago? Did any news or Media Covered this news? Can you please add any references? I cannot think this kind of thing can happen in real life. I mean, Someone mixing poison in food and distributing them to kill innocent people who came to support their political leader. If this is true, There must be some news media that will cover this news. This is not a regular thing that happens in everyday life.Now come to 2nd point. All politicians are not the same. You cannot blame everyone for some countable politicians. I used to hate politics (I still do). But, at some point, I feel I should be a politician to fix some issues. If no one from people steps up to fix societal problems, How will those issues be solved? You can try to resolve any issues by yourself. But, Political power gives you more opportunity and especially funds as well. You must be careful with the funds and ensure you don't waste them. Most importantly, don't loot them. One of my school friends became a politician last year. I am proud of him. He helped many poor people and did many other things that I don't remember now. Government always sends some help to needy people. But, Needy people can't get it due to bad politicians. As a politician, You have to ensure those helps get by who deserve it most.",
