Try check the transaction id, though coinbase is an exchange, maybe you make use of a feature you don't know about while using the exchange or probably sent to a wrong address, if you target a different address but sent to another one you don't have access to, then am sorry to inform you that your fund is lost because bitcoin transactions are irreversible, then try to provide other necessary information about how it all happened and what exactly you did that led to that",

If you are sending it yourself from Coinbase to your wallet, meaning you are the one sending it, how it can be lost?Perhaps you might have send it to a wrong address. And it will help us if you can send the tx like going to https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/<then put your address of destination here>",

Something went wrong when you started sending because if you do the right thing then it is impossible for your bitcoins to be lost and not received. You don't share any details so it's difficult for the community to provide answers unless you link the image during the submission process. If you send to an unknown address then there is no chance of recovery and even if you know the address and can access the owner's social media, it also depends on whether the recipient wants to return your bitcoins or not.An important lesson that we can take from what happened to you is that must be careful and always be careful when using an exchange to send the bitcoins you have. I think it's more your own personal fault than the exchange you use, maybe some users have explained some tips that you can do, but I think it was your mistake in sending so it will be difficult to recover.",

If you want to move your Bitcoins from Coinbase to your wallet, of course, you have to copy the address from your wallet. Maybe if you put your transaction address or TX here there will be members who can help you see it.This error could occur due to your fault. or maybe your device has been infected with a virus.Don't expect much, but if it can come back to you. I hope you get it back.",

Welcome to the forum and sincerely people do get answers to their questions or solution to their problems here. But before they will get such help, they will be able to make the community understand their problems.With what you did in OP, you might never have an answer to your questions. You have acknowledged that you sent your coin to the wrong address. How did you know? What you need to do is to paste the tx id here or you check it out on explorer, then you will have a clear understanding of where your coin went to. I guess you have an account with coinbase, maybe you have to chat their support.",
