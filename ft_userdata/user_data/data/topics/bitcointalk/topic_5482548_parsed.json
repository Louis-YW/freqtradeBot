If you are Bitcoin enthusiast, I am sure you love decentralization and censorship resistance. So you will be against censorship even it is censorship against Ordinals.The problems are now there is no other better way for Ordinals to operate on so if in future, Bitcoin developers can build up that space for Ordinals, like off-chain, layer 2, Ordinals migrate to their new better homes, Bitcoin mempools and on chain transactions will be better than now.Generally I am against censorship like Eligius mining pool, Lukedashjr and Jack Dorsey proposed to do.",
