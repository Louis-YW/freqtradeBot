It's only fake rumour created by shitty youtubers. I will never ever believe with what have said by yuotubers. Almost all of youtubers are shady as fuck as they are only creating more and more fake news and sensations to get viewers and like for their videos. You must not blindly believe with what already said by youtubers.",

His developers migrated to $NEAR and Candle labs and these projects have grants programs set up for developers. NEAR for example is giving away millions of dollars and $CNDL is giving away a piece of the protocol itself, a stake in the chain.",

I get that Do Kwon needs to say stuff like this because he is the project owner and he needs to try to keep the hope up, the more help he gets the easier it would be for him, he would prefer it if people would buy it and make it repegged themselves without him doing anything, so he is trying to make it liked more and more and trying to gain some attention.But, we all know that it won't work that way, we all know that it is going to be a problem. So, we should be focusing on the reality and not the dream he has and not the thing he wants us to do because that won't be working.",

First of all we need to see if the re-peg is really happening and to be honest i highly doubt that. At the moment UST is at around 0.05 USD per token so i there is a huge buy pressure needed in order to get the price back up to 1 USD. If they are trying to re-peg it to the USD price via some other kind of mechanism or a relaunch of the token or something like that than this would be also bad for everyone that is still holding UST because then their old UST are worthless or not worth that much.Even if the re-peg works i think there is still a lot of trust that has been lost and will be very hard to get back.",

Do not put all of your life savings or anything like that into just coin. Of course there could be some stuff where it requires you to invest bigger amount than usual, but not all, never all of it.I personally feel like this needs to be written everywhere, lately binance started to ask questions like \"are you sure you are withdrawing for right reasons\" and warn everyone of fake places and scammers and all of that. But, they are forgetting the golden \"do not put all of your money into just one place\" thing and that is needed for everyone. If you are doing that, and then it crashes like Luna, you kind of deserved it.",
