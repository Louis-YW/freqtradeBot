I can remember that both were accepted up to a certain point where we were no longer seeing the old notes. If they can hold on to this, then the money scarcity that we are currently facing will gradually reduce since no one will be afraid of holding the old note and not being able to use it.",

The truth about this whole scenario is that politics is involved in this action,they all know what they are  doing. Last time like you said redesign of 100 was given enough time for proper circulation before it was gotten rid off. They use their selfish interest to suffer the masses for no reason,if not why the rush to end the swap. All these nonsense is done by the APC leaders just to have more advantage over PDP to manipulate the forth coming election.",
