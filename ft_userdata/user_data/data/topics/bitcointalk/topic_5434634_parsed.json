For such large payments, you should generally use on-chain transactions. Anyway, I guess you wouldn't mind paying a premium fee for such a high-value transaction to place it in the first block in the mempool, so LN's instant payment settlement wouldn't be a huge advantage.Also, the larger the payment (value-wise), the higher fees you pay on the Lightning Network.",

Of course, Lightning tries to split the payment and use multiple routes, but much larger sums than what you mentioned can already fail.You can work on your 'connectivity' by opening more and larger channels. Once you're better connected, your routing abilities will improve.More about routing payments here: https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook/blob/develop/08_routing_htlcs.asciidocAlso look at uncertainty of balances and pathfinding complexity.",

LN's advantage is being able to make many transactions at low fee after opening a channel (which requires an on-chain transaction) once.",

      "body": "The Lightning Network is a second-layer protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enables fast and inexpensive micropayments. It is primarily designed for small transactions between two parties, but it is also possible to use it to send larger amounts of BTC. However, the maximum amount that can be sent in a single transaction is limited by the capacity of the channel, which can be increased by adding more funds to the channel.Sending large amounts using the Lightning Network may have some advantages over using the normal Bitcoin blockchain. For example, Lightning Network transactions are much faster and cheaper than on-chain transactions, which makes them a good option for frequent, low-value transactions. Additionally, the use of payment channels allows for greater privacy and security, as the transactions are not recorded on the blockchain and are only visible to the parties involved in the channel.",

On-chain, you could pay 350 satoshis for sending 35 BTC, if your transaction would be small. In LN, it would be 0.00001% fee, so you wouldn't find any serious node with such fees. Mainly, LN fees is what determines how many coins will be stored inside that network, because when on-chain fees are cheaper, there is no reason to do that. Also, if you don't have any channel, then LN will be always more expensive, because \"LN=on_chain_fee+ln_fee\" in this case.",

When the total capacity of the network is about 5 thousands bitcoins (with larger channels being a few hundreds bitcoins worth), you understand that you're about to have some trouble sending that monstrous amount. Think of it like this: blockchain comes with a storage cost which increases according to your transaction's size (in bytes), and lightning comes with a routing cost which increases according to your payment's size (in sat). If the storage cost overcomes the routing cost, use lightning. If the routing cost overcomes the storage cost, use the blockchain.",

Theoretically, you could send it via Lightning (if you find a channel) but I don't see any reason to use Lightning it's simply wasn't meant for this. LN is for small, instant payments.

The maximum channel capacity of the network is currently around 0.16 BTC, which means that a single payment channel can only hold up to that amount. However, users can open multiple channels with different partners to increase their overall capacity.It's also worth noting that the Lightning Network is still a relatively new technology and the amount of BTC that can be transferred may change in the future as the network continues to evolve and improve.So, to answer your question, it is possible to transfer large amounts of BTC using the Lightning Network, but it would involve opening multiple payment channels and routing the transaction through several different nodes on the network.",
