This is also the times when scams that use bitcoin as a mask to their true intentions are on the double, they've been doing it ever since and I don't think that we're going to see any subsiding of those kinds of scams so hopefully people are ready for these kinds of stuff, those scams will always be easily identifiable anyways, just ask them directly if what they're selling you is a scam and if they get mad then you know it's definitely a scam.",

      "body": "Yes this is pretty common sense. Usually in a bear market there is no new retail adoption so harder to get affiliates referrals. When there is a big boom and you pay Google for their adwords or advertise on twitter or elsewhere you will have success in your referrals.I think most platforms these days unbanned bitcoin advertisements, maybe Instagram is the only one that prohibits advertising bitcoin content. So if you can find a highly effective way of generating tons of views and turn those into clicks which turn into actual members that join then you should do pretty well.",

Well, people are getting very excited when they see the crypto market going up, and up thus, many new investors get excited as well, and will invest into crypto.As an promoter, I guess it's the best time to promote some programs that you're affiliated with as long as it isn't a scam website. I will not any particular websites that has an affiliate program, but there are many of those who are still online until now, and as an promoter, you take advantage of it. You said it already that it the conversions will be higher as more people will jump, and will invest into crypto as they are excited. I guess it's a no brainer already that you need to promote the program even more when the bull run starts though in general, I think people are still promoting those programs whether the market is in a bull run, or the opposite of it. Nevertheless, as long as you are promoting legit websites then there's nothing wrong about it.",

I recall clearly hearing about bitcoin for the first time during the previous bull run; the news was everywhere on every site, and many individuals hoped they had bitcoin in stock to benefit from the bull run. Before I joined the bitcoin community, I had no idea this happened every four years. This is the best time for such programmes, and you will make a lot of money promoting them; just be honest and make everything transparent.",

We don't because people will definitely troop into the cryptocurrency industry during the bull run and take advantage of the ignorance of the newbies who will join the market at the peak of the bull run.If you are so sure the bull run will come, please buy bitcoin now such that during the bull, you will be joyous not to think about anything scam affiliate program to promote.",

Of course, once the market turns bullish, people slowly start returning to crypto, and you'll have a huge audience that could potentially sign up for the affiliates you are promoting. The bull season is the happiest time in the crypto market, as people see almost everything as an opportunity to earn a decent profit and to entertain themselves as well.What business industry your affiliate falls by the way?",

OP what kind of affiliate programs are you referring to?Considering the Bull Run and the Halving event so close the market campaigns are gonna on the peek, those lefties are waiting for an opportunity to return back, TBH what they are expecting seems like not very likely to happen as most people still believe in some of the macro speculations that before moving forward to the ATH market will crash hard once too 26k to 22k and its only possible with an upset in the ETF approvals.considering the topic's nature I do belive that business owner in the crypto industry do realize the fact that Pre-Bullrun market campaigns are more successful and more people get attractive due to the bullish sentiments and FOMO.",

For marketers, exchanges, or affiliates is the best moment because they tend to offer offers with interesting problems. This includes bullish times and price moves up. If we are a trader I think there is no time to look for affiliates. I will take the moment, capitalizing on price movements. Either use a short-term or long-term system by holding Bitcoin. Then I will never join the affiliate program. This is too risky, I will manage my own funds. I will not entrust my funds to others. There tend to be many crypto scams and until now the victims are always growing.",

The chances for conversions will be higher as Bitcoin popularity will already be in mind of people. Definitely! The best time to promote Bitcoin is when its price is doing very well, like currently that we're coming up, it is very much easier to talk to someone about it than if we were going down. But I will strongly suggest that in all we do, there should be transparency. While you try to tell more people about Bitcoin, let them know about volatility too. Also, many people are fond of giving the wrong idea as if Bitcoin is all about investment, let them know that it is a currency which is better than fiat; you can send money to anyone in the world without documents and third parties, discuss decentralization, etc. Because it is equally important that we do the promotion rightly.",

Bull run truly attracts new people into this market and they will have more interest to join this market than in a bear market with many bad, positive news, fud and price usually decreases with time.You can earn good if you are a big influencer and people follow your social media, Youtube channel, website, blog will have reasons to open their new accounts through your affiliate link. If you are not an influencer, you will not have people opens their accounts with your referral link.

Of course when the price has peaked it will become a hot topic that continues to be discussed by various international media with such a high increase at this time, therefore affiliate programs are likely to be even higher to promote, you should also pay attention to the more bitcoin becomes a hot topic trend among the public, fraud will be even more rampant even with affiliate programs there are always indications of fraud where you will not be paid for choosing the wrong affiliate program.Make sure when you want to promote affiliates what your skills are, whether it's from a high-traffic website or something else, although this will increase someday when the price goes up it is not easy for an affiliate program those who follow your references, maybe you already know how and that's what to do.",

Many people who didn’t know about Bitcoins, usually join during this time into the Bitcoins industry. Hence there is huge chance that if you promote your Bitcoin affiliate links, then they will join it. During the bull time, every where there is demand to accumulate the coins, hence many people would be trying out new places to buy the coins for cheap. So at that time, if you promote some marketplace to buy the coins, then definitely people will join it.",

If you are not promoting referal from exchanges that want to have newbies come to their exchange to buy bitcoin, the rest are mostly scams and you don't want to be called out if things doesn't go as planned. If you are from a country that take cases serious, you may be arrested for spreading false information, I hope you deal with the right affiliated companies to avoid futitr problems.Another thing I think you should do is to have a good background of bitcoin,understanding it well and teaching them is a good thing. If you are lucky, they can buy you some bear of btc, I see some YouTube channels and other bitcoin content creators add btc wallet for their viewers and if they love your content, they will dash you some sats for bear and imagine you have a large base fans that like your videos, you will make more create of bears in sats after you combine all the outputs together. You need good speaking skills and knowledge of bitcoin to achieve this aspect.",
