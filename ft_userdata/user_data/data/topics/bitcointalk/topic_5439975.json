  "content": "Belonging to this forum has some benefit which includes bitcoin education, financial intelligence, investment, interpersonal skills, and so on. But I observed that there are some improvements in some areas of my life that I need to share.Creativeity: The forum standard for post quality is very high. It is not like other social media platforms where you can post without planning or putting in the effort. Senior members in the forum are always willing to criticize and correct such substandard posts. This means you need to always think outside the box if you want to be productive in this forum. The pursuit of excellence in the forum will unconsciously spur members to be creative in thinking and writing.Innovation: This forum celebrates positive innovation. Staying around this form for some time now has made me innovative in my daily life. I am no longer content anymore with the status quo. This forum has helped me to have the feeling that I can do more or there is room for improvement.Giving: I saw members giving selflessly to the campaign manager Yahoo and I was touched. Recently I saw a thread for support of victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria and unconsciously I have started learning that I must not help only my relatives but I must extend help even to persons I don't know.Law-abiding: If you live in a place where laws are not obeyed, you will appreciate the forum. It indirectly makes you respect other people's work so that you will always acknowledge them by referencing them when you lift their work and also obey the rules in the forum. Teaching me that nobody is above the law is priceless.",

The difference is clear, and the rules are simple.",

I read some comments on a user's profile claiming that they were spamming the forum with low-quality contributions and that other members were being banned for plagiarism, making it impossible for anyone to duplicate other people's work or content from outside websites. This forum provides a lot of knowledge-based assistance to its users, particularly for those who want to learn and develop. I have already learned a lot on this site.",

Unlike when you read articles or blogs about cryptocurrencies stuff, you will find that no one will oppose their opinions. no matter what they say and what they think about certain coins, that's why there are lots of newbies who fell into their trap, they were lured to invest in a pump-and-dump coin. If someone posts his opinion regarding a certain project here, he will be corrected or he will be rebutted if he is saying the wrong impression about the project he is promoting.",

One disadvantage of the forum is her heavy criticism which new newbies tends to pick up very quickly and continue same habits. As for the creativity, that's one of the positive impact and if you follow it up it'll definitely affect your life as you'll always been that one user that thinks outside the box while others are thinking alike. I think one of the benefits of bitcointallk is that it makes you want to stay informed (be current). With the frequent discussion of things happening around the world on the forum due to her members been stations at different parts of the world,, for you to be able to participate in discussion on the forum without looking foolish, you'll have to be informed and this affect other area's of life as well.",

You don’t need any crazy idea just to be a member. Be an organic member that shares knowledge and discuss with other user is enough to rank up but the speed of your rank varies on the quality of your post.Since there’s a lot of thread already existed in the forum. It’s very hard for newbie to think for a new concept for starting useful thread. But good thing there’s a merit thread here that can look on your post. I believe gathering merit to rank up is the main point of this thread that’s why OP come up to the list of OP perspective in the forum. Life on forum will be easier if you didn’t focus much on merit but rather on understanding the crypto since your knowledge will be the key to earn merit in the future.",

It does not focus only in crypto and in finances, but as well as the whole aspects in life that will make you equipped and become the best version of yourself.
