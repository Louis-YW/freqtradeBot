Share your opinion ... Highly AppreciatedI believe you are proposing a platform where products and services will be sold through p2p mode and the payment method will be cryptocurrency without the platform holding that cryptocurrency in a custodian wallet. Am I correct?If yes, I am sure I have seen a similar platform back in 2018 during ICO boom. As far as I remember, they had a MVP as well. I don't think they were able to finish the platform but this is something worth researching.",

So this way an EDeFi could be the next big thing, just think of it like amazon or flipKart of Bitcoin Trading",

The problem is, IIRC, such kind of platform/initiative was already discussed by someone else on the Project Development board and somewhere, a long ago and not once. Now I didn't hear anything about it at all. I did ask whether how this particular project will be developed, and where's the pain point of the market that could potentially choose this platform. For example, how do you attract buyers and sellers to your platforms? because things like Amazon already give a lot of convenients for a lot of users. And you didn't even explain the escrow and dispute resolution system about it, how could anyone have an assurance when they want to transact over the platform?",
