Anyone have idea???We cannot give you an idea unless you show us something and follow this format, including everything you have there, screenshots of conversations, deposits, and what they are accusing you of.You don't come here accusing a casino of scam, without a piece of detailed information about your issue, my guess is multi-accounting, so let's see if it is, by giving us all the information.Code:[b][color=black]What happened:: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Scammers Profile Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Reference Link: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Amount Scammed: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Payment Method: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Proof of Payment: [/color][/b][b][color=black]PM/Chat Logs: [/color][/b][b][color=black]Additional Notes: [/color][/b]",

I have no idea what to do. Anyone have idea???We don't have idea because you just have said they are scam plus those process of verifications that you've been through. There's no clear scam on that if they ask you for it because majority of the casinos these days are asking for it when they detect you do something suspicious on your account. Or the funds that you have just deposited seems to be suspicious for them. I don't know how they do that but it seems to be like that. They're obeying the rules of their government to detect money laundering if they're being used for it. You have the idea what to do and if they will ask for more of it, you just have to comply since you can't do that much on it but to follow and obey if your funds are there. Otherwise, it could be the reason robelneo said about multi accounting.",

They should just confiscate the bonus and refund the original deposit and not fully extend the waiting for KYC that will not gonna change their decision.I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news but it’s very hard to win a case against casino when it regards about multi account and bonus abuse because there’s no way to prove that you didn’t own other account while they have digital record of connection such as IP address and same device login.",

One thing I don't always like what gamblers does is that they always make account without passing kyc probably if they made deposit and started gambling at that point there will be no issues but immediately they have a serious winning to withdraw it the site in question would start requesting for their details at this point passing kyc is very difficult because the site will be very sensitive to detect errors or mistake to limits you from having access to the site. Note before going to signed up any sites always read their terms of service to ease you from stressing yourself. If I am not mistakenly they have ann thread or possibly contact their manager to help you look into this case with your solid evidence.",

I also provide picture of my ID too.Just to be sure we cover every ground, how possible is it that the blurry quality is because the image got compressed too much? Did you compress it to meet their maximum upload size? Can you perhaps snap them with different device? Or, something more simple, have you look at the image you uploaded again? Were they still clear?I'd be very happy if I can invite their representative here and they can answer directly, but unfortunately this is Stake, one of the most out of reach casino, they barely reply to invitations. Nonetheless, let me try to notify Symphonized... if he hasn't been aware of this case already, he's the one in charge of forwarding cases on this forum to Stake's team.",
