  "content": "Honestly, why would you want to take a 40% tax cut working for corporate America and paying Uncle Sam top dollar when you can get a 1099 as an independent contractor in pretty much any industry/trade as an agency and utilize tax write offs on basically everything you spend money on. I mean not everything but most things you can write off. Stretching your dollar as far as you can within the legal tax code is how the rich get richer. Mostly utilizing real estate, and tax savings vehicles like life insurance cash value policies, etc. Does anyone have any great tips or tricks for maximizing your tax returns? American income tax is complete bs.",
