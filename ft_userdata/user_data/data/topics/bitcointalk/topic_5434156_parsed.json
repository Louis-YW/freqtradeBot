If bitcoin is recognized as a commodity, then it should be traded under the same rules as oil, gold and other similar goods. Therefore, bitcoin may be banned from trading on many crypto exchanges until these exchanges receive the necessary licenses.Where am I wrong?",

Therefore, bitcoin may be banned from trading on many crypto exchanges until these exchanges receive the necessary licenses.Where am I wrong?Well, the truth is that if Bitcoin is banned on centralized exchanges the price will rise significantly because it's good development for Bitcoin... Good development makes it bullish. Bitcoin has been \"reconfigured\" to react properly to news since it was captured in 2021 by those who mean well. The good news that will make it rise more significantly is when more people are trading it in decentralized peer-to-peer manner. Whatever they choose to call it doesn't really matter much so long as it's not true. The fact is that it's a decentralized system with an internal currency called Bitcoin.",

I don’t know yet what the consequences for bitcoin will be after the regulation. Trading on decentralized exchanges is impossible to control, but the founders of several large projects can be jailed, like with Tornado Cash, and I am sure that other projects will close down bitcoin trading very quickly.If the SEC recognizes the cryptocurrency as a share, then after that the project is closed. But I have not yet seen cases of cryptocurrency being recognized as a commodity.",

Its not like bitcoin is a commodity so US can stop all CEXes from trading it until its regulated as oil is. Its more like, when bitcoin will be regulated, it will be available to trade where oil/gold is available now.I mean ... you can buy 10 tones of coal from local reseller who will load it on his truck and deliver to your home so you can warm it in winter. This guy does not need a licence from US to sell it to you.",

Internet, Bitcoin and blockchain serve human, give them freedom and wealth.Perhaps they will launch laws to have clearer definitions and guidelines on cryptocurrency audits that can help more Big Audit companies to join and do their deals with big exchanges for audit contracts.",

This guy does not need a licence from US to sell it to you.I am sure that all these exchanges are subject to US regulations. In a few years, all the major crypto exchanges have also fallen into compliance with US regulations, although they are not required to do so. It is much more difficult to register on the commodity exchange. My point is that very few cryptocurrency exchanges will get licenses, but it will probably only be the biggest exchanges.",

The SEC don't even do their job right. There are many manipulations happening in the stock markets right in front of everybody and the SEC don't give a damn about it. Why would they care about crypto when they don't care about stocks? It is all a massive buzz.",

The reason they're panic is, they're leave their coins on the exchanges.Indeed there are several countries that prohibit Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and investment assets or even any type of transaction.However, with the development of the era and technology, some of these countries have thoughts of legalizing Bitcoin and utilizing the crypto industry as state income by imposing taxes on every transaction or trading platform for crypto in the country.If there really is a fear that bitcoin can no longer be traded within a country, then there are still several ways to be able to enter the crypto buying and selling platform to make transactions without the country's government knowing and detecting it.",
