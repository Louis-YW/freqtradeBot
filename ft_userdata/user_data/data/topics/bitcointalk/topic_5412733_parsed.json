  "content": "The news comes from Bangladesh that 4 people were arrested by RAB-5 (Rapid Action Battalion) for the purpose of illegal bitcoin trading. The news I read is in Bengali, and if I translate the news, then according to the news sources, those 4 people who are placed in Narshingdi are arrested not only for using bitcoin, though bitcoin is illegal in Bangladesh, but they are also being arrested because they are doing some kind of money laundering. According to the news, they first use some illegal and banned dating websites, then from other countries' people take dollars, then they convert those dollars into cash through the p2p method. Finally, they convert that cash into bitcoin again through the p2p method. So Bitocin is illegal, which means they did not pay taxes because of the p2p method, and RAB suspects they are involved in money laundering. So that's the overall news. Now my closing statement on this matter is that no doubt this arrest is a good job because these guys are scamming people and laundering money, but in this case, the news portal highlights bitcoin that it is illegally traded. What I do think is good. Because they choose illegal paths like dating websites and money laundering, but you can't use balmebitcoin for this. That's my opinion. What do you think about this news? Please share it with us. Thank you. News source.",

Using Peer to Peer trading method on a good platform is a good choice but if you do this, trade with old and trusted (high reputation point) trade partners. Trade with them, you are safer because their money are more likely from clean resources, not from money laundering resources.If you intentionally do money laundering, you know of the potential ending. Worse you also bring troubles to your trade partners.With Peer to Peer trades, follow two rulesDon't trade with newbiesChoose old and trusted trade partners (with good trading volume in the past, good account age, high reputation point, good feedback from past trade partners)",

I think that was the main problem about this case, they got arrested because of scamming, not trading Bitcoin in illegal country. The subject of this thread should be \"4 scammers on dating apps using Bitcoin got arrested\"Though it seems like a bad news to Bitcoin, but if we look on the bright side, Bitcoin actually help the police or blockchain analysis to find those scammers. If they're use Monero and trade it on decentralized exchanges, they would be safe",

You saying that got me thinking of the early days of these cat-fishing scams running rampant. With those emails people receive saying they can get money sent to them from a nigerian price. Atleast those sending the emails wouldn't get caught.These guys were doing this in a country which completely banned the use of bitcoin a couple of months ago from what I recall reading about Indian banks (Bangledesh specfically) for anyone doing these kind of transactions to and from their bank accounts.",

So I am guessing they are complete amateurs and by their clothes they are obviously not rich. Whatever money they were trading was probably small amounts. Nonetheless they got caught because their oppressive anticoiner government wanted to make an example out of someone in order to spook the rest of the population away from Bitcoin (and cryptocurrency in general).Its too bad. But it just goes to show why we need Bitcoin. Its regular people who get made an example of, its regular people who lose their money and its regular people who have to suffer financial slavery.Bitcoin is financial freedom. Thats why I hope this story will create more coiners in Bangladesh.",

This gives more privacy and such peeps turn into their so called action Center to do all the illegal stuff. Usually they are always photographed with whatever things collected from the criminal spot. But yeah it looks funny. I think they were using dating sites to collect the payment in the form of bitcoin or it’s even possible they were only distributing the money by sending to that site. So turning it into Money laundering process eventually. Anyways, news should have shaded more light to see whether it was serious matter or just some another funny scam.",
