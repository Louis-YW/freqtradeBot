  "content": "Hi allJust posting a problem I am having with Bustabit.  Essentially they are not processing a 120K bit withdrawal for me as I cannot \"authorize\" it from my email as I accidently deleted the temp email.  This is the letter I sent these guys explaining, what's a reasonable amount of time to wait and will they pay me? To date NO response over a relatively minor amount of money------Hi good afternoonI own the xxx account on BaBI wrote customer service this morning but thought I would follow up with a personal emailI processed a .12 BTC withdrawal this morning from the xxx BaB account and when I tried to access my (temp) email to authorize the withdrawal I could not as I inadvertently deleted the email account (by deleting browser history) and had not made a note of it.  When I try to log back in I am unsuccessful as I am asked to authorize the login in this email account that no longer exists so the .12 BTC withdrawal remains pendingI have attached a pdf screenshot of the xxx account withdrawals pageMy pw for the account is xxxMy most recent deposit came from this address: xxxAs I say, I don't have access to my temp email anymore because I deleted my history on the browser and forgot to write down the address, it was the xxxx domainCould you kindly process the pending transaction and either change my email to this one (xxx) or I can re register a new BaB account if you preferThank you",

Email verification for such withdrawal confirmation is always been that crucial operation which if they would really be believing that you dont have already access to that email. Totally that hard to believe on but well it would always falls down into their own jurisdiction and decision whether this one would be have some exemptions?",

Perhaps they are looking at it internally and what went wrong and what could be the solution in your problem.In any case, they have what we call a ANN thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2897545.0.You can post your issues there and hopefully they will reply.",

Never share your password with anybody other than you. No matter what’s the case is, don’t share your password.

However it goes, good luck with the issue.Yeah really good luck because until we hear the team side of the story we won't know what really at both ends,  and judging based on the current facts will be very unbiased,  so the best advice os for ops to still send a reminder to the team as a follow up email including all necessary evidence. If it be a casino like stay,  the balance will still be in the account until the right email code is entered before the balance deduction will be made,  and it that is the case why ops do not have much to worry about losing the money because in the long run he will either have to go through KYC to change to new email.",

Other solution is to request withdraw your balance on the wallet address that you previously use for withdrawal. This will surely verify that you are the original owner.",

But then some just decide to use the forum the way it suits them,  I am sure the ops could have still been around if his issues had not been resolved,  and more also we have to look back at something we must pay details to while answering or commenting on this thread going forward.",
