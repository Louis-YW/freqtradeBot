  "content": "FIFAMINER.COM is a staking concept forked by other staking Defi Projects from across the market with combining the best ideas for growth while still making a massive return on your investment. We started our brand, FIFA Miner, to create the safest, most profitable, sustainable, Defi Projects in the market. Daily ROI All Unstake fees stay in the contract. Daily ROI will range from 4% to 10% daily depending on the staking duration with your initial investment. We have added a compound feature as well that will add a new stake once you compound your profits from the original stake. We will be building a portfolio outside the protocol, during this growth phase we will insure allocate the right amount of capital in each sector before paying out earnings from our investment portfolio into the smart contract. In short, we will create self-sustainability in the short coming months. Deposits – 10% Fee Dividend collection – 10% Fee Compound – 0% Fee Referrals – 10% Fee Road Map FIFA Miner BUSD is phase 2 of our current ops! As we continue to boost the growth of FIFA Miner for BUSD, we will slowly begin to launch other miners for all coins! AVAX, BTC, DOGE, MATIC, SOL, ETH… the list goes on. Once we feel comfortable to the point that our BUSD project is stable and sustainable on its own, we will begin moving forward on the next coin.

I mean the fact that you can't even scam right makes me think that you should find something else to do. This is not something you will be good at.Then there's the fact that in your post history you have several exit scammed projects similar to this (busdhoney, busdbee, Dailyyields, babychick...) You didn't even bother to make new account.Also, this is not an altcoin, it's a service that scams people.",
