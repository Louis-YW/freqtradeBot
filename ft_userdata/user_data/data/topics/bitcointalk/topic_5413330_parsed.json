  "content": "Recognizing that the heat generated from mining equipment can become a intolerable, a discouragement and a challenge, it is in every miners benefit to find more beneficial uses for the heat energy from their equipment, rather than considering them totally as a waste. A forum member already has stated one use of the heat which can be recycled to heating homes, which can be beneficial for people in very cold places like Canada where their home require heating to also cut cost, some other applications where the harnessed heat from mining machine can be used are;(a)For heating water and food possibly.(b)for drying laundry and food that needs drying.Which other possible domestic use can you think of?",

But when we go to it the price of ASIC's tripled and not longer worked for us.I'm excited about the new water cooled rigs, that can really make the heat energy useful.Floor / baseboard heating, water heater, pool heater ground heating in greenhouses",

Using liquid cooling is fine, but do you want to have heated flooring during the summer? If not you have to have a 2nd water path to move the heat someplace else.Also, it adds complication. I have an air cooled miner I can put it anyplace where I can move enough air to keep it cool no though given to plumbing....-Dave",

And during the hot summer months you need to get more heat and humidity out of the space.This is the main problem with the heat, you need to get it out of the miner but at the same time you must be careful what air you get in also, so you will definitely need two circuits here, and then you have the distance if your greenhouse is like 50 meters from the room where you have the miners you need a lot of fans to push it, maybe dig a trench for the tubes so you don't lose that much heat but at the same time, you have to watch out if air goes above 30C not to ruin your plants, so another exhaust.A lot of pain in the ass if you're working on small-scale stuff, might be really enjoyable as a hobby if you like this stuff but probably at one point you will get bored playing around all day with settings and temps and fan speeds depending on how sunny is outside.",

Exhaust fans, intake fans, heat, humidity, CO2 generators, lights, water and nutrition. I was going to use the output of the dehumidifiers to drive the ASICs as it's filtered as well.",
