There's nothing to be used to reimburse its users. Many people are complaining on its official twitter account if they are willing to take off their mone from there site but since coinex has no money left, and it's still halted.

The exchange sites being operated by so many people. You can't be sure if all of enginers would never make mistke that can trigger the security breach of exchange sites. My guess if the priv key owned by this exchange site being leaked or compromised. RIP coinex. Will coinex declare itself to be bankrupt after this case?",

The story is still developing. Anyone affected? Please share your story.I havent that experience on using up CoinEx but i heard this platform and in speaking these breaches and hacks then its not really that a shocking news that one day there's one that pops out and this is why its neverbeen ideal not really that suggested/recommended for you to store up all of your funds on an exchange. Im even that skeptical on doing so even on Binance, how much more on not so popular platforms?They could always be having the chance on having those breaches or those issues on which it would really be leading on losing those funds but to be able to read up which they would really be having those kind of reimbursement or be giving back into those affected users then this is something that the good news where those users would really be looking for or really expect to happen.Good thing that they do have those back up funds just like that SAFU funds with Binance.Im wondering if the trust and credibility wont really be affected out just like on what Binance have in the past? I dont think so it would be similar but at least they did make out some good gesture and action which it is must thing.",

Can't believe people still keeping their coins on exchanges.It seems like it's not a popular exchange and is often used, so it's possible that many people don't use it, but there are still those who suffer losses, and I'm also one of those like you who don't use the exchange. But I agree with you that if you get into the habit of saving on an exchange for too long, the possibility of something like this happening is very high. Because it is difficult to predict, errors can occur, most likely done by someone inside, although hacking is also possible. It's certainly a wiser action to keep it in your wallet.",

They need to work very hard and put in measures to ensure that they don't get hacked again. Binance did it after their $30 hack and introduced the Safu Funds - if you're familiar with the \"Funds are Safu\" phrase, that's it. Bitfinix also was hacked in the post and the way they mitigated it was to introduce debt token and paid out affected users periodically. Today, the exchange is still operational.",

There are customers who are loyal to their exchanges. In this case, CoinEx said that they would refund those affected users but they're also assuring that no fund of customers has been touched. That's like a trusting words from them and I have seen this happen in Binance and that's why the word 'safu' became a trend even they were hacked and look at them now, still trusted by many traders.Quote from: Heulahee on September 13, 2023, 07:04:47 AMNowadays strong security can't even safe the exchanges.

Yes I said small because compare to how much money larger exchanges are losing when they got hacked, this is a small amount. Anyway, feel sad for those who are using this not-so-popular exchange, but we've said numerous times already that \"don't store your funds in your exchanges\" unless it's being used for trading. The problem is many people aren't following what many are saying because these exchanges have a feature where the investors can earn a certain percentage by storing their coins in their exchange (kind of staking). The good thing though is that they're reimbursing the lost funds... or not? Quote from: makishart on September 14, 2023, 12:08:07 AMLazarus goes crazy.
