  "content": "i'd like to share my opinion on a controversial topic and see what are the thoughts of bitcoiners here.the taproot soft fork was pushed too fast, unlikely past soft forks with over 95% of consensus.now it will have unintended consequences both for bitcoin layer 1 and layer 2:on layer 1, with the introduction of ordinal, now bitcoin's blockchain is getting bloated with useless jpegs, nfts, and it could possibly become worse: child porn, porn in general, violent images, death threats, images that aim to dox someone, etc. Politicians, legislators and other state parasites will try to use it as an excuse (regardless of whether it makes sense) to arrest people whom they don't like under the claim of \"sharing, transmitting child porn and other illegal content\". It does not matter if (1) you didn't put the image there, or if (2) the image can only be displayed special software that can read, parse and understand Inscriptions (or other silly protocol) so that what is there is just a bunch of bytes unless you have the proper software. None of that will mater if they want to starting arresting people to use bitcoin (of course this will not be the end of bitcoin, it will continue to exist, but certainly will be bad for many people).on layer 2, there is this horrible proposal called TARO, which makes use of taproot and pretends to bring digital assets to the LN, such as stablecoins, arbitrary tokens, nfts, etc. That way, people would be able to use the LN infrastructure to relay metadata of those digital assets, allowing folks to issue their shitcoin on LN. The LN protocol is decentralized, permissionless and anyone can use it without making the LN node public available or without revealing that you are actually using it, or with whom. It does not matter though: for regulators, it does not matter what you are using it for, they will say you are \"operating money transmitter services\" without a license, etc. Bring stablecoins (aka, shitcoins, fiat coins) to LN goes against the purpose of Bitcoin. If TARO enables that (as promised), it will just be another excuse for regulators to chase bitcoiners, node operators, and anyone using LN. Again, this will not be the end of LN, which is decentralized and will continue to exist, but this will cause harm to many.we would be better off undoing taproot via a fork with at least a 95% consensus threshold of full nodes and miners. This would probably take some years to implement a safe code to undo/block taproot; in the meantime, we would have to tolerate taproot in the blockchain.Also, I think these kinda of softforks should not happen anymore. Only forks that fix bugs, fix vulnerabilities, enhance security, but not forks that \"add cool features\".",

(or as the americans call it running a money service business) which has always put LN routers at risk even moving msats.. the reason governments have not chased after people that open up their msats for route utility. is becasue the amounts are too small to give a crap about chasing someone for a $2 profit per monthc. core are the defacto authority. every proposal has to go through them an be moderated out quick or sponsored in .. any other implementation brand ever trying to offer proposals not part of the core roadmap gets REKTd. allowing funcky new formats in that do not require nodes to be upgraded first to recognised the rules set of new formats is BAD. it means nodes are not verifying and validating the full blockchain data. SUPERBADgoing soft is a way that consensus strictness has been softened to allow possible bugs/trojan functions into bitcoin without any vetting review or prevention by the decentralised network. its done to bypass the requirement of full nodes to be ready to validate everything. its done to let core get their way while not allowing there centralised network to object to ite. anyone saying let it happen let it carry on. is revealing they dont care about bitcoins concept and protocols and just wants a certain group to remain the central point of failure, knowing a central point of failure will fail at some pointf. i do laugh how those central point adoration guys pretend there is no one controlling /authorising proposals. YET bitcoin is not AI.. its not self generating code..its done via devs. <-emphasisthere is an OBVIOUS group of devs sponsored by corporations, and its those corporate features that get added above any \"community\" desire(and no im not talking about volunteer contributors that just translate the GUI or grammar/spell check minor comments, im talking about paid devs with commit, merge and release candidate publishing privileges)yep devs write code. and we need to hold the accountable, review them, critique them.. not let them have \"god mode\" (soft access) to upgrades",

The writer argues that the Taproot soft fork was rushed and could have unintended consequences for both the Bitcoin network and its users. On the first layer, the writer fears that the introduction of ordinal could lead to the blockchain becoming bloated with illegal or inappropriate content, which could be used as an excuse by politicians and regulators to target people using Bitcoin. On the second layer, the writer is concerned about the TARO proposal, which could allow stablecoins and other digital assets to be transmitted via the Lightning Network. The writer believes that this would be harmful to many people and goes against the purpose of Bitcoin. They suggest undoing the Taproot soft fork via a future fork with a 95% consensus threshold of full nodes and miners. The writer also believes that only security-enhancing forks should be implemented in the future.",

There should not be such fee manipulations happening consistently. Moreover, why would the \"devs\" open a door for the possibility of these metadata/ non transactional data existing in the first place?

Full nodes have never been part of the voting process from day one which never changed either. It has always been 1 CPU 1 Vote (aka miner with actual hashrate) not 1 Node 1 Vote. The reason is pretty simple, there is no way to know for sure the IP you connect to is actually running a full node or is faking it or is one of many IP addresses linked to a single node (in other words you can run a single node but with many IP addresses pretending to be that many).You also seem to be ignoring the history. The first soft fork (with backward compatibility) if memory serves was BIP16 (ie. P2SH) which happened over a decade ago in early days of Bitcoin.P.S. Your arguments regarding \"validation data\" is also weak. It is like saying \"SPV clients not validating anything is a bullcrap feature\" too. It's a good feature that allows users to continue using bitcoin and running a \"semi full node\" until they get around to upgrading instead of being punished and have everything stop abruptly after the hard fork and be forced to upgrade.",

They know such rollbacks are only harmful for Bitcoin network and consequently it will cause dramatic loss in loyalty, trust in Bitcoin from the crowd.If the attacker wants to get profit from rollback, attacks, such attacks won't be helpful for attackers but if they are from governments, they can get benefit from it. Above all, I did not see governments come too close to attack Bitcoin network.",

Not that it would happen but something like that would be like disabling the soft fork by removing the extra rules. So in case of Taproot all the Taproot outputs become anyone-can-spend.",

So in case of Taproot all the Taproot outputs become anyone-can-spend.i agreeit doesnt need a chain re-org orphan event of weeks-monthsjust needs to make the softened consensus rules hard and structured againTaproot promised lean witness utility. so a simple fix. make taproot only allowed 80byte witnessi find it funny how legacy cant have lengthy signatures(old name for witness) but new features have been softened to allow it. when it is these new features that promised they wouldnt bloat the blocks with excessive witness dataa simple hardening of the rules does not mean removing old data. it just means not letting the bloat continue in future and far far easier to implement",
