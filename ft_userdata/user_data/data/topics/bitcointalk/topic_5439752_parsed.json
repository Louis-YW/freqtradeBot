In the worst case scenario it can be a low value post e.g. when someone opens a topic with copy/pasted wall of text without adding anything of their own.Quote from: PX-Z on February 13, 2023, 11:31:40 PMThat's judgmental though, what's \"proper\" to me may not be proper to you.As I said in my previous post, its not enough to just cover your ass by sharing reference link as everything should be easily visible when you copy/paste something, including reference link. We have members that were using all kind of creative ways to hide reference links and the fact that they actually copy/pasted text and that very little was written by themselves. They were eventually called out for it and in the end they stopped those practices due pressure from other members.",

Haven't sourced even if I'm correct. I didn't get a ban, I think it's because putting inside a quote also refers to acknowledging that the texts are not mine.
