I tried calling them back after they left a VM but it’s next to impossible to reach a live person. I tried tricking the system many times but was unsuccessful. Will inbox you in a couple mns. Again, my bad..been meaning to check/get back to those who’ve inboxed me lately.",

      "body": "To update mx12 and to share my story as a warning/lesson I suppose to everyone else.  FedEx will not deliver to a USPS PO Box no matter what.  It's in fact illegal to even do so.  Here's where FedEx has lost my business forever going forward.  First, they didn't let mx12 know that they couldn't deliver to a PO Box.  Why on earth wouldn't they ?! Then when FedEx called me to verify my shipping information, they left me the regular home office number here in the US.  They did so despite the fact of knowing that it's literally impossible to get through to someone when you're the receiver.  I tried tricking the system many different ways to no avail.  I get a call late yesterday evening from a lovely lady at FedEx.  She told me she saw my item on the belt that takes packages to to be, and here's the kicker...destroyed.  It arrived Dec 11th, made one attempt to contact me, left a phone number to return call that won't work, and then decided instead of trying to reach back out to me (even after mx12 contacted them to provide my email as a source to reach me) that they would just destroy it.  The woman said she noticed how it hadn't been there very long, and stated she just didn't feel right letting this thing go to be destroyed after only having been there for less than two weeks.  Fuck FedEx.  This is some horse shit piss poor business practices.  I mean, they couldn't contact the sender to try and arrange a return?  The laziness and lack of giving a shit is across the board with this one.  So just an FYI/Lesson learned here I wanted to share.",

      "body": "Hey,This is what I got today FedEx - 21:59 Delivered MXXXXXXXX, XX XXXXX United StatesThis week is crazy  I have to drive around 3000km on Sunday with my old car from 1998. I only have tomorrow to get it ready, but something happened, and it's not driving at full strength. I hope it's not serious, but I have to drive. Maybe there will be a way to repair it on the road, but it doesn't look good. And now, this situation with the artwork  Let me see what I can do and how to provide you with another number for this artwork. It's very sad this happened because in this package were gifts, numbered postcards, and a really well written letter by me  I'm not sure about the bitcoin address, but there was also an opendime attached to this artwork, so you can load it  Let me see what I can do after my crazy trip, where I'm trying to help a couple of people cross country borders.I will try to be online, but if everything goes well, I will be back on 6-10 January.",

It's probable that the USPS has been able to preserve and maintain a comparatively excellent reputation despite competition from other providers because of their reputation for honesty and dependability. It's also important to remember that the USPS is a service and not a company, so their goals differ from others.",

      "body": "I have a similar horror story with FedEx as well involving a PO Box.  I first learned that FedEx doesn't deliver to PO Boxes when I ordered a Bitcoin miner from a user on these forums.  I gave him my PO Box to ship the miner thinking that he would ship it and I would receive it just like any other package.  However, I was wrong.  What ended up happening was I received notification the package had been delivered and went to get it only to find it wasn't waiting for me.  I asked the people inside if they recalled seeing a FedEx delivery truck and was told that they dropped the package off at the front door of the post office and left...  Somebody got a free Bitcoin miner that day.  I learned my lesson.  FedEx was 0 help in resolving the situation.  I'll never use FedEx either.",
