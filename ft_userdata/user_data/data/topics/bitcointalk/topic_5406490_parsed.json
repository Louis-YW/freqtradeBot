It was created by a person who used a pseudonym called Satoshi Nakamoto.What is a Pseudonym?A pseudonym or alias is a fictitious name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which differs from their original or true name.I hope this makes some sense for you, have a good weekend.",

First look at where you are going wrong, and instead of arguing with just a few small steps to learn about WP bitcoin, there is no need to argue if someone is wrong but they are exaggerating the problem.",

Honestly, many don't care anymore who satoshi is especially the new investors. But to us, we do care a lot and thankful to him and whoever he/she or they was, and we're all aware that it's an alias/pseudonym and we'll never know who he really is and there goes too many speculations on who he was.",
