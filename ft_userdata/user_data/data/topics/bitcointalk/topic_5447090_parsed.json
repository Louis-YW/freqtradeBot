But when I realize and watch my calendar its already April in the year 2023 which is for sure it will be one of the April fools in social media.But anyway if it is true then it's look like good.",

Immediately I saw that link I knew something was wrong and needed to check my profile to confirm it. How it escaped my mind it was another April Fool prank, even though I thought of it until yesterday.",

If not for the fact the the text did not come out as expected I'm sure we would have had more people complaining of \"missing merits\" Good one @TryNinja I'm impressed, sadly only those that have the Bitcointalk SuperNotifier bot activated on their telegram gets to experience this April fool's joke. It was a very clever trick but kind of scary to me. I thought my account was trying to be hacked as I saw the message, I was about reporting the incident thinking it's some hack attempt and if the link is been clicked, you'll be compromised so I didn't bother clicking. Good thing I visited the the meta baord before trying to report the incident if not I would be looking stupid by now. Funny I didn't even know today was the first of April, the year is just running too fast already we're in the fourth month of the year. Assuming I remember today was April fool's day, I would had done some pranks myself. I love pranks and I remember my days of doing them on the service board. Feel good to have some laugh thanks @TryNinja.",
