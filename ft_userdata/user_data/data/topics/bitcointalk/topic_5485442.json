  "content": "This is a very important topic that I want to comment on, since lately I see a lot of confusion on it on Twitter and in other platforms about “What’s the difference between a 12 word seed phrase and a 24 word seed phrase?” Many people simply have a basic preference or default wallet. For some, like me, the issue goes further, and is about security, i will try to summarise it as quite as posible. I will split this topic in three parts: 12 words seed phrase , 24 words seed phrase and finally the scrambled Seed Words. Note: SP will stand to seed phrase.12 Words SPhttps://talkimg.com/images/2024/02/16/YwoJl.pngAnd if you are wondering wich words are in the BIP39 list here its is a llink to check it by yourself.https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txtThe number of posible combinations exceeds 2.6 undecillion potential pairings. This implies that in order to calculate all of the potential 12-word SP that exist, someone would have to predict all 2.6 undecillion permutations, quite a heavy proces to be honest. 24 Words SPhttps://talkimg.com/images/2024/02/16/YwoJl.pngAs you see 14 quattuorvigintillion possible word combinations, its the first time you heard it, i know....Astronimcal number, although guessing a 24-word seed phrase is not impossible in theory, we can described as \"practically impossible.\" In other words, given the constraints of a human lifespan and the full extent of computer power now accessible to humanity, it is not conceivable to estimate a seed phrase (Who knows in the future...).Scrambled SPTwo cases the 12 and the 24 SP case.So here we will gonna talk about having the correct list of words but scrambled, in wich case we can restore our wallet its is posible? two cases the 12 and the 24 SP case.Starting with the 12 scrambled words:Quoteoff energy lounge crisp library inmate accident occur boring aunt cherry galleryThe list above is a 12 word SP scrambled, that contained 100,000 sats in this adddres: bc1ql7ka7ut3vcveydx8sy9ylhurpnc6cpy02yjrgeA web page throw it as a challenge in November 13, 2022 and in December 8, 2022 the sats were gone.So, in order to guess the order of 12 known seed words, you have to guess all 479,001,600 possible combinations. That’s less than half a billion different combinations. It probably wouldn’t take someone very long to guess with the right computer script and a decent amount of computing power.The 24 scrambled words:Quotegrab merit chuckle can island wash floor car exit mother box festival october odor camp country trial nephew coil fabric galaxy napkin appear appleThe list above is a 24 word SP scrambled, that contained 1,000,000 sats in this adddres: bc1qxsd68d42agvykdueutm228uzn4s2g9qp2kk7t8The bounty started  in November 13, 2022 till now nobody breaking in to it ! ( you can try That’s more than 620 sextillion possible combinations, which is more than one quadrillion (1,295,295,050,649,600) times the number of possible combinations with just 12 words. That’s the power of “Vires in numeris”, or “strength in numbers”, which is one of the many mantras that bitcoiners put on t-shirts, artwork, and cliché engagement tweets. The raw level of security that you have with a 24 word seed phrase is essentially 1,295,295,050,649,600 times greater than with just 12 words.ConclusionUsing this examples, i want to conclude this topic saying that both 12 and 24 SP words are secure, but 24 is way more, in one hand we have the dilema of scrambling the words and having the 24 SP its would be imposible to recover, although the 12 SP its definetly more ''easy'' or '' lot less difficult'' than the 24 one. My suggestion is to pick the 24 SP and not scrambling the words , i hope you learned something.",

My suggestion is to pick the 24 SP and not scrambling the words , i hope you learned something.24 woryd seed phrases are not more secure than 12 word seed phrases. 24 words seed phrases can be impossible to rearrange if the words are not in order while there is possibility that 12 word seed phrase can be rearranged. But that does not mean 24 words seed phrases are more secure. If an attacker sees your seed phrase, the chance that the seed phrase are in order is higher as usual and the coins can be stolen after the wallet has been compromised. Also not recommended to disarrange a 24 word seed phrase because it can not be rearranged. 12 words seed phrases have 128 bits of security just as bitcoin private key which makes 24 word seed phrase to also have 128 bit of security because private key bit of security is not more than 128.",

We can't travel to either one of them That's the same with 12 versus 24 words. It is impossible to break a 128-bit entropy that created the 12 word seed phrase. Using 256 bit entropy is obviously stronger but it is like making something impossible more impossible!Not to mention that a bigger entropy is not providing your keys with more security because the keys derived from it still have 128 bits of security.",

I do understand that maybe 24-word can be more secured but then again it can be burdensome on my part inputting those 24 words whenever I need to uninstall and install the wallet. Anyway, the most important thing is that we have the choice on what to pick...if 24-word can give one a more peace of mind then so let it be the choice, otherwise 12-word is enough for me.

      "body": "A few days ago, I was given the option of either choosing a 12 SP or a 24 SP while trying to create a crypto wallet specifically for certain alts I wanted to buy. I've never had that option before. It was either on 12 SP or 24 SP default settings with other wallets I had created in the past. So, I quickly went with the 12. Though there was a note at the bottom of that option that both were secured, the 24 SP was more secured as it read. I chose and created using 12 because I've come to realize that a better part of wallet security begins with us, not the app. No matter how secure we think an app or hardware is, if we aren't safety conscious we won't get the wallet security it provides. For me, the security and safety of my funds begins with me and I try not to compromise that. I've used both 12 and 24 in my seven years in this industry with various wallets and haven't been hacked for once. Know the type of wallets you want to use first before sending your funds to them. Research and find reviews on them before activation.",
