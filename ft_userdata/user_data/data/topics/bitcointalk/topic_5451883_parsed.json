Keeping in mind that Bitcoin is not a solution to all financial problems is crucial, but in just some other way, it solves only *some*.But I agree with countries that adopting Bitcoin because it will help Bitcoin also to be known to other people and will help the Bitcoin community to grow.",

You will see small nations especially countries are in deeply debt will do legal tender for Bitcoin first.Purchasing power of US. dollar will mainly depend on FED decision to stop printing more US. dollar or continue printing it or increase the printing rate.Purchasing power of the US. dollar over time",

Shifting to Bitcoin will make them lose their grasp on the financial aspect of their country because Bitcoin is decentralized and it is more dangerous because only a few people are holding the majority of Bitcoin supply.  The government won't allow their economy to be under the grasp of these people, will they?",

Bitcoin is not in a currency war with the Dollar, gold, any other currency. It is on its own. Small nations that are performing abysmally economically are too scared to take the bold step just like El Salvador and adopt bitcoin. These are for many reasons - political, influences from the west, their citizens are just not ready, technological etcQuoteBitcoin as an indistructive currency is a good option to deploy in other to counter your perceived persecutors.It is true but it is one of the measures. If bitcoin is still used in a country where corruptions and terrible economic policies is the order of the day, it will be of no good to those countries.",
