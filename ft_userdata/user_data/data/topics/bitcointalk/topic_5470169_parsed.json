I mean you can play without music and I will assume majority doesn't want distraction when they are playing, hence it's better for us without any music in the background.Of course that is the psychology of gaming, we want to hear those sounds of slot machines, or the roulette ball bouncing around that metal wheel and hopefully it will bounce to your number. In a traditional based casinos though, there are entertainment so there could be live band to hear and watch during your game time.",

This is an individual preference we can each decide on what we want, some can easily get distracted by just making noise in an environment and they can't cope to listening to music while gambling because it's a serious distraction on them, also we have some gamblers who are fond of playing music while gambling because in doing so, they have more pleasure in that and enjoy the fun than when everywhere is quiet.",

I rarely do anything without music, even if what I was doing was just playing. If it had an in-game music that I don't mind then why not, but if it doesn't have one, I usually just start up my playlist. I call bs on \"controlling emotions while listening to music\" unless you have proof (other than yourself ofc). There's also the idea of \"concentrating\", jesus christ I don't think you need any concentration when clicking a button for a dice game. Maybe if it was poker/blackjack, but they're relatively simple games still. I must say I pity your concentration if you can't manage thinking while having bgm in simple instances like this.",

Since I gamble for fun most times, I prefer listening to music when i am gambling especially when it is my lucky moment.I switch off the music when I have lost straight three bets and I need to concentrate on my bets. If it is sportsbet, especially football, at all the time winning or losing I would prefer the music to be on so that I have have the dull vibe of the game, so that I don't get angry if one of the players that I bet his club to win is not playing well or is making mistakes. Like Last season when Maguire was messing the game up with own goals and a lot of mistake, I will only laugh and not getting angry. Music consoles me in sportsbets.",

Meanwhile, if I'm in a closed room and alone, I definitely use music from the game. This is because gambling in my place is considered a bad activity so you have to be able to adapt and don't let other people or even your own family find out. So I prefer playing game music rather than turning on seasons outside of games because seasons from games feel the sensation while playing. Maybe that's the function of casinos in providing music from games because it can create a special desire for gamblers.",

It's authentic, real, and immersive. What if that clinking sound made you want a drink every time? Possible water sip?But music... might it be a double-edged sword? It motivates, stirs emotions, and occasionally makes you forget you're playing. This is tough, especially if your wallet is at stake.

However, it might not be a good idea to listen to music while playing other games, especially if you or I are playing poker.Of course, poker is a game that heavily relies on strategy and the thinking. Now when you're listening to music while doing it, it will provide us with a small diversion that will prevent us from thinking clearly and prevent us from being able to develop sound strategies. That may be the cause of our failure. That won't help us, to put it briefly.",

Most game players who place slightly higher bets do not want their seriousness when playing to be ruined by sounds outside the game, including music. They are more comfortable hearing the sound of a slot machine, or the bouncing sound of a roulette ball than the sound of music which can disturb their concentration while playing.For some gamblers who want to have fun in the game, they will be more entertained by the sound of music. They don't really care about the results obtained, as long as the adrenaline produced can bring their mood to a level of pleasure, they will still feel satisfied even if they have to come out with a defeat.",

That really depends on how's my day, whether it's good or bad. If I have a tiring day and I want to gamble and that's making me think that I should listen to set the mood then I have to play it before playing. But during the time that I am gambling, I can stop that any moment when I find it annoying and not appealing to my ears. So, it's really random moments when I do it because I'm not sure whether I'd like it when things aren't perfect and had to deal with a lot of things during the day and sometimes the music from the games is more than enough already.
