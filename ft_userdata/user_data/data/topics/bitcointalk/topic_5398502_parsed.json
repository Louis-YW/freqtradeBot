  "content": "98% Of Luna investors lose or wiped out their investment in just 48 hours so the word HODL now meansÂ  Hold On to Dear Life because many are stressed and disappointed and some thinking of the unthinkable and they are holding to their dear life because they lose their lifetime earnings.This is one example of why we should invest only money that we can afford to lose because we never know what's going to happen, what happens to Luna can happen to other top coins in the market and Luna is a big example of how good coin turns to worse.So are you following the golden rule of only investing what you can afford to lose?",
