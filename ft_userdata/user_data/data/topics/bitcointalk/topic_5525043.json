If we talking about increment since inception or listing then I can say it's the biggest investment or one of in recent years. Real Estate is still the Now and still in the future One of our basic needs as humans is shelter So like Real estate is essential do is Agriculture. Bitcoin helps in creating and protecting of wealth without the need of a third party.",

However, there are also certain factors that until now become a struggle for bitcoin to reach the said phase for bitcoin. It's volatility alone is indeed a big threat for global adoption. It's regulation and legal framework is still not highly established. But if only bitcoin will continue to be seen as a digital gold because of its increasing store of value, and having financial institutions to back up bitcoin, then it won't be surprising for bitcoin to become the best world's investment in the future.",

However, to truly enjoy its benefits and generate substantial profits, it's crucial to establish a reliable source of income.This steady stream of funds will allow you to cover unexpected expenses without dipping into your Bitcoin investment. Moreover, it's essential to understand that investing in Bitcoin is a long term commitment, not a get rich quick scheme.",

Compared to real estate you can’t acquire property immediately because it’s expensive and just thinking about the process and all the necessary documents feels like a hassle. The opportunities Bitcoin offers make it a truly unique asset class. With the rising interest from institutions and mainstream adoption I can confidently say we’re headed in that direction.",

Like, investing always has some amount of risk no matter what.  Bitcoin is still pretty new thing and real estate has been around longer though and people usually think its more stableAt the end of the day, the best investment for someone comes down to their personal situation.  Theres no one size fits all answer.  For some folks Bitcoin works, and for others, something like real estate makes more sense.",

I must say that the question is very technical because if you look at other investment out there you will discover that, that same risk involved in bitcoin investment is also applicable in other investment. is it the price not being stable? You know this also happens in other investment out there just as it is in bitcoin investment,  so I think bitcoin is the best investment so far.",

Market cap? Users? Best in what? For me, real estate is still at the top when it comes to investment. Yes, the capital that you need in real estate is quite high (unless you will invest into REITS), but the reward in the long run can be good and it can give you passive income through rental income. As for Bitcoin, it can go as high as real estate since it's appreciating in price because of the limited supply, but right now, there's no certainty on it yet. Bitcoin is still on the adoption stage so thinking like this is for me, a bit early. Can we just not think about this first, and think about the adoption rate of Bitcoin around the world?",

Now regards popularity it's really unlikely Bitcoin is going to become the top 1 in the world, because it's just too risky and volatile for most investors. Common sense goes for safer routes, like fixed passive income methods offered by banks (even though it's unprofitable) and conservative investments like real estate, which is also a very good alternative. People aren't willing to see their assets melting 20%-50% in a matter of days in crypto market.",

But now even if the amount of investment in this digital currency increases, the media will not take this issue very seriously because Bitcoin has not moved globally like the dollar.
