Which one is more risky; Martingale or Anti Martingale?   -   Many have tried and done this technique, and most of those who did were ultimately unsuccessful. This method is also quite risky for a gambler who is not rich but just playing to grow their small amount.Perhaps as I see it martingale is only in favor of really rich gamblers who seem to never run out of money. It's hard to imagine if you start with your bet of 1$ and then every time you lose in rolling you will do it x2 or x3, then there is a chance that you roll 20x and you don't win, how much can you lose? So it is not favorable or practical for gamblers whose only goal is to grow money.",

Which one is more risky; Martingale or Anti Martingale?Not exactly, but what we do in poker, and I understand that it is the same in sports betting, is that we go up levels when we reach a certain bankroll amount, and when we lose due to a bad streak and the bankroll drops below x, we go down a level. It is essentially similar, what happens is that in casino games that are EV-, you are going to lose money in the long term, unlike in poker where you can earn money in the long term making EV+ moves, so in casino games what will happen is that the money you have in your account will last longer, but do not expect to get profitability from it.",

Martingale is my standard betting strategy I use when I don't want to think too much about gambling. It works best for my gambling behaviour as it guarantees in most cases that I will finish with a positive gambling evening. Only one win will recover all my previous losses, which is great if you want to build up your bankroll steadily over time. The big issue unfortunately is the tail risk, that you can get wiped out in a single session when we are facing a loss streak. Another drawback of the martingale strategy is the large capital requirements, we need a decent bankroll to start with to withstand several losses in a row. Would be nice to see the strategy in action and see how well you are doing with it. For how many rounds have you used the strategy? Did you make a decent win of it? Assuming that we are losing a bit more than we are winning, we are going to double up less often than in a martingale strategy.

In most cases, it'd be $1 but it'd still accumulate if you lose out a lot of times, especially if we consider how each win and loss usually offset each other, but with $1 being the minimum if it stacks up, it doesn't exactly offset anything. Though I guess if you consider how Martingale is, this one would be a lot better since the losses are set at the minimum, while Martingale requires you to have an insane bankroll to break even, and if you don't, well it'd be an insane loss.",

The big risk is that every time you have to double the amount of the bet, and if the amount of the first bet is small, this is not so critical, but it will be small if we talked about testing the strategy, in practice everything turns out differently and this will necessarily lead to big losses.",

You can try it in some casinos with expert settings, like Wolf, choose some cheap coin, and just let it run on auto and you will see for yourself if it's good or not. The thing with Martingale and Anti-Martingale is that you need to start with some very low bet to be able to double after every loss, but in the end, you win the base bet.",

And as long as it is there, any strategy you come up with will make you lose in the long run. The best and the only strategy to beat the house is playing less (ideally once) and wagering more. Only then you can become an exception mathematically.Any other strategy which makes you play more will get the house working and that means you will lose for certain because that's how the house edge works. It takes the money from your pocket and put it in the casino's.",

Bankroll size is the most important thing to be considered on this so called bet strategy because the bankroll needs to withstand the worst case scenario of losing streak in able for this strategy become effective. Even on dice game with 99% win rate can give a 10 lose streak or more then other games like Blackjack and Bacarrat can give more potential lose streak.I really hate this kind of strategy because it will just lessen your chance to win in case long streak hits you in early stage of your gaming session. Betting on fixed bet and just wait for the win streak then stop betting in profit is still the best because your bankroll will can last longer even with long lose streak because the game result will always be balance at the end of the game with just a little bit of favor with the house due to house edge. You will not lose a lot if you are just playing on consistent bet type with same bet size.",
