I’m not a pro trader nor newbie but I never use demo account until now because I’m not a hardcore trader that trading every price movement or in regular basis. Trader can simply use small amount as test trade using their own account since trading with real money involved has different impact on decision making instead of using fake money.",

Quote from: Queentoshi on November 26, 2023, 04:06:49 PMDo you as an experienced trader that has made profit from the market repeatedly, do you still have a demo account for trying out new strategies? Demo account will let a trader not to be a good trader because the trader will trade without no emotion involved. But it is for beginners. When I was a beginner, I used $0.25 to a open position and it helped. So beginners do not also need demo if they can use small amount of money like $1 to practice.",

What do you think? Do you as an experienced trader that has made profit from the market repeatedly, do you still have a demo account for trying out new strategies? One thing I should noticed in the Demo accounts may be the traders can learn many things in these demo accounts about the trading but when they came to real trading and in the sense they go to some exchange may be that would be Binance or any other Exchange then there would be some difficult situation for the person who was first trading at demo account. Because in the demo account, not a single percent of the sell pressure on the person would be present from the start to the end of his trade where he would learn trading in the demo account.Although I had show you only one thing, even there are many more like this, I was told only about the sell pressure yet. But he could suffer from more and then there will be different areas he should have to pass then.",

In speaking about demo accounts then it would be something open for everyone whether you are a noob or a pro but most likely it would really be that relevant when you are just starting with trading.Familiarization on how indicators works and on how to know about those other terms and other related thing on which it would really be that relevant for you to deal with demobut there are something which you cant really be able to learn via demo alone which you could really be only be able to learn with live trading on which i do talk about emotionalaspect and psychological approach. You cant really be able to enhance yourself if you are that focusing on demo.This is why on the time that you do make out some familiarization on what those terms and indicators then test out yourself on live marketusing up real funds.",

A demo account is an account which is free of loss. In this account, people use virtual money in trading and gain knowledge and experience through it.  This is a fearless account where the new trader can do trading without any fear of loss. This account is only for newbies or beginners but the experienced trader can also use it for developing  new strategies. This will help a new trader to adjust to the crypto world, testing their strategies and making their psychology better.  So in this case I think that a demo account will be important Both for the new and the experienced traders do not get fear of Money loss but to test their strategies that will be better in the actual trading or not.",

I don't think using demo account is the only way from saving you from your losses in trading. As long as you manage to trade an at amount you are comfortable to lose, and you analyze the market well before deciding to trade, as much as you have tested your strategies if they still are working, then that could actually minimize your losses in trading. Using demo account is mostly a beginner's option, but when you become experienced in the market, it's more on practicing trading with caution and consistent exposure in the market through live trading will honed more to be a pro and successful traders.However, using demo trading or not is up to the trader's decision. But it does not actually guarantee bigger chances to make you a productive and successful trader in the process.",

Demo account is a tool to test your strategy. Everyone should a solid strategy for trading. You should first backtest  your strategy with historical data. If it holds good on historical backtesting the next step is to test it in real time using a demo account. It tests whether the strategy is as profitable at current time. Anyone trying to test their luck with demo account are misusing it. Inner instincts holds no ground in trading but instincts you get from the overall mindset of traders, news and financial report would count as an strategy.",
