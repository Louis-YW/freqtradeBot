It's just another form of rebranding to fool gullible investors.I think it will mix both fungible token and non-fungible token if you're just call Token instead of NFT.There's another article I found INO is stand for Initial Node Offering https://decbc.com/ino/",

There are so many articles about INO on google.  I know why it's not booming. There's no originality, it's not fresh, it had been used before and failed most of the time. Yes, ICO.  Basic \"NFT\" should be enough. Investors are not stupid to misunderstand the need to buy something before they start the program. It had always been that way. If you want faster profits, buy it, take the high risk. As I seen in my experience most of those who did pay enough reaped their rewards earlier than those waiting for NFT airdrops. Games or just the basic application. Invest early and you will be paid higher as long as it's a legitimate project.",

Having heard of it and also myself, I have speculated that it will also be hyped over time by some platforms promoting it. But like many new approaches to projects that I know of, only a few work, and they lose the benefits they're being valued for. These days, new images are always appearing and exaggerated, so I am not too optimistic about this approach. But I would also be happy to see that at that stage, there's a lot more to it than the market's rebound.",

For me personally, as I mentioned earlier, exaggerating trends too much makes the market move in the worst direction possible. Not the other way around. After each experiment with the markets and users, the trends gradually lose their position and become harder to come back stronger, and that is bullshit, if it is fair to say here, is a superfluous of imagination when there are tons of projects that just copy each other and give out. Users or investors always suffer more from such navigation, but it is also very beneficial to see some of the projects that bring about huge successes.",

He is referring to a new term, INO (Initial NFT Offering), just a variation, a new form of fundraising and possibly an alternative to the recent IEO, IDO, IGO trends. It is common for bull cycles to be accompanied by new trends. With the emergence of INO, hopefully we will soon see a bull market emerge in the market.",
