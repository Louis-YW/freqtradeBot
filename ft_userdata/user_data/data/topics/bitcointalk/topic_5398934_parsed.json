Their scope is to seize our Earth and to settle in it. So they begin to destroy the humans on the Earth.In this situation, Humans came to know that Aliens can't enter the desert because the climatic temperature of the desert seems to be a threat to alien's life.But Tragedy is when humans find out this truth, the Human race on the Earth is almost on the edge of extinction.To secure their Life from Aliens, people entered the desert as a refuge. Among them, Patagonian people from Argentina seem to be the most intelligent.The Patagonian Desert is located primarily in Argentina was bounded by the Andes to its west, and the Atlantic Ocean to its east, in Patagonia, southern Argentina. To the north grades into the Cuyo Region and the Monte.It became a challenge for that small group of people to lead the life in the Patagonian Desert. For the survival of the Human race in the Desert land, they decided to separate required water from the atmosphere. They also decided to separate necessary nutrients from sand to plant crops and raise cattle in the desert land.While Aliens are looking for a way to enter the desert, People in the Patagonian Desert plan to prepare the most powerful weapons to fight against aliens and destroy them.Patagonian people worked hard to save the Earth from aliens, bring back Earth to its normal state, and lead a peaceful life.There will be more token on dessert farm game on coming days because of its stable economic model.

If you look at their replies, they’re pretty one-sided and not genuine at all. No mixed criticisms whatsoever for these brand new and newbie accounts. I think the mods should keep an eye on all of these newbie accounts who responded to this thread, especially if they are registered with the same IP address. That’s just me concerning of course.",
