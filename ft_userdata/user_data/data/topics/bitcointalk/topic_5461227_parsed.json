  "content": "You may have spotted an article or Tweet about Worldcoin lately. Here's an example Article: https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/24/worldcoin-launch-sam-altman/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANAMljq7e2zNF35eUVvo7H9_WzdDOFSd8944e9W1CNZrLHgS-w1UXkPm1GDKgFyC_c2Vy5rF-rVr62849MIjpf5YA9L-FM7k60TwK41KE5zEnPdKjBBJzuzzlVCmVLLYLwkeovtjgWKbeNEVYBLmHAKDHItua5OJAz3UiW59zAvkI paid attention to this due to my interest in Antaui Coins, which are loaded with Worldcoin.  My initial thought after seeing a headline was that this group musthave taken over the Worldcoin blockchain to innovate it and bring it to a new use case. This would have been cool and I was quickly wondering if I should dust off the Antauicoin and prepare for the moon ( )However, this is a second Worldcoin. The old one loaded on Antaui coins is WDC, ranked #3618 by market cap, and the new one WLD, ranked #137 by market cap. I cannot say why they went with a token name that was already created. Here is one of the founders (Sam Altman)Just Kidding. Here they are: The premise of their enterprise is to develop a system that verifies human vs robotin a digital world using iris scanning tech (called an Orb) and a verification network. The reason for why they need a token and a blockchain is unclear. My personal take on this with just a little bit of rooting through their material is admittedly somewhat cynical. My opinion is they probably devised thisbecause of profit potential rather than a true need to develop another alt coin. Instead of devising the tech and system to work on existing blockchains, they want their own economic controls. Yes, they cite bridges and all that that to be compatible, but they still went with creating their own token, which is ERC20. This sentence from their material seems quite hyperbolic: So for all the Antaui lovers out there thinking their day in the sun had arrived, apologies. Seems we have another Worldcoin on the block. Maybe they will make a physical coin loaded with their token.",

      "body": "I still pop in from time to time to check in and see if there's any interest in these.  I still have several, which I've mentioned before, but I bought both on the original release, and then picked up the remaining stock from Gudmunsen when WDC tanked after the whole Sharmbeck incident.Anyway, I found the C# project that was created to allow you to scan a coin barcode and expand it to a proper key.  I don't think I can upload a zip here, but if anyone is interested, DM me and I'll try to take the time to create a Github with the code, or something.Keep in mind, this is old so I don't know if it will compile or run.  It should have the code that someone can reverse-engineer, though.  Regardless, I think the original author took it from another tool on git an modified the address system to map to WDC addresses, rather than BTC addresses.  In fact, I think it might be the same tool (again, only modified to work with WDC) that was used to expand the OG Cascasius coins.  It's been yeeeeears since I looked into this stuff, so I can't fully recall.",

However, they did work with me and helped me to get the resolution needed to convert the PK's. the github for the project is here: https://github.com/expatjedi/wdcaddress.orgit will have a link to the following site: https://wdcaddress.org/ once you go to the address, take the pc offline.once on the page, click \"wallet details\"enter the private key as it is shown on the coin - should start with a \"S\"and then click \"view details\"Your coins Public Address will be the one on the left under the \"Worldcoin Address\" heading - ignore the one on the right for the \"Worldcoin Address Compressed\"I used the Worldcoin QT wallet found here: https://www.worldcoin.global/wdc/#walletsEither version of the presented private key should work - either the 51 chars or the 52 chars. I have tested this now with 5 coins and had success each time. Using this may prompt the wallet to do a rescan but once it is done, your funds should be there. See below for one such coins balance.",
