If ona check ever since bitcoin come out since that 2009 till date. if person wey dey work for oil company or business person wey dey see money that time, dey buy this bitcoin small small maybe by now the person no go reason to accumulate again but rather just dey look him potfolio dey laugh. Just they wait for the appointed time to withdraw. And now wey our day just break like this, I think e never to late to also do the same thing. For example person wey dey 50 years that 2010 buy am keep by now him don reach 63years that one don become him retirement money. If him keep am for bank for this 13years, inflation for don short him money well well. So we too sopos reason this matter say if I dey buy this bitcoin they keep for like 13 to 15 years adding to my age now say person go also make am. bitcoin price of today at $37k fit reach $500k by then because as the halving dey always dey come naso the price they grow.Just emagine the price of 1 bitcoin after 3 to 4 halving?",

So my point be say if you invest for retirement, then no be guarantee say when you go need the money say price go dey up. In other words, to take profit for every halving circle better pass than to leave in the name of retirement. Omo me I no fit use bitcoin get hope for retirement oo, as I talk before, na to buy properties and build dey collect rent, lease, event centers sure pass.",

You're correct, but OP is rather coming from a different perspective, his advise is that people whom are younger and are salary earners should start saving up personally for their retirement days, like setting out a percentage of their income to purchase bitcoin and not touch it until their retirement. Many halving must've occurred and the bull runs would've appreciated their investments so much as compared to leaving it in banks which you and I know that liquidity affects fiat so much, thereby leading to devaluation instead of appreciation like in the case of bitcoin. Having much money even before government pays their gratuity is a good bonus. The only thing wey sweet pass money na more money and their investments in bitcoin promises that on a long term.",

Bitcoin is not a bad investment at all, and while someone is still working and receiving their salary, they can possibly be accumulating some Bitcoin fraction little by little while they are also investing in other projects that can actually profit them too when they are old. For instance, some people prefer to start a company like an open hotel, invest in pharmaceutical companies, or invest in housing and property, and it will not be bad at all that the person invests in Bitcoin too. It is not usually wise to cast all your hope in the bowels because it can mistakenly come true and your plans might no longer fall into place.",

The only money that can only be invested at that point is the gratuity, which is also given to civil servants after retiring, it is a large money wey you fit lump sum and stock plenty bitcoin but for dat money to enter hand again after retirement na anoda wahala for d country.
