So, to make these operations you are not going to carry a laptop and your HW all the time. Carrying 0.01 BTC on your mobile is not crazy.

A lot of people here on the forum simply cannot purchase a device to calmly read the forum.Another point is that not all Android devices will let hackers through. Reasonable people understand that if they have any financial means on the phone, they should use it with extreme caution. I don't have a wallet on my phone; however, I am sure that my information is not available to hackers.It's simple. You are responsible for your funds. Even with a hardware wallet, if someone lacks sufficient knowledge of storage and use, he can still lose everything.",

And if you're going to be making regular payments, it's best to keep your money in a wallet that's easy to use and accessible, mobile wallets and desktop wallets are also viable options.and mobile phones are easy to carry and become a part of our daily lives, this also means they can be broken, damaged or stolen. If you only store a few assets on your phone in a digital wallet, then you don't need to worry too much. However people who keep all their crypto only in their phone, should be very careful with two things. Phone security andHacking towards digital hot wallets.In conclusion, mobile wallets can be used to store small amounts of crypto but larger amounts of crypto are better stored in cold digital wallets.",

But security sometimes has to do with how the investor treats both wallets, a mindful investor could keep his mobile wallet secured but a careless investors could still lost his funds on hardware wallets. Another thing about Mobile wallet is its portability and cost saving. Investors saving having just $300 or below worth of funds will see purchasing of hardware wallets a waste of money considering its price.",

Why they give his bitcoin to the hacker?Actually, the idea of storing crypto on phones is a very good idea. These devices are always at hand of users, almost everyone has it. The potential in this is huge and most likely, the industry will develop in this direction. Undoubtedly, there are vulnerabilities that will need to be addressed. Therefore, keeping money on phone wallets is acceptable, if it is not large amounts for everyday expenses. Of course, these devices are not intended for long-term storage and are not suitable.You ask why people keep money on their phones. The answer is very simple - it's convenient. Often people are willing to give up security for the sake of it. I believe that the use of crypto currencies should be simple and convenient, and mobile wallets fulfill this function. By solving the security problem, this crypto storage method will win the consumer market.",

Hackers usually target huge amounts of bitcoins, anyone with a very huge amount of bitcoins and decides to keep them on his mobile phone that he walks around with cannot be considered to be very wise.",

But because for a while there is no other choice before they use a safer device to save.",

Why they give his bitcoin to the hacker?The answer to your question is, because that's the least operating system device most people can afford, it doesn't mean they are very rich, because most of the hacking done is always caused by users mistakes i.e either by clicking an unknown link or visiting a trojan website which gives hackers access to our devices. But that doesn't mean there are ways can't still use this operating system and not yet gets hacked by always doing the needful i.e by always avoiding any unknown link or website, not sharing your phone password with friends and always try not tell people how much you own in your wallet. Because according to research, I was able to know that the most valuable operating systems are Linux and Android.https://www.techradar.com/news/windows-10-isnt-the-most-vulnerable-operating-system-its-actually-linux",

Because you can carry your phone around to anywhere that you are going, it makes it more vulnerable. It is good not to use fingerprint, using password or pin is better.",
