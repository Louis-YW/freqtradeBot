He must have mined more than 1.1 million Bitcoin. Who knows may be 4 million or 6 million. Or may even less than 1.1 million. What is the truth ?  I wish I could have the chance to know it from 3 Jauary 2011. Then I could have mine at list 2 million by 2022. All things are luck.",

Quote from: DigitalMonk on August 25, 2022, 02:48:02 PMWhat is the truth The truth is that not everything said about Satoshi is true including those that make the claim to be Satoshi, all fake, don't believe much on influential newsQuote from: DigitalMonk on August 25, 2022, 02:48:02 PM I wish I could have the chance to know it from 3 Jauary 2011. Then I could have mine at list 2 million by 2022I hope you understand that mining isn't just a child's play, it requires alot and that's why you hardly have an encounter with miners because they are such that are always busy having all hands on desk, not only that but they are truly sound in reasoning and in solving complex mathematical equations.",

If you have any further questions to the topic you already started, just reply to that thread  And this is what I classify as thread spamming, because there is no new information that will be given here that has not been given in the previous thread O.P posted before, because this thread will only give room to repetition of statements already said. So I will advise O.P to please lock this thread, and if he still needs clarification, refer back to the previous.",
