I don't even recommend buying MSTR even though it's pretty much almost like a pseudo-ETF; because who would know what Saylor and the new CEO would do.But if you really want to go with stocks, we have the likes of $COIN and some mining stocks. Obviously expect the correlation to be shaky.",

Now there are mnemonic seeds that make managing them easier, there are hardware wallets for those who are allergic to software. The only excuse to invest into Bitcoin via proxy is being  70+ old and incapable of learning new things. Otherwise there's no good reason to invite a middleman where it's not needed and make your investment less secure and less profitable due to extra fees.",

If you still don't want to do that, then I would suggest looking into getting a Swiss account in the BBVA bank. I've read some people are able to buy Bitcoin from there. It has to be specifically Swiss and you may need to meet some requirements to access this feature which probably is reserved for people that has more than a few hundreds to invest.Other than that, I would wait for a proper ETF. Eventually Fidelity or someone big will be able to have a BTC ETF, but right now in a bear market you want to be ready to buy as soon as possible, to be able to DCA in, but have in mind we could still go as low as 10k or even lower before a mega capitulation that wipes this entire crypto clownmarket.",

The exchanger can't only be hacked, but simply refuse to give out your money under any pretext, plausible or fictitious. Of course, this is the easiest way for newbies, because it removes all the issues of storage, security and responsibility, but at the same time deprives them of the most important advantage of bitcoin - freedom of action in the world of finance. The notorious \"not your keys - not your money\". Newbies should not start with simplification, sacrificing the most valuable thing that bitcoin has.",

They can buy or invest on some companies like MicroStrategy as they are known to also invest in btc but I think the income that we will be getting isn't going to be full anymore because I think you need to pay some fees when availing these kind of services, so it's always better to invest on our own.",

Such a fork can often end up in another custodial wallet, which in most cases means wasted money.Quote from: thecodebear on September 21, 2022, 06:20:59 PMAnd buying actual Bitcoin and storing it oneself is infinitely more advisable than buying some bitcoin related investable product like Microstrategy stock or some ETF or whatever.In general, I would also advise it to anyone who shows that they understand at least some basics when it comes to Bitcoin, but for some it is still safer to buy stocks or shares in a fund. Most people do not have enough determination or knowledge to be their own bank, and they do not understand the risk of using CEX as storage.",
