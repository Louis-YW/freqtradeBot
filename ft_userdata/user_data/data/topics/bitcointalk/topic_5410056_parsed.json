The drama about Trust is one thing, meriting posts that deserve it is another thing. Yes, sometimes people merit posts expressing views on the trust system, and yes, people tend to merit the posts expressing views similar to their own instead of good posts, still, the merit system is imho in a much better shape now that it was 1 year ago (just a random date in the past) and I don't want to risk making it worse (we do need the merit sources).And back to the Trust system, that one may need improvements. People removing themselves from DT1 or clearing their trust lists are just a symptom of all that. And those are valid choices; people should not be punished for that.Edit:Quote from: Upgrade00 on August 16, 2022, 10:27:56 AMThe topic title already gave away a prejudiced view from youI don't agree with OP, still, I find it a valid question.

If a user isn't trusted in the first place, do we trust them to distribute merit appropriately? I guess that's the only major question I can see from this. However, if you're trusted, and you've just asked the community to not include you in their trust lists, I'm not entirely sure why that would effect their judgement on being merit sources. If theymos has a problem, he will, and has removed merit sources. I also voted no for the time being, unless I'm missing the point here. Feel free to enlighten me.",

I wonder why they want theymos to make some changes to DT while not complaining some changes for merit source. I expect merit system to be more decentralized than theymos packing most smerits to just few people. Both are not perfect but both are helping, nothing should change is what I think.",

There isn't any correlation, but Timelord2067 has been known to exhibit a weird form of pareidolia when it comes to forum-related associations, so maybe DT and merit sources being lumped in together is an extension of that.  No offense, Timelord2067; I know I'm not the only one who's noticed that trait, nor am I the first to have mentioned it in a thread.So who are these members who are demanding to be removed from DT?  I've read about people clearing their trust lists (which I've recently done), but aside from marlboroza a while back I haven't seen any such demands.  Could have missed it, though.In any case, I wouldn't even care if a DT member-merit source got booted from the DT list by the community.  As long as they're handing out merits appropriately and not abusing the system, they should stay merit sources.  Think about how many sources we have now and how long it takes for members to rank up.  If you started removing sources simply because they wanted off the DT list, it'd throw a monkey wrench in the merit machine that might be hard to fix.",

If there were cases of this and it become more evident there were reasons that conflicted with the user being a merit source afterwards then it'd probably be a good idea (done individually) but merits might be recognised more than trust so a dt1 member and merit source i could see stepping down from both at the same time if they didn't want the pressure of the trust system.",
