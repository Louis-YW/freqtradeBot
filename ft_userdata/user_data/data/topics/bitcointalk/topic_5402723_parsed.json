What things actually carry real value ?",

I'm in a similar boat and hope to find that golden ticket.  I once had a client who started escape rooms all over USA, he made great money until covid hit.  Bump for someone greater than us to point us in the direction at some passive or even active income.  Need that side hustle.-FrY",

You just woke up to bump a useless thread. I would be surprised if you are not one of the alternate profiles OP uses.On trying to look at the bright side as to why the user onefry must have bumped this thread, it's possible he or she didn't even know that the user was banned. Perhaps not aware of the case at the time and bans aren't indicated on a user too not except you check by some means (bpip).Again, the user in question isn't wearing any signature so, we can't say the bump was born out of meeting up with post quota and activities could be earned anywhere, even in off-topic so I wouldn't consider that.It's still questionable though as to why if we are to look past all this because, the OP is focused on his or her site exchange services and that could be private. Not being here makes the replies some worth useless. Perhaps OP is here as a guest or on another account andnnot having to tell makes posting on the thread off.",
