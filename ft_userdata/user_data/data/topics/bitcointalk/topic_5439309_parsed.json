  "content": "When adding cosigners through xpubs/Zpubs this results in missing fingerprints in the wallet - some hw wallets (coldcard for one) seem to require the fingerprint in order to decide if they are involved in the psbt. The only way to solve this that I could find is go into the raw wallet json and fix the Code:\"root_fingerprint\": nullI think it would be useful to have a fingerprint input field along side the xpub/zpub when adding cosigners.",
