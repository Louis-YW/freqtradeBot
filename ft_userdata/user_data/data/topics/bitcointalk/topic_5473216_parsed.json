  "content": "I was checking mempool and saw the transaction  fee sky rocketing. I am not sure what happened suddenly as these fees are way beyond anyone's imagination. Later on, I did found out that Binance has listed Ordinals (ORDI). I want to ask the community whether the severe high transaction fee occured because of the listing? I went ahead and check the price of $ORDI on Binance and found that it is trading at a price which is way beyond it should be. I am sharing the screenshot below.Anyone here who can give a solution to this issue? I feel they would continue to make the transaction fee in those Satoshi figures . This situation would not help small investors and traders as they would avoid these kinds of transaction fees. Edited on 10th of November 2023As expected it is now beyond the control of anyone except those who were part of the development. They should come up with a solution otherwise the whole idea would crumbled. Look at this after I posted before the current price.This has to stop or everything that was beautiful would become a nightmare. Those who created it have to come out of a unique solution. These fees are insane and out of the limit of anyone who is like me. Imagine someone wants to transfer $10! Do you think these atrocious fee would help them.  Today's date: 6th of December 2023.",

Having experience in this regards is not something new anymore, this is to tell us how the network is busy or congested, but we can always manuever our own way through, try to use a bitcoin wallet like electrum which support RBF, adjust your transactions to the lowest priority, apply the option of static and set the limit to about 20 Satoshi per vbyte, make your payment and use the transaction id to pump your transaction, use via btc to make your transaction faster since it's a mining pool and it's free, another thing you can do is to target weekend transactions or study the mempool when it's less congested.",

It's becoming obvious this is going to be the major bane of Bitcoin, and not even the government we keep poking fingers at for its refusal to fall in line with the mass adoption thing. This congestion gets worse whenever there's price rally a few days in a roll. It frustrates every effort to have smooth transactions. People need seamless (or almost seamless transactions) to want to use a service. In this regard, Bitcoin isn't providing it.",

I want to ask the community whether the severe high transaction fee occured because of the listing? Definitely not related since Bitcoin high transaction is already there few days ago when the pump to 35k started. Probably the hype on that token is due Bitcoin Ordinals popularity now that the mempool is already being flooded by Ordinals transactions. Withdrawal on that token is already suspended by exchange due to high fee. While the pending transaction volume is not growing either.",

The rise in price reflects increased demand and therefore more transactions are conducted, which motivates miners to select transactions with higher fees, and this will automatically raise fees. It is true that it has become a little exaggerated, but it is not possible to draw conclusions based on a short time.I hope the situation would improves quickly and goes back to how it was.",

Take note that ViaBTC is a mining pool and if you use their free accelerator and meet all the requirements, you still have to wait until ViaBTC successfully mines a block, and it can take sometime. ViaBTC also accelerates only 100 tx's per hour, so it is likely that you will fall under a queue.It is also worth mentioning that your fee rate must be 10 sat/byte and above in order to accelerate your tx, also the volume of your tx cannot be more than 500 bytes. ViaBTC works anyway, but i would just check mempool.space and choose a fee rate that is best for my tx at that point in time.",

If this is your first time then you should really get used to it, the only issue that we do encounter on Bitcoin is into that scalability issue on which on the time that the network gets clogged thenfees would go high but this isnt really as near with that ETH shit fees when theres a bloat of network transactions that flood out on the market. We could have several bucks in terms of feeswhich we arent really that get used to and on the time that you do able to see those big changes or fees then you would really be starting to have doubts on why is this.If you've been here on this market for a while then these kind of moments are really that normal.Any ways on trying out to lessen the fees? The only way is to make out some conversion with some btc pairs and from there you could really make that transaction but well its something hassle for me but if you are really that minding on saving up the fees then this would really be your choice.As for Ordinals then i dont really see the connection.
