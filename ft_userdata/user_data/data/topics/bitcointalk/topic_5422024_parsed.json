  "content": "Earlier during the trend of cryptocurrency regulations some U.S Senators and Congressmen like Patrick Toomey didn't want crypto to be regulated, but they all want it now! These Senators are shooting from the hip, as they is nothing to think about. FTX did something bad. Below are some of their quick reactions;Senator Cynthia Lumiss: A strong proposer of the cryptocurrency regulation is still standing on her initial suggestion of regulating cryptocurrency. She went on to tweet that the FTX bankcruptcy wouldn't have happened if the Lummis-Gillibrand bill was passed. Here are the key points in the bill she mentioned.Clear property right (not your keys, not your coin)Strong protection and separation of customer assets on an exchangeTight limits on digital asset leverage and lendingBankruptcy protection for all customersTransparency into affiliates and connected organization of an exchange. On her Interview with a Yahoo reporter named Jenniffer she called FTX a Ponzi scheme and reassured the reporter that her bill with Grillibrand will be reviewed immediately. “We’ll definitely review the bill under this to see that we have adequately protected consumers assets during a bankruptcy, protecting consumer assets from being co-mingled and making sure that our definitions are sufficiently tight,” said Lummis.On another interview with SquawkCNBC she was asked an important question that goes; how will you regulate a company based in Bahamas and other Offshore exchanges? \"We need to make sure we're balancing innovation with consumer protections,\" says @SenLummis \"Buyer beware, these foreign based companies are operating under different country's laws because they're more advantageous to those companies.\"My view, I think the regulation is only for US based cryptocurrency firms and that doesn't make enough sense, though Bahamas is working on her laws to tackle the FTX collapse. Therefore, it'll be difficult to regulate these exchanges, because it won't get to or affect every country.  Second on my list is Senator Patrick ToomeySenator Patrick is blaming the congress for not having passed a regulatory bill on cryptocurrency trading. And such negligence has led cryptocurrency developments to foreign jurisdictions that have little or insufficient regulations. Also, he said that the regulation should start with Stablecoins. Generally, It seems they are more focused on regulating exchanges than cryptocurrency. The last lawmaker on my list is Rep Warren Davidson who claims to have been in the digital currency space since 2000sHis Opinion, self custody, seems to be the best, and he seeks that his bill \"Keep your coin\" be passed, and anyone that attacks self custody opposes individual freedom. He added that people are lured to hand-over their funds to someone else(exchanges), believing that their funds are safer on exchanges. Adding to his reactions, he quoted a tweet from 2019 where he interviewed SecEnfDirector on \"Selective Enforcement\", and said that the SEC has proven not to be capable of regulating cryptocurrency. In a nutshell, from what Rep Warren Davidson had to say about the Self custody and people getting deceived to save funds on exchanges, more works needs to be done. Because, these victims enter the market blindly and they can't see what's going on, even. Regulating Exchanges seem to be more achievable in the US than any other country.

Now, they've got to blame the SEC for not taking action like the SEC is uncontrollable. I don't trust these law makers, the concepts of executing or passing bills is controlled by unknown inner players within their circle. Whatever is revealed to the entire public is more or less a lie. Because they should have questioned the SEC, when congress man Davidson discovered that the SEC regularly meets up with FTX. These law makers are more interested on the funds than regulating cryptocurrency.",

So the Government can't capitalize on one events when they're multiple scams happening on the wild west cryptocurrency market. In addition, the Government also received donations from the exchange, so I'd say that if they effected the downfall of FTX its not for regulation, maybe it's for the aim of more money, bulk. They'll have their share of the lost money.",

According to this article, it will create laws and regulations to crackdown on moneylaundering, however, I speculate that similar to much of the of bills created, some statements on this bill would be vague, broad and open to interpretation.As federal prosecutors seek to imprison former crypto darling Sam Bankman-Fried, Sen. Elizabeth Warren is attempting to push through Congress a bipartisan crackdown on money laundering in the crypto industry.The Massachusetts Democrat is teaming up with Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas to introduce new legislation on Wednesday that would seek to close loopholes in the financial system that pose national security risks by allowing digital assets to be used for money laundering, Warren’s office told CNN.Source https://edition.cnn.com/2022/12/14/business/elizabeth-warren-bipartisan-crypto-crackdown/index.html",
