  "content": "Just last night, I was making some posts, and after making about six posts, which was supposed to make my total post count 1337, I just saw \"leet\" the moment I dropped the 6th post. Last night experience just reminded me of what also happened with my profile some months ago, when I clicked on my profile, it Opened, but I was seeing a different name on my profile, but the number of merits, post count, and activity were the same as mine, but the name was something else. After I refreshed the page, it changed to my name. But for this current occurrence of last night, I refreshed my profile several times, but it was just showing the same word \"leet\". Anyone had the same situation before, or just me? And who has any idea what it could be? I guess maybe some sort of bug or something ðŸ’­ðŸ¤” else...Cheers ðŸ¥‚, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange ðŸ‘ºðŸ‘º",
