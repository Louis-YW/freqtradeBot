Gambling is what we make of it. You will enjoy being a gambler if you have that self-control with your wagering amount, bankroll, time spent to gamble, and accepting your losses as it comes not to chase after the loss the propensity of loss chase leads to more losses. The loss recovery syndrome is what makes gamblers sale off their properties thinking that they can use the money gotten from the sale of their property to recover their previous losses. That's why we're admonished to use amount we can easily let go when we lose it to gamble. At the end of the day this sarcasm will always meet the victims with a cold feet.",

Gambler says... he can now afford to rent an apartment because of gambling, says from a gambler who use to have his own house. LOL... So it was just a joke, but if we reflect hard, we would understand that if we won't be careful with gambling, time will come this would happen to us. Bringing this is helpful @OP... this is for the gamblers who arent' still seeing the risk of what they are doing, so hopefully they'll see this joke and reflect seriously.",

If they wont really be that sensible and mindful about spendingthen they would really be ending up on this way.This is why we should really be that responsible with our gambling because if we dont then we really ends up the same situationon which it is something that we dont really like to happen.",

Nevertheless it's true though, I mean everyone could end that way if they are not careful about their gambling.Or even worst comes to worst, maybe he will sell his bike and then just the walk of shame every time he goes to the office. That will be really terrible, although I haven't experience the walk of shame when I gamble in land based before I don't have a car. I always put side money on my back pocket just to make sure.",

But we don't know whether he sold his car to continue gambling or if there was something else that meant he had to sell his car. But if he sells his car just because he wants to continue gambling, that has gone too far and it seems like he is addicted to gambling so he must be cured and not gamble anymore. He has seen what happened to his life so he should realize it and not gamble anymore or his life will become even more chaotic. Yes, that is a valuable lesson for us because gambling can make us lose everything we have, even our family.",

This one is really funny, and it's not just actually a joke but a real life realization for all gamblers. That is, if you gamble without caution, without knowing your limits in gambling, you will certainly end up with a huge loss and just settle to what you can only afford. This serves as an eye opener that in gambling, its more of a loss than win, especially if you keep chasing for some profits in gambling.However, some gamblers are just extra lucky that when they start gambling, all they own is a bike, but when they hit the jackpot prize, they purchase their brand new car. Well, this is the irony but still possible with gambling.",

Many gamblers are also having this losses and gradually they are going down but obstinately don't want to quit. Gambling is not what you will do all the time, you can gamble if you see the probability to win especially in soccer but if you don't win then you wait for another time.

It was truly hilarious when I first heard about that joke but that only works once and the next you see it or hear it, you won't be laughing anymore especially if you are also a gambler who experienced the same thing as those people.

If a person just keeps losing and getting frustrated, it means that it's problem gambling, perhaps an addiction. If a person only gambles recreationally, spending only what one can afford to lose, gambling is a way of having fun and would not lead to issues like losing a car or a house. So it's simply important to keep things under control and seek professional help if necessary.",

This happenings could possibly happen to anyone if they are not careful with their gambling habits since if they get addicted with this for sure they can sell all their stuff just to have money to use for gambling.That's why to avoid such unfortunate scenario its really better for us to control our emotion and don't ever chase anything on gambling. We should be more responsible enough to know what exceed to us and what is not since if we know how to control any activity that can give us a big problem for sure we can possibly eliminate anything that can possibly give us a problem.",
