I checked website which shows that 2 Presale rounds are  successfully ended with full token sale. after every sale round end the price of token increasing in the next round. Listing date is  August first week according to website announcement. My question is about token distribution and locking period. 1: When will token be distributed and fully unlock (before listing or after)2: will there be full unlocked of token after TGE ?3: Coinstore is good for early start but may i knows there are also big exchange offer ICO like Bitget, bybit, Kucoin, Gate so we can expect Public ICO there or this roadmap is final?",

Though I don't know if other devices like desktop and the apple apps are working because I have not tried them. Hi Gladitorcomeback,We are very moderate in spending our tokens. We have not given any massive discounts in presale round, so we have decided to keep the tokens unlocked for the presale buyers. We also know with the kind of upcoming developments, partnerships and listings, Project will reach its peak in 2-3 years time. I hope all investors will hold for good gains and not sell for mere % profits from Presale purchase.We are planning long term incentives for presale buyers by giving them boosters in Staking, free mint in upcoming NFT projects launched in Ozonechain, etc.We are concentrating more on Decentralized developments like Dex, Launchpads, NFT marketplace and Metaverse. We are in talk with EVM compatible projects for partnerships. Listing in CEX should come one by one. We will concentrate on long term development and adoption than rushing into exchange listings. I would invite you and your friends to invest in our project for a secure future.You can contact me in telegram @eris_Crypto if you have any more question, i am there to help.Best regards.Quote from: Gladitorcomeback on June 01, 2023, 01:05:16 AMQuote from: ozone_chain on May 30, 2023, 07:50:44 PMOur Presale is live at https://ico.ozonechain.io, we have partnered with Coinstore Exchange for IEO and listing.
