In online casinos, it's often just to show the users that they are licensed to make them look legit. It helps the reputation and user's trust somehow but you know how costly it is to sue them.  Creating a scam report in bitcointalk is worth doing to ruin the casino's rep than suing a casino that you know you won't be seeing on the court.",

It's something I guess we all should be aware of; I believe most of us don't know at all.What I know is that you should use a trustworthy casino. If a casino is not located in your country, the more the money that would be used to file a law suit against them. What people are doing most are to post what the casino did on their social media and forums for people to avoid the casino.",

It's something I guess we all should be aware of; I believe most of us don't know at all.Not sure about this and I'm not aware, but just want to ask a question, is there a case already where a gambling site, specifically with a Curacao license, turned into a scammed site and just went off without any trace? If there is, I don't understand why these sites will apply for a license as even though it's easy to have a Curacao license, the requirements needed are personal documents of its owners and detailed information about their business, and these are strictly screened.Scam gambling sites, as I see, won't bother to apply for any license.",

I Know a Casino with a License looks more trustworthy, but I will trust better word of mouth recommendation and endorsement about the reputation of a casino than just knowing that they have a curacao license, or any other License. Casinos can change after they have obtained the licenses and that is why I will not take the fact that a casino is licensed to mean that they will not give me issues in the future. Nothing beats reading real reviews to know if a casino is good or not.",

They are only there to fill their pockets and of course want as few problems as possible.

Based on the online data its cost about 20K to 25k Euros to get the license and later the annual fee once the business becomes operative.Having license allows the jurisdiction to accept the gamblers and tax compliance just like every other business. In past license didn't get in the priority but now it becomes mandatory even for the startups.",

Since they pay 20k and have to wait for approval they aren't going to steal 1k from you.I agree that licenses aren't anything you can rely upon, but it shows some effort on the side of the casino. That can be an effort to run a legit business or a big scam. I rarely look at that when I choose a place to play. Reviews and age of the business are more important.",
