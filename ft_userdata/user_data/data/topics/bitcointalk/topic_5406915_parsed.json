I can't even seem to find any terms from freebitco.in which we don't know the reason for accounts removal.",

Thanks.Have you been able to log into your account again?contacting them via email or contacting via representatives on this forum will not help because their security system detects all the accounts as multi accounts and it violates their rules, family members are often used as an excuse to defend themselves, if you register all of these accounts on one of the referral links of the suspended account, this further proves the fraud they have detected, and making all of these accounts have FUN tokens is also a way to take advantage because if you are at level 1 which is 2,500 FUN will get 1 WoF every day and having 20 accounts will be more profitable because it will get 20 WoF compared to one account with the highest level that must have 500,000 FUN.",

Yes, if you write the email correctly, you will be able to log in or register for Freebitcoin. I have been working on this site for years, and frankly, my experience with it is not good. I have personally convinced that it is a waste of time or a systematic scam. You POLL the faucet every hour and you get 0.00000050BTC and it never happened before that I got a lucky number that has a good payout, in addition, the betting game to multiply your bitcoins is very complicated and may make you lose everything you have, so try with a small amount that you can lose instead of 0.046BTC, just a piece of advice.",
