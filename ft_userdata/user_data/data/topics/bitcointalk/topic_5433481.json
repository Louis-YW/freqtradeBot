Just ignore all sponsored posts (they're usually clearly marked and are just a minor step up from pure Press Release type or advertisement posts) as those have the lowest quality and most dubious sources (they're paid for, so can't really blame them for using a common media business model).Crypto Town Crier is my occasional \"how to read between the lines of the real news\" site but they seem to have taken a break in the last month. I was formerly affiliated with Bitcoin News also, and while their content is a bit iffy, it does strive to be more of a commentary site than breaking news (and their Telegram is... at times interesting).",

They have insightful information of bitcoin market and possible development as expected to be likely result of any occurrence in the blockchain industry. So far, they do share educative bitcoin data and information for personal Consumptions you upgrade if the need be.

They're a crypto news content website so basically the content is much more important than the appearance of the website. Although it's also one of my concerns when I'm thinking of using a website the design, but with them all I can say is that it's not that bad at all but that's my preference and the same as yours.",
