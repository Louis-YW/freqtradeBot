Abortion is done in very early stages anyway. Fetus is not aware of anything and haven't experienced anything.And the irony is just too much when i see people who are so pro life when it comes to unborn, but seem to despice baby's life after it has is born. Then it's suddenly baby's fault that it was born to conditions that it couldn't handle and ended up in jail later on. Pro-life people aren't so pro life when it comes death sentence, war, free health care, or decent living conditions for poor people. Then they seem to be ok by letting people die.",

Morality was taking a center stage, that it bad to take a life and in some countries, it is a crime to abort but such countries also go to war and bomb even hospitals where the sick and helpless is recuperating. It is really a wide topic and I will just say it is a choice.Some people have purpose to avert a new life to be added to the family, whether health wise or not, whether logical or not is left for couples.About reducing the number of population like we have some Asian countries having that as policy, I think with the reality of economic hardship, homes in Africa and new couples are already having the mind not to procreate more than what they can take care of.",

If woman was raped and got pragnanted that way, it's definitely up to mother whether she wants to give a birth of do an abortion, no one can blame her because she was impregnated forcefully, without her will.2. If Doctor tells couples that their child will have birth defect, then it's up to couple to decide whether they want to dedicate their life to that kid or do an abortion. Personally, I think that no one can blame mother for abortion in this case because child with birth defect usually makes life pure hell for parents and child also suffers from defect, some of them include pain, disabilities and etc.3. If mother got pregnant accidently via one night stand and she doesn't want baby, then abortion is probably okay, probably, because child will suffer from growing up without loving parents and most likely she will be abused by a mother or stepfather. But this part is very debatable and I don't have fixed opinion about that. There are cases when mother doesn't want baby but grandparents take it as their responsibility to grow them, so, it's very debatable.",

QuoteCountries now do so many things to control the number of children a couple is allowed to have and the rate of abortion is increasing by the day.Many nations that came up with policies to reduce their population are regretting their actions. Majority of the makeup of the population is aging and most youths are not interested in raising children. This has led to labor shortages which has affected many sectors negatively. I don't know any developed country that encourages abortion to reduce population in recent times. QuoteAlthough some society and religion strictly kicks against it and victims are punishable by the laws of some societies, that hasn't stopped people from taking part in itWhile Some don't even see it as anything bad, some feel undergoing abortion is same as taking a life and the culprit should be subject to punishment.With so many thought process regarding this topic, whats your take on abortion?Abortion can be justified if the health of the mother or baby is at stake. In cases of rape and other moral issues,  abortion can also be recommended. But anyone that is not ready to have a baby knows what to do. Use protection or take action immediately after sex. Regardless of how we see it,  abortion is causing more harm to our society than the problem we think it solves.",

A situation where abortion is somewhat deliberated is when a woman is raped and she conceived. In this situation, I don’t still think it is the best thing to do but if the woman insists and wants to get rid of it with her life at risk, then no one can stop that from happening. Abortion is same as committing suicide, anyone caught doing that knowingly should be arrested and prosecuted and jailed.",

And it's a sin because the person has killed a soul, after abortion there are complications that occur which will be detrimental to the persons health like haemorrhage ( excessive loss of blood) and you know what happen when there is too much loss of blood, it will lead to lack of circulation of sufficient oxygen because what assist in oxygen ( haemoglobin) transportation is lost through haemorrhage.

There are cases when mother doesn't want baby but grandparents take it as their responsibility to grow them, so, it's very debatable.You just said my mind. Why bring a child into the world to suffer  when you know you are not capable financially,  morally and otherwise to raise a child? In as much as we know that most people abort their babies due to some selfish reasons,  abortion cannot be wrong in all cases. Sometimes it is necessary to abort when the life of the mother is at stake.In some countries where abortion is illegal, people tend to drink all form of concoctions or visit quacks who know little or nothing about the abortion process. This can result in complications for the woman or even death. Most times, if the foetus is not terminated successfully,  it can can lead to some defects in the baby if the child is finally born. In my view,  abortion should be legalised for special cases like you listed above. You don't force a rape victim to keep a child simply because abortion is a sin. Having a child should be a matter of personal decision. And consenting adults should as much as possible protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. This will save you the stress of going through the abortion process.",

But in general...If there was sex outside of marriage, and if there is going to be an abortion, don't wait for the abortion. Rather, execute the mother and father for having sex outside of marriage. The major alternative to this would be that the mother and father get married and raise the child right. Other alternatives might be:1. That there is a man willing to marry the woman, and raise the child in the absence of the father;2. That the parents of the woman (or any other responsible married couple) agree to support the woman.and the child until the child is 18;3. Other points would be similar to these.But if there is going to be an abortion, take the mother's and father's lives right along with the baby/fetus/embryo... especially in the case of sex outside of marriage.",

If you know that you are not ready for a child, abstain from sexual intercourse if you have not yet started having sex, but if you have, then always try to play it safe with your partner. You both should have a discussion about your plans so you can have an understanding that pregnancy at that stage can ruin the plans that you both have for yourself. If you are a lady having unprotected sex with a person that you know you cannot allow be the father of your child, or will not be ready to father a child, you should stop being sexually involved with them unprotected. And as a female if you know you are not ready to be a mother and you understand that it can ruin your plans for your future, do not let yourself get pregnant, so that the though of abortion does not come up.",

Have you heard the heartbeat after a week? I bet after a week the sperms reach the shores of safety, they are not in the mood to get working, besides they have a battle to win.After a month it starts showing because embryo is attached by then, though I'm not a doctor, it's just that I know that the heart starts beating after 5-6 weeks. Maybe mice start beating after a week but not humans.Another thing is, God says if you are afraid of poverty, don't be, for that I am the one providing for the child, you just have to believe that.  But nowadays most of the abortion cases are either bastards or it happens out of fear that they can't afford to raise a child.",
