So i only can speculate some Bitcoin holder either,1. Move their coin to different address, either because they used old software or wanting better security by using different wallet.2. Sell their coin after finding out Bitcoin price rising a lot in past few months.",

Perhaps the user was waiting on the halving to see what the holding could amass to and at a good enough price, holder has taken profit in simple terms.This could be the case, however, that address has been holding this coins since 2016/2017, and moved them on the 24th and 28th of last month. So just thinking aloud here, if that bitcoiner has been waiting since 2016 for this year's halving, then surely they would be able to wait longer until we see the 'real' effect of the halving this year, which a lot of people expect to be ~ $100k.So i think this bitcoiner may have moved their coins to another wallet for better security, maybe a new hardware wallet or they set up a new airgapped wallet. This is just my own idea, and it does not matter to any of us what the bitcoiner did with their coins.",

I commend those who have been well acquainted with bitcoin since basically the creation of it but not all of them are still active participants in bitcoin.Besides if we could hypothetically give sleeping addresses to anyone, why would we when there is still a chance that it could wake up and suddenly move?",

We should always work according to the prices set, we know how challenging it can be for most people here.The blockchain is built on formidable grounds and we have received the top runs in the system.",
