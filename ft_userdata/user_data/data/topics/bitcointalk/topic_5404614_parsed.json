  "content": "I’ve attached screenshots below showing proof of wins, bonus being cleared, etc. Please read So starting from the beginning. I’m a vip member at rocketpot and they give me a 100% deposit bonus weekly. So I deposited $1500 in Eth and got a $1500 bonus. I lost the real funds and just had bonus funds left. I decided to play book of 99 as it’s a 99% rtp game I ended up losing and being down to my last $140. I decided to play sweet bonanza candy land(game show) bet the bonus games and ended up hitting a 60x for  $4800. Then decided to play book of 99 slot again and other games ended up winning, getting a balance of 16kish. I decided to play blackjack/game shows and slots to clear the 100x wager requirement. After a long grind, I cleared the wager requirement breaking even and 14-16k was added to my real balance. I immediately requested a cash out  of 7.5k(as there is a 10k weekly limit) and decided to do fruit party bonus buys with the rest. Eventually hit a 53k win off a $2000 buy in fruit party(see screenshots below) Keep in mind this is all real funds at this point as the bonus was cleared. While waiting for withdrawal to be processed I decided to keep playing setting a stop loss of 10-20k as I can only withdraw 10k/week anyways. I ended up running my balance to over 160k usd in etherum. Now rocketpot has declined my withdrawal and telling me they won’t process it with no real explanation besides “dishonest behaviour” with an explanation of “I activated the bonus funds and then collect bonuses or spins in a game directly. Then I go and cancel or lose the bonus funds. After that I go back into the game collect the spins or bonus and have it added to real balance” that’s just complete bs as I never canceled or lost the bonus, I completed the wager requirements for the bonus. Their explanation doesn’t even make any sense as I never did any of the things they said. I got extremely lucky and was able to clear a 100x wager requirement and ended up winning 53k on fruit party legitimately afterwards with real funds. After I explained that I never canceled or lost the bonus funds and ended up clearing it. I was told they are gonna continue to investigate it. As of this moment Im still waiting for a update, but I’m posting this to raise awareness and for people to stay away from rocketpot as I truly believe they are looking for any excuse at this point to not pay out as it’s a large payout. If you guys have any legal course I can take please let me know as I fully intend to take any means necessary against this as this is life changing money for me and I feel I am literally getting robbed. Will continue to post updates on here. Ps I’ve also went over rocketpots terms of service and nothing I did is against there tos https://imgur.com/a/LGb13NRhttps://imgur.com/a/Vt1Un9jhttps://imgur.com/a/H4sGRykhttps://i.imgur.com/RJHyAar.jpgUPDATE #1They confirmed with me today that the winnings were legit and I did in fact clear the bonus. Was told to request a 6k withdrawal as it’s within their weekly 10k/week limit and that a manager will be emailing me. Seems like they will be honoring the payout? So far still haven’t received the 6k or gotten an email from the manager. Will post further updates as this develops. As for posting on the scam section, due to this update I will be waiting another 24 hours if nothing is received by then I will be proceeding with posting this there in greater detail. The part of the pic I blacked out showed player name and details so due to privacy reasons I blacked it out [https://imgur.com/a/LWNHNGq](https://imgur.com/a/LWNHNGq)UPDATEhttps://imgur.com/a/RkJwgydGood news rocketpot has paid out $16k so far. They processed the $6000 withdrawal Sunday and has already paid out the $10000 for this week following their limits. So so far I’ve received $16k of the $170k+. Good news is there was no delay in the $10k payout for this week.  Unfortunately still have no direct answer or confirmation from rocketpot if they will be paying out and honoring the full 170k+ in winnings waiting on the appropriate manager update for that. Now following their withdrawal limits I am waiting till next week to request another $10k to see if this continues. Will post further updates and every payment received on hereUPDATEhttps://imgur.com/a/ljC8YGlThat’s the thing, rocketpot still hasn’t given a direct answer or confirmation if they’ll honouring the full amount. When I asked today for the update regarding it, I was told this(see pic). Trust me there’s no one that would love to change the thread title more than me, but for now untill I get a answer allI can do is just post every payment I receive on here(which is still positive news) I also asked if there is any way they can raise their monthly limits they cannot. So after I request a another $10k on Monday the 11th I’m gonna be waiting till August 1st before I can request a further payout. The reality is getting paid out in full is gonna take a long time and this will be an extruding long processWill continue to post updates here",

[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5178376.0The presented terms in this is out of place to me. What do they mean by canceling a promotion that have already be keyed into. From my understanding to that term, it applies to laying claims to the validity of a promotion as per running and not after it has been claimed, used in gambling and made wins of it. Amendments to it might be on how its used and not to declare it illegal after winners have been made of I. Else, what becomes of the promotional offers then.",
