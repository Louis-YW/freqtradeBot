If you have resersched well, you will notice that MBit is no longer a reputable gambling site on this forum and it is advisable for everyone to stay away from the gambling site if they do not want to be scammed. There are many active gambling sites on this forum, go to gambling board to check that. Use only the active ones with active official thread and account on this forum.",

Just be careful trusting anyone claiming that they are mbit casino representative since some scammers use this incident to scam the investors again. I guess for this issue if you have time you can seek help for legal authorities who's expert to handle crypto scamming cases in your country.",

You can't do anything when it comes to online casinos as you will never be able to reach them or lodge any legal complaint against them",
