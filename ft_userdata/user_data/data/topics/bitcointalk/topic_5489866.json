The problem of using this strategy is you need to check the price everyday to get updated and you need to set a budget how much you will buy for the dip, the dip could happen continuously in one month and it could be not happen in one month because the market is bullish.",

If I have the ability to apply it, I will do the same, but I also understand that the principle should not be too stubborn, so I often think about harmony between investment and life. Someone's formula may be suitable for that individual, but it may not always be applied effectively.Looking back at the method, I'm still a bit skeptical about using it on a large time frame so it's just a simulation for DCA on a small time frame, but in this space if such good timing is certain everything is so convenient.",

      "body": "The smart DCA method is good for investors who have accumulated up to a certain level of bitcoin either close to their bitcoin target, because when you have reached that stage, you will not want to buy frequently, but you will look for time when to buy. Maybe at the dip or using the smart DCA during corrections in the bull run.However, for a new investor who just started his bitcoin accumulation journey should not use the smart DCA in this stage, because their size of bitcoin is very small or they don't have any. The weekly or monthly regular DCA is the best, because it will give them the opportunity to buy bitcoin often and keep on grow their bitcoin portfolio bit by bit, without skipping any week or month.",

The smart DCA, as mk4 says is again trying to time the market, which we already know is very difficult. Besides, I remember having seen some studies on the stock market showing that in reality between doing simple DCA or waiting for the downturns to buy there was hardly any difference in terms of profitability in the long term (if the one who buys in the downturns is right, which is a lot to assume).I, as I say, sometimes I have taken advantage to reload in a market downturn because at that time I had more money available or I have sold at highs to enjoy profits but these are different reasons than trying to make a \"smart\" DCA.",

They don't even have to make any transactions manually themselves anymore, as many exchanges nowadays would offer regular purchase option. I have my doubts whether the \"Smart DCA\" is a good term as the approach here would be quite different from the classic DCA and could result in completely different outcome - i.e. in scenario where there are no dips and the price is moving slowly and consistently up for prolonged period (which is rare but theoretically possible).From what I know, timing the market, or \"buying the dips\" strategy is, on average, more effective than DCA, but the DCA is still much more convenient for most people.",

Also, unless you managed to automate your purchase (which I don't think is possible on any platform without having a trading bot), there's a risk you could simply miss the correction and not buy in the right time, i.e. due to holidays, other commitments etc.But yeah, both strategies have their own risks and only the time will tell which one is more effective.",
