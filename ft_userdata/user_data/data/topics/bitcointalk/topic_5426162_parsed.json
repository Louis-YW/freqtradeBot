Yubikey with serial # 011098772. Yubikey Shipping Document with matched serial #.3. MTGOX NFT: https://www.mtgoxnft.net/l/en-US/FAQ:Will you place the item in escrow?Yes, I will place the item in escrow with a trusted forum member.Can you do escrow transaction for buyer?Yes, if buyer pays the escrow fee.Who pays for shipping?The buyer will cover all shipping and insurance costs.Introduction: Yubikeys were distributed by MTGOX with and without custom branding as early as July 2011. Mark Karpelès' 2020 Twitter post confirms this (see link below). The Yubikey in this auction is a version without the MTGOX logo, showing the serial number and corresponding QR code.https://twitter.com/MagicalTux/status/1311228582534864898NFTThe MTGOX NFT is airdropped to all MtGox users through a verification process to ensure they are indeed MtGox customers. MtGox's NFT is an ERC-721 compliant NFT with a number of extra features intended to cover specific use cases. NFT numbers (uint256) will match the MtGox account number, and a hardcoded limit will prevent any NFT from being created outside the range of MtGox accounts. This minting method has owner-only limitation, and will allow an externally signed token to be issued to users who have completed verification.Original Yubikey Shipping DocumentIncluded is the original paper document sent out by MTGOX with the key. It references the YubiKey's matching serial #. This document is not a copy, it is the original item: Images of the key in my possession: I reached out to Yubikey support for verification of this key using the serial number. Yubikey support confirmed via serial number that this key was produced in September 2011. Since the serial number is public, anyone can verify this by contacting Yubikey support themselves.",

See here for details: https://www.mtgoxnft.net/l/en-US/I'm surprised you haven't claimed your MtGox NFT yet, but that's awesome you plan to include it in the sale.  I claimed my MtGox NFT a while ago but I haven't seen much happen with it.  I occasionally check on it to see if it's morphed into something cool or the price has gone crazy...  I have always been surprised how much they are selling for.  People pretty much have no idea what they're going to be when all is said and done, but there's a market for them that seems to thrive.  Good luck!",
