Its goal is to bring the game we know and love to today’s new standard, so the game will receive the attention it deserves into the future. MetaPoker is designed with three prominent concepts integrated to its platform– decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens(NFT), and blockchain-based Poker game.Within MetaPoker’s ecosystem, the users will be able to take on a variety of roles such as player, investor, influencer, and shareholder, and enrich the MetaPoker experience while engaging with the platform and its community. Thus, allowing the entire ecosystem to self — sustain and operate.At the current stage, we do not plan to seek investments but rather want to open up a dialogue between you and us to keep the project moving towards.If you are interested in either poker or GameFi, please join us and give us effective feedback, both positive and negative, is very helpful.
