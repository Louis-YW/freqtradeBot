  "content": "Long time member here, but has been some time since I last posted.I wanted to post here because I thought maybe some of you would be interested in some extremely rare Marine saltwater I have available.In particular I have some Peacekeeper Maroon Clownfish which haven't been openly on the market for 7 to 8 years now. I also have a brand new variant that no one else owns yet that I'm releasing, called the Maravilla.These are absolutely stunning fish that are very hardy, unlike most other Marine fish species. They are also excellent for any level of experience in the hobby.Each fish is $10,000 USD, however, this is an all inclusive price as I will also fly out and deliver these fish to you. It would be a white glove treatment. I will acclimate them to your tank. This reduces the transaction risk on such a high profile fish. If it passes in transit, it's on me.I will accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment.I actually have been turning this into a business and I am incorporated. It is called Fish Are Friends. My website, www.fisharefriends.com, is still in progress but hoping to have something up within the next week since Aquashella is in August 9th.I will try to get some pictures posted up, or can message me and I'll give you my number. I don't mind videoing showing what's available via sort of a WYSIWYG.If anyone has any questions please reach out to me either in this thread or via PM/DM.I'd be more than happy to help you through any advice in getting into the hobby as well as it's very easy to make costly mistakes. A nice setup for these fish on a nice budget.Thank you for any interested and I look forward to hearing from you all.",
