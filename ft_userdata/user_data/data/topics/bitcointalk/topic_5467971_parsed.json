  "content": "I have this idea 💡 no one will ever do it and I don’t have a dictator’s power to make it happen.The cattle feed lots in Yuma Arizona  produce lots of beef for the USA.Yuma Arizona has huge lettuce 🥬 and green vegetables fields. Providing veg to most of the world.On more than on occasion the shit and runoff from the cattle goes into the irrigation canals and makes large e coli contamination of the veg.my idea is shade the cattle with solar panels.cattle need shade and you could make a huge solar field to shade the feed lot.use the solar energy to dry the shit from the cattle into fuel.burn the waste to run a mining farmuse the irrigation canals to cool the miners which sterilizes the water.run the water into the green veg.So the waste from the cows is used to  both mine coin and  sterilize the water.The coins mitigate the cost of the project.we get clean veg and good beef.This is a pretty much prefect idea which will never be done in the U.S.A due to multiple interests that would fight it. But a dictator could just say do this and get it done.So anyone have other ideas 💡 that would be good. That need a dictators clout to get done.",

If I were the dictator of America, I would probably look into JFK’s executive order 11110 and also make politicians submitting a budget deficit illegal. These two actions I suspect would solve a majority of the world’s problems over a couple decades.",

The shade will protect cattle from sun and other environmental issues while at the same time it will generate electricity for free. The initial cost will be higher but over time it'll be much profitable.Quote from: philipma1957 on September 24, 2023, 11:51:44 PMuse the solar energy to dry the shit from the cattle into fuel.Not sure about fuel but the solar energy can be helpful to turn their waste into biogas which can then be converted into electricity with specialized kind of bio-gas generators. That electricity plus the extra unutilized solar energy can be utilized to run the mining farms.Quote from: philipma1957 on September 24, 2023, 11:51:44 PMThis is a pretty much prefect idea which will never be done in the U.S.A due to multiple interests that would fight it.

That need a dictators clout to get done.Yes, your idea is a nice one but unfortunately it's impossible to see it happen in real life. A dictator might be able to do that but man a dictator in USA is an unthinkable thing. My simple idea is to promote awareness about such ideas at US level in the form of free seminars and webinars so that the farmers and miners of USA may implement this idea as it can be helpful for both. The government will subsidy them for their efforts if they turn this idea into reality.",

      "body": "Your idea isn't really a new one. I mean it's smart, but there are many great ways to make everything more efficient and eliminate problems countries are facing. There's a way to reduce biological waste by feeding it to the worms and allow chickens to roam free in the area, eating the worms. When the worms are done with the waste you're left with processed compost that you can use for planting and a lot of well fed chickens.Technically you could generate more power than the world needs just from renewables, but that would require countries to work together on a global scale because:some countries don't have rivers, but those that have them don't want to build hydroelectric generatorssome countries don't experience strong winds and those that do are too poor to build wind generators, or don't want to do it because of bird deaths and noisesome countries don't get enough sun to make solar panels efficient and some of those that do, don't have ways to make panels. They have to buy them from China and some countries don't want to trade with ChinaIf I could make the whole world do what I say, I'd make countries share resources between them on a larger scale. That's the root of the problem that I have a hammer and you have wood and nails, but I don't want you to build a house faster than me so I won't give you my hammer to slow you down and none of us will benefit.",

      "body": "heres the thing.. to buy fertiliser to grow crops to feed the cows cost something.. so burning the manure and then buying fertiliser elsewhere is not cost efficientburning manure doesnt create enough watts to keep several miners running 24/7the more cost efficient is to use manure to fertilise land to grow crops to feed the cow to maturity. to sell the cow to then use the income to buy electric from the grid to power a minerthe amount of manure coming out of one cow to  burn for miner energy will not produce enough electric compared to selling the cow and buying grid electricso burning manure wont earn good electric production and then having to buy fertiliser to crow crops will add into those costs too..yes using a manure degradation process can produce some excess methane before then using the solids as fertiliser.. but the cost of the decomposer and then the cost of a biofuel burner and electric generator wont cover the cost saving of using the biogas to reduce the amount of electric you'd need to  buy from the gridits more efficient to just spread manure on the field let crops grow, let cows eat crops and then sell the cow to then buy electricunless the farmer is also an engineer and can make the decomposer and generator cheap from scrap materials he can scavenge from locals...alot of people SAY solar and biogas is cheap electric production.. but that is if you are spreading the hardware cost over a decade+however we all know hashrate increases meaning mining competition increases and so every 2 year people need to buy more hardware to double up hashrate to stay in the hash race. meaning although you buy solar or biogas generator to power Xminers in year one. by year three you are doubling capacity. meaning your costs dont last decades but just a couple years meaning the energy production isnt spread over a decade but a few years before upgrading more hardware, so that multiplies the cost by 5x compared to what some may tell you",

I mean there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the plan itself aside from nobody would do it, that is an expensive idea that is high tech, and whenever we are talking about brand new technology stuff, governments are usually too late to it. Think about places like DMV, that's a government place and just check how outdated everything they use, including the simplest thing which is the software they use.So all in all, the idea is \"possible\" but unrealistic to expect USA to do something like this, because governments are heavy and slow. People can do it, I mean there is nothing going against that, anyone who has enough money could buy cattles and solar panels and give it a go.",

Yuma Arizona has a huge food lot for cattle 🐮.And there is so much shit it constantly pollutes the irrigation canal system.Btw free market is so much not a free market in the USA its funny to even talk about it as if it exists so it must be best method to do.  This discussion belongs elsewhere.",

I mean, everyone should earn what they deserve. I know this is not actually on-topic and about the usage of POW coins but let me explain what I mean.Proof Of Work in ideal life would look like this:Everyone wears a watch during the work that measures how much physical energy they use, i.e. how many calories they burn during the work, how much mental energy they use (let's say it's 2050 year) and what kind of mental or physical job they do. They will have a coefficient according to their job type and they will earn money that way. This means that people who do nothing, like many managers and some higher people, will earn nothing if they actually don't work during the day. This can probably solve many problems and lazy people wouldn't be earning high figures without actually doing the job.I really wish there was a Proof Of Work system in our life, that would make life fairer and would make some sense.",
