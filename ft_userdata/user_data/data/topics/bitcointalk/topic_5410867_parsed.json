Besides if Satoshi wanted to show any support he would do what all those miners did last year and signed a message announcing that CSW is a scumbag scammer.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/25/craig-wright-called-fraud-in-message-signed-with-bitcoin-addresses-he-claims-to-own/P.S.

I appreciate it when something like that happens . that wallet holder is really lucky . coz When he mined 50 bitcoins the price was very low but now when he transferred the bitcoins it is worth more than million dollars. But if he had access to his wallet a few months earlier ,when the price of bitcoin was over $65k he could have sold his bitcoins for 3x from present price. To be honest, any miner who could have the courage to hold a bitcoin that was mine when the price was $0.5 deserve to do whatever he chose to do with his bitcoin. I mean 10 years is a big lot of time that many things have happened in the bitcoin industry. If the owner of that wallet address could import his private keys to other chains, he could also spend other coins that were airdroped some years ago.
