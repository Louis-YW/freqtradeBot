  "content": "Hello bros, just want to make a new update on the bitcoin. I started to see people asking if it was a good time to buy Bitcoin or not. I think it's a pretty lazy question cos everyone should do their own research, but if there people are truly wondering about it, I will try to give a short answer to it.There were a couple of weeks after my last post about the best time to buy Bitcoin and my opinion STILL didn't change.Yes, we can see that bitcoin is going up, we see that inflation is going down little by little and other signals. But I will keep advocating that we still didn't get rid of the MAIN reason economy is suffering and Bitcoin is not 60k.Interest rates are still high and FED just keeps rising it. And that's where the real problem is. You should understand that some signals might be good and show that economy is recovering, but while inflation is still higher than needed, FED will keep rising or then holding interest rates. It means that it's NOT over and we might see another huge Bitcoin dump in a near future. It's obvious that some sectors of the economy showing some good results but only because of the LAG EFFECT of the interest rates.I still think that we won't see real gains until inflation will go down enough and fed will start cutting interest rates. I said it before and I will say it again: I think the best time to buy bitcoin will be after interest rates will go down. It's easily the best signal to buy for me. And it's also the least risky one.So be careful. If you truly don't know if you should buy or not, do some research and always look at the bigger picture and not some small local signals.",

I have been thinking that bitcoin will get to all-time-high that would be over $100000 next, that means that starting to accumulate at $30000 is not too late.This is not trading, holders do not have much business with fundamental trading just as it is explained in the OP, holders should focus on the fact that the price of bitcoin is not yet still too high and buying weekly or daily with certain little amount of money is better than to miss the next bull run.",

So not thinking of selling or buying in the short term but thinking that it is decentralised, the only commodity that does not increase its supply when the price goes up and things like that.",

When Bitcoin's below $20,000, interest rates at that time is at it's peak. Fortunately, I bought a small amount at that time, and didn't do and what you are saying. Now interest rates are still high, Bitcoin's price is still low (for me), why not take the opportunity to buy now, and wait for the Fed to cut interest rates?I mean sooner or later, Fed will still cut interest rates, so why not make one step ahead of it? You used the word \"think\" meaning you're not sure as well on what you're saying. Well, I'm 100% sure if I say that it's still a good time to invest into Bitcoin right now. Just buy. Do Dollar-Cost Average, and don't wait for Fed to cut interest rates. Now with to your opinion, I guess I will not follow what you said.  Respect to you still for sharing your opinion, but I will not follow that one. I still believe in Dollar-Cost Averaging. F*ck the interest rates, but I will still continue to buy, and buy, and buy.",

If you truly don't know if you should buy or not, do some research and always look at the bigger picture and not some small local signals.That's an interesting take on the current situation and what to expect in near future of the bitcoin market. In some parts I agree with you and in others I am more optimistic than you. In general I would also say that it's not the best time to buy large quantities of Bitcoins, but we also need to look alternatives. In case we have large sums of fiat cash laying around then we need to do something with it. In my country the interest rates on savings are around 1% while the inflation rate is 8-10%. It just doesn't make any sense to not invest and at least try to keep the value of our money constant. I would still recommend to invest at least partially our money in bitcoins. Just because bitcoins aren't cheap anymore doesn't mean there isn't a lot of upside potential legt. We are still far away from the ATH and the halving is going to come next year.",

Buying Bitcoin anytime makes more sense.That's the best they could think about, it's not their fault, they have failed to understand that when the world is in fear or panic, it's always a good time to make a decision, Waren Buffet's favorite quote says ' Be greedy when others are Fearful and Be Fearful when others are Greedy'.Waiting for inflation to go down before you start buying Bitcoin means you will be buying at a high price because lower inflation is automatically bullish for the whole crypto space, this is one of the reasons why many people missed good buying opportunities. They want good news to be around the corner before taking a step, not knowing that the perfect investment opportunities happen when the world is in chaos and panic.",

But then, there are several factors that can affect Bitcoin's price and we all differ in opinion with regard to that. IMHO, whether fed rates are high or not, the most important thing to be considered by someone who wants to invest in bitcoin is his readiness and willingness to start buying. This isn't for everybody that just wants quick gains although it's possible through other options like going into spot or margin trading if it's about being optimistic about bitcoin and its future then, you should buy when you're ready and have got clear plans to stay for longer period of time.It's not just all about the fed interest rates or what not but you see that the moment you're looking at right now is still a good entry before it soars again.",

What affects bitcoin negatively is recession which is what pushes people into liquidating their assets so that they can \"live\"!What we had over the past year (and still do) is a combination of inflation and recession which is what led to the initial crash. We still have high inflation and recession in a lot of the world including US, but what you are forgetting is that more increase in interest rates by the FED is not going to have any effects on reducing the inflation or causing any more recession than this.In other words there is no reason to expect any kind of drop because of the ongoing recession in US specially since almost all of those who wanted to sell have already sold their bitcoins.The only way we could see a big drop in bitcoin price is either a massive market manipulation or a massively negative and sudden economical event. Anything that is ongoing is not going to come at a shock and cause a drop like dollar value dumping, inflation remaining high, US banks shutting down, and so on.",
