      "body": "Before I discovered the notification bot thread, I was still replying to my quoted replies. How I did it back then was to enable notification for each of the threads that I last visited. Every new comment that dropped there, I always got notifications about it, and when I went back to the threads, I checked to see if I was mentioned or not. Sometimes I also found some interesting new comments that dropped under the thread, which I might pick up on by either asking questions or throwing more light on the discussion. Another thing I usually do is search my name in the search section every 24 hours to check if I was mentioned by any member or something came up with my name. To be honest, this notification bot is really helpful and has reduced the stress of searching and doing all that other manual checking stuff. I believe there are a lot of people who are still aware of the notification bot, and a few who are aware don't like making use of Telegram and, as such, won't want to create one because of that.Quote from: rby on June 19, 2023, 07:56:07 PMAlthough this has its backlash, some merits sources will not hand out merits to you if you challenge their opinions, that is why some users prefer to lick the ass of others maybe to be in their good book for merits.Pardon me for a slight off topic We are all entitled to our own different opinions, and I don't think going against someone based on your own understanding is enough reason for them not to give you some merit if you deserve it. There are actually polite ways of telling someone they are wrong without attaching some insult to it, and when such is done, no harm can come with it.",

Sometimes someone can see no need in answering, someone can ignore someone else's messages, someone just don't want to answer in some exact case, — no one is obliged to answer.But there are many who never or nearly never answer, this is not occasional. If you are interested in some topic you anyway follow it, so you'll see someone answers you. Maybe not using a notifier you'll miss some answers but not most of answers.Those ones who use multiple alt accounts usually don't care. They change campaigns they participate easily, they don't care if one of their accounts is excluded from participating, they will make several new. They are not interested in what they are talking about. They don't use notifiers because they don't care if they are answered or mentioned anywhere.

I'd say that OP is not the only one who is a bit annoyed when there are users who post a lot but don't ever take part in discussions. I think another reason why they do not participate in discussions is that they usually do not read previous posts and do not delve into the essence of the topic, so their posts fall out of the general narrative, and few people want to write comments on their posts or mention them.

Could it be these set of users that Royse777 and Hhampuz complain that they use the forum in a wrong way or they post for weekly pay.OP, could you elaborate on the second part of the above statement (about the complaining thing)?I meant that some members of this forum doesn't use the forum in a better way that promotes healthy discussion. They will login their accounts, punch in some posts and offline without regards to other activities happening in the forum. They do not also join conversations, at most they will reply the OP directly and that's it.Some of the campaign managers who read these posts weekly frown at that pattern of posting which I also emphasised in OP.Hhampuz  hinted on this when he made changes in the Roobet campaignQuote from: Hhampuz on April 23, 2023, 10:14:57 PMI've made some notable changes to the roster of this campaign. A total of 6 members were removed for various reasons such as activity, posting habits and overall posting quality. If you were removed - don't feel too bad! I just don't want users to join a relaxed campaign like this one and then punch in week in and week out making 15 posts without adding any substance or holding any real conversations with other users. You may disagree and tell me that you shouldn't fall into that category but I've been looking at weeks and weeks of your posting history and it's more or less the same. Royse777 likes it when users engage in conversations in different boards rather than dropping random unconnected posts to complete the campaign requirements [/color]QuotePlease apply if you are a regular poster and enjoy discussion on different topics.Little Mouse lamented about this in Flush campaign where some users were making the exact posts according to the campaign rules. It is just like after hitting the 25 posts requirements for sinbad campaign, you will no longer respond to conversations or use the forum till the next week you start afresh and make exact 25 posts again Quote from: Little Mouse on May 06, 2023, 05:20:15 AMOne more: If you are posting only the minimum to follow the campaign rules, I will be hard on the rules. But if you are using the forum as usual, you will have more flexible rules in the campaign. I will even make exceptional rules for you. I had to do some search to get these posts from the managers. I believe you must have understood my points. It is not actually easy to make some connected sentences for understanding of others let alone for their reading pleasure.

Recommendations[TELEGRAM] Yet Another BitcoinTalk Notification BOT (merits, mentions, topics,+)LoyceV's notification bot (7 days retroactive)I know of others but I'm not sure they are still maintained till date. If you have recommendations for this service, you can drop and I will gladly add to Op.I use a notification bot, but that doesn't mean that everytime someone says my name I feel like I need to come post on the forum. I tend to only reply if someone else hasn't already answered the person for me. That seems to be a normal thing around here, lots scramble to get their weekly quota. I could get by without the bot as I'm not in as much of a hurry as I feel some other users are. Seems like there are lots looking for an edge. They're in too much of a hurry for whatever reason. You can browse the forum and see the threads you have replied in pretty easily. You can also go to your post history and see where you have replied and go read replies after your post. Bots are convenient for sure, but a person can get by without it.",

And I can assure you that if the conversation is interesting enough I don't miss any answers.",

In the future, I hope that you will try to tell your thoughts differently, because they appear in the form of unintended hints, such as:Quote from: rby on June 19, 2023, 07:56:07 PMit will not be difficult to complete and exceed your weekly post quota. There will also not be a slight room for AI usage. Quote from: rby on June 19, 2023, 07:56:07 PMit is possible you can make even more than 10 posts a day and also will be learning new things. Quote from: rby on June 19, 2023, 07:56:07 PM Could it be these set of users that Royse777 and Hhampuz complain that they use the forum in a wrong way or they post for weekly pay.Quote from: rby on June 19, 2023, 07:56:07 PM Although this has its backlash, some merits sources will not hand out merits to you if you challenge their opinions, that is why some users prefer to lick the ass of others maybe to be in their good book for merits.Pardon me for a slight off topicIn general, I have not activated a bot before, however, if you are interested in a discussion, it will definitely follow all the responses received without the need for a notification bot. In fact, forum conversations have gone on for years without these bots.",
