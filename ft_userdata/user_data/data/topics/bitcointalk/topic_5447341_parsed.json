I have claimed deposit bonus many times and all the casinos I have used that promises the bonus all gave me the bonus. I think so will other promotional offers be too. There is one thing about casino, if you play and you continue to play, be given bonus, there is the possibility that you will lose your bonus back to the gambling site. If a gambling site is having good reputation, I do not think you have anything to worry about their promotion offers.",

You don't want that support group to turn to a mob.These things are difficult to verify on your own so it might seem like a suspicious thing from one side. Best to not use that casino for your mental peace. Question is whether you are going to investigate that yourself or just let the casino do as it pleases? But I can say that there are programmers who verify alogrithm and all to mark those casinos as legit from this forum.",

How can the gamblers verify that the actual amount of people are receiving the drop or the bonus, if there are no list to verify it? Let's discuss this.. I am curious if other people also thought about this...Â  These drops are not really that big compared to the average amount a gambler spends at a casino in a month. You can look at it as form of rake back from the casino and almost all the big casinos are offering these days. During the covid lockdowns we had a big boom in the online gambling industry and casinos needs to be competitive to attract new customers and maintain their gamblers. In my opinion these drops are legit and I haven't heard otherwise. Also most casinos have a chat window where you can actually see which players get the drops. For the casino it's a form of advertising and the players can't withdraw that money. For example at one poker casino where I play regularly, the give every gambler daily a 0.25 USD tournament ticket. You have to play with it and even when you win you can't withdraw that money, you need to play with 3x the amount you won before being eligible to withdraw. That is a great system as it increase the number of games at the casino and doesn't hurt much the profitability of the casino.",

I can use each to bet and it can expire after 7 days that I was given. I gamble and won but I was given the bonus.

      "body": "The question of transparency in gambling establishment promotions is a legitimate issue that merits further examination. With the ongoing progress of technology, numerous inventive approaches can be employed to tackle this challenge.One feasible solution involves the utilization of random number generators, which can guarantee impartial and transparent distribution of promotions. RNGs employ algorithms to generate random digits, which, in turn, can be applied to choose promotion beneficiaries without bias.Another promising resolution is the adoption of blockchain technology, offering an unalterable record of all transactions and promotional activities. By capitalizing on the transparency and responsibility inherent in blockchain, casinos can ascertain equitable distribution of promotions and eliminate any possibility of illicit skimming.",

I guess we can say it's all marketing... casinos with drops/bonuses/promotions/wheels are more attractive. I believe that some casinos are doing these drops, but those drops always come with some catch. I don't remember the last time I got some cash drop, but free spins or free bet comes from time to time depending on a site and how active I am. The trick about these drops is that casinos don't really spend all that money, if they drop $5-$10 in free spins/bets to +1000 people, most of us will just lose that on a site. Just a few people manage to cash out some money.",
