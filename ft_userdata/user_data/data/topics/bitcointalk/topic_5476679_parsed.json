      "body": "Stratum v2: Superior Security, Flexibility, and PerformanceBandwidth Consumption:SV2 optimizes bandwidth by encoding messages in minimized binary and eliminating redundant messaging. Stratum V1's JSON-RPC protocol is 2-3x heavier due to human-readable text. SV2 reduces average network message size from ~100 bytes (unencrypted) to 48 bytes (encrypted), lowering infrastructure costs and enabling precise hashrate measurement.Server CPU Load:SV2 allows efficient caching and eliminates Merkle Root recomputation for each share submission. It enables header-only mining, significantly reducing server CPU load.Job Distribution Latency:SV2 separates mining prevhash and future job messages, allowing faster job distribution. This minimizes latency and increases efficiency in starting new block mining.Binary Encoding:SV2's binary encoding is optimized for efficient computation and networking, significantly reducing message size compared to Stratum V1's JSON-RPC.Man-in-the-Middle Attack Prevention:SV2 ensures data integrity and confidentiality with robust encryption (AEAD), protecting against hashrate hijacking and maintaining miner-pool privacy.Eliminate Empty Block Mining:SV2's efficient job distribution eliminates the incentive to mine empty blocks, reducing the likelihood of empty block propagation in the network.Job Selection:SV2 allows miners to choose their work, decentralizing mining and limiting pools' ability to censor transactions. This enhances Bitcoin's censorship resistance.Header-Only Mining:SV2's header-only mining protocol reduces bandwidth and CPU load, optimizing for speed and efficiency in large-scale mining operations.Multiplexing:SV2 enables multiple communication channels over a single connection, reducing infrastructure complexity and costs.Implicit Work Subscription:SV2 assumes implicit job assignment requests upon channel opening, eliminating unnecessary data transfers and improving protocol efficiency.Native Version Rolling:SV2 natively supports version rolling, enhancing the mining process by extending the search space and reducing new job distributions.Zero-time Backend Switching:SV2 facilitates efficient backend switching and job allocation from different pools, optimizing complex mining setups.Same Connection - Different Jobs:SV2's multiplexing allows transmission of data for different jobs over a single connection, reducing the need for multiple connections and simplifying infrastructure.Source: Stratumprotocol.org",

I did not maximize my FEES but I maximized my PROFIT.How much extra does VIABTC make with their paid accelerator? You are correct, but!!, This does not increase the profit for miners, in fact, it reduces it, only the pool would make more profit by scamming miners off their potential profit, the fact that Viabtc ignored my questions in the past shows that they do not share any of that profit with the miners, it's pretty much a scam if you ask me, which is one of the reasons why I stopped using them.An example of using $ to keep things simple is if said pool charged $100 on a transaction that is paying $1 in fee on the blockchain while removing another transaction that was paying $50, you should pay the miners $49 out of that $100, otherwise the pool is stealing.I have checked my daily payouts over and over again to see any mention of \"acceleration profit\", or at least an answer of some sort, I got none, so I could only assume that they keep all of it, so as far as miners are concerned any pool that doesn't use the default getblocktemplate is certainly paying them less.Edit: to be even more fair to Viabtc i did contact them again asking the same question, this will be my last attempt.",

So if I pay you to mine a TX and you mine it it's between you and the other users of the pool not the pool and it's users.if 1 user gets lucky to hit a block that has a potential of 3 BTC in fee rewards but then because he is stupid or gets paid for doing so -- the other miners would end up losing profit, I mean if a single entity (a pool) can make you lose profit, it's only going to be worse when thousands of other users can do the same, I personally wouldn't use any pool that allows this -- I doubt anyone in their right mind would.Transaction-biased blocks are only good for one purpose, the pool won't be able to censor certain transactions, but for this to actually work, other miners need to have a say in this, they need to accept the block template proposed by each other and to evaluate it otherwise, it will certainly fail and nobody would use them.",

Coz it's censorship - a bad idea against the ideals of Bitcoin.Bitcoin core simply gathers all transactions available and ensures you get the best fees in your block.Wanting transaction bias - i.e. censorship of transactions - removing transactions you don't like - will mean lower fees on PPLNS pools.I bet you wont point out on your pool that with V2, any blocks found will only contain the transactions allowed by the miners of the blocks found.Your marketing spin (lies) will mean most your miners wont even realise this.Though if your pool is already censoring transactions, I guess it doesn't really matter.But even if you are not already doing it, it will be soon enough.",

This is the difference between a market, and a free market. You can choose not to buy the cheapest thing, or not do the highest profit trade. You may simply like the other stuff and nobody can force you to get the \"most profitable\" if you don't want to.This is giving people choice, you are free to use it or ignore it. Nobody forces you what template you like. The pool can enforce their own preferences or leave it entirely to the miners.You seem to not get the \"optional\" and \"proposal\" parts of block templates.
