When it was time for the funeral eulogy, many people came up and spoke about their relationship with the deceased. All of them spoke of his kindheartedness, generosity, love, kindness, etc. Nobody ever mentioned about his bad character or criminal activities.This funeral made me recall that I have never attended any burial where people speak about the true character of the dead. They only speak good things about the deceased. Are they scared to speak evil about the dead or is there a tradition that forbids people from speaking bad against the dead?",

Funerals are attended by the the close relatives, friends and allies who loved the dead while alive. The dead person might one way or the be other be bounded to be good to these people. You will see that those called to read parting notes about the dead are mostly family or friends which he will mostly be good to. So, what else will they say if not his good.And also from the religious and moral point of view, there is a general warning of Not speaking I'll of the Dead.",

Are they scared to speak evil about the dead or is there a tradition that forbids people from speaking bad against the dead?    Reason is quite obvious when you think about it. People who hate that person don't often even come to the funeral, because why would they? They don't care. There are only friends and relatives left and they want to remind themselves about the good things in his/her life. And that's completely understandable because they are mourning.It's also for the same reason you don't yell in weddings things like \"this won't last\" etc. It's just polite behavior not to.",

The person could've been bad, but to the family it's always a loss and you don't want to spit in their faces calling their son or husband names, right? People who didn't like the deceased usually don't come to say the last goodbye to him, so they aren't present there. Those who are don't want to be attacked at that moment.",

One thing I've observed is, most times it's family who read the eulogies and I don't think they'd want to say anything bad even if the deceased was not a likable or nice person. It's more like paying their last respects. While reading through the replies, I think a reply from @o48o, saying those who didn't see eye to eye with the deceased will not attend. In my opinion, these peeps would be the first to be in attendance because they are moved by curiosity.",

They just choose not to talk about the person’s bad part. People always want to please the dead. The most important thing is to always remind the person when he was living that his negative behavior is bad. If you didn't tell the living that his negative behavior is wrong, you are not qualifies to speak good about they person when he is dead.",

Plus will it change anything. The so called bad person that you see and know as bad may have different relationships with everyone there and to some he is really a kind hearted man having all the qualities they mentioned. Also if it the burial of someone who is a big time criminal, do you think his burial where his other compatriots and fellow close criminals will attend is the place to highlight their bad doings and ruin his memory in front of everyone? you may just be putting your life in danger as some of their loyalist can develop a hatred for you immediately.",
