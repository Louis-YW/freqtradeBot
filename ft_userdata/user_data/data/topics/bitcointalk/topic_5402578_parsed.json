Both technical trading news and the like I thought that the market was no different. But after I owned several exchanges I realized that some orders were quiet and tended to be slow. this made me ask myself.How many times have I sold tokens and it was long enough for people to ask for them even though the base price and ups were not too far away. creeping transactions don't fluctuate naturally.if it doesn't happen what you mentioned earlier, it's not possible because it's illogical and solid as if it were walking in place.I only sold a few bucks and needed a few days for the price to match.how important is volume and the art of playing in calculating the development of projects and the rapid growth of the market.",

      "body": "Whoa ! Several low cap Altcoins are now at zero trading volume !! Even some of the good ones !Okay so lets explore this.... if trading volume is at zero... does that mean that any purchase would make the price go up ? ( in theory ) So then would it be possible to push that price upwards by making a not so small purchase ? ( like $1000 or $2000 ) If this is true, then you could in theory manipulate that market in your favour, and get possibly a 2X or a 3X out of it, if trading volume is zero. I'm talking about very very small low caps though, which are already 0.00 something at least.In case you think this is impossible... I saw it happen with one particular Altcoin in the top 1000. The price was so low a few days ago, I think it hit negative 99.8 per cent or something, that one large purchase made it go up 950% in one day !! Only in crypto !!",

Trading volume comes with a couple of advantages and disadvantages, so it shouldn't be approached without understanding all the possible outcomes.onthe other hand, trading volume can be faked. To avoid being deceived by fake volumes, you need to understand the order book which is a list of low sell and buy prices",

Don't forget that trading volume, which is shown on trading platforms, is not always the transactions of real people, bots are also involved. Obviously, this can be one of the metrics when choosing a project or deciding to buy/sell it. If you are concerned about trading volume formed on large-scale selloffs, it is also worth paying attention to the order book and looking at the depth of the market. If there are only sellers in the market, and the demand from buyers is very minimal, then clearly this project at the moment is not of interest in terms of investment.",

Seeing this means that the project is moving in the market and it means that the project has the potential demand. But if we saw selling demand, that is something it catches attention and probably there is a problem with that project, you'd better stay away from that.This is to say how important to check the market trend buy/sell volume as from that point, we can assess the project if we can make a profit or just lose.",

Because the trading volume of many coins and tokens is done with washtrade. This means that we cannot make a 100% accurate measurement. That's why investing and trading in major coins is always more secure. Also an important information; If a coin is experiencing a price drop while at low volume, it is a sign of bullish divergence.",
