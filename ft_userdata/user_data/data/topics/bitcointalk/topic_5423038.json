  "content": "Hello, my name is Jerwin. On Sept. 20'th 2022, I made a deposit on Chips.gg, just like I had done countless times for the past approximately 2 years. At that point I had never really won much at all on the site. Well, the next 3 days would be different. I ended my session that day with a withdrawal for 1.0 BTC (shown in pic below) which I received in less than 5 minutes without a sinlge word said or problem happen. The next day, Sept. 21'st 2022, I hit another big win, this time on Hand of Anubis, for another $37K and change (game replay link below).  I went to support before requesting a withdrawal and asked if it was ok for me to withdrawal. At first I was told yes, that I would be able to withdrawal up to my daily limit. Then, not even 5 seconds after telling me that, the support agent changed what he said and told me that withdrawals on my account had in-fact been disabled pending KYC b/c I had requested a withdrawal larger than 1.0 BTC. But I had never requested a withdrawal at that point. And if I hadn't requested a withdrawal, why were they disabled. So they lied saying that my withdrawals had been disabled for requesting a withdrawal larger than 1.0 BTC, that was their first lie. At first I was upset b/c I take maintaining my anonymity very seriously. So of course I pushed back a little but ultimately agreed to completeing a KYC. I was told that I could continue playing and that the only thing on my account affected were withdrawals. I started the process of submitting all my documents. While I was submitting my documents there were some error messages. That just seemed weird to me.. I informed the support agent of these errors and they acted like it was nothing, which also struck me as strange. Thats w :)hy i think I said to them, \"I want it on record that I was getting error messages while trying to submit my KYC documents\" .After submitting all my documents, given the fact that I was on a major heater, and was told that it was completely fine to do so, I kept on playing. I waited all the next day for my KYC to be completed/approved and then late that night on the 22nd, or i guess it was technically early in the morning on Sept. 23, 2022, I hit another $45K on the game Time Spinners (game replay link below). I was soaring high to say the least..I couldnt beleive that after over 2 years of losing there, and pretty much everywhere else, that I was finally winning..And winning big on top of that! Well, after sending out a pretty large amount in tips to the community chat I went back to support to check on the status of my KYC. This is when my heart broke, literally almost took my breath away. They told me that my KYC had been denied and that they were confiscating the funds and disabling my account. They also accused me of providing false information when I submitted my KYC documents and then threatened me by saying \"In this case we need to report this to the authorities of your country.\" So they are pretty much accusing me of living in a jurisdiction where online gambling is illegal (picture below). The reason they gave for failing my KYC wasn't that the 3rd party site said that I failed, they told me, and I quote, \"We know who you are, Adam\".  (picture below) First off, let me just say, MY REAL NAME IS NOT ADAM! I'll explain why they might think this, but want to make clear IT IS NOT VALID GROUNDS TO DENY PASSING MY KYC. As I stated earlier, i value my anonymity. Since pretty much all crypto casinos allow players to play anonymously, with no KYC, I was also told that they don't KYC by one of Chips.gg's streamers when i first found out about them on Twitch.  I made up a fake Identity that had an email address, Discord server and a Twitch profile, WHICH ISN'T ILLEGAL TO DO!! I NEVER SUBMITTED ANYTHING TO THE CASINO THAT SAID MY NAME WAS ADAM. I ALSO NEVER DIRECTLY TOLD THEM THAT MY NAME WAS ADAM, THEY NEVER ASKED. I WAS NORMALLY CALLED POSER B/C THAT WAS THE FIRST WORD OF MY USERNAME.I always prefer to remain anonymous so that word of my little habit doesn't interfere with my normal/personal life. Adamcn24 was my Twitch name.  I did, however, have a couple verbal disputes with one of their streamers (who lives in Texas, I might add, TXSLOTADDICT) which brought even more of a spotlight on me and my name on Twitch. It is  those reasons and those reasons only that they are basing their judgment/ruling on and are using it to Justify themselves failing my KYC application. There is absolutely no other way that they would think that my name is Adam. In my opinion, by doing this, Chips.gg willfully committed FRAUD! They either completely ignored my passing the KYC process with 3rd party site, or, they did nothing when i told them about the errors when submitting my documents knowing that this would certainly fail me. Them knowing that and then telling me I failed, that is also committing FRAUD. Either way, I think that it's safe to say that Chips.gg willfully and without any fear of consequence, committed fraud against me. What im about to say now proves even further that they never had any intentions of paying me. After they denied my KYC and accused me of purchasing my documents, I then, without being asked, voluteered to take a selfie of myself holding my driver's license as well as a piece of paper with my name, the name of the site, the date, how much BTC I wanted to withdrawal and my nickname, Adam, all written on that piece of paper (picture below). They didn't even acknowledge my offer, but I sent it anyway. I beleive their next words were \"Anything else I can help you with?\" They had absolultey no intention of paying me from the second they KYC'd me. I have sent them no less than 3, but as many as 5, emails trying to get this issue worked out but they havnt responded to a single one of my emails (Picture Below). Thats just another fact that supports my idea that they weren't planning on paying me from the very beginning of it all. The last point that i want to make is this.. I withdrew that 1.0BTC on the 20th. They informed me on the 24th that I had not passed my KYC application b/c they have known that,allegedly,I am this guy named Adam who doesnt live in a jurisdiction where online gambling is legal.  If that was the case then by them saying that, they admitted that they knew this guy Adam wasnt supposed to be playing on their site b/c it was illegal but they went ahead and let him play anyway and paid him out 1.0 BTC. HaHa! So either way they have committed a crime here! I hope that by posting this story and exposing this site's fradulent and predatory business practices, that it saves some other innocent player from having to go through any experience like this. They kept all my deposits, all my winnings, $1k - $2.5K in rakeback and all my VIP level up bonuses that I hadn't redeemed. At the time, with BTC at what it was at, the total that they scammed me out of was approximately 3.0 - 3.2 BTC (depending on rakeback and bonuses confiscated) I know that my BTC balance was 2.999 BTC. (picture below) You guys need to make this right Chips. What you are doing to your players is disgusting and I feel that if it continues, something should be done about it!!  In closing, I would like to offer/say I am more than willing to complete any level of KYC that is required of me to get this issue dealt with. So I offer both Chips.gg and Bitcointalk that. Also im not sure how it works but im pretty sure a site can somehow tell or find out if a VPN is being used to login and if one isnt being used, know the location of the person logging in.  So I ask that this information be given to the necessary person/people at Chips.gg. I have nothing to hide.  Thanks.Pic 1 : 1.0 BTC withdrawal on Sept. 20th, 2002 - https://ibb.co/BZhBkbW$38K Anubis win replay - https://replay.hacksawgaming.com/?roundid=4000018860088&partner=1335&language=enPic 2 : Me informing support chat of the submission errors while submitting KYC documents: https://ibb.co/JBy1LD0$45K Timespinner win replay -  https://replay.hacksawgaming.com/?roundid=4000019477720&partner=1335&language=enPic 3 :  Chips rejecting my KYC and threatening to contact authorities -  https://ibb.co/sJMrWNHPic 4 : Support chat saying \"We know who you are, Adam\" - https://ibb.co/9s9VBX7Pic 5 : Emails never responded to (2 out of 4) - https://ibb.co/X7VQyGn  ,  https://ibb.co/KK4GJpZPic 6 : Capture of screen with balance showing right before they disabled my account: https://ibb.co/njf61MQ",

      "body": "I think this thread should be moved to the Scam Accusations board since it is an accusation against the casino.Another thing, why is this called Part 2 when there is no Part 1?It's really difficult to read that second huge paragraph you wrote. Can't you structure it in a better way and make several normal paragraphs where it makes sense?You really shouldn't dox yourself and write your real name here. There is no need for that since you are talking about wanting to protect your privacy.  Regarding KYCs. It's common for crypto casinos to request KYC before paying out significant amounts of money. If you read Chips.gg's TOS, I am sure you agreed to a clause giving them the right to ask you to undergo KYC at any time. I am not in favor of such a way of doing business, but apparently crypto gamblers are OK not being asked to verify their identities during registration and prefer doing KYC before withdrawing or after winning big. I don't see a screenshot of them saying \"we know who you are\". The one you posted shows they address you as Adam, that you failed your KYC verification apparently due to providing false information, and that they will report your actions to your local government. How did they find out about your Adam alias? When you created your Chips.gg account did you submit that as your real name somewhere but then you provided them ID documents that show a completely different name?QuoteI then, without being asked, voluteered to take aselfie of myself holding my driver's license as well as a piece of paperwith my name, the name of the site, the date, how much BTC I wanted towithdrawal and my nickname, Adam, all written on that piece of paper. (picshown below) This picture wasn't posted in the OP. And again, you shouldn't post identifiable and personal information, but I am just stating a fact. Where does your Adam personality supposedly live? Are you accessing your betting account with a VPN from a restricted jurisdiction?Some of the statements written together with your screenshots can't be verified so you can't call it proof. No one here knows what information you submitted to Stake or Bitcasino for the KYC verification, so no one can know what was accepted by them but not by Chips. No one knows what names you gave to Bitcasino and Stake representatives and if it differs from what was given to Chips.gg. Also, we don't know what's on your documents (and we shouldn't) or where you are logging in from.3 things:1. Move this thread to the scam accusation board. You can do it yourself by scrolling all the way down to the bottom of the page and clicking on \"move topic\". 2. Try to reformat the OP and create easy to read paragraphs. 3. Contact chipsgg who is the casino's forum representative and ask them to reply in this thread and explain what happened. If they don't, let us know and someone else will.",

Bitcointalk does not have KYC and you should never allow a random person from the internet to handle your private data. As khaled0111 mentioned, you might now start receiving offers through PM with people claiming they can help you in some way or the other. Trust no one. All the communication should be conducted in public, besides the release of sensitive data, of course. If you want, you can include an independent 3rd party in this case. Check out the complaint sections on Casino Guru or AskGamblers, for example. They might be willing to conduct their own investigation and offer guidance.",

      "body": "Well @SyGambler,  with all do respect,  theres a couple things that I need to say to you here in repsonse to your incredibly rude comment on my post.  Sir, I do not know whether or not this is your job, to go around and do this. If it is, then ok, thanks for helping me correct an error, albeit very unprofessionally. But if it's not your job, then I must say that I question what your true intentions really are for posting your comment in such a rude way while also accusing me of  such dishonest behavior.  First of all,  I see that your rank here is \"Legendary\", so I believe its safe to assume that you have posted once or twice here (haha).  As I am sure you have probably noticed, my ranking is one of the most prestigous here on the site. Or wait, is the the lowest ranking on the site, the rank of \"Newbie\" , which I beleive is reserved for NEW USERS!? Please forgive me for not spending as much time here on bitcointalk as you seem to have spent. I assure you that I do value my privacy, but given the amount of money at stake for me here and also given the fact that Chips.gg has completely ignored my every attempt to contact them, I have decided that it's a calculated risk I am willing to take. I, as well as a close friend of mine that is in law enforcement, believe that Chips.gg committed multiple felonies while carrying out their actions against me. What reason could you possibly have for coming onto my post and speaking to me in such a manner and even worse tainting my post with baseless accusations of fraud on my part. I dont know what your role is here on this forum, but you speak as if you represent it. If that's the case, I plan on fileing a complaint about your behavior on this post. You have absolutely no right to come here spouting accusations which could potentially effect the outcome of my case. What is the real reason you decided to comment here? B/c it appears that you came to try and influence people's opinons by making accusations based on nothing more than your ego telling you that it's ok to do it. So now, respectfully, I ask that you change or remove your post. It doesnt even have to be the entire post. All I care about is the removal of your factually inaccurate opinion about my case. I would have thought that someone here with your ranking would know that such behavior is unacceptable.",

      "body": "Thank you @pmalek for bringing this review to our attention. To comply with AML laws and license requirements this user was asked to provide KYC documentation for his account. Unfortunately, the player did not pass our internal verification checks, and was told this was the case in our live support. We must stress that we do not take the decision to close an account lightly and we ensure that we are making the right decision no matter how timely this may sometimes be. To protect both the security and privacy of the player and the casino we cannot provide details of how our checks are internally carried out. However, we can say that we were provided with documentation that did not match or pass our verification. Providing false documentation is a major breach of our terms of service and due to this his account was closed.What we would like to add to this thread and in response to LottoEscoto's claims, without risking the security of our own procedures or breaching the user's privacy is the following:Regarding the documents, we did not accuse the documents of being dupes, we declined them because they do not match the information we cross-check KYC documents with when verifying a user. To further help, in a way that doesn't compromise the security of our platform, we can advise you that the screenshot shared above by the user: \"Pic 6 : Capture of screen with balance showing right before they disabled my account: https://ibb.co/njf61MQ\" who you are able to clearly see is logged in. Shows the time stamp on the user's device as well as the date in the bottom right-hand corner.We will re-post the image here once more for clarityIn our onsite chat feature visible in this screenshot, a player has tipped another player, and below we attach a screenshot of the timestamp for this tip from our own records. We can verify that the timestamp in the bottom right-hand corner is that of an EST timezone as is the attached picture of the timestamp for the tip sent in this screenshot.Unfortunately, this does not match the timezone of the user's supposed country of origin.We apologize for not being able to share more intricate details regarding this case publicly.",

      "body": "While everything that Chips.gg said here probably, on it's face, sounds legit and above board, I assure that it is not. It's all smoke and mirrors. They begin stating that all of their actions that they've taken have been to comply with AML laws and license requirements, yadda , yadda, yadda.. These people even start off the defence of their actions with an outright lie. One that can be proven as being a lie. In my original post, I spoke about how they said to me, \"We know who you are Adam.\" I even provided a capture of them saying this.  Lets do this, for the sake of argument, and for that alone,  if in-fact I were this Adam character and they, quote, \" knew who I was\", as they said they did,  that would mean that they knew that I wasn't supposed to be playing there. My computer has been set to that same time standard for 4 years now. And I've also been tipping and receiving tips since my first few days playign there. So they have known all of this information for a couple years now. But they want to let u play and take your money. Which is exactly what they did. I never really won before now. A few tiny withdrawals is all. So for 2 years of having that information, and even paying me 1.0 BTC the day before, you're saying that all those deposits, withdrawals, that for some reason they didnt fall under AML laws and regulations?  Im a little confused by this. It didnt matter then,  and then I finally hit some major money and then all of the sudden the AML laws start mattering to you?  I just wanted to point that out because the level of BS in your statment is almost comical.  Let me be clear, my name is not Adam and I do not live in a jurisiction where online gambling is illegal.  I also stated in my original statment that I had error messages and problems submitting my documents. When I went to support to report this they didnt ask a single question about it. They didnt try to verify that my documents were successfully sent to the 3rd party who handldes their KYC applications. And they didnt do that because they NEVER had any intention of paying me the money I had righfully won. When they informed me in the chat that I had \"failed my KYC\" i pleaded with them to allow me to send them a selfie or to do whatever they needed me to do in order to prove that i was who I was claiming to be. They didnt even acknowledge my offers. They just kept going on through their little spill of how they were going to disable my account and steal my money. Because thats exactly what they did. They may not have acknowledged it but I went ahead and sent it anyway and they still didn't acknowledge. I wrote my legal name, then put aka. adam b/c i was known by that nickname on twitch, i held my ID , put the date , name of site and even how much i wanted to withdrawal. They sent no response and completely ignored it. I wouldnt have had the time to coordinate with someone all the way on the other side of the world in a diff time zone, as you said, in order to do that right then and there. When they said in their statment here \"we do not take the decision to close an account lightly\"  thats right you dont. B/c you are usign any and every possible reason to close my account, no matter how small, irrelevant or flat out wrong it truly is. When they say \"to protect the security and privacy of the player and the casino we cannot provide details of how our checks are internally carried out. However, we can say that we were provided with documentation that did not match or pass our verification.\" Now this is where things really begin to not make sense. Do you or do you not conduct your KYC verifications through a 3rd party site? Are you saying that you have 2'nd KYC processess that a player has to pass? Do you send their documents off and then conduct your own process in which you then conclude that you have all this\"evidense\" to overturn a successfull KYC verification confirmed through your 3rd party site? And if so, how is that even legal? You wont disclose what information or how you got it.So basically all you have to do is say that you do have it and then hide under \"protecting blah blah\"..There's another term for the proceess that you described in your  \"explanation\" . It's called having a license to steal. You would also be the FIRST and ONLY site that i have ever heard of in my entire life that operates that way, its not even legal under your precious AML laws that you love so much all of a sudden. This \"information\" that they are saying they're using to justify their decision, a decision illegal for them to make, is my Twitch name. I know someone with the Twitch name SnugglePuff. Does thta mean that SnugglePuff would fail your KYC since their documents most certainly wont be for someone named SnugglePuff?!? I highly doubt  it. Furthermore, you guys told me that you never even see or handle the documents and that once submitted they are protected with high level encryption. So then please tell me  , as you explained in your statment here describing your process, how were you able to come to this conclusion? Quote \"we declined them because they do not match the information we cross-check KYC documents with when verifying a user\".  I would love to know how that works.  If my documents are supposedly never handled by you and are proctected by high level encryption, then how the hell are you using my documents to cross-check against anything?!?  And furthermore, if you do normally send them off in an encrypted file to have KYC of a player verified, why on earth would you conduct your own investigation.   That makes no sense whatsoever. Not to mention being able to conduct business in such a way would allow you to deny anyone you want to for any reason you want, regardless of whether or not the 3rd party site passes the KYC application. You also told me in support chat that whatever verdict is given back , pass or fail, that is the verdict, plain and simple. This is what you told me in chat support. Although, turns out that was a lie as well.  You made no reference or said a word about this 2nd \"in-house\" kyc process that I would also have to pass along with the one you send off to be done.  You never mention any of that.  All you have done in your post here is lie.  When it comes to the computer and the time standard. I work for company in the US. For the purpose of my job, i was asked to set my computer to that time standard. Its been that way for approximatley 4 years.  That doesn't prove anything. I can right now at this moment put my computer into any time standard that i feel like.  This fact does not prove anything other than my computer was set to Eastern Standard time. Which last I checked it isnt a requirement for someones device's time standard to be set to any specific one.  These are the most ridiculous justifications I have ever heard in my life. I sure hope that for everyone else reading this that it is as clear to you as the truth b/c thats exaclty what it is. These people are criminals and predators and the last thing they should be allowed to have is a license enabling them to unleash their insatiable appetite of greed for money on the unsuspecting public.",

      "body": "It's unusual to have a local time zone on your computer different than the one you are in, but that alone isn't sufficient evidence that the player isn't who he claims to be. Based on the ID OP posted previously, he claims to be from the Philippines (PHT time zone). You claim he is located in an EST time zone, which means he resides in the US. According to your TOS, players from the United States aren't allowed to gamble on Chips.gg. But you have to prove he is American or gambles from the USA. The time zone alone isn't enough for that.@LottoEscotoWhy would your employer care what time zone is configured on your computer? I have occasionally worked with people from various parts of the world and none of them have ever asked or required I change any of my local settings. I would like to ask other users not to answer this question instead of the OP if possible.You also said that Chips.gg told you over live chat they are using a 3rd-party service for verifying KYC data. Can you post that part of the conversation?@chipsggWho looks at and verifies the personal documents submitted for KYC verification? You (the casino) or a 3rd-party service provider that just tells you 'passed' or 'failed'?OP has already posted plenty of information about himself, including names, pictures, where he lives, how much he won... If OP agrees, would you be willing to verify his identity live via Skype, Zoom, or a similar platform? It would be easy to prove whether or not he lives in the US or the Philippines by having him take a video call as he is walking down his local street and perhaps stopping by a newsstand to show you what kind of newspapers are sold there. The surrounding buildings, the way the streets look, etc., could also show if he is located in the US or not.The whole issue seems to be about whether or not OP residies in the USA or not.",

      "body": "I was googling some random stuff trying to help you out with this OP but unfortunately it seems that you are not presenting the truth here.In your screenshot above you show your name on chips being \"PozerDispozr24\"[1] and I found an interesting forum profile of someone named \"PoserDispozr4\"[2] playing on stake.com and sharing some big wins on this forum, one \"adamncn24\"[2.1] which just happens to be, by your own admission, a name that you have used. It just seems to be too many coincidences for this to line up in your favor, unfortunately.Here's a snippet from one such post from that forum profile:\"My name is Adam, I am an old school gambler and have played on most sites considered to be ok that accepts US players. I can't wait until the legality of online gambling spreads from being legal only in a handful of US states to being legal in most states in our country. I feel that only then we will catch a truly fair shake when gambling online.\"[2.2]It seems to me that the odds are stacked against you in trying to prove something here which you know just isn't true and I can understand this from Chips.gg's POV. It looks like you knew exactly what you were doing was not allowed in accordance with the ToS to the extent that when you eventually hit big (even after making a larger withdraw prior), you went on to have someone else submit documents and claim that they belonged to you while in fact you have a seemingly large digital fingerprint so that anyone can see that you are more likely than not from USA.I'm pretty confident in saying that if you would have just come clean to Chips when you hit some big wins and told them \"Hey guys, it's pretty fucked up what's going on but I'm actually playing from the US which is against your ToS but maybe we could come to some agreement regarding this money here and then you close my account and I agree to not play here again\". < This may have not had any effect and they could have, rightfully so, closed your account regardless but it would have been better than just instantly turning to lies to the extent that you submit someone else's documents as your own.. It's nefarious and malicious and even now you are making all of this noise with a post here on bitcointalk and calling out other users here who doubt your story.Receipts:[1]: https://imgur.com/a/u8jVSmS (Your screenshot from your Chips.gg account, username \"PozerDispozr24\").[2]: https://imgur.com/a/tBVDez4 (\"adamcn24\" posting this image from a big win on stake.com under the username \"PoserDispozr4\" posted on the lcb.org forum). archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20221202140534/https://lcb.org/onlinecasinobonusforum/casinos/winner-screenshots-casino-play/msg545447[2.1]: https://lcb.org/users/104238 (\"adamcn24\" user profile on lcb.org). archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20221202134552/https://lcb.org/users/104238[2.2]: https://i.imgur.com/1MO6cC5.png (\"adamcn24\" user introduction on the lcb.org forum) archived: https://web.archive.org/web/20221202140710/https://lcb.org/onlinecasinobonusforum/general-discussion/introduce-yourself/msg545315",

OP did claim that he created this alternative Adam character and built up a profile around him, which also included a Twitch account and some other stuff. That could all be a part of that online gambling personality of his, or he is lying about everything. It's all inconclusive and difficult to get to the bottom of things. He posted plenty of screenshots on that lcb forum and named Stake and FortuneJack as some other casinos he gambles on. We know from his earlier posts that he gambles on Bitcasino as well.",

      "body": "chipsgg Ok, Finally able to sit down and address your questions and c ;)oncerns from your previous response. So here we go. Yes Pmalek I am in the Philippines. This can be proven fairly easily I imagine. Im sure you guys there at Bitcointalk are able to see a few different things about any given user that visits your site. I could be wrong about this, but I'm pretty sure that you guys know if someone is trying to access the site while using a VPN. For this specific purpose I have not used a VPN here at all. (unless done so accidentally, meaning forgetting to cut it off before accessing the site) I do know that I created my account without my VPN on. So you guys should be able to tell that I am in fact in the Philippines. Also I'm sure that in a way similar to how Chips.gg went about doing it, you guys are able to see the time standard that my device is in when posting on your site. I truly hope that you first of all, have this information, and second, will be able to inform the readers here, especally Chips.gg's representative, that I am accessing your site from the Philippines and my devices are set in PHT time zone. I use my desktop almost exclusively for work and for gaming.  Everything else is either my mobile or laptop. My employer in the states isnt some big company. It is actually a very small, you could even say tiny, shipping company. It only has 3 employees including me, the owner and his wife.  If you are wondering, my father is how I met my boss. My father has visited the US many times and he and my boss are friends. He gave me this job as a favor to my father. I dont want to sound like I am saying wrong things about my boss, but he is not what you would call tech savy. He also doesn't really know the laws associated with having me working for him not being a citizen of the US. Because of this fact and also the fact that on paper I am not an employee of his company, I get paid under table in Bitcoin and he had me to some, as he says, \"precautions\". Since I do some data entry and other computer related tasks, he asked me to change my computers clock/time standard to EST and also to use a VPN connected to a US server while I work. I honestly do not know if doing all of it makes any differnce, but it apparently gives my boss peace of mind. I am very thankful that he allows me to do this work for him and that is why I grant his requests concerning the time standard and VPN connection on my desktop.So now I'll address your question about Chips.gg chat support saying that they use 3rd-party service for they verifying KYC data. (Capture link below) Not only did they say that they use a 3rd party for their KYC verification process, they briefly explained the process. I had just told them that I had uploaded all my documents. This is the point where I told them about my issues uploading my documents and also making them aware of the error messages that I received while uploading my documents.  They then stated that they can't see my documents b/c there is a delay for the confirmation that my documents were received. They didn't offer to let me know, they didnt say that they would tell whether or not my documents were received.  One has to think, by them not making these efforts, and intentionally so in my opinion, wouldn't that possibly be considered sabottage? If you knowingly don't correct something u know is wrong and know that by doing nothing the outcome will be rejection, that is still effectively causign the rejection.  Thats my opinion anyway. Ok, moving on to my favorite part of the capture and that is the bottom, the white message block which is Chips.gg support. This is the part that completely 1million% contradicts what their representative stated as being their KYC process in their statement here on Bitconitalk. Remember I had just told them that i had uploaded my documents and they said that they arent able to see b/c they are immediately encrypted and that they never actually see the documents theirselves, they just get a confirmation on whether or not the documents were received from Chips  successfully.  The support agent goes on to say, and I quote, \"Those information are encrypted, It's verified by a third party we just get a status, rejected or accepted.\" So there you have it. What are we to beleive now with them?  I think that capture compared to what their representative came on here said is more than enough to prove that they never had any intention on saying that I passed my KYC.. Who knows if they even actually sent everything off. I do know this, if they had sent everythign off, and my documents were uploaded correctly and successfully, it is literally IMPOSSIBLE that I failed my KYC. Not to mention the selfie that I immediately took and sent them.As to your solution of taking a video live and showing my area , grabbing a newspaper and walking the streets so someone viewing can see the buildings and the streets  and my surroundings, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD NEVER ASK!! I am ready and willing to do this anytime.  Please tell me what you would want me to do and I will do it. In the event that Chips.gg decides to right their wrong here, i want to state it publicly that I want to be able to log into my account and withdrawal my Bitcoin myself. I want this mainly because of the large amount of rakeback and VIP level up bonuses that were unclaimed at the time, (at that time, still had plenty of time to claim them). If they decline me the right to do that and insist on sending my balance, rakeback and level up bonuses, the ONLY, i repeat, ONLY BTC address they are to send to is ,   btc address- 35JBrV9qbWbdZCSYbtg5E2HUYwzkFXQPPj  I'm putting this here so that they cannot say that I gave them some other address to send to and they sent it already and then I never receive it.  Capture 1 : Me stating that I had error messages happen while submitting my documents -  https://ibb.co/frn1vT5Capture 2: Chips.gg support chat agent telling me about their KYC process, explains 3rd party involvment and states essentially that they are not at all involved in the KYC process whatsoever - https://ibb.co/Gxc3Xy7",

      "body": "@Pmalek I was hoping to hear back from you after answering your questions.  And @Hhampuz , for your and @FatFork 's information,  I never, not once, claimed that I wasn't PoserDispozr.. I am PoserDispozr4 on Stake.. AND THAT ACCOUNT IS LEVEL 2 VERIFIED USING THE SAME DOCUMENTS THAT I SUBMMITTED TO CHIPS!!  Yes, the profile for adamcn24 is mine..Yes, I am PoserDispozr4. I mean, for Christ's sake, you can clearly see in the picture I posted of my account's BTC balance at the beginning of this post clearly showing that SAME name, although spelled a little differently, than on my Stake account, but it's all right there! So please one of you two please show me on this post one time where I said those accounts weren't mine.. All I said was that my name isn't really Adam. That is all I said. I mean, @Hhampuz , @FatFork , the only thing that you two did there was prove my case for me. So thanks to you both, I guess..  @Pmalek , you had asked me some questions as well as for some information.. I wasn't able to respond immediately, but I did come and address most, if not all of your questions. I'm just curious why there wasn't a response from you.  You had seemed at least somewhat interested in what the outcome of all this would be.. I guess there really is no way for me to prove that I used the same documents so all I can offer there is my word.. But know this, I value being a man, my name, but even more than both of those things, I value my word. So I give you my word, on my name, as a man, that what I have told you here is the truth.. I guess I was hoping that someone here with some weight or clout would see all of this for what it was.. and still is.. And that is Chips.gg , being the predatory online casino site that it is, stealing an amount of money that it would take some people 5-6 years to earn, and others even longer..{I'm referring to entry-level employee wages}Here's something to think about.. how many other players must they have done this to that would give them the level of confidence needed by any business owner to come onto a post like this, obviously without any communications between them and the handling agents who dealt with this issue when it happened, and not only that, but coming here with such weak and downright laughable justifications/reasonings and explanations for their criminal-level actions that they are most certainly guilty of?!? How could they possibly be so certain that there would be no fallout and that it wouldn't have a negative impact on their business?!!?  All of that BS about their KYC process.. I mean, how would @chipsgg have known that the agent I dealt with told me about the encryption and how Chips never handles or sees any of the documents and that the 3rd party site basically just sends back a verdict stating whether or not the documents pass or fail, and that whichever it is, Chips accepts the 3rd party's findings as fact. They would have had to communicate these things to one another. You don't prepare for something that you don't care about and don't see as a threat... And prepared is the opposite of how @chipsgg arrived on this post.",
