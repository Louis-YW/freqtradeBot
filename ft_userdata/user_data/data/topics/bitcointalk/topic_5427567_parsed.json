Is there a way to \"auto-forward\" all incoming payments to another address using Electrum? Thanks Do you still have the private key to your old Bitcoin wallet address? Because you always request a new address on same private key and receives the balance on the new address without the need on forwarding it to the new one. I believe you need a script to do this if you want to transfer the Bitcoin to separate address with different private key.",

      "body": "The script knowngunman linked to might be working, but it most likely not because it was written in 2013 and Electrum has had a massive list of updates since then. I strongly recommend you to replace your old bitcoin wallet with the new one, wherever you have it, because even if the script works, it doesn't seem tested (might have flaws), and you're going to pay more in fees than needed. Not only because you'll make each transaction twice, but because SegWit didn't exist in 2013.",

Thanks Foward payment makes little sense, as it comes with a cost (you need to pay for the transactions)why don't you just import your old wallet private key into your new wallet? This can be easily done using electrum or any other wallet.",

Is there a way to \"auto-forward\" all incoming payments to another address using Electrum? Thanks You want to auto-foward unconfirmed transactions so that you can get the final payment on a new or another address not belonging to your old wallet? Why don't you just update your Electrum wallet instead of auto-foward?Or you are think the seed phrase or private key of the old electrum is not safe and secure anymore? You can download new Electrum wallet from https://electrum.org/#home and verify its signature.Quote from: BitMaxz on December 09, 2022, 10:47:13 PMAre you going to use it in someone's wallet?This is what I could think about, to be used against someone. Or any likely good reason to auto-foward?",
