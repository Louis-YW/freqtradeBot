Indeed, if these wallets are detectable, then we should probably think about changing the hiding place or put something around them to avoid that the metal detectors find them, no? What do you think about it?",

You can keep that in a secure location and take a paper backup of the seedphrase with you. It's easier to travel with and not easily detectable.• Simply putting something around them would not prevent detection.",

In general, stainless steel is a very poor conductor of electricity and poorly magnetic when compared to most other metals, and can often go undetected by metal detectors, especially if it is very small in size. If you are very concerned about such an attack, then just use two or more paper back ups in different geographical locations. This is generally better than a single metal back up anyway.I have to say though, if you have a thief in your house using a metal detector to find your metal back up, then your op-sec has spectacularly failed and everything you have is probably at risk by that point.",

However, it seems that stainless steel is not detectable by burglars' metal detectors.According to my internet research, like stainless steel, an ordinary metal detector cannot locate titanium because it has low electrical conductivity.",

Titanium is expensive, and you aren't going to see it in ordinary hardware wallets unless a company creates something like that for VIPs and similar. Ledger's cover is made of stainless steel for example, so that's a more frequent material. Besides the connectors and boards that have some metal components, I can't think of a popular hardware wallet with a metal back cover or a big metal part like that of Ledger. Are you also talking about the metal seed plates or only hardware wallets?",

In general, stainless steel is a very poor conductor of electricity and poorly magnetic when compared to most other metals, and can often go undetected by metal detectors, especially if it is very small in size. This! If you use stainless steel with small washers the whole thing will be around 2.5 cm by 6 cm, easy to hide, with poor conductivity a thief will have to increase the pulse of the detector to a frequency where every hinge in the room will trigger a signal even if they are a meter away, if you hide this in a garage or in a cabinet made out of metal any metal detector would be useless and going through the things by hand will be way faster. But also, this is only if we talk about commercial detectors.Professional magnetometers with scan analysis will show the user every tiny bit of metal everywhere, but I somehow doubt a thief will rush and buy a 25k Euros piece of equipment to search for washers in your home.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on April 10, 2023, 12:56:18 PMI have to say though, if you have a thief in your house using a metal detector to find your metal back up, then your op-sec has spectacularly failed and everything you have is probably at risk by that point.If you have someone who is ready to break into your house with this target in mind, knowing you have enough coins to make it worth stealing and facing prison time then one should be concerned for their safety also. From just a \"normal\" burglary to getting kidnapped or assaulted and getting to witness a  $5 dollar wrench attack it's just a matter of how much $ you are hiding.",

It has a slightly higher yield strength than stainless steel, has a slightly higher melting point, is slightly less reactive, is slightly less conductive, and so on, but it is also significantly more expensive. These extra benefits are almost certainly meaningless - both will survive any kind of house fire or other household accidents or events equally well (provided they are of sufficient thickness), and it would take things like exposure to a blast furnace or some industrial strength acid before you noticed a difference.If you have some titanium lying around then go ahead and use it, but there is no point coughing up the extra money when stainless steel will work just as well for all realistic eventualities.",

Alternatively, seems, there is a company that makes Titanium hardware wallets but that just comes from quick google search, I don't know a thing about them but still worth to check, sounds interesting: Corazon Titanium.Or just write down your seeds on paper and save it somewhere where thieves won't start searching, for example behind the wallpaper of living room, idk, that's up to you.",
