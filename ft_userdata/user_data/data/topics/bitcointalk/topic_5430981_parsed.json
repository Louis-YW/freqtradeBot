  "content": "Only a week wey d CBN released d new naira notes for the country, counterfeit naira notes follow am enter the country also. Em go make sense make we all get the knowledge on how we go take differentiate the both(counterfeit and real naira notes).Em get about five simple guidelines on naira note wey all man suppose know to help am differentiate a counterfeit naira from a real oneQuote1. Check the texture: If the texture of the Naira note is soft and the image in it appears dull, you have the right to be concerned, reject it and demand another one.This means that you should be sensitive to the touch of the money you are given when involved in any transaction.2. Observe the gold foil: The N1000 note has a gold foil on the right side, just near the CBN governor’s signature. If you scratch the gold foil of a fake note it will peel off instantly but the gold foil on the original note does not peel.3. Use water or other liquid: You can differentiate fake currency from the original by using water or other liquid. Scammers release fake money and the colours they use in printing counterfeits are soluble in water and some other liquids.If you are not certain about the originality of a Naira note, dip it in water or petrol and scrub it gently. The colours will change immediately if it is fake money. The colours of counterfeit money will wash off like an artwork painted with watercolour.Again, the moment you immerse it in water, the paper becomes messed up. It will get rough and look more like a paper mache. However, the real note will not look like this when immersed in water or any liquid.4. Examine the ribbon/thread: There is a thread which appears like a ribbon on all Naira notes, running from the top to the bottom.In real notes, this thread can be felt with a touch. It is more noticeable on old Naira notes. However, in fake notes, there is something that looks like the thread but it is not.In the counterfeit notes, what is there is just a straight-line painting that looks like the thread in the original notes. If you scratch the painting, it will peel off like the solver panel on recharge cards.5. Use mercury bulbs: Some qualities of the paper Naira notes cannot be seen with the naked eye. These features are only in original Naira notes, and one cannot see them except with the help of mercury bulbs.

I had an argument with someone the other day about the possibility of faking the new notes, only for me to actually see one with the distinction very clear. Many people dey try take advantage of the fact say the new notes new too dey in circulation. As you take the pain to stress on the features wey we fit use distinguish am, you don remove the stress of trying to second guess which from which.",

      "body": "Good tips from you. You know this is what the society would be facing now because the fake note currently is on circulation which no one knows what they are in possession of wether the original or the fake. This timely intervention would let Nigerians be educated and enlightened on how to identify and pick out the fake from the original. We can  share this in our various homes, locality etc to give people orientation on how to spot the fake note so as not to fall victim of fraudsters. I really sorry for the POS vendors because most of them are the ones likely to have encountered with this fake note.Well done for the update OP",
