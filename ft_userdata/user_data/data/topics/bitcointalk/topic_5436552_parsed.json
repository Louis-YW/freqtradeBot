He said with online gambling it's available on through mobile phones and you can play at any time, this means no shortage of gambling around the clock and no shortage of losing money as well, you can easily pull out your phone and gamble with any free time, a bit compulsive and too accessible. What do you think about this claim? Is he right or wrong?",

      "body": "He is somewhat correct. There is surely no shortage of casinos and gambling houses around different neighbors but it is so easy to pull out your mobile, top up your account and start gambling for as long as you want.One can get addicted to both and would do anything to either get to a casino or use their mobile, but the relative ease of access in one option makes it harder to break from.Self discipline is key to avoid getting stuck to online gambling as well as filling your time with other habits.- Jay -",

      "body": "Depending on how the gambler understands the meaning of gambling itself, sometimes it is true that with easy access with mobile phones we can gamble at any time and get addicted, but if he can control himself not to become an addict, it won't have any effect.For example, I like to play gambling using my cell phone instead of having to go to a place to play gambling because the ease of access makes me comfortable playing gambling, but that doesn't mean that every time I play gambling, sometimes when I have free time I play gambling and it's not a priority, after all I'm not I'm unemployed because I still have other work to do, it's a powerful way to keep me from becoming an addict",

Being addict to an online casino can be manage or prevented. Just set limitations on gambling online to avoid addiction. I gamble in real life casino if I only have much time but I prefer doing it online and at home.",

What do you think about this claim? Is he right or wrong?  This is correct and I also agree with this statement, the online casino is hassle-free, you don't have to go to the casino itself literally, using your car that you will load with fuel where you pay for the fuel of your car can you use it to match in the casino online, what if it hits, isn't it a great help and comfort to a gambler?Although I am not saying that it is bad to gamble in a land-based or physical casino, of course, it also has advantages compared to online. Online is only recommended if you don't want to leave your place.",

      "body": "all of that returns to the self-control of each gambler. if a gambler is able to control himself from becoming a crazy gambling addict, all is well.for me online gambling makes it easier for a gambler to reach gambling remotely. I mean, like during the Covid 19 case, it would be better for us to gamble online without meeting many people to stop transmission.on the other hand, online gambling will be safer when you win big from gambling there are no bad people who will follow us and rob us of our money. different from physical gambling when we win big many people know and there is a criminal who is stalking us.In conclusion, online gambling or physical gambling has its own advantages and disadvantages. it's just that online gambling is more practical and safer.for the problem of being addicted, I say again it depends on each gambler. if a gambler is always able to control himself to gamble according to their planned commitment, I don't think it will make it more addictive.anyway, wouldn't this thread be better in the gambling discussion section.",

Your urge to gamble will always be there and you find free time to satisfy your urge by just accessing an online casino app or a website. This why a lot of online casinos have poped up and are getting a good amount of traffic.",

Is he right or wrong?  Its subjective, what if I feel taking my phone on the hands and go to a browser and login to a casino site and choose a game and decide bet amount and finally click the roll which involves some physical activity too so anyone who feel driving down to a casino can say the same reason for gambling online too. If you decide to gamble online its your own decision, if you decide to smoke its your own decision so you are in control of it so you can't blame the availability of products for your pleasure.",

This is one of the consequences of technologies today, many abused it and being uncontrolled. If you think you can't handle your addiction anymore better to seek some help and restrict yourself from any online activities. Physical casinos still serve its purpose, some still prefer the traditional way of gambling instead of playing online though whatever you choose, you can still be addict so be responsible always.",

There are a bunch of ways you can use to ban yourself from visiting online casinos, self-exclusion exists, and extensions that ban the website (just slam the keyboard when passing a password so you don't unlock it). There are also a bunch of processes involved before you even start playing like signing up and then depositing, might be a small duration for some but definitely enough to wake up and stop yourself. Idk if it exists but you can maybe set your card to deny withdrawal requests if it's through casinos, or just disconnect it if you see it connected. For cryptos well, idrk, maybe just throw it to a hardware wallet and lock it with multiple locks so you'd have to spend some level of effort to withdraw. Won't deny that it does make gambling anywhere faster though.",

Well, physical casinos can also be addictive especially with all the freebies and complementaries that they offer. They will try their best to capture your attention so you would be able to stay at the casino for as long as they want and for you to actually gamble again.QuoteHe said with online gambling it's available on through mobile phones and you can play at any time, this means no shortage of gambling around the clock and no shortage of losing money as well, you can easily pull out your phone and gamble with any free time, a bit compulsive and too accessible.

You can experience the same level of adrenaline in your home as if you are actually participating onsite a physical casino. The only problem stems on how easy it is for any person to enter an online gambling website as underage minors are prone to this.",

It would be difficult to maintain the practice once it has formed, so you have to watch out if you are doing it too much.

You are in control, but if you started to notice that you are doing it too much, then better to be away from your device.That’s why some countries have decided to ban gambling, because in their society, they probably noticed the effects of that.",

But does it make gambling more addictive? to youngsters somehow yes becuse they get to experience such thing. But what makes gambling addictive is gambler's mindset when playing. If you are one of those players who are eager to get rich from this industry, then you are definitely prone to being addicted into this activity. What causes this mindset? Impression. There are people who becme rich from winning the jackpot or big time. That is true but think of how huge the gap or difference in comparison with the number of people who are losing. This simply implies that not all people would be fortunate in gambling and that is an enough reason to avoid yourself being too dragged into it.",

Gambling addicts have the uncontrollable urge to keep gambling despite all the negative effects of compulsive gambling they are perfectly aware about. They are, no doubt, sick people and they need professional help. Does the invention of the internet make the life of such people harder? I don't know, maybe it does, but keep in mind that there are only around 5% of such people. It is still a big tragedy and all of us should try to help such people to recover from their illness, but I don't think the rest 95% should be deprived of the entertainment they enjoy so much.",
