  "content": "So, one thing that's been on my mind is the native tokens of exchanges. You know, those little guys that make the crypto world go 'round within specific exchange platforms.Basically BNB holds 1st place as the top most native token, and the growth of that coin is really high over time. And it is really also volatile at this point. so I started looking more around native tokens.And, so MAX token, I recently got introduced to it via its listing on Bitget exchange, so I understand some of you may not familiar with MAX. It is the utility token issued by MaiCoin Asset Exchange based in Taipei, Taiwan and it is a part of MaiCoin Group. Charlie Lee and Vitalik are also advisors of this group and so if you remember, Vitalik was giving an update about ETH 2.0 at Maicoin STO conference in Taipei a long time ago and also did a podcast with Maicoin, discussing Ethereum's transition to Proof of Stake, regulatory challenges, economic disparities in cryptocurrency, innovative solutions from Radical Markets like quadratic funding etc. This native token may not be recognized as top as BNB but still a great native token to have around in my opinion.What are your thoughts on this? Are you holding any native tokens that may boom?",

You can assure too that the token will receive price boost since the exchange will surely have profit from trading fees and its a necessity on crypto market.Investing on well known exchange such as Binance is a good thing to consider. Just make you are always updated and vigilant to all the news related news including FUD to the company since there’s a chance that a big exchange can collapse once regulators hit them hard just like what happened to FTX. But in general, Investing on popular exchange token is one of a good investment long term since they often have a feature of buy back using the exchange profit and discount from trading fees.",

So far that despite the controversies that it had been in, I'm still holding it since I have no choice.",

I am mostly neutral when it comes to CEX tokens with the exception of Bitget's BGB and Binance's BNB tokens. Bitget has been thriving these past few months so that's obviously been a good buy. BNB has one of the biggest names in crypto as its founder and since I bought low, I have some confidence it that too. Overall though, its best to be careful with them CEX tokens. As for MAX, I did hear a lot abt it and it's listing in Bitget. I'll say it's worth giving a look for the short term cos of the solid team behind it.",

Are you holding any native tokens that may boom?Native exchange tokens are good options for short-term investment. Buy BNB when it's down and sell it at a higher price during the alt season. They are better than other shit tokens. However, long-term investments in exchange tokens are not reliable because it is difficult to predict how long an exchange will work/survive, and you could potentially lose your money. Also, store your holdings in BTC (in offline/cold wallets) or offline investments after making a profit from these tokens.",

I know that it will take some time to get there, but I am sure that it's not going to be that much of a big deal at all.Hopefully, it can get to a point where we can actually enjoy it, and that should be more than enough, and I bet that people will like it one way or another, but that doesn't mean that it will get to a good point, we need to end up having some sort of situation where it will help plenty of people and that type of return should be very good.",

This is like giving one another a boost but of course, this is with monetary exchange and fees for them to be part of a new project just as what you've mentioned OP. It could have been better for the new projects that have a lot of budget for their marketing to give that allocation to their advisors because it's part of it.

A recent accusation of Kucoin not holding every staked amount of users hurt the exchange reputation but the exchange is still going strong and would be a good business when the bull arrives.I also in some period of time bought FTT token as FTX was said to be overtaking binance on volume of transaction amount soon but that led to a disaster, so exchange coins are not a full proof investment without risk.",

But the same as other native coins out there, the value seems to be difficult to increase unlike before. While it's given that it is because of the total supply, it is also because investors are not expecting too much out of them anymore. BNB was and is still the most successful one of all when it comes to native coins and repeating that will be hard because of the diversity in the number of investments in the market. Some investors would just say \"I'd rather buy BNB than risk it with a new one.\" and it's because of reputation. They built this from the roots and it's now stronger, if something would like to mimic that, it will be a long battle in marketing.",
