I believe here is the best place I can get the help/answer considering my curiosity.cryptocurrencies are decentralized finance, but not all cryptocurrencies are designed to be such. You may split cryptocurrencies into CEFI and DEFI. The second is focused on being decentralized, allowing you to communicate with smart contract protocols without going through any intermediaries; it is just you and the protocol. For example, to trade on an exchange, you must first register with a centralized exchange and be vetted, but Defi requires only you and your wallet.These days I use to wonder if we really have defi in crypto though, they are been controlled by a group of people.",

Can you also see the stable coins like USDT and USDC that can be frozen by their developers, even if you are having the stable coins on a noncustodial wallet, it can still be frozen by the developers, that is also centralization in some ways.",

Ponzi is a more specific type of scam and is not really an innate effect of de-fi itself. Perhaps this scheme can happen in the defi space too since smart contracts can be built for different purposes of use. Cryptocurrency is just a means, nothing more.Since ponzi is considered a crime, founders generally disguise their schemes and prefer the path of centralization.",
