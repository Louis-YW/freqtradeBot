I do not know how the fee is, but you can try the ones like Pancakeswap which is BEP20 and compare it with ERC20 exchange like dYdX. Know that decentralized exchanges can be exploited too by hackers. I still prefer centralized exchanges for trading derivatives. Maybe because I have not used decentralized exchanges before for it.You can still use some no KYC centralized exchanges too: No-KYC Exchange EncyclopediaBut KYC can be asked at anytime.",

(Thanks for that). And if we can do future trades on PS then why going for DYDX, DYDX is a new exchange while Pankcakeswap is older and most trustable too. So, if i have to chose as in OP's place then i will go for PS.I do agree with your points, that many platform not asking for KYC at start might ask for KYC after sometime or when the trading volume will begin to increase. OKX would be a better option too. Houbi is also on the list but now i will suggest OP to not trade in Houbi because it has some red flags.

I think you should personally try the dydx first so you have a point o comparison just when you're going to Binance.  If there is just an Android version of the dydx, I would have used it every now and then.

Whether we do really like it or not but we cant really that deny that centralized exchange platforms does really give out that kind of convenience on which we cant really be able to experience on using up a DEX.Even though we do really mind about decentralization and anonymity but we cant really still deny the fact that being convenient and easy access and tons of options on which you could really be able to do with CEX.This is why in comparing about liquidity and volume then CEX does have the upperhand which it isnt shocking, we people do love that decentralized stuff but in speaking about using up some services or platformthen nothing beats out these current exchangers that been offering. This is why its not really that shocking that people would really be coming or using up the most convenient way.KYC is becoming  that more evident on crypto based platforms and sooner or later then most of the current existing ones would really be getting inline on such protocol or requirement.Somehow there are still some places which are really that going that non asking kyc still.",

So if you are a daytrader, you might find it difficult to pay 1% fees on each trade. So that makes it unfeasable, for now. But perhaps someone knows of a solution of trading on DeFi with low costs? Someone here also mentioned that DeFi can be hacked: Of course both DeFi and CeFi platforms can be hacked. So there is no reason to believe that a centralized exchange cannot be hacked.",

You might feel the fee when you do actual trades and that's what's saving you from doing it in centralized exchanges like Binance. Thing here is where you're comfortable doing the trades, you can choose whatever you want and do an actual experiment on what's costing you less for the fees and what's saving you more. The rate could literally vary as that's what most of the exchanges, cexes and dexes differs in most cases.",

But people now choose the opportunity of gaining the market over security, if security, privacy, and control are key concerns, a DEX might be more appealing.  If higher liquidity, user-friendliness, and a wider range of trading features matter more to you, a CEX might be a better fit.",

It looks like they support dydx too[1]. Not sure if it requires a VPS or not, it looks like you can just run it on your computer (although a VPS is probably preferred if you want to run it 24/7). On the other hand, the last update is last year so you should expect some problems. I do believe the tradeoff is quite worth it if you are not comfortable with KYC at all.[1] https://github.com/kieran-mackle/AutoTrader",

However dont know if I am charged more on another side.Definitely, there will be some fee charges from both the Dex and CEX exchanges. Most of the time, the fees can't even be noticed as they are relatively small to the extent that you might not notice that there was a charge removed when you were executing your trade. The fee rate is dependent on which exchange you choose; some Dex even charge higher than CEX, and some CEX charge higher irrespective of what the charge is for. On the aspect of KYC, it's an individual choice, and I tell people the risk involved is now left for you to decide if it's worth it or not. I personally don't talk people out of using centralized exchanges, but rather I advise users to consider the risk factor involved, and if there are possible means of avoiding it, one should grab them, but in a situation where there are none, especially in the aspect where you talk about having more trading pairs, one should go for it, and do not forget to look at the T&C of whichever CEX you choose to use, as most times those ignored declaimers are what is being used against someone, especially on the aspect of huge deposits, frozen accounts, loss of funds, etc.",
