  "content": "The question is, How can poker compliment existing crypto operators?We're almost done with development for a multi-player poker system called Redraw Poker Platform and are looking for business opportunities.https://redrawpokerplatform.com/There's already a lot of energy going into poker and crypto at the top end, such as:WPT Poker HeroesVirtue PokerBut, while NFTs and Play-to-Earn are great, those don't fit easily into existing casinos and their gaming.So the question is, How can multi-player poker add some features that benefit existing operators? One idea is weekly freerolls or guaranteed MTTs for players.Or if that question is too hard to answer specifically, what are some of the general features that players like (not limited to playing cards)? Are players open to trying new things? Or are the expectations more geared toward the traditional live casino experience?",
