  "content": "What do you say on this matter?Banknote and Digital Currency {Bitcoin} are all meant to buy things both in physical shops and online vendors. And countries are trying to adapt to the adoption of the digital currency upon all the restrictions many had laid on it but seen the benefits of it, some lift up the ban. And many people were excited because bitcoin is decentralized and out of government control and bitcoin is volatile and it is store of value. So people became conscious and like bitcoin the more. If bitcoin transaction is low and retail businesses accept bitcoin as a method of payment. Dollar does devalue bitcoin so the price of things will not be influenced by dollar anymore. But the international market might still affect the price of things because there they would still used dollar for exchange unless the vendors are accepting bitcoin at that level as well. In my own understanding if bitcoin is adopted as a legal tender in my country the cost of living will reduce. The cost of in my country is on the peak that those who are receiving $80 as salary is nothing but a peanut which can't buy anything reasonable in the market again. Dollar is just playing with the Banknote in my country. And the best way is for the retail businesses to accept bitcoin if the transaction fee is low so that things will be okay for the poor. I am very happy that within this almost one year period I was not in the forum, I have invested some reasonable amount of bitcoin.Welcome Back to the forum.DiMarxist.",

For people who can already make money, but don't make enough to save any money, Bitcoin can't do anything for them. Bitcoin is a great solution for a lot of problems, but it doesn't fix every single money problem in the world. It's just a currency. A lot of money problems have nothing to do with the currency, but rather with the economy/politics/culture/etc.",

I think the \"lowered cost of living\" part is due to how Bitcoin has its own economy (unlike the dollar) but in the end, wouldn't the price automatically adjust to the usual high prices? Heck it might even be higher just so that merchants can accommodate the variances that Bitcoin has, which in most cases can be pretty high. To compare, it's not like your $80 would change when converted to Bitcoin, it's still worth $80 at that point. And as for looking at prices with Bitcoin, as I said, it would naturally adjust according to whatever dollar equivalent it has, say $10, then no matter the BTC price, it'd always equate to $10 at the end of the day. I also don't see it realistic to put the entirety of your money as Bitcoin due to the high volatility, regardless of however much profit you can possibly make off of it since at the end of the day, it's just a \"possibility\".",

Inflation, low demand for national currency, political instability, etc might be some of the factors affecting your country. Until some of these problems are fixed, Bitcoin might have no positive effect on the economy. People will still have to pay more for goods and services with Bitcoin if the country is going through inflation. Your country might benefit from Bitcoin if they buy the currency and keep it for a long time. They could make a profit that can be used to tackle other economic problems. Bitcoin adoption could also attract some investors and create few jobs in your country. It could also help to reduce the cost of international financial transactions since it could bypass SWIFT and other international payment channels.",

Bitcoin will keep being \"digital gold\", which would rather be adopted by big institutional investors. The retail businesses will stay away from BTC, due to various factors.

But this still depends on the country we are talking about. In my country, though Bitcoin will help, but it can't still measure up for the huge inflation that has happened and that is still happening. Bitcoin is trying, yet, the inflation is bitting so deeper than it.And for you to know the gist, within a few years now, we are now talking about 5-10 times higher in price. This year alone (as new as it is), some goods and services have tripled in price, though some could still be doubled or almost doubled depending on what we are talking about. So, it is that bad. I just hope that things will be fine with time even as we use Bitcoin and another possible assets to try to hedge this nonesense inflation that is frustrating people daily.",

The unemployment rate in the country is very high, but bitcoin came to liberate many youths from the poverty line and you are saying that bitcoin has nothing to do the nation economy.
