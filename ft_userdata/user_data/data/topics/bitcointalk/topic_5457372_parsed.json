It is when people have lost their lives that these government agencies will tell the world how the firm or company broke regulatory rules. But they were around and were watching these firms engage in risky adventures without stopping them. These agencies will not deny that they are aware that OceanGate was risking the lives of people and making a profit from it. Government agencies are reactive and not proactive. These deaths would have been avoided if regulators had sealed the company and ensured they abide by the rules. Our system is run by highly connected corrupt and greedy folks that act above the law because of their links to the seat of power. The loss of life is irreplaceable, but it becomes painful to the bereaved if it happened because of avoidable mistakes.",

Invisible hand of the market won't be able to undo the damage or prevent it in the future from repeating again.I think most people are fine with regulations as long as it is reasonable. The problem is that the one who runs the system can't be trusted, which is hard to solve since you can't simply tell everyone to \"try to participate in governance then\". If this point is being connected with cryptocurrencies, such as exchange and whatnot, the problem is not really similar since the stakes are different. As far as I'm aware, nobody died when they don't submit KYC and don't want to do it, just facing some inconveniences. If we really want to force the invisible hand term into this discussion, then some might argue that the stock price of such a company can get slashed if the public found out that the CEO and its staff are a bunch of idiots. CMIIW.A lot of cases related to exchange insolvency also give us some distrust in how people run these exchanges, or how the government handles the case. The debate about SEC being so unclear with their rules and how they go after exchanges is quite popular on social media afaik. Hopefully, nothing like this will happen in the future.",

But besides that, there are also many investors who are against all regulations, they do not need to know what the regulations are and constantly oppose and strongly oppose. It can be said that currently, the government and the people have not found a common voice, while we want freedom, the government wants to control us more. Since then, there have been too many unresolvable conflicts.I am not against all regulations but they should at least make regulations that are appropriate and fair for all rather than just for their own benefit.",

There wasn't a single certification board that was willing to certify the vessel, nor was there an insurance company willing to offer them coverage because the vessel was assemped seemingly out of a hardware store. Sure, *zero* regulations are disastrous. But no one's arguing for total lawlessness absent of legal structure and regulatory framework.
