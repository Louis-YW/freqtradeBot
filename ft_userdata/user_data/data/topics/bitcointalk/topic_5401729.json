  "content": "Custom Linux install guide for the Futurebit Apollo [A Full Node/Mining Platform for the Home!].This is the 'Base configuration' for my node and miner install guides for Futurebit Apollo BTC.Since the premise of this device was always Install any Bitcoin Application, Use any Hardware Wallets, download any Dev tools and use our platform as your dedicated Bitcoin development system. (see quote below), people requested a Lightning install guide on the official support page and other 'apps', but unfortunately nothing was released yet.Quote from: https://www.futurebit.io/Hook up a Monitor, Keyboard, and Mouse and you have a dedicated low power desktop system that runs 24/7. Install any Bitcoin Application, Use any Hardware Wallets, download any Dev tools and use our platform as your dedicated Bitcoin development system. The possibilities are endless.For me, there was also the issue of security; if you update this device's OS using the apt package manager, it can stop working, so it's often discouraged - leaving thousands of users running these machines on outdated software.Hence I decided to take a fresh new microSD card and install Armbian on it as well as the necessary software for:Full Bitcoin node (Bitcoin Core v23.0)Miner software (Binary from Futurebit.io)Apollo dashboard (Open source from jstefanop)Lightning node (Core Lightning v0.11.1)Electrum (electrs v0.9.7)BTCPayServer may be added if there's interest.Since some users may not care about the 'node' and just want to mine, I split into two topics:[Guide] Futurebit Apollo BTC Custom Linux Install - Miner[Guide] Futurebit Apollo BTC Custom Linux Install - NodeBoth topics assume you followed the basic config explained here.",

      "body": "I planned to use openSUSE, since I have had good experiences with it as a node OS. Unfortunately, the SBC used by Futurebit is an Orange Pi 4 which doesn't have great software support, so for best chances of success I stick with Armbian, which is what Futurebit ships (just an older version of it).Download page: https://www.armbian.com/orange-pi-4/Direct link: https://redirect.armbian.com/orangepi4/Bullseye_current (Armbian 22.05 Bullseye - May 28, 2022)Burn on a new microSD card with 16GB or more using dd or BalenaEtcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/).The first boot of this microSD will require to plug in a HDMI monitor and a USB keyboard to create an admin (you can use something else, I just assume this name from here on forward) account and set your locale.Otherwise just update the whole thing and proceed with miner and / or node install guides, linked above.Code:sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y",

It's the full unit, so it has the hashboard and a 1TB SSD with full node. I'll also write a review about it with more info, soon-ish, so we can discuss more questions over there..  The reason for this guide is that the full node is, well, just that. A full node. No Electrum, no Lightning. Updating the system and installing software is also discouraged since it 'may break something'.  So I had to start with a fresh OS to install everything I'd want in a device like this.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 08, 2022, 08:14:00 PMThis is the first time I saw this and it looks like interesting device with decent price, I see that batch 3 is sold out, but they are already working on batch 4.One problem I have with asic miners is noise they are creating, but this makes almost no noise according to their website (not sure if this is true).Yeah, all in all it's a neat machine; it works well and reliably, it's not 'silent silent', but fairly quiet so as long as it's not in your bedroom, it won't get in your way.I'll elaborate more in the review though. But I can say that stock, running at full speed, it's relatively loud - you're meant to run it in eco mode to get it quiet; however I found a 'hardware solution' for it (PC fans) and it's fine like that.TL;DR, if you want real silence, the higher-efficiency ASIC chips in the Compac F (BM1397) may be a better choice. Though the price per hash is much higher there and you even need to buy a PSU and the GekkoScience USB hub separately.",

After all, I already have a personal full node that I can always access, with electrs and everything I need.However I liked the concept and wanted to deploy another node for some family (or give them my local node and use the Apollo for myself).

However, I will add instructions for creating a cronjob that turns off / turns down the miner at night and turns it on in the morning. Could also be modified to e.g. only mine when electricity is cheaper if that's what people want to go for.

Its performance per Watt is much better than Apollo, even though you get much less hashes per $ of purchasing cost.Quote from: dkbit98 on June 09, 2022, 06:48:42 PMQuote from: nullama on June 09, 2022, 01:42:58 AMThe first thing I had to update was the original PSU.

      "body": "Thanks for writing this guide and the guides for the custom Linux miner and node install!The miner and node install instructions are above my current skill level, although I could probably follow the instructions without understanding what I am doing.However, I wonder if there is an alternative approach.Do I understand this correctly when stating it as follows? 1) The miner and node install instructions are needed so that the Orange Pi can be operated while the cable between Orange Pi  and ASIC board is connected, and the Orange Pi is powered that way.2) There are still software vulnerabilities involved when following the instructions.3) The Orange Pi 4 could be dis-connected from the ASIC board, turning it into a Standard Apollo with a Orange Pi in the same housing. With a dumb 5V power supply to the USB-C port, the Orange Pi 4 could be powered up and run Armbian OS4) This is where it gets tricky, potentially: Can the 'separated' Orange Pi 4 be connected via USB to USB micro cable to the ASIC board in the same housing, or does that create some ground loop that could fry things? 5) If I get a new PSU to power the 'separated' ASIC board on 12V and the 'separated' Orange Pi on 5V: Would that 5V supply be 'dumb' enough to provide sufficient power to the separated Orange Pi? And would that put the separated ASIC board and Orange Pi on the same ground connection so that a ground loop is prevented?6) Can I then just install Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Electrs and a Lightning wallet and whatever else I want into the Armbian OS, keep it updated and secure, and run the 'separated' ASIC board by using the Apollo BTC Standard software in a terminal? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5340015.msg57091051#msg570910517) And can I then also run additional Standard Apollo units (each in a separate terminal, connected to the same (new) PSU on 12V?",

Yes; it's mostly correct.Quote from: MrMik on December 07, 2022, 09:14:34 PM1) The miner and node install instructions are needed so that the Orange Pi can be operated while the cable between Orange Pi  and ASIC board is connected, and the Orange Pi is powered that way.Exactly: what differentiates my guide from just installing generic Armbian, Bitcoind and Apollo-miner binaries is that the GPIO setup lets you use the hashboard through the internal connection. Saving you an USB cable and a second power supply.Quote from: MrMik on December 07, 2022, 09:14:34 PM2) There are still software vulnerabilities involved when following the instructions.No; there are no known software vulnerabilities when following my instructions!  Not sure how you came to such conclusion.Quote from: MrMik on December 07, 2022, 09:14:34 PM3) The Orange Pi 4 could be dis-connected from the ASIC board, turning it into a Standard Apollo with a Orange Pi in the same housing.

And would that put the separated ASIC board and Orange Pi on the same ground connection so that a ground loop is prevented?Yes; if you skip the GPIO setup, but follow all other steps, that's how you would operate the miner. Hashboard connected using a microUSB to USB-A cable, and a separate power supply for the Orange Pi 4.This would definitely work and you don't have to worry about ground loops. It will just be a 'Standard Unit' controlled from an Orange Pi 4, that is conveniently sitting in the same enclosure. Electrically, there is no difference whether it sits inside or not.I just don't see why you would want to do that, if using this one simple step you can save around 50 bucks in cables and power supplies.

Yes, that's exactly what I've done in my guides.  I labeled each step with what software is installed and the build instructions are mainly taken from the original projects' GitHub pages & modified to run on Armbian. If you're going to do it all manually (without guide), you'll be doing basically the exact same stuff.Yes, the miner script in my guide supports external standard units, as well. Don't need separate terminals even; the script recognizes and starts up all of them!",

Not sure how you came to such conclusion.Sorry to cause confusion and maybe concern for some readers. My fault for not really fully understanding the instructions, no doubt.The stuff I picked up as potentially concerning was this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401730.msg60310493#msg60310493QuoteAttention: As of now, you need to actually get the apolloapi repo instead, since it handles the authentication to the web UI. Also the project(s) require a very old, potentially insecure version of NodeJS; namely NodeJS 9.x - use at your own risk. Do note that you can mine and run your nodes without any web UI at all..I don't really know what that means, but I figured you highlighted it in red for some reason. The other one is this: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5401730.msg60310485#msg60310485Quote[5] Download the DTS file that comes with the 'Apollo OS'. Yes, this is a binary file I'm providing, but the apollo miner binary is, too, and I'm trying to figure out a better way for this as we speak.With this one I am even more uncertain if I understand it correctly.What I thought (while reading the instructions diagonally) this sentence means is this:'This is a binary file' = no-one can tell what is in it, i.e. no source code provided and therefore we have to trust n0nce and/or jstefanop that the content is not malicious. I probably misunderstood that one completely, my apologies, I'm not trying to accuse anyone of bad intentions.",
