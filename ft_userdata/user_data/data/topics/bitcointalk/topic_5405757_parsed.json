No you don’t understand. The coins are not at MtGox.Some trustee has them. And the people who lost their BTC back in 2014 filed claims for their lost bitcoins.They will get them most likely sent to a new BTC wallet and those who want USD will have it sold by the trustee and most likely would be sent by bank transfer.",

      "body": "Honestly I agree. Its going to be a lot of \"burned\" coins. Sure there could be some dump, but it will mainly be because of all the people who will sell to avoid a dump, causing the dump themselves funnily enough. This is why I believe that nobody should do something before it happens, because it may not happen at all, and you hurt the market for nothing. This will be mainly maybe like %30-40 of the people still having access to their wallets, and maybe nearly 100k bitcoins being gone forever. Thats a good thing for us, more bitcoins gone from the market circulation and it will allow bitcoin to gain value overtime, not right away probably, but over long term.",

However now they got 137K BTC and users will get that also. People KYC long time ago if they had large balances.Keep in mind BTC topped at $1000 back then and many had coins in the $100-200 range.",

I believe that after so long of giving that money away, most people are going to sell the coins. Firstly because they have an extremely high return compared to the original acquisition cost, secondly because they have waited a long time, and finally because in the bear market we are in, there is not much incentive to hold. If they had received it last year, with the price rising, and when it was beating ath after ath, maybe more than one would have been tempted to HODL but now I don't think so.However, I think the smartest thing to do would be not to sell everything. If you get 5 Bitcoins, you sell 2 or 3 and you get your money back after waiting for so long, you make a profit and you stay invested.",

This is around $3 billion dollars.Technically not all creditors will be receiving bitcoin it's worth noting.. As far I understand they have the option of cash, btc or bch (<= lol). This is probably in an attempt to reduce market volatility, with the trust offering to sell their coins for them. I imagine this would be done OTC based on the amounts. Although this still is an increase of 150K coins, it seems unlikely that it will be this much pressure on the spot market. It's potentially a good opportunity for instiutions to get cheap coins OTC.Quote from: adaseb on July 09, 2022, 10:28:52 PMEveryone is watching their wallet and many will start to front run the dumping when it’s actually redistributed.Sell the rumour buy the news comes to mind. Meaning by the time coins are distributed to creditors, the dump will be over. Logically, it'd make no sense for creditors who want to take profits to do so themselves, via spot market, when they have the option of the trust doing it for them. Especially if the trust is able to cash out their coins prior to others getting their BTC. Maybe only 10-50K coins will be distributed in total?Quote from: adaseb on July 09, 2022, 10:28:52 PMWhat does everyone think will happen? Dump? Pump? Sideways?Probably start dumping from here if the news causes panic in the market. Either way, direction will now likely be determined by OTC markets based on distribution plan, rather than spot market.Quote from: adaseb on July 09, 2022, 10:28:52 PMIt’s also funny how ETH merge is around the same time. Late August. Should be a busy month. Not sure this is that relevant to BTC price, but rather a factor for ETH getting hit harder than BTC.",

I completely understand these people considering how much time has passed and that each of them wants to finish it as soon as possible.If it finally happens that the payouts start, I don't think it can have too much of an impact on the price considering that the payouts will probably go gradually, that a good part will be paid out in fiat, and that some will certainly keep what they get in Bitcoin. No matter how it ends, the whole case is, from a time perspective, a great shame for the Japanese system, which has proven to be quite incapable of solving it within a reasonable time frame.",

That was a long wait but it was all worth it, since btc value have improved compared to its price long time ago. They can just assume that it was a blessing in disguise. It's okay if there are still some delays but what important is it's already confirmed that they will get their btc's and we are still in a bearish market right now. It would be a good timing if they receive their coins during the bull run.",
