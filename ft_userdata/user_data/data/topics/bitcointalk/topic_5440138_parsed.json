You have to start spending more time on the forum and get engagements so that you will begin to find out how little things like that work here. From BPIP data I see you are honest about what you said and have not sent a single merit to any member. Get busy. But you can close this topic now as your question has its answer already.",

We hope to see you send some of them 3.5smerits you've got but for now,You should move this thread over to beginners and help or even archive after haven't got all these directives.If you don't know how to move a thread,Look at the bottom left of your screen and you would notice a lock/move icon. Click and following the directives in selecting a board then authorise the move. This isn't a typical meta thread!",

I posted this with my phone and thought that it was okay.Even with a phone you will still find out if it's bloated or not. I also post images here from a mobile phone. Just hit the \"Preview\" button before you post to peruse how your picture will look like when posted. Zoom in to get a clearer view.

There are so many quality posts that have even previously been rewarded with merit by other users. If you think it's feasible, please apply according to what has been directed by several users here.",
