The governance token's primary role is to be used for voting by the community members pertaining to K STADIUM governance,¬† which is operated through smart contracts as well as through votes and cannot be traded based on the timeline of the recently published whitepaper[May 22], and can only be obtained from sending crypto assets to KSTA's community Pool,if 1 KSTA is remitted to the community pool,it will be exchanged for 1 SOP, and the SOP paid can be Delegated to the Stadium Owner(SO), a leader verified with a delegable token, for compensation. Along with the delegation does not mean a transfer of value , so the SOP does not expire after the delegation. The SOP Delegated to the SO is calculated as the Voting Power proportional to the entire SOP. The exchange ratio of SOP and KSTA is not a fixed value and can be changed for the purpose of controlling inflow and price adjustment. But the $KSTA remains the primary token of K STADIUM through with the holders can benefit from the projects governance and would be able to carry out diverse transactions in the system, ranging from the shopping mall to part of the project Ecosystem, so you see as holder you're indirectly part of the project's team.

      "body": "Why K STADIUMi. GovernanceIn the previous section, cases in which DPoS governance and its shortcomings has resulted in a gradual decrease in participation were discussed. This phenomenon poses risks of DPoS governance eventually leading to a potentially abandoned network. In this regard, it is safe to assume that the success of a governance model or its network largely depends on a solid driver of participation.Two critical elements were mentioned for a potentially successful governance model in the introduction: collaborative effort by the community, and a selfsustainingtoken economy. As such, what could qualify as a solid driver to activate and sustain the behaviors or mechanisms most difficult to achieve simultaneously most critical for the DPoS approach to be effective? The innate structure of a DPoS-based governance model allows for efficient authentication and validation resulting in unprecedented transaction speeds; however, its weakness is exposed when the token holder acts based on ‚Äúindividual benefit‚Äù as opposed to acting on behalf of the ‚Äúcommunity.‚Äù While there is no singular solution that will guarantee a perfect participation scenario, we have an agenda which we believe would be the most relevant to our initiative‚Äôs scope. We believe that the weakest link in the DPoS environment is the connection of the individual to the community. By this, we mean that the individual has the freedom to withdraw their stake at any given time regardless of financial benefit. However, a network where the individual‚Äôs identity strongly aligns with the community‚Äôs identity will have a higher probability of retaining its members through a value that outweighs abandoning the project. As such, another look at the EOS network and their 0.5% annual reward simply cannot outweigh the ‚Äúhassle‚Äù of governance participation.In K STADIUM, participation in governance is a direct decision by participating, beyond changing the structure or interest rate of simple ‚Äútokenomics.‚Äù This decision is directly related to the direction of funds in the community. Thus, participation in the network carries more weight than just a ‚Äúvote‚Äù to elect someone to decide on their behalf. Allowing users to participate in decisions can be a solution to the fundamental problem of governance stagnation by fostering stronger bonds between communities and individuals through clear rewards.ii. Community PoolVenture Capital (VC) refers to financial capital itself or institutional investors who own such capital, which invests in potential startup ventures to generate high capital gains. Start-ups receive investments to solve initial capital problems, and investors hope for a win-win scenario by receiving high yields on their investment should the company perform as projected. Solana is a representative blockchain platform that has received investment from venture capital. Solana is expanding its ecosystem by nurturing Solana-based decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and ecosystem-based startups with investment funds. Since it takes considerable cost and time to expand and develop the blockchain ecosystem, rapid growth is guaranteed if funds and manpower are secured through initial investment. However, it is not easy for companies to receive the so-called investments from venture capital, and Individual investors cannot participate in investments on the same scale as those led by VCs. This led K STADIUM to devise a funding system that aggregates the funds of participants into a community pool to expand the ecosystem. The community pool itself functions as a VC. The fund collected in the community pool is used to improve and update the system and supports services to be launched on the mainnet. The expansion of platforms to NFT, deFi, as well as the metaverse leads to high holders' returns, and holders‚Äô returns soon, and theprofits from funds are recollected into the Community Pool, leading to the growth of the VC. The larger Community Pool lead to larger project planning and implementations than before, and growth in project size results in increased holder returns. This process creates a sustainable cycle that ultimately increases the size of the fund known as the Community Pool, which results in higher profits for individual participants who have participated in it. As a result, the platform continues to expand while benefiting its users.This and more are still parts of the benefit of being an holder of $KSTA, HODL and Stake your KSTA today and I assure you, you won't regret ithttps://[Suspicious link removed]/3mYYItD",

      "body": "The coin holder of the K STADIUM blockchain mainnet, or, the token holder sends his tokens in the community pool and receives a stake token (SOP) (Stadium Owner Power). The mainnet's holder, who has received the equity token, can delegate the equity token (SOP) to the node operator, or the SO (Stadium Owner).SOs entrusted with equity tokens are ranked according to the number of tokens delegated to them. The role of SO according to the ranking may be modified by voting on the policy of the mainnet.SOs that have not been put into block generation are broadcasted the agreed upon ledger through gossip protocols. In order to participate in the SO Pool, the retention of the entire ledger is a basic condition as well as being able to operate a node. And to ensure the performance of the entire network, the node server must meet server specifications (hardware and software) to participate in the SO Pool. The ranking of SOs may be performed for each predetermined period according to settings, referred to as a ‚Äúround.‚Äù SO selection for the next round is carried out through a snapshot according to the amount of equity tokens held at a certain point in time when each round begins, and rewards for each round is paid at a certain point after the end of the round. Main net users, who have acquired equity tokens through sending crypto assets to Community Pool, can select SOs to delegate their equity tokens after reviewing public data such as ranking, rewards ratio, participation in previous rounds, voting (asset management, policy-making) and policy-making directions through voting.If the passed proposal involves the use of funds that can be returned to external project tokens or other token-based profits, the results of community pool fund execution will be distributed to participants in new project tokens or other forms of medium. The profit is paid according to the rate of the participants‚Äô delegation and follows the reward payment mechanism. To be specific, the rate of return isbasically determined according to the payment formula of the basic reward, rank reward, and block reward that SOM receives through SO delegation. Nondelegated.SOP is excluded from the benefit. The profit payout is calculated from the reward distribution data. However, the payment date and amounts may vary from project to project.The ‚Äúdata‚Äù determination of the returns, the execution of the community pool funds, the adjustment of the SOP, and the return refers to the same data. The reference time related to the execution of funds may be adjusted according to changes in the policy, and the operator needs to notify the change before the revision.All these things are benefits $KSTA owners are privileged to enjoy, get yours today and HODL üíéüí∞üí™https://[Suspicious link removed]/3mYYItD",
