Um, the Compac-F has their own thread that you may want to read through. Bet most if not all of any questions you have - including power requirements and current pulled vs freq - are answered there...",

These are in my bedroom and my wife doesn't like the light  There isn't a.way to turn the screen off without logging in to the unit via ssh (username \"pi\", password \"raspberry\" and closing the process that runs the screen.You can access this by typing \"sudo screen -list\" and attaching to the correct process running the screen program.If this is a little too much for you, ask Idan at Bitcoin Merch to get a screen toggle / brightness slider implemented into the software and it'll get done.RegardsIAmGpio",
