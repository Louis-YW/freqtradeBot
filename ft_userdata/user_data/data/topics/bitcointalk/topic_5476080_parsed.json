  "content": "I remember there were plenty of defi and aggregators that provided 100%+ apy for staking LP of top coins (top 20 by market cap) and or stable coins. Like BNB/USDT pair staking would give 100%+ but now there are no such rewards. Pancakeswap and autofarm rates are depressing.Can anyone suggest me any large paying defis or aggregators? I'm open to changing my preferred network to any new networks but the pair should be of the top coins only.",
