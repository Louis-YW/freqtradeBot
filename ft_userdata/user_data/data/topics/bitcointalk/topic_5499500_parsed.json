      "body": "True DaveF,It is a smart move to make as the US has the most strict regulation laws when it comes to cryptocurrency.Just look at Coinbase and the redtape they have had to go through to just be in the forefront of the mass adoption of bitcoin in the public eye, having commercials during live sporting events is enormous at a grand scale.So this purchase of BitStamp is also a good move for it's own clientbase.Noticed some key elements while looking at what one of the founders of the company has achieved since it's inception on 2011:https://www.crunchbase.com/person/nejc-kodric\"The deal add four to five million new cryptocurrency customers to the company but, more significantly, it will also let the popular trading app take over the 50 licenses that Bitstamp has in Europe and around the world.\" source: https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/06/06/robinhood-just-made-a-very-big-bet-on-crypto-what-the-200-million-bitstamp-deal-means-for-the-companyAnother interesting read to see what implications it brings along with it at the Wall Street Journal from an American standpoint on this deal:https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/robinhood-doubles-down-on-crypto-with-deal-for-bitstamp-eade3276",

Good to see they are doing something that could benefit their clients.Some of them hold all of their crypto on Robinhood though, which I try to tell them isn't a good idea but you guys know how that conversation ends up with normal people lol.",

They are possibly protecting their business so that in the future, if there is persecution in the crypto industry, they are not tied to just one geographic location, we all know that the dynamics regarding laws and persecution change every 4 years.",

I think that's my question here. They are being cornered and politically attacked and I think they just said to themselves, \"It's enough. We are buying something that moves outside US and you cannot touch us anymore.\"  Something like that.",

No doubt.  Except last I knew, Robinhood absolutely sucked as a company and they let customers buy and sell cryptocurrencies like they were a bucket shop from many years past, i.e., people basically bet on whatever crypto they bought or sold but there was never actually any buying or selling going on.  You weren't able to withdraw the crypto you bought, nor could you deposit any.Is Robinhood still operating like that?  I had an account once but abandoned it after they weren't able to provide me with a phone number to call in order to solve a problem, nor were they willing to call me.",
