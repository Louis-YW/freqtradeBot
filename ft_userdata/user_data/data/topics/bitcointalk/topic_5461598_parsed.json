According to coinmarketcap there are 18 000 000 coins/tokens. Do you think that a project that has no real use and only mixes tokens inside the project is needed? I will give an example of a real use. BNB gives discounts for trading on the largest CEX, besides it is used for fees on BSC, ETH is used for fees for using the largest smart contract platform, BTC is used for fees for using the best digital gold. under these coins is a utility that someone wants to use. What utility is behind your project? What are these tokens for anyway? You presented tokenomics, how tokens are supposed to move in the project, but you didn't say why anyone would be interested in the project at all. Without a product, you create a ponzi.",

      "body": "Centralization and a public ledger seem at odds in the context of crypto. The absence of a governing body, or \"centralization,\" is crypto's key selling point. Therefore, there may be less demand for a centralized token. Still, the answer is conditional on the nature of centralization and the degree of control exercised.Distributing tokens by sending them at random to users' existing wallets? Interesting, however fairness issues may arise if tokens are distributed at random, especially if those with larger wallets wind up with a disproportionate share. Perhaps an algorithmic method would work better.Again, flat transaction fees can have both positive and negative effects. While they may make computations easier, they may also put off customers who rely on little purchases to advance their game.Last but not least, persistent inflation can discourage long-term investment in the coin by causing its value to gradually decrease. Keep in mind that a cryptocurrency's (or any currency's) stability is essential to its widespread use.",

I think Flat transaction costs and constant inflation are intriguing additions to the ecology. But its crucial to properly take into account the financial ramifications and probable difficulties in implementation and adoption beacuse already million on token are listed on coinmarketcap. Your proposal might be improved by talking to crypto professionals. Good luck with the creation of your token but make it unique with unique product",

My motivation behind this is, I have been in crypto since BTC was 17$ and I think there are some aspects I would like to try to iterate on.However, the reason I posted it here is to see the initial reaction to the concept to gauge if it is worth pursuing.As I mentioned, I will be releasing a drafted white paper soon, and the reference implementation should be done today or tomorrow. Which I will then use to test if my assumptions work.It's meant to be its own platform, not ERC20 or something.",

So that using it as a currency is more convenient and more incentivized. That's the main idea.I never said that there won't be a liquidity pool or that there can't be a liquidity pool. But the purpose of the post was a few steps back. The concept behind it, not how to bootstrap it.Also, my idea of doing a liquidity pool would be a bit different. Since the token generation is not tied to a genesis wallet but based on seeds, users could get the tokens and you could do a buyback of them.That way you could bootstrap the currency without people having to buy it in the beginning, and the risk is on me and maybe some other investors. But right now there's not even a platform ready, because it's supposed to be a native coin.",

I don't see any of this could garner an attention due to you are building something that has no foundational reasoning.Have you read the white paper?The goal is to make the system verifiable and auditable, yes. The public ledger system is just one aspect of that. And it leaves open the possibility of decentralizing certain aspects of the system later to create offline transactions (just a theory for now).Random was not the best word to describe it, sorry. The distribution process is based on seeds. The name of the token (the second of the Unix time it belongs to) is one seed, the other seed is the number of wallets in the system. So it's not a UBI system, because the system doesn't try to make sure to send tokens to everyone. It tries to make the distribution process verifiable.Since the token generation process is stable regardless of how many wallets there are, the bot problem should not be as worrisome. But that's why there is a flat fee for each transaction.If every bot creates a thousand wallets, they reduce the chance of getting a token at all, and also need at least two tokens because of the flat fee of one.The problem I am trying to solve is the unstable processing time of decentralized coins and the processing fee without requiring proof of work or proof of stake, while at the same time being transparent and having a token distribution process without arbitrary requirements.",
