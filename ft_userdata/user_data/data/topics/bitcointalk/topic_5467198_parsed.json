  "content": "This is a noob question! I downloaded the wallet on my Mac Book today, installed and then created a new wallet. While creating I saw that it showed me, Wallet = default_wallet. I did not understand earlier but later on I realized it meant wallet name. Now, that I have created a wallet, I would like to change this name. My question is how to do it? I do not see any option within the wallet that allows me to do it. I thought of changing the file extension but I concluded that it might corrupt the file.What can I do now? Should I create a new wallet or can I still change the name?Thanks.",
