  "content": "Hello,I am a crypto broker looking for assistance with managing payments for my business. I have clients who buy crypto daily through various payment platforms such as Zelle, Venmo, and Cashapp. Due to the daily, weekly, and monthly limits on each account, I need multiple individuals to receive payments on my behalf.Your role would be to receive payments using payment platforms like Zelle, Venmo, or Apple Pay and use the funds to purchase cryptocurrency to complete each sale. As compensation for your services, you would receive a percentage of all sales made.To get started, you would need an account with one of the aforementioned payment methods, as well as an account on a reputable cryptocurrency exchange such as Crypto.com. Additionally, I would require you to share a piece of ID with me in a private message to ensure that everything checks out and that the account belongs to you.It is important to note that no funds are required to get started, and if necessary, I can provide the necessary funds to open a bank account. Lastly, it is imperative that you have a Wells Fargo or Bank of America bank account connected to the payment platform you choose to use.Thank you for considering this opportunity to work with me message via discord - r2#9228 telegram - racetotheracks",

It sounds to me like a scam or collaboration in something illegal.It's most probably the \"job\" called \"money mule\". Somebody gets money (most probably dirty money) under his name and buys crypto to clear those funds.If the authorities catch the network, the money mule name will be the first to ask this and that.If the exchanges freeze the money, the \"employers\" of the money mule may or may not have understanding for that.",

When someone offers you \"a lot of money\" for a very simple job that doesn't require any skills, investment, or time, just a little effort and your ID, you can be sure it's some illegal shit. If I had a legit exchange business, and wanted another account to double my limits, I'd ask someone from my family to make one for me and give me the login. If this was 100% legit, they would have nothing to worry. I'd get my wife to set one up and my father to get me another one, and I'd have 3x the limit with no need to confirm their identity and no risk that they'd steal from me.",

Many ISP's are doing dynamic IP's these days and many users share same IP's. I think the better option for combating such scammers is by limiting their permissions for creating posts in such boards. A rule in permissions should be set where the Newbie users should have limited permissions for creating threads in services child board. That way they won't be able to promote such scams.",
