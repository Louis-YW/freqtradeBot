  "content": "Another new crypto casino, where each player should be QA and report bugs to them.Casinos topic - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5465749.0This scam accusation was created because the casino won't close an account due to gambling addiction. It extremely hurts players like me. Because If I have a successful withdrawal in a casino, I'll dep there big sums soon and lose them. So this is their tactic - nobody can be self-excluded from their casinos. Why I think this is SCAM and huge RED FLAG:1) Their statement that you can self-exclude by yourself:https://i.gyazo.com/3b7793e99103f4d3064996f678dbfcb6.png2) You have that option but only for 24 hours - if you want more, you should wait that period and follow the link in the email. It looks like:https://i.gyazo.com/c26b0c33899f2d53636ffd1736b04b05.pngSo after cooling-off period, I played in that casino again. And in few hours followed that link but OOPS - doesn't work anymore. Another casino with technical glitches.https://i.gyazo.com/54c711d6d94a3e71de713b1d2528a1fb.mp43) Their tech support (not ordinary support) told that it'll be fixed in few days. In a few days, I can't confirm even 24-hours cooling-off period:https://i.gyazo.com/84606414ba7d9296e5ca69cfb50f6523.pngSo in the casino's opinion, I should give a damn about my self-exclusion and help them to do everything to fix that.For people who telling that this is not scam. IT IS SCAM, just look for some guy's complaining about same issue. But he lost his money already:https://casino.guru/coins-game-casino-player-s-account-was-not-closed",

I thought players create scam accusation only if some platform confiscate their winnings and deposits or freeze their accounts. You can clearly see that they have a technical error and may need some time to fix it. But you are creating a scam accusation thread instead of cooperating with them. For now, try to stay away if possible and create another ticket requesting to close your account. I hope they will take care of it. @Little Mouse may be able to help you as well.

Casinos should follow all of the rules, not a few ones.I tried to self-exclude right after winning - didn't work out. I played again and won. Tried to self-exclude again. Didn't work out. Now in a few days, I'm trying to do that again. I know where it goes. As I have wide gambling experience. Don't gamble if you can't control yourself. - I got it, you are not a gambler. Don't give any tips to us, gamblers if you are not aware of what is gambling at all.",

Every casino on the market want their players to lose money and that's why they make profit. Right? Closing player's account is the easiest thing to do. It doesn't require rocket-science and a bunch of code just to close a player's account. They got that function in their white-label whatsoever platform. Well, from my experience in gambling in over 50 casinos, only shady casinos have issues with closing players' accounts. For example, Stake, BC.Game, Bitcasino and other big crypto casinos were able to block my account in a matter of minutes. Because they respect their players and care about reputation.",

Nothing new. For now I can't even self-exclude myself for 24-hours, as their system glitched. And all new links that I create are already expired. I won't quit gambling, but that saves from losing big sums of money. For example, If I never self-excluded myself from Stake, Bitstarz, Bitcasino, BC Game, I could lose there a really big sums of money and do bad things for life such as selling car, etc. Instead, when I'm playing in new, shitty casinos, I lose like 300-600 usdt/month. When I win in that casinos, I'll dep more in next month, so self-excluding is my way to prevent losing money.",
