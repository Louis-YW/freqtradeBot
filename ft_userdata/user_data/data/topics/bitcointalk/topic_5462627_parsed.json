Wel  During this situation, what are you thinking and how you preparing for next bull run?  Which Altcoins you are planning to be hold untill next bull run? My plan is to hold the layer 1 and layer 2 tokens for the next bull run. Also, try to get some profits from during that time. Because we don't know the exact ATH.Eg : Layer 1 =>  Sui, Sei Layer 2 => OP, ARB",

I guess this will be a great investment still despite how much it made the investor bleed since the last bull run. It disappoints the haters thinking it will actually die eventually but still kicking to this day. Unless you think another meme will come out, then you can still ignore SHIB.

There are lot of it, I'm into Base chain right now and holding some altcoins out there and I'm sure with Coinbase as one of the leaders in this industry, I think they have few percentage to fail and will likely this will be the chain that will make most millionaires in the bull run.

Perhaps it will be tomorrow or maybe in the halving of Bitcoin which for me is still a long time.But I am solid to keep my Ethereum and BNB. I don't think those two should be sold even after the bull run because that's when FOMO will come and some investors will still be risking for a purchase and expect some short-term returns. XRP seems to be a good choice too. I mean, a lot of good things had happened to them and one bull run could change it all to bring them back on top.",

Wel  During this situation, what are you thinking and how you preparing for next bull run?  Which Altcoins you are planning to be hold untill next bull run? Investing in new projects is no longer profitable it is better to avoid new projects even if you expect a 100x return in a bearish market it is still difficult to see a successful project in the market when listing or it may not even last long.When the bullrun comes all altcoins will increase because the market growth continues to soar, but to see the percentage of the increase is still unclear, I think it is enough to invest in altcoins that are solid in the sense that they are at the top of the marketcap then it has the potential to rise more sharply when the rally comes.",
