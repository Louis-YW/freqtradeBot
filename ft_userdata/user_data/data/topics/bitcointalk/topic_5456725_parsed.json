You will have me there.For once I agree with you.Quote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 07:03:00 AMAre you saying I like it so much or I said it somewhere (about like and dislike)?It was sarcasm. Quote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 07:03:00 AMMake sure you are using appropriate reference for it. Why not create a new topic to make a proper reference? Why wait?Let me guess, you are going to have a meeting with your friends and then all of you will come together at once with your BS arguments.FYI I have no friends on the forum, I never contacted any of your clients via Telegram, and I haven't had Telegram installed for a while. And no, I'm not going to conspire with some \"friends\", I simply want to see what people I have in consideration of the forum say about this topic before I leave the tag and proper reference it. That you not only employ naim027 but you boast about it. Quote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 07:03:00 AMI am conducting an dependent business and right now I have many clients and forum members who participated my campaigns, they will rate me. If I ask a group to rate my business then I don't think overall it will bring a bad rating if not 5 out of 5 (although you tried many times in the past to approach my clients and convinced them not to hire my service because you have low moral).So what do you care about my tags?Quote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 05:46:59 AMDo you think I give a shit?Yes, I do think you give a shit, because it's been a while since you last came to this section and today you appeared defending an alleged team behind which was John Abraham (naim027) from 2020 to 2021, and naim027 from 2021 until supposedly a month ago, just after I tagged the account. Besides, behind that account they only need one person, unlike they want make us believe, look at the post history and you will see that they publish one post a week at the most.Then, after appearing to plead the case, it turns out that you are in the same case, not only at CasinoCritique, but in your team, and you boast about it.Besides, as much as you want to deny it, the ultimate responsible behind CasinoCritique is you, as you told me and many others on what you call \"confidential information\".",

Not exactly a crime but a clear violation of the rules. I mean, when naim027 was banned for plagiarism, not only ban evaded with his alts AnotherAlt, Crypt0S0ul, also with Paradice.in account Cratoon.Not talking about any of the accounts but in general.How interesting to read it that your brain is malfunctioning!That official account of Paradice.in is not someone personal property. It's representing a business. If any account of that business is ban then we can consider other accounts (if available) of the business were ban evading. An employee is not the business, a business is not the employee.Royse777 is my personal account and CasinoCritique is the business account representing the project casinocritique.com (handled by other members too). For some reason if Royse777 is banned, how many will say CasinoCritique is ban evading? There can be another situation too. For some reasons if the casinocritique account receives a temp ban then do you think Royse777 will ban evading?Where do you see I am defending anyone? As I said you are malfunctioning. Fix yourself and stop twisting your tongue.Back to your main concern - Quote from: Royse777 on June 18, 2023, 07:03:00 AMI don't have to tell you who I am employing, when I am employing. I am conducting an dependent business and right now I have many clients and forum members who participated my campaigns, they will rate me. If I ask a group to rate my business then I don't think overall it will bring a bad rating if not 5 out of 5 (although you tried many times in the past to approach my clients and convinced them not to hire my service because you have low moral).Edit: Maybe I need to calculate the potential lose I had because of you when approaching my clients and convincing some of them not to hire me. Then base on the calculation, I need to create a flag (perhaps type 1) and ask the community to support it. Because the truth is, you harmed my business and who knows you are still trying to harm my business.",

Thank you for having me.It'd save a lot of angst and echo chamber frothing at the mouth if the OP just locked this thread - both are what I would call lost causes.  (The OP and their accused)Instead of clicking \"reply\" why not just let it go?",

Fix yourself and stop twisting your tongue.Apparently either it is not my brain that is malfunctioning, or if it is malfunctioning it is not the only one. Regarding the issue at hand, I have thought about it carefully, and I believe that Cratoon, which is managed by only one person in the forum, that is naim027, at least until recently and maybe he is still managing it, is not the same case as you have him as one of your employees updating spreadsheets.So no, I am not going to leave you a red tag because, actually, I don't think there is trading risk with you today. You manage a lot of campaigns and you do currency exchange from time to time. I'm not going to do like you who have a tag on my profile that you admit is in a grey area.

Because the truth is, you harmed my business and who knows you are still trying to harm my business.Regarding this, first: have you noticed that our discussions are of no interest to anyone?  And second, I'm going to repeat it for the umpteenth time. I have never contacted any client of yours, and if I had, I would have told you to your face then and now.Fine, create the flag if you want, but my prediction is that it's going to attract as much interest as this thread. And the logical thing to do will be for reasonable people on the forum to tell you to stop stirring it up.",
