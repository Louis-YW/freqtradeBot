  "content": "I am curious to know if (and how much) Bitcoin is adopted in low- and middle-income countries.I am reading the Bitcoin Magazine (Issue 24 - The El Salvador Issue).Here are some stats, according to the magazine:The global average cost of sending $200 remained high at 6.5% - or $13, in 2020.In Sub-Saharan Africa, the average cost of sending $200 was 8.2% in 2020.Sending money from Japan to Brazil cost 11.5% in remittance costs in 20201 out of 9 people on the planet depend on remittances sent by migrant workers to support their families.According to these, do you feel like Bitcoin has helped? Do you use it to avoid all those remittance costs?",

Do you use it to avoid all those remittance costs?Yes I would say the ease of bitcoin transfer during cross border transactions has actually been the biggest flex of bitcoin against other traditional means of exchange. Aside the charges which as you pointed out is very low when compared fiat, another advantage again is the lack of limitations on using bitcoin, if you use fiat through banks you have daily or monthly limit for the transfer or better still the charges is in batches based on amount to be sent and not uniform like that of bitcoin, and this sometimes frustrating for an average citizen in this middle- incoming countries. Another thing that drive adoption aside remittances in this countries is the continuous devaluation of their currencies in high rate.

This is also true. I wonder though, how much time it takes to send a traditional remittance from a country to another. I have never sent one, so...Cheaper and faster?Probably about the same, Some remittance fees differ depending on the country. Now sending Fiat money is easier using the E-Wallet App and is sent instantly on business days.The fee varies around $7-$20 $3-$11 depending on the current exchange rate and the destination country chosen. But the advantages of using crypto, all can be done instantly, the sending fee is lower (if there is no spike in transactions) and all can be done anonymously, without any identity. But the obstacle at the moment is that those who work abroad don't really understand Bitcoin or crypto, they prefer to send through banks and some supported E-Wallets. The lack of crypto knowledge hinders real adoption.",

If the country is still quite close it will be cheaper, but when sending to European countries such as the US, it requires a fairly expensive cost and a long waiting schedule.  There is also a limit for each money transfer that will be made. It is not more efficient than Bitcoin and Bitcoin is certainly still cheaper.Here's a comparison of the fees and how long it will take for the money to arrive, The name of the app is \"Flip\"",

Even if the transaction is less costly than the commonly used bank system.So to answer your question it must be said that bitcoin is better option for all people from low class and middle class income country to people. But if you talk about remittance cost, remittance cost is given by the government of a country as a percentage of income. Accordingly, if the government brings any currency as remittance from a foreign country by evading taxes, it will be considered as black money by that government. Correct me if I misunderstood your question. Among the countries where cryptocurrency is legal, many countries levy a large amount of tax on income from cryptocurrency, which is a different matter.",
