Africans have had a lot of negative life experience with state issued fiat. Their typical economic situation is one where they search for alternatives.I suspect a high percentage of africa's population are also unbanked demographics. Their success story with cryptocurrencies trends with claims of 4 billion unbanked in the world. Crypto doing well in africa could be a double whammy of history conspiring with the unbanked to create a perfect storm of crypto mass adoption. If inflation around the world continues to rise, it is possible we will see an uptrend to these metrics. People will seek alternatives to fiat and inflation. Which could drive them into embracing crypto markets and other alt assets.",

The information is not far from the fact that Nigerian youth are well informed about cryptocurrency. The economic hardship is even the more reason that the youth don't need to rely on the government for survival and they have to source their living through the new age of generational technology. We know all that online businesses are thriving not only bitcoin trading or crypto but many other businesses exist online.",

      "body": "Sure Bitcoin is better than some of the weakest fiat currencies in the world that experience hyperinflation, but on its own Bitcoin is not a good foundation for a country's economy. A currency needs to be stable in order to have a prosperous economy. If a currency jumps up or down by tens of percents every month, it's impossible to do business planning. And there are technical problems like scalability, dependence on Internet connection and electronic devices, no way to return stolen or lost funds, etc. So, in case of Africa Bitcoin is not a long-term solution, but more of a band-aid.",

Bitcoin and all other altcoins are just a method of exchange. They do not magically make your life easy or provide you with a free source of money that can sustain your day to day living. All of the supposed economic benefits are equally applicable towards any currency, they are certainly not unique to cryptocurrency. While it may have some useful purposes in places like Africa, where the banking system is perhaps a bit fragmented and can be hard to access, let's not pretend it is going to bring people a revenue source out of nowhere.",

I mean who would want to take out bag full of stash and ask shopkeeper to give a chocolate bar in exchange that. Obviously that is heart breaking for them and the Government itself to use their own fiat. Sadly, they can’t bring up the prices against dollar because it would take lot of development in the nation, business establishments, e-commerce going up and what not. But Nigeria does not seem to be in position to do that. They are in hyper hyperinflation.",

A value of 0 indicates a location where there was not enough data for this term.Note: A higher value means a higher proportion of all queries, not a higher absolute query count. So a tiny country where 80% of the queries are for \"bananas\" will get twice the score of a giant country where only 40% of the queries are for \"bananas\".As for the numbers,  I've already mentioned, stopped looking at only the percentages you're liking:Clickbaitish title:Crypto users in Africa grew by 2,500% in 2021Reality is hidden in the content:QuoteThe number of crypto transactions in Africa constitutes roughly 2.8% of global volumesQuote from: Fortify on August 07, 2022, 07:21:21 AMThe two graphics you presented, while very interesting, have absolutely zero to do with the premise of the thread which is \"resisting economy hardship\".

What do you mean by \"balanced economy\"? It has been proven that cryptocurrencies cannot guarantee zero inflation. Inflation will always exist. It doesn't matter if it's crypto or fiat.3.Cryptocurrencies cannot help in reducing the poverty and increasing the GDP.

Moreover government will have a difficult time paying off it's foreign debts because it'll have to buy bitcoin from its earnings to pay it off. I don't know how will economy get stronger just by this change.I appreciate your question, if we give it a look from the first approach with engaging the use of bitcoin in the economy in relation to that of fiat currency, we could see that the banks can have in possession all your finances with little or no interest on it, they can freeze an account at anytime, but bitcoin has created more opportunities for a rescue way from the financial institutions and government by going decentralized, more opportunities comes in with trading bitcoin and i believe traders can attest to that, there's a great benefits miners derived when they got a reward for solving complex mathematical equations using PoW in which an average talented and skillful person couldn't have been given such an opportunity to exercise his potentials and abilities by banks despite his assets with them, no gain or benefit that comes out from this institutions.Employment opportunities, when you look at many young adults between the age of 18 to 45 years old, you would discover they were all on the look for an alternative to banking system and government policy, this is what exactly bitcoin has come in with as a solution, privacy, security, trust, reliability, immutability, decentralization all with our finances, Satoshi could have sat down and thought about this all while ago on countless occasions before he successfully introduced bitcoin in 2009, bitcoin cannot be affected by inflation because when you buy bitcoin today and after 2 to 5 years you will never regret buying it, forget about volatility, that remains constant but here there's high tendencies that bitcoin will rise up beyond your purchasing rate when you first set in, here history should speak better.the exchange market in bitcoin price is what many of our youth take proper cognisance to in making profits, they involve in p2p trading and make their interest aside the long term investment, what has the fiat institutions created in their system, one of the job i will never recommend a person to is a banking job, because they don't last, i use the word cryptocurrency from the topic because we still have some that have made it through with altcoins despite the high risk involved, moreso come to think of it this way, bitcoin has more applications than any for of asset which only has one way use of application, here bitcoin can be traded, investment as assets for store of value, use for making payments, it has no barriers tied to nationale meaning its decentralized unlike other currencies, have you also consider the numbers of industries that uses the blockchain in which is the basis of bitcoin network for their own interest as well just because of it immutability and decentralization unlike the centralized internet storage service providers like google drive, dropbox, etc. In addition i strongly believe in this:Quote from: amishmanish on August 07, 2022, 09:00:18 AMYes crypto is an way of resisting hardships.

Majority of videos about troubleshooting a pc and a phone are from them and many other countries are thankful for them because their solutions are easy to understand and works like a charm compared to those videos from other countries. What I only dislike about them is that some knowledgeable people from this country uses their knowledge in bad things like for scamming.Not just small time but big time. This is why their reputation are also affected and when someone heard Nigeria or Nigerian, the first thing that can come to their mind is those big time scamming which have happened on the past.",

Since covid till now Pakistan faces hyperinflation, Srilanka is insolvent, and Bangladesh is also on the way to meeting the same consequences. Southeast Asia is one of the most densely populated places on the earth where most people use technology every day.
