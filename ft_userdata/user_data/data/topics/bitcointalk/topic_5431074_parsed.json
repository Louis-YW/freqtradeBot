Theres likely a possibility we can even go mega bull mode starting 2023 (given the massive bull div on weekly candles). However, just stay safu during periods of fomc meetings and cpi dates, otherwise it will always be smooth to trade. Elon's words mean nothing to me",

To be honest there are possibilities that BTC might fall or there are heavy possibilities that Bitcoins will rise. What we can do is just estimate and predict according to that. Moreover 90% of the Bitcoin holders don’t care about Elon Musk’s prophecy. I mean before Elon Musk, they were still believing in Bitcoins and will continue to do it so. Bitcoin always follow the 4 year cycle pattern. So definitely something good is coming very soon. Just don’t lose your patience and hope.",

I thought he was mostly making bad cars and manipulating his company stock and other assets through his twitter account.Elon Musk is not an authority on the global economy. His opinion does not mean much. If you want to invest ... spend some time for your economy and history eduction and unfollow Elon Musk (AKA tHE Great market manipulator).",

It will take a longtime that is but the time is only short now because we are almost to 2023 and the bear \"winter\" can't go more than the next halving in 2024. If going by history of bitcoin, it is normal. In 2018 it is the same so Elon musk can't influence bitcoin price, we know the circle is 4 years to buy now is better soon bull rally will start without the winter.",

I don’t envisage any scenario where bitcoin pumps. You are talking about 2024/25 until we see the next bull market. In short, 2023 is likely to see a bottom formed, potentially a capitulation event which confirms a cycle bottom. We will then start to recover & end 2023 above $30,000 if we’re lucky. No all time high until late 2024 though, maybe delayed until Q1 or Q2 2025.",

Now, in this case, it is Elon Musk who said that he is a person who is very well known in the business space, but you also need to know that what he said still has the possibility of going wrong so you don't need to feel disappointed when what he said at this point is not occur as predicted when the time comes.",
