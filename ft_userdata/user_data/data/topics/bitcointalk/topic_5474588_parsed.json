It'll be fun, I swear.  Yeah, lightning won't work on multi-sig. The point of a multi-sig wallet is the security gained from not having all required private keys in one device. But, lightning requires you to sign commitment transactions (which use inputs from the locked funds) and be online at all times (e.g., for signing a potential penalty transaction). I'm struggling to imagine how it'd work in a multi-sig wallet, especially if we consider the fact that locked funds are locked to multi-sig in the first place!There is also this explanation: https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/97123/134811.",

I wanted to check their paid service but it seems for their paid service for each a transaction they charge over $200 LOL. I don't see no point to spend that much.The paid service is really as high as one can't imagine; instead of spending that much on acceleration service, one will just have to double his fee from the payment side and make sure their transaction fee is a bit higher, which usually could just cost about $30-$50 for a transaction as large as the ones you use to send, which can just take a few minutes or hours for them to get confirmed. Then again, let me ask about the $200 of their fee charge. Is it for a single transaction or is it a life or annual charge that, after that one-time payment, you will not have to pay again for the rest of the month or year?",

(Probably not, unless they are getting desperate).Yes the free service for ViaBTC acceleration will not work due to size and even the paid service is something that I don’t think will be cost effective, because most of all this paid accelerators are expensive than regular transactions fees (although I don’t know of this period) Also the CPFP will not be visible for any of the receiving addresses because of how high the fees will be when trying to cover up for the parent transaction",
