Don't do this in Google Sheets, I'm doing this as an example.You can do this on any PC that is disconnected from the Internet1. Write our seed phrase in this order2.Find word position in BIP39 word list: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt3.We need to get 4 digits. In lines with less than 4 digits, we add the required number of 0s at the beginning to make 4 digits4.Combine all the digits into 1 large number and we get 48 digits.141417021419067202161027060618531302116419490515   5.Split this number into groups of 6 digits   141417   021419   067202   161027   060618   531302   116419   490515    6.A sequence number must be added to each group.You can use a different step, for example 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07  or 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14  or 00 03 09 .... and so on, but the main thing is not to forget this step. This is necessary when decoding and the important thing is that the colors do not need to be stored in a certain order, because the sequence number is encrypted in the color. I use 00 02 04 06 08 10 12 14  to make the colors as distinct as possible.7.Next, convert the resulting 8-digit numbers to hexadecimal8.If we have a 5-digit value, then add 0 in front8.Now finally, after a lot of work, you can add colors to your table.9. To check, you can use a converter and check the result. Use the script on a computer that is not connected to the Internet.#022869 #1ED82B #3E0F82 #5E0283 #7AFECA #A0B1E6 #B8E1C3 #DD1B93https://enteropositivo.github.io/bip39colors/#colorstobip39compares phrase seedradar start rally fault brain leopard entry travel pencil multiply vicious doctor___I'm tired for today, if you're interested, I'll show you in the same format how to decipher colors in Excel.This is a very simple and safe way to store your seed phrase.

      "body": "QuoteColors are everywhereBIPColors gives you an additional layer of obfuscation because colors are widely present in various sources such as website source code, color palettes used by artists, images, and more. And it's not as obvious as finding a piece of paper with 12 words making them undetectable to hackers or thieves. Problem number one - these colors are not standard, a fixed number of non-standard colors used together is already an easy to spot pattern. There more people use this method, the more hackers will look for this pattern. It's even trivial to write an algorithm that will analyze colors and find sets of these random colors and convert them back to seed.Problem number two - colors can get corrupted. You draw a picture with these colors, save it in a lossy format, upload it somewhere and it might shift colors and render the seed unrecoverable.I'm sure there's a lot of problems with this, like the most basic rule that there's no security by obscurity.",

It adds multiple steps of unnecessary complexity, where the mistyping of a single character could render your back up useless and mean you lose all your coins. You cannot save or print any images using the colors, since a change in format may change the color, and printing and scanning it back in will definitely change the color. This means you are limited to either backing it up electronically which is unsafe, or writing down the hex codes, which defeats the entire point and is riskier than just writing down a seed phrase.In short, don't use this.
