The threat is to centralized businesses like crypto exchanges, not crypto.And there are always decentralized alternatives to what crypto exchanges can offer you. Like Bisq or Defi for example.If anything, the over-regulation is going to kill off the centralized end-points and I consider this a good thing in the long term. We need a more decentralized ecosystem that cannot be touched by any single entity.Also, you are confusing privacy for anonymity. A public ledger like a blockchain is not meant to be anonymous. It is meant to give everyone full transparency and control over their money.As far as XMR and similar coins go, this kind of anonymity does not matter because fiat is far more anonymous and far easier to use for commiting financial crimes like money laundering.",

While major crypto companies would like to make the space feel less private by working with the regulators. However I think more clear regulations might actually move to legitimize crypto and maybe even open doors for more privacy focused projects. I am just trying to be more positive here, since It's not all black and white. The future of privacy very well could be a factor of how these regulations will keep on evolving. Crypto isn't dead regarding privacy, it's in survival mode. Whether this survives will be due to innovation and how the community innovates.",

I always like to read the following post by o_e_l_e_o when the subject is CBDCs:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on April 13, 2020, 01:48:14 PMQuote from: davis196 on April 13, 2020, 12:32:50 PMThe central bank can still \"produce\" any amount of new money(digital or paper-it doesn't matter) and throw it to the banks.Exactly. In fact, moving to a purely digital currency will make it even easier for them to do so. Such a currency makes sense for the banks - easier to control, easier to print, cheaper to manage, no need for printing presses and similar, no money spent on fighting counterfeit notes, etc. It doesn't make sense for the user though, and it will be a privacy nightmare. We already know we can't trust governments with our data, and that they spy on us, monitor us, profile us. A currency like this will also tell the government exactly how much money you own and exactly what you spend it on. All privacy will go out the window.I also worry about how a government could use this against people it deems \"unsavory\". We already know there are centralized crypto scams like EOS which can freeze your accounts and seize your coins if you do something they don't like. Why would a CBDC be any different? Criticize the government too much and you might just find you can no longer access your money...I think this post explains it very well.",
