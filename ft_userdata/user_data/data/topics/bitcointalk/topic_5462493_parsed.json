      "body": "Yes, I saw that nobody is giving me big loan. So I involved myself mining and earned a bit like 50 USDT converting BTC. Also I am a coder. I can code for metatrader indicator. Also have learnt forex quite well. But due to the shortage of fund I am not being able to do forex trading. So, after carefully thinking and calculating I am asking for loan. NB: You mentioned no work which is your misconception. I will invest my full time during this period.",

N2.   I have asked for help of 150 USDT.  Now tell me what type of security do you want to get? I definately want to say that you will ask for fee or colleteral. Now tell me - what is the security of this colleteral?Remember one thing. I am in needy. I need 150 USDT. I asked this sum to those person who had much. Say for an example, I have 50 USDT. So 0.00005 USDT is less for me. If anybody ask for this sum to me for help or invest or loan, I can take risk trusting him or her. If required I could investicate his or her investing area practically.Remember another thing - I am not asking loan like you scammer. I remember your name in facebook. It was same who scammed 25 USDT from me. I thing everythng is clear to you.",
