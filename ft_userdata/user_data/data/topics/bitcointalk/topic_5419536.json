Well, obviously, most casino accepting cryptocurrencies made an ANN thread here and runs signature campaign later on because their target users are mainly came from here, so i will say yes. Bitcoin gambling and crypto gambling subreddit are nothing compare the users/topics/discussion on the gambling board. Well, in fact bitcointalk gambling boards shows at as first rank in first page  when searching google using this keyword \"crypto gambling forum\" and \"bitcoin gambling forum\".",

I think there are many more people that use crypto for gambling than for buying stuff or transferring wealth.And It is not a bad thing or a fault of the crypto. People simply love gambling. If there was another choice, people would use that too. Right now nothing beats crypto when it comes to gambling. It is fast, almost anonymous and reliable.",

      "body": "Let's start with the fact that not all signature campaigns are casinos. From time to time there's an altcoin signature and there are some unpaid campaigns or campaigns where you advertise the manager and he shares profits with you... There used to be a few mixer campaigns but those other mixers got scared of possible legal action against them. It's not that only casinos want to use this form of advertising but there are some entities that actively fight crypto businesses and casinos mostly managed to avoid these attacks.

If there's a framework in place more businesses will pop up and decide to advertise. They will for sure. Altcoins usually flood the forum in bull market and get quiet in bear.",

      "body": "One main reason I see is because crypto casinos are popping off literally almost everywhere every single day. It's hard to make your brand recognized without some form of advertising like signature campaigns. Bitcointalk is like the main hub for all things crypto and bitcoin, and once you get the word out from here, there is a huge possibility that your platform will be referred to another people of which the referral will come from here. Previously signature campaigns were dominated by ICOs and IEOs and all that stuff during the boom of those things, but eventually, the gambling campaigns outnumber them just because gambling is the same old story but with always a different face and a different feel for them.",

A lot of ICOs that are well advertised don't make profits for a long time and a lot that are poorly advertised need to be timed well so people probably exited because of that.I also remember bitmixer and yobit seemed quite easy to enter which also took up a lot of signature space here for a while - they might also have had some role in deterring coinmakers and other companies from competing here - a 3 month ico campaign you have to be accepted into over a quick copy and paste task is probably not going to convince people to wait to be accepted.",

If not for the gambling sites that are advertising their services on this forum, this forum traffic would have reduced. Bitcointalk is a bitcoin forum, but we can also say it is a gambling forum because most of the campaigns belong to gambling sites, but that does  not change that this forum is a bitcoin forum, the best you can get about bitcoin is from this forum. I do not think altcoins can be like before, there can be some campaigns during bull run, but it seems more that gambling will dominate for long. The days of altcoins dominance is over.",

On the other hand, we could see more campaigns potentially pay altcoins similar to how BK8 shifted their payments from BTC to Tether.",

I appreciate that they are the longest running altcoin campaign in this forum and I am sure that the project will get good feedback from the impact of that campaign. But it is difficult for altcoin campaigns/bounties to grow again because most altcoins from projects are not legal, and now many top new projects are changing promotion patterns to provide incentives for participants to take tesnet, feedback, swaps and more. So it seems that many members are hunting to become part of the gambling campaign because of the weekly payouts and the long-term running of the campaign.",
