The price of Luna has been decreasing most among the top 15 cryptocurrencies, Luna dropped to 42nd. Luna should be regarded as a shit coin but Binance listed it because it was not a shit coin before as its marketcap got to over $30 billion but now at $2 billion. A coin with that large marketcap of 2 billion now can not still be regarded as shit coin though but the price dropped significantly.",

You should have known by now that you can't always bank on altcoins for investment purpose, if you didn't, you do now. Not trying to justify binance, but they can't be blamed if a coin that was doing well and was approved by them for listing suddenly performs poorly.",

If something is listed on Binance, it is tied to the price of Bitcoin using bots. So if the price of BTC goes down, your favorite coin will go down too, regardless of fundamentals. The best thing you can do is buy something and hold it long term. If it has staking, better still. I'm holding ICP and NEAR, which have staking and XRP that does not. Besides, ICP has an 8% higher APY then UST ever had.",

During the larger liquidations due to the macro-market volatility, UST fell down to as low as $0.60 yesterday which sparked a major sell-off in LUNA and resulted in one of the biggest price crashes in LUNA’s history.This is something beyond Binance's control and you should do your research if the market is crashing or pumping there's always a reason for this.",

I don't think with how many people got scam from this coin ever bought on higher price and right now have bad thing see their assets drop drastically. Any chance based on your opinion with Luna coin back to the top price, maybe reach above $20 again? or developer have run away and not responsibility again before Luna coin delisting from Binance.",
