You can see it here if bitgert has been trading in so many exchange site include kucoin exchange site. https://coinmarketcap.com/id/currencies/bitrise-token/markets/That means if bitgert was not a scam but it's just a garbage token with no voluma. The volume is pretty small compared with another token in the market. Since bitgert was creating a new blockchain and its price is very bad. It's not a scam coin but it's garbage coin. I remember when so many bitgert shills were flooding this section with so many advertising threads for bitgert.",

      "body": "Choosing a project for investment includes not being scam, as your investment in any scam project means losing your money, but also the fact that Bitgert is not a scam does not mean that it is a good investment. - Search for the developer team, are there photos or not, if there are photos, are there personal data or not, if there are no photos or the developer team is unknown and there is no necessary reason for them to be anonymous, do not invest in them. - Read the white paper. Is its data unique, or is it copied and pasted from the Internet. - Does the currency have a good future plan, is there continuous development, is the demand limits limited, or are there a lot of tokens that are printed and burned.These are general indications that if the currency fails, it is not good for investment, and practices such as theft of images, plagiarism, and the possibility of controlling tokens indicate that it is scam.",

If we are playing to invest, then it’s better we invest in bitcoin, and if we want to invest in some altcoins which I don’t really encourage, then we should go for coins with high trading volumes and must be available on almost all reputable exchanges, but trading pump and dump coin is really a bad idea which I will recommend we all stop that.",

Is this a scam project?Please give your opinions honestly and briefly.Thank you.Here you need to do research, study the project, look at tokenomics, and most importantly understand where half of the tokens are now and how and for how long the second half of the tokens will be unlocked. Then look at the investors and the ecosystem.And I don't like this datahttps://defillama.com/chain/BitgertThere are a lot of competitors similar Chains now, you can invest if you have studied the project well and are confident in development.",
