The more responses you get or your name is called, the higher your points in this category.It doesn't work like that, there's a calculation you can check it yourself on BPIP, so it has nothing to do how many people mentioned your username, but the more people leave you positive feedback, it will increase one of the parameter.Quote from: https://bpip.org/Most Recognized is calculated using:1000 - ((Activity Rank + Trust Rank + Earned Merit Rank) / 3).Anyway congratulations @shasan for reaching Legendary rank, I hope you will reach Double Legendary rank in near future",
