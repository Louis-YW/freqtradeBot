However, always stay alert for possible phishing attempts, make sure your software comes from trustworthy places, and protect your mobile device if you connect via Bluetooth. This is because even though hardware wallets provide robust security, it's important to remain watchful to protect your Bitcoin holdings. Kudos on the journey",

Is there any Keystone user on here? What's your user experience so far? Mine is Keystone 3 pro I don’t know much about this hardware wallet but here is a thread by dkbit98 on this particular Keystone 3 pro hardware wallet you can simply ask your question there. In the upgrade of firmware I think both the usb and SD card are same, if you’re insinuating on catching any malware, make to use an old offline device at least. But AFAIK the private key which is the most important thing stored on the hardware wallet is not transferred when the card or USB is plugged in. Another advice is, do not rely totally on this hardware wallet device, make sure to back up your seed phrase in case there is loss or damage to the device most especially since it is a touch screen sensitive a fall could cause its damage, but with your seed phrase backed up properly (best offline) you can recover the wallet on another device.",

If I start using software wallet on my hardware wallet does it add more to it's security? Or it's a bad idea? Yes, in order to improve security, software wallets can be linked to hardware wallets. The two wallets work well together to secure your assets and keys, and some software wallet providers suggest using their products in addition to hardware wallets for optimal security. Read quote belowQuoteLuckily, even when you must use a software wallet, you can combine it with a hardware wallet to experience the best of both worlds. While the software wallet provides you access to the platform you want, your hardware wallet can protect your private keys and sign transactions offline. This way, you can easily access apps and services with the confidence your private keys are secure.  You can read more about software and hardware wallets and their connections here and here",

What's positive about this HW is that the hardware and software are open source (so they claim on the official website), and that's certainly a good thing for anyone who doesn't want any surprises and some hidden features. What is most important for every HW is that it can create a seed in an offline environment, and that it can protect the user from clipboard malware in such a way that every user can always compare the addresses on the HW with the one in the user interface.What every user needs to pay the most attention to is actually the backup, which means that it is saved safely (not online or on a PC/smartphone), and preferably in more than one copy if possible in at least two different locations.",

Mine is Keystone 3 proThis is a good think you have buy and I always prefer users to buy the hardware and keep the hardware wallet in order to save themselves from the attack and from the software's even now a days there are many software's present through which users can take away the money for example the malicious software. Even though there should be very careful in all these while you are going to connect the wallet somewhere in which area you want to transfer some files.I'm personally using they wallet but it didn't creates problem for me till now because its security is up class and still I have suggested to my friends which are here and they are also using it because we are in crypto from more times and without this wallet there is more risk that may be the wallet in the mobile got hacked and we have already face these hacking problems many times before.",

Having a backup recovery seed is always a smart idea when it comes to cryptocurrency wallets, no matter what kind you use, and don't ever think that it's unnecessary.  Even hardware wallets, which are seen as very secure, can fail or get lost or stolen and  and if that happens but you don't have your recovery seed written down somewhere safe say bye-bye to your crypto funds. So do yourself a favor - take the few minutes it'll take to carefully write out your wallet recovery seed words and stash them somewhere secure like a safe deposit box.  That way if something happens to your hardware wallet device, you've still got access to your assets.  Dont take risks here - it's just not worth it.",
