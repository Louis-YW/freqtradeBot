Anyway, what do you think will be your main advantage over the other existing DEXs today? Initially, it is hard to get the liquidity of the trading pairs you would want to list. So do you think you can provide the liquidity needed for your traders to get the low commission?",

Anyway, what do you think will be your main advantage over the other existing DEXs today? Initially, it is hard to get the liquidity of the trading pairs you would want to list. So do you think you can provide the liquidity needed for your traders to get the low commission?First of all, I will tell you that we are a legitimate project. At the moment, our exchange is under development, it will be decentralized. We'll post development screenshots soon. Regarding your question, the advantage over other DEXs will be low fees and hassle-free deposits and withdrawals (no support involved). We will be able to provide sufficient liquidity to ensure low fees, moreover, we are not going to put a commission for trading on our exchange at all, because it will be completely decentralized.",

Therefore, a new account is always welcome. As for your link, yes, there may indeed be false positives, but I assure you that we have a clean project. Very soon we will post screenshots of the development of our exchange and you will see for yourself that we are a legitimate project.In the meantime, you can visit any of our threads on the forums.Code:https://www.emoneyspace.com/forum/index.php/topic,534702.0.htmlhttps://bitcoingarden.org/forum/index.php?topic=116798.new#newhttps://www.altcoinstalks.com/index.php?topic=266958.0https://carigold.com/forum/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.745926/https://mmo4me.com/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.443415/https://www.jackobian.com/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.152944/https://bitcoinforum.com/altcoin-announcements/(ann)-(tirex-coin)-(exchange)-(cryptonight(switching)tirex-network-bsc)/new/#newhttps://topgoldforum.com/topic/380170-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonightswitchingtirex-network-bsc/http://www.dreamteammoney.com/index.php?showtopic=699154https://exchangecurrencyzone.com/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.286056/https://exchangecurrencyzone.com/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.286056/https://forumbitcoin.co.id/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.158582/https://www.rolclub.com/advertising/3749540-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.htmlhttps://cryptotalk.org/topic/361982-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonightswitchingtirex-network-bsc/https://investsocial.com/forum/free-discussion/advertisement/17965887-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bschttps://www.earnlib.com/d/4870-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bschttps://www.mmopro.org/altcoin-announcement/40491-[ann]-[tirex-coin]-[exchange]-[cryptonight-switching-%7Ctirex-network%7C-bsc].htmlhttps://forum.cryptoff.org/index.php?/topic/24501-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonightswitchingtirex-network-bsc/https://thecryptocurrencyforums.com/community/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.4685/http://www.hyipstalk.com/threads/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-tirex-network-bsc.116271/https://www.cryptoforumtalk.com/thread-284.htmlhttp://www.digitalmoneytalk.com/topic/72018-ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonightswitchingtirex-network-bsc/https://www.pinoymoneytalk.com/forum/index.php?topic=68402.0https://steemit.com/ico/@icesaiah/ann-tirex-coin-exchange-cryptonight-switching-or-tirex-network-or-bschttps://hive.blog/bsc/@icesaiah/ann-tirexnetwork-decentralized-ecosystem-based-on-cryptonight",
