I'm running on windows 10 OS using Trex miner, pls helpThe 3070 Ti is a card with Gddr6x memory and if you cool it down properly you can get it to the average hash rate of 76-80 Mhsh.On Windows 10 if you use Lolminer it shows you all the details beside the card temperature also the memory temperature and if that temperature is high you need a better cooling and the high memory temperature can give you a couple of Mhsh less,there was a case when a person long before the 100% unlock was getting like 4-5 Mhsh less than he should but he was having a problem with high memory temperature and once he fixed it he got those mhsh-s that he was missing.",

I decided to never buy GDDR6X video cards again, and mine EPIC+SERO instead of ETH.Due to thermal limitations, some miners did not receive more than 90 megahash. At first it was 115 and then the hashrate dropped to 80 megahash. If you are a miner who buys an expensive video card and does not read the reviews of other miners, then great adventures await him. But you are very lucky, 105 megahash is good.",

If you do it yourself, you will have to solve many problems. Alternatively, you can choose an RTX 3070 Ti ( 80 mh) graphics card with a good cooling system, but they need to be kept in an open case at a distance of at least 20 centimeters from each other.",
