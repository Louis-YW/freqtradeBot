Keep in mind, you canâ€™t just go on a site and max bet TT or e sports. Obviously itâ€™s much better to mix it up with major sports and also lose a game here and there on purpose so you donâ€™t get limited.",

Any minimum betting amount? On what platform? Do you have any specifics or it depends on the users choice? After a win, what if the user don't share the percentage you are asking? Or is there anything a must to prevent of user doing that?And if a loss, what responsibility you will take regardless the amount bet?Are you open for middleman?",

However, I wouldnâ€™t waste my time for anything less than a few hundred as I have to pay a middle man already.Platform we can discuss in private. Thereâ€™s many.Each user must pay after the winning selection. User must also send proof of the bet with bet amount prior to the match beginning. If a user does not hold their end after a match is completed, they will be immediately cut off.We take 100% of the responsibility if a bet that is supposed to win, loses. However, we donâ€™t lose bets because we are only betting matches with inside information. As I stated above, we would lose a game here and there on purpose but the user would know that and they would bet a substantial amount less to limit the net/loss.Hope that helps!",
