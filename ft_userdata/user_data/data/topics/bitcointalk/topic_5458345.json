So if they ever go down (hacked, funds stolen, etc.) your funds will be gone forever.And if you think that no such a thing can happen because the company is too big to fail, then you should know that we've had multiple incidents where millions of dollars were lost in the last year or so, with services similar to Nexo: BlockFi, Voyager, Celsius network, etc.",

The percentages that such services promise, like Nexo, are not taken out of thin air, and no one will just hand out these percentages. This means that Nexo wants to get something in return, and this will be that you will give control of your assets into the hands of this service. Is it worth risking 100% of your assets for that 8-12% extra interest? I think these are inconsistent values.BTC should not be stored in a wallet with a high interest rate, but in the safest wallet. Everything else is unnecessary risk.",

It depends on how computer and security savvy you are.Always download software wallets from the official sites and verify your downloads thoroughly. There are threads here in this forum that describe the verification step-by-step. Don't skip the verification, it's important to be sure your get and execute the real and untampered software wallet.When your stash grows, consider to buy a decent hardware wallet (no, that is not a Ledger, period!). A hardware wallet protects your wallet and your private keys from a potentially unsecure computer. Malware can't gain access to your private keys and can't tamper with your transactions as long as you carefully inspect every transaction that is presented to your hardware wallet to sign it. Don't skip the thorough verification of every transaction to be signed on your hardware wallets display only. Don't trust your computer or mobile device, only trust your hardware wallet's display.",

Sounds strange to me as I’m used to calling it non custodian wallet.Yea, I do call it a none-custodial wallet until I came across a comment by JayJuanGee (if I could remember correctly) where the reason why it should also be called self-custodial was given: \"stating that the user who owns and holds the wallet has full control over it, and when one owns something and that belongs to the person alone, that's self-property\". So the same is applicable to a non-custodial wallet, which could also be referred to as \"self-custodial\" since the owner is fully responsible for their own security.Quote from: Kushan22 on July 02, 2023, 05:41:10 PMSecurity: When it comes to cryptocurrencies, security should be your top priority. While some wallets offer interest, they might not provide the same level of security as reputable hardware wallets or cold storage options. Consider the track record, reputation, and security measures of the wallet provider before storing your assets.In this day and age, information like ratings and recommendations gotten online regarding anything related to finance should not be taken too seriously, for anyone can now pay people to give a nice review and recommendations over their app. But deep down, there are things going on that we don't know about. That's why I always recommend people come to this forum to search and ask questions regarding any particular wallet, for there will always be opinions from people who have used the wallet and will share their review based on direct experience.",

Nexo and its likes act like traditional banks, they hold on to your funds and loan them out to borrowers with the promise of a percentage which is not worth the risk of leaving funds there. Most of these entities end up running into bankruptcy and that is the end for you funds and the so called percentage. So my advice will be like the rest, just keep your funds on self custodian wallets. The volatility of bitcoin it self is a better percentage if you hold for long and buy at the right time/price. But if you’re to earn more aside holding, then it would be preferable to learn about bitcoin trading. Trading is risky but at least you can have custody of your funds all the time.",

Although it's your choice to make, I have suggested that if you are using Mobile , then you should use Bluewallet, but if it's on Windows, then you can go with Electrum wallet.

It's pretty simple actually, they give your Bitcoins out to lenders and in turn, you get to earn from the proceeds. But that's not always the case and you might end up actually losing both your Bitcoins and the supposed interest. Here's a link to the SEC filing against Gemini: https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-7 FYOR, this is a similar product offering to Nexo. The best and primary way to store and hold crypto is self-custody. Afterall, the best way to get something done is to do it yourself. The same applies for taking responsibility for the security of your Bitcoin.",

It's still better to put Bitcoin in a Hardware wallet or Electrum than to put a large amount of Bitcoin in Coinbase, or any centralized based platform that we know we don't have 100% access to because for example if there's a problem that's for sure you will have a problem there.",
