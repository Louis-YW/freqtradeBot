  "content": "I have heard several people saying \"it's not too late to invest now in Bitcoin\". Erik Fineman in 2011 invested $1000 in Bitcoin for $12 each Bitcoin, later in 2013 Bitcoin was trading above $1k+ he made a fortune ( Reference link )         Bitcoin in 2010 $0.09, in 2013 it spiked to $1200, may 2017 it moved past $2k, June 2020 was $9k+ and November 2021 it spiked above $60k. It's still possible to archive more hight in future and early investors will earn a fortune too.      There are some factors that affect BTC price (Like whales) but I know that any time BTC price dumps so hard, is a sign \"we can buy more\". A friend of mine had 5 Bitcoin back then in 2013 and he told me he was going to sell it any year Bitcoin could hit his target which was $25k, in 2014 I lost contact of him, January 2021 when Bitcoin moved pass $25k he was the first person I thought of but there was no means to hear from him.       Most persons are still speculative about the right time to invest in Bitcoin, some invest in scam Altcoin, shit coins and meme coins with the believe that it's easy to make huge profit from tokens whose price are yet not  below $1.     Some new project can promise huge staking reward, auto compounding interest and promise but they may not stand the test of time.     I  lost the asset I invested in the coins below, is better to invest in Bitcoin than some scam Altcoins.      Secondly my cousin gave me some funds to invest for her into crypto, I let her understood the risk, 14 moths now I have still been waiting and expecting to get little return from the investment but is just like waiting in vain. She (my cousin) never complained about how her asset has melted but out of sympathy and she needed money for her business, i had to repay her invested capital.   I wish I had invested that money into Bitcoin, but I learned my lesson.       Early birds are always on time, A friend of mine whom I thought about cryptocurrency decided to invest half of his salary on Bitcoin every month since 2019 and he bought up to 2.4 Bitcoin, but he sold them all last year for $58k each, he used some of the money to complete the building of his house this year. Last month he told me he bought 2 Bitcoin in the month of June for $20k each and he said his holding till $100k.    Investing early in Bitcoin is good instead of waiting too long. What do you think?",

Erik Fineman in 2011 invested $1000 in Bitcoin for $12 each Bitcoin, Yes I also believe that saying. But just that everything has purpose and time. When the time which is allocated to you has reached, you must excel in life and at that period whenever you do, you succeed. A 60 years old man went to school and joined primary one. So nothing is too late but your seriousness is the main thing. I believed it was not only Erik Fineman that was Invested on bitcoin but he wad one of the serious once among them in the year 2011. Because from the 2011 conference people were many there. Early Birds can make profit if it is focus strength to the seashore but if it is distracted along the way like many on the way then it becomes story on it part and there is a saying that, \"if I would have known\". Most people who started early also misused the coin, although in any good thing that is coming to one's life there is always a mistake. And one thing is to Know the mistake and another is to correct the mistake.",

This decline is expected to continue over the next couple of years, heralding a period where Bitcoin is considered a low risk investment and a perfect fit for a store of value along with its other qualities.However, I foresee a situation where; Bitcoin becomes less stable as it absorbs more investors and adoption grows leading to price stability. And then, a new demand would arise from stability, opening the door wider to a different type of investors and the potential for more rapid growth i.e, volatility.",

Last year during that cycle, many people were buying bitcoin above $50k thinking that it was still cheap and because of the $100k speculation price. Now that we are in bear season and it is ranging between $20k-25k, people call it a scam.Investing early can be very subjective. The price of bitcoin last year at $30k above can still be early if we are looking its price after 5 years or more. People that bought last year near its peak are still early if they will hodl it until the next market cycle.",

It is certainly not easy for someone who is an early bird in all of this to stop regretting that he made bad decisions, but there is not much point in going back so far into the past because nothing can be changed there.The early adopters were key in guiding Bitcoin on the right path, and we should be grateful to them for that - because back then profit was obviously something that most people didn't think about. Those who hunt for profit can say today that they are in the same position as those at the end of 2017 when it comes to the price, so we can say that they got an opportunity to go back even 5 years in the past. I personally would be grateful for such an opportunity, and I would not be too greedy and wait for an even more favorable moment.",

Right now investing might be relatively safer compared to back then since we have instances of Bitcoin going back up from situations like this, so there's at least something to refer to.
