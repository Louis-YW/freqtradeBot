  "content": "The FACT0RN (Symbol: FACT) Blockchain is now listed on xeggex (https://xeggex.com/asset/FACT) in case anyone here would like to mine the coin. The PoW is integer factorization; in particular, it is very friendly to CPU mining and not as friendly to GPUs and ASICs on the market today. The development of this project was funded by Coinbase (See https://www.coinbase.com/blog/fact0rn-blockchain-integer-factorization-as-proof-of-work-pow)The total coin supply as of this posting is 88,221.87042070 coins. The current difficulty level is 288-bits --- you must find a brilliant number of that size under blockchain restrictions. The reward for that is about 2.5 FACT coins at the moment --- the target block time is 30 minutes....though many miners have joined in the past couple of days and the blockchain has produced up to 5 blocks in one hour recently and on average is producing more than 2 blocks per hour right now.Daemon: https://github.com/FACT0RN/FACT0RN (Download the latest release from here).Miner: https://github.com/FACT0RN/factoringWebsite: https://fact0rn.io/Discord: https://discord.gg/gG7MXxS5FdTwitter: https://twitter.com/LionesEscanorWhitepaper: https://fact0rn.io/FACT0RN_whitepaper.pdfCoinbase: https://www.coinbase.com/blog/fact0rn-blockchain-integer-factorization-as-proof-of-work-powTrade: https://xeggex.com/market/FACT_USDTBlock Explorer: https://factexplorer.io/   (EDIT: I forgot to add it the first time around)",
