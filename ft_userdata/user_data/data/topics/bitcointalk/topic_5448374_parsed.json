Cannot give any effect if we talk about prices changes since the balance will just sleep with no transaction will happen. But if there's movement like dumping it especially if this is a huge balance then maybe a short time dump of the price will happen.But it can lessen up the supply and we don't know yet what will be the real effect on it especially if many people will want more bitcoin and supply is to low. Maybe we can see price goes up then it will be expensive for other people to acquire some amount of it.",

Hence, as people keep losing their BTC due to loss of wallet seed phrase, can it affect or cause a decline in BTC supply entirely? Bitcoin has a limited maximum supply and a constantly changing circulating supply, and any potential loss of someone's funds which involves the corresponding loss of private keys can be considered as a decrease in available supply, but the maximum supply of Bitcoin stays nearly the same. In order to decrease the total supply, coins need to be \"burned\" or destroyed in a provable way, which means it will be impossible to restore such coins even by finding private keys. There are many approaches to destroying coins in a provable way, but it is a rare occurrence that this happens naturally due to mistakes. Most often than not, people who want to burn their coins know what they are doing: they destroy their coins on purpose to achieve some goal that they see as more important thing than valuable coins.",

The lost BTC will have an effect on the number of BTC in supply since it will reduce the amount in circulation when everyone finally gets to know about bitcoin and want to get some. There is 21 million in supply, but that amount will not be available to everyone when bitcoin finally gets accepted and adopted because of how many out of that supply has been lost due to loss of wallet seed. There will still be enough bitcoin to go round, but it will affect the number the available to everyone.",

It would definitely cause a decline or a reduction in the number of bitcoins in circulation. It doesn't reduce the number of bitcoin generally, just the amount in circulation. Fortunately, this also wouldn't negatively affect the prices of the bitcoin in circulation. As the demand increases and combined with a limited supply, the price of bitcoin is bound to go only one direction. All the way up.",

It's impossible as from Private key to Public key then public address is one-way. You can not revert the process from Public address to Public key then Private key.Not at the moment, but reversing a public key to a private key could certainly be possible far enough in the future with quantum computers. If such an event occurred, then the several million coins in early P2PK outputs as well as any coins in outputs with a revealed public key (which includes all addresses which have previously spent bitcoin) could potentially have their private keys reverse engineered and therefore re-enter circulation, unless the community consensus is to fork to somehow lock all these coins.Just because coins have not moved in a long time, or even if someone claims they have lost the private keys/seed phrase/wallet/whatever, it is wrong to assume those coins are permanently lost and can't be recovered.Quote from: tbct_mt2 on April 11, 2023, 02:14:46 PMHowever, you won't be able to know how many bitcoins were lost.We can prove that the number of provably lost bitcoin is 2,828.654 BTC, and this number can be safely removed from both the total and the circulating supplies.

Hence, as people keep losing their BTC due to loss of wallet seed phrase, can it affect or cause a decline in BTC supply entirely? There are 2 points to pay attention to when looking for an answer to your question:1. If we start from the law of supply and demand, then the reduction of bitcoin in general circulation should cause an increase in the value of it. People have lost and will continue to lose access to their btc. At the moment, not 1 millionBTC have been lost and in fact, the total number of btc will be less than the claimed 21 mln.2. On the other hand, technologies are developing and I admit the possibility that in the distant future (or not so) the power of computers (for example, quantum ones) will allow hacking (brute forcing) lost wallets. That will make it possible to get closer to the limit of 21 mln. bitcoins, as it was intended by the creator.Probably, the events described in paragraph 1 will occur first, and then, in paragraph 2. But as I believe, with each new halving it will be more and more difficult to get btc, which means that it will be more reluctant to part with.How do you understand the total supply? There are a lot of holders whose bitcoins are stored on their wallets and practically don't participate in the general turnover. You remember the recent story, when bitcoins moved from the old wallet only 10 years later. Many people can do the same. What I'm saying is that out of the 21 mln.BTC available now, some are lost forever (or not so forever) and some may just be on hold until the best price becomes available. As a result, it turns out that in the available offer there are not so many bitcoin that can be bought at the moment.",

It's dope to see you're curious about Bitcoin, and I'm stoked to drop some knowledge on you. About your question, it's true that some peeps have lost their BTC wallets, and that can be hella frustrating. But losing wallets doesn't have any effect on the total supply of BTC. The supply of Bitcoin is predetermined and fixed, and losing wallets only reduces the circulating supply. Make sure to stash your seed phrase in a safe place and be cautious about security measures to dodge such losses. Bitcoin is a real game-changer of a technology, and you gotta know how to use it and keep it safe. By stashing your seed phrase in a secure spot and taking the right precautions, you can avoid any major losses. And remember, the price of Bitcoin can change in the blink of an eye, so make sure you're keeping an eye on the market and investing your money smartly.",

So if I may ask again, does this mean that the continuous loss of BTC in wallets which results to reduction in BTC circulation can lead to increments in the price of bitcoin or it doesn't work that way with bitcoin???",
