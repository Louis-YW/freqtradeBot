  "content": "Earlier this year, around May to be precise, It was reported that one of the trading exchanges, Patricia halted withdrawals[1] which at first they claimed(lied) that it was due to blockchain congestion but what really happened to Patricia wasn't what was disclosed to the public at first, they actually lost $2m to hack around January 2022 but they keep mum and refuse to disclose that to the public not until they seize withdrawals around April this year. What happened like a joke turned out to be true, they have massively sacked workers and worked to get back to business again but from the look of things, they are not done with their fraud because, instead of them to resume withdrawals and allow customers to have access to their bitcoin, they decide to carry out another heist; they lunch a Patricia token(PTK)[2] pegged to USDT with a whitepaper[3] which is not listed on any exchange, if they have the USDTbank in the first place, they wouldn't launch another shitty stablecoin. Not only did they stop there.They converted the user's BTC balance to the worthless stablecoin without their knowledge, no emails were sent, and no notification, who does that? Why convert BTC to PTK tokens they don't need? Looking at the status of the company, they don't have the means to pay back the customers, they don't have the liquidity to settle all the debts, the BTC on the user's wallet is only database value, no intrinsic value and this is just another FTX scam.What have you learned? Not your keys, definitely not your coins. Never leave your BTC on another man's land, they control it while you only control the front end, you don't have the keys and you can't control what will happen in the future.

When I see any project that presents itself as serious and mentions its tokens as part of the business plan, I don't need anything more than to understand the direction in which the business is going.Do not use centralized crypto exchanges, stay away from tokens and similar junk, and do not believe the fairy tales presented to you on social networks - their goal is to take your money and nothing more.",

Not your keys not your coin has often been heard and is very often discussed in forum, after the collapse of FTX some time ago it should have been a lesson for crypto users not to trust their assets to be controlled by a centralized exchange. The freezing of assets that centralized exchanges do is unacceptable and clearly detrimental to the users of their service, users can only see the amount of assets in their account but cannot withdraw them.Crypto asset users must be able to choose a safe place to store assets with an asset exchange. I hope that no member of this forum becomes a victim of Patricia exchange because they are too full of important information that has been shared in the forum to prevent incidents like this.",

The company is now planning to raise as much as $50 million to upgrade its technology, hire blockchain engineers and keep up with regulatory requirements. Agbodje expects to raise the funds in the next six monthsThey fled Nigeria to Estonia, they want 50 million, they have 30k claimed transactions a day while employing over 350 people, although they supposedly fired 80% of them, but..they don't have enough money to pay back 2 million.Also no they hold a Lithuania \"license\" for a company with 1 employee and no title filled this year, and their so-called Canadian MSB number is a business number and the company is listed as inactive, so they don't have a Fintrac license.",

Learn to keep your coins in your custody and protect your private keys and seed phrase.It is a fact that many people are careless in this matter. Most of the times their assets are kept in exchanges. We should never hand over our assets to someone else, even if it is a good exchange. We only have a password to access our Bitcoin. Whereas the reality is that our Bitcoin is controlled by someone else. This is also true. This is the crypto currency market and there is no telling what will happen in the future. Therefore, it is better to keep your Bitcoin in your personal wallet. Your seed phrase and your private keys should always be kept secure and not shared with anyone. Soft wallets and hard wallets are the best options for storing your Bitcoin. One should always keep one's assets in one's house instead of keeping them in someone else's house and never compromise in this regard.",

Nobody knows if the exchange is telling the truth but the fact remains that no one should store or keep their coins in an exchange because your coins is no longer yours at the moment it is with them. It is only when you have transfer your coins out of the exchange that it becomes yours. Exchanges can come up with different stories and deny you access from your funds and they can also do whatever they like with your funds and you don't have a say.

Don't allow any influencers to make you use a centralized exchange you are not sure of.These social media influencers are promoting what they are not even using, and they probably do not do any review before starting the advertisement; they only work to be paid, which is why it is always wrong to follow social media influencers without doing further research.Moreover, centralized exchanges are not to be trusted because of the number of them that have gone bankrupt since the start of this bear market. That is why it is always advisable to keep your Bitcoin in a wallet in which you hold the private key.",
