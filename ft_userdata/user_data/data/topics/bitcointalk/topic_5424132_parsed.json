Instead, if you really want to take the risk (only if all other ways of recovering your pass failed) why not go for walletrecoveryservices Â , they got some pretty impressive reviews and seem to be quite old in the space.This one just blew me out lol..",

Depending on your case (wallet type, hints, if there is anything you remember about your passphrase etc.) you may try to restore it yourself. Write here more details and for sure you will receive a help. For the beginning you may read this: https://btcrecover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Usage_Examples/UsageExamples/ to see if any of that examples looks familiar.",

As I've pointed out before, the site itself is largely plagiarized from elsewhere, and contains plagiarized blog posts predating its registration date designed to make it appear older and more trustworthy than it actually is. There are zero confirmed reviews or feedback from people successfully using the site, and the user in question is negatively rated for this suspicious behavior.So no, it is not safe.As I said to you in your other thread, if you share as much as you can remember about your passphrase then we can help you to try to brute force it yourself using btcrecover.",

If you're willing to learn a bit about using wallet recovery tool and have fairly fast CPU/GPU, recovering by yourself is good alternative.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on November 29, 2022, 07:42:12 PMQuote from: suzuri on November 29, 2022, 04:43:05 PMand found a webiste, but idk if its safeThis site was spammed on this forum repeatedly by a newbie who would post about it and then a day or two later delete the post, repeating this pattern of behavior over and over.It's very likely someone report his post since some of his past post could be deemed as spam or off-topic.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on November 29, 2022, 07:42:12 PMAs I've pointed out before, the site itself is largely plagiarized from elsewhere, and contains plagiarized blog posts predating its registration date designed to make it appear older and more trustworthy than it actually is.
