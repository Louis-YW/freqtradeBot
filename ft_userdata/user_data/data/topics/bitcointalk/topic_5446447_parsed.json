  "content": "Hello,   I'm lost, and I don't know much about BTC wallets and transactions. I had BTC online on Localbitcoin since a long time without using it, and I have been advised by email that they will no longer provide their service, so I needed to withdraw all my BTC. I choosed armory on windows as it seemed secure. I installed it, created a wallet, and sent BTC from Localbitcoin to the adress of my Armory wallet. Now blockcypher.com  says the transaction is complete, but the ballance has not changed on the armory wallet (still 0,00btc). I wonder why... Armory appears to be offline because \"it failed to spawn the DB\". It says to \"refer to the dblog.tx\", but I don't know what it means. I would be very greatfull if one would indicate a step by step way to manage this... Thanks in advance.",

      "body": "First thanks for your answer, and taking time helping me. I regret my choice as obviously it goes beyond my abilities in this matter. But I already sent BTC from my original wallet online to a wallet created on Armory (which is still not credited). I should have think more before and choose Electrum indeed... I'm not sure I understand what you mean by \"download the full blockchain and make your wallet to be fully functional\", and how this is to be done...I downloaded and install Bitcoin core as I've read it's necessary to get Armory working. But Bitcoin core says it will need 5 weeks to get synchronysed ! I don't know what it means, and I'm a little depserate here...[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

If not, you should do that now!I've used many wallets, but I've never used Armory. From what I've seen, it's a very good wallet, but for me, it's not the worth the hassle.Syncing Bitcoin Core means downloading and verifying 500 GB. Depending on your computer and internet connection, it can take less than a day (with a modern CPU, 16 GB RAM, 4096MB or more dbcache, SSD, high speed internet) or it can take many weeks if you lack computing power or internet speed.If you're not in a rush, just let it sync.If you are less patient, you can export the private key, and sweep that into a new Electrum wallet. Depending on how much value you're holding you may want to consider a hardware wallet for security. Whatever you do, make sure you understand what you're doing before doing it!Note that people will try to scam you by PM, so don't trust them. And don't share your private key with anyone.",

You're making me feel more confident, and I understand I need to be patient. I will try to understand both options you're suggesting and then come back with my thoughts :-)[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

      "body": "OP, copy your Bitcoin address and scan it on the Bitcoin network (https://blockchair.com) then you can see your wallet balance, and I believe your funds are still safe. If you truly complete the download of the full blockchain of that wallet, then it is supposed to show your balance. Another thing you should do is make sure your network is working and, if possible, reboot your device and reconnect your browsing network because, most times, if there is a poor connection, the wallet can go offline and the balance can remain at zero. I believe you have also copied out your phrase so you can just import it to Electrium, according to @Charles-Tim Guid.",

I'm trying to transfer all the funds from Armory to Electrum, but I'm stuck at some point : I downloaded Electrum/created a wallet/ then choose Import BTC adresses or private keys (I'm I right ?). But on the following window (Enter a list of BTC adresses or a list of Private keys\", nothing seems working (I can Paste a text, or import a file) From Armory, I think I managed find the private keys list. From their, I can choose to show \"Adress string\", or/and \"Private key (plain base 58)\", or/and \"Private keys (Plain Hex)\", among other data. I can choose to \"omit space in key data\" or not. I can finally \"Copy to clip board\", or \"Save to file\" (I don't know what type of file and where it is created). When I copy/paste the text on Electrum, It does not work, and I dont what file I could try to import... I hope I'm clear enough and not too confused. Thanks again for your help !",

Then if you import it on Electrum directly, you should be able to see your coin and also be able to spend it.You will click on 'import bitcoin addresses or private keys', it would work. If your private key start from 5, the bitcoin will start from 1.For addresses that start from 1:Import it directly like this:5KJcMhCvqsUxzF...Or in this format:p2pkh:5KJcMhCvqsUxzFHTt...Private key that start from 5 are uncompressed private key of bitcoin address and likely you are using an old version of Armony.
