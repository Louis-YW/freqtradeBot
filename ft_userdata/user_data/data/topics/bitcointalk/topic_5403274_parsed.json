Since those are a continuation of the same card release (you are releasing the remaining # numbers) should I assume that will be the exact same? If not, could you please elaborate on the differences?For example, will the serial be embossed as in the picture?Further, the different text font will match the original release text, or it is an improvement to this batch?(a photo of the current batch release -instead of the prototype photo- would help)Thanks.",

      "body": "Yes, serials will be embossed, as that is something that is only & always done for the History series. I can't speak about the text difference 100%, but will try and get that answered tomorrow for sure and update here.However.... Knowing Yogg as well as I do, I'm going to have to assume these will be EXACTLY the same as the ones already released to subscribers in 2021, other than serial numbers (obviously). AFAIK, he still had all the same files from the ones already made, these were just not all printed/created until recently, .... Also, I know he would not want a series with \"different\" fonts on them than other cards - He is quite strict about having absolutely no \"variations\" among sets! Thanks!Edit still some sets left in the shop, get 'em while they're there, they go fast!",

Just checking on status and free bump to the post as there are only 3 sets left Hello PreciousMetapsICTThanks for your order !Yes indeed, I want to finalize our automated funding collection server and use this to address the emails to you.This aspect is rather critical : we need to make it in some way so that customers can verify the contents of the email come from us and not from someone claiming to be us.(Otherwise this would be a flaw allowing the theft of customer funds)¬†I'm making progress on this but if it is not operational later today, I am just going to send the emails manually for this round.It is taking a bit more time than what I thought.Quote from: tweetious on June 20, 2022, 09:57:17 PMWill those cards look exactly the same, as those that were released to the subscribers? Since those are a continuation of the same card release (you are releasing the remaining # numbers) should I assume that will be the exact same? If not, could you please elaborate on the differences?Hey tweetious,Yes indeed, they are all exactly the same as the ones released to subscribers. The pictures posted were from prototypes.The Coldkeys sold on this listing have the old paperboard card holder, which is handwritten. They are also all embossed.About the font, it is outlined so the characters are more easily readable on such a background.I'll share more updates with you here when the funding emails have been sent, and the parcels shipped.Thank you. üôè",
