      "body": "I have been using optimism users and for me this looks like more interesting rather than metis dao. I will prefer to pick optimism rather than metis dao but the questions is whether second layer solution is still worth with the hype? i meant there are too much second layer solutions and the hype will not be so big like what happened in the last bullrun. People aware about this too. that's why i were putting this as my main concern after seeing so many layer 2 come to the crypto",

Why not focus on huge L2 project like Polygon(Matic) and Loopeing(LRC) that has better marketcap and room for improvement in the future since it was being use already by many famous dapps.But Optimism is the best if the only option is the 2 project above.",

Do drop your suggestion.It's my first time hearing Metis Dao and I just checked it and seems also a quality project just like Optimism as a layer 2 project.But my vote is for Optimism, even though these 2 projects started during the bear market, they are both superb as they are built both on top of Ethereum.I'll still go with highest market cap which is Optimism.",

How you determine which one will ultimately depend on your own metrics.I am personally in a watch mode only after the successful POS migration of Ethereum since many of these L2 projects were born because of ETH's limitation under POW. What else can they offer now that they can't use their low transaction fee for marketing.",

Ive seen grow on partnership with optism so It really has edge. But metisdao, not sure though but Ive seen dapps deploying to them too.On the otherhand, Ive think astar is growing fast and even got a lot of major partnership and integrations too.",

Arbitrum and Optimism are 2 projects that I want to bet on, they all have the same potential. I don't think layer2 will fail, it solves a lot of problems for layer1 and ethereum's upgrade doesn't affect layer2 development at all. Alternatively, you can also consider investing in Polygon, it is sidechain rather than pure layer2 but very promising and solves similar problems as Arbitrum and Optimism.",
