I stopped listening to many of them because their predictions turned out to be baseless guesses.  This forum has been my source of motivation, which has made me stick to my plans no matter the magnitude of misinformation flying on the internet.",

And it is also possible to go up by the same percentage at the same time frame. So Bitcoin is still a very volatile asset and you should not be jumping around in joy just because Bitcoin had breached 71k level. So chil l and enjoy the upward momentum. You can also choose to book some profits to recover the invested money. Just don't become too cheerful seeing the current momentum. Anything can happen!",

We've seen many \"breakouts\" but then things headed south again. To answer your question, I still occasionally spend a few satoshis to buy things online, but I've never once thought of throwing in the towel.",

Can't wait for bitcoin options to start trading next year. If you've been here on crypto space or trading or holding up Bitcoin since 2018 then pretty sure that you do already have that experience on that bull run cycle happens or simply the with market cycle about ups and downs on each trend period. It is really that hard to believe that in year 2024 on which you are really that almost selling out your Bitcoin just because you haven't seen any increase on this year? On the moment that you have been able to realize on how market volatility works or behaves then you do already make yourself that getting numb on whatever market volatility that you will be able to face on, but since we are just human beings on which having emotions then it is really that normal that there are really times or moments that you will really be having that kind of emotions on which you will really be having thoughts whether it is really that ime to sell out your position and focusing into other venture specially if you've been holding for very long time. Basing up on what you have said or mentioned that  you do keep on DCA'ing on which this simply means that you have trusted up your Bitcoin investment on which i have said earlier that it is really just that too impossible that you wont really be able to have those realizations along the way in regarding about Bitcoin volatility. You will not be making up those steps or actions if you arent that taking up such risky option to take. There are really indeed those times that you do lose hope but if you are someone whose not good on handling your emotion then you are susceptible on having these mistakes.",

It sometimes depends on the level of knowledge and commitment one may have gathered over the time, before you can decide to either hold a majority of your assets into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.My stronger advice will remain that you invest a part of your money into physical assets while also exploring the cryptocurrencies. Some promising physical investments may include real estate and gemstones. These two examples of investments tend to have a strong wielding purchase power amidst any economic instabilities the world might be facing.",

I started with Bitcoin around 2016, and it took a while to get comfortable with the volatility. Learning to stick with DCA and hodl strategies helped me through those choppy times too.I had considered scaling back if things didn’t improve. But now, it feels like sticking it out was worth it. The longer the consolidation, the bigger the potential reward. Looking forward to seeing how this next phase plays out, especially with Bitcoin options on the horizon!",

Can't wait for bitcoin options to start trading next year. Why do people prepare their finances for certain conditions and they prepare a percentage of their needs in life so they don't have to sell bitcoin before the ATH target is reached. When all the money you have is in bitcoin then when the price drops it will have an impact on losses and whether you like it or not you have to sell some to meet your living needs. That's why it's important to have a strategy and not force all your money to be in bitcoin as an investment step that is taken.If you apply a long term strategy then there is no need to sell half because you can wait for the next ATH to get maximum profit. Even if you sell and will re-accumulate purchases then you will likely take an accumulation approach at a much higher price and it is better to wait for a period of maximum increase.",

I do think it is normal especially for hodlers that are not exactly wealthy and any money you have is needed to pay for bills and would help your family. It is not the same for rich people who still have an excessive amount of money even with other investments.I personally have not thought of selling my coins due to the price. There were some times where I planned on selling my bitcoin in case something really bad happens in my life but thankfully I have not reached that moment so I did not have to sell my bitcoin.
