For e.g. if you got dogecoin and 14 other cryptos, and you want to send doge, just import the seed it in any self custodial dogecoin wallet and you're done. Do the same for rest of the crypto coins, i.e., import the same seed in their respective compatible wallets.Simple trick: Buy another hardware wallet and restore all  your coins easily (with the seedphrase ofc)",

Do the same for rest of the crypto coins, i.e., import the same seed in their respective compatible wallets. I would only suggest importing a seed that's been generated in a safer system such as a hardware wallet into a software wallet if it's an emergency. Most of the times though, it's not an emergency. If someone losses their hardware wallet or it breaks, they get afraid they will lose access to their coins and want to reassure themselves by recovering them asap. You are just minimizing the security of your seed that way and making it potentially vulnerable as well because it's been used with a hot wallet.Importing your hardware wallet seed into one software is bad enough. Doing it in 15 different ones just increases potential attack vectors. For your crypto to get stolen, either one of those 15 hot wallets need to mess something up. Compare it to having a secret, telling that secret to one person and revealing it to 15 people. If you can't use your current hardware wallet any longer, get one from another brand and restore your wallets from your backup seed. Generate new seeds and wallets on the new one if you lost trust in the old device and gradually move your coins to the new one.",

I took another look at Trezor's coin page. For example, if your search for bitcoin or ethereum, the site only shows you Trezor Suite as the supported software. But if you type in polygon, then it displays 3rd-part software like MyCrypto or MEW. I guess if the asset is supported by Trezor Suite, they don't mention alternative wallets. If not (like in the case of polygon), they do.Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 25, 2023, 08:54:37 AMWallets listed are Electrum, Exodus, MetaMask, MyEtherWallet and MyCrypto wallet. I do not know if MyCrypto wallet support many other coins because I have not used the wallet before. I have never either, but I think it's similar to MEW and only used for ether and ethereum-based tokens. Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 25, 2023, 08:54:37 AMThe last time I downloaded Exodus, it is supporting many cryptocurrencies including Solana and NFTs, although it is a close source wallet. Yeah, Exodus is a multicurrency wallet, meaning that most coins and tokens would probably work by connecting your Trezor to it. It's closed-source, but your open-source Trezor does the sending. Exodus is just a means to get coins from A to B. All transaction details will be displayed and should be checked on the HWs screen.",

Buying a new piece of hardware would not have fixed this issue after importing seeds.I'm not sure what would cause this or the mechanics behind it, which is why I am asking.  It could be a non issue but I wanted to be sure.So when you say self custodial wallet do you mean the same hardware wallet?   In this case that would not work.  It was a software issue. If I had to guess I do not think the hardware wallet seed would work with a QT wallet, but I am unsure.  Maybe something like electrum if it were Bitcoin?Quote from: Charles-Tim on February 25, 2023, 08:27:55 AMIt is nothing like emergency, you have your hardware wallet like Trezor which you can even access with different wallet software like Electrum for bitcoin, Metamask for ERC20 etc, even if the official software of the wallet is outdated, you can use other reputable software wallets to spend your coins.

Oh, I see. Maybe I can even guess which altcoin you are talking about but it's not important for this discussion. In case hardware wallet #1 has an issue with a particular coin, how do you know that wallets #2 and #3 don't have the same problems? If the coin changed something on a protocol level, an update or a fix needs to be released by the wallets that support that coin to continue interacting with it in an uninterrupted manner. Some wallets could fix the code in a day, others might need a bit more time. Patience is a virtue in that case. Maybe there is a temporary workaround that you can use until your client fixes its main software. Like you said yourself, they fixed it in a few days.

Are you talking about a possibility in which the software and blockchain is so badly done that it becomes impossible to make transactions or something else? If that is the case, then yeah, a non-functional shitcoin is equally non-functional no matter who holds the keys.If you are talking about censorship, freezing of addresses, and reversibility of transactions, things are a bit different. These things could be initiated by the issuers and developers if your coins are on a CEX or in your hardware wallet. The additional risks with CEXs are that they can freeze, lose, steal, or gamble away your crypto. Or you fail their internal KYC or AML procedures.",

I was trying to ask how to use a seed phrase without a HW, generated from a HW in something like electrum.  AKA -seed compatibility.  And could this be exploited by governments to attack HW's had the answer to the previous question been not compatible.  But this seems like a non issue.  I can and have, many times walked someone through the simple process of seed creation, how it works. o_e_l_e_o  - great idea to get a new HW and tx everything else to it and leave the bugged coin before importing it into anything that's hot.Again, thank you all for the info!  It's very nice to see some people still frequent BCT taking the time to respond to the less knowledgeable regarding specifics.",

The compatibility is there because most hardware wallets follow the BIP39 implementation. Electrum is somewhat different because it uses a unique seed creation process based on version numbers and not checksums like in BIP39, but it still accepts and supports BIP39 seeds with a minor settings change.If your hardware wallet uses standard derivation paths (which popular brands do) and you have the correct recovery phrase + the passphrase (if one exists), you won't have difficulties recovering from a backup. Your coins could be lost if the original derivation path is something completely unorthodox and there would be no one in the world who knows which one it is.",

There are plenty of good open source software wallets out there which accept BIP39 seed phrases.For altcoins, however, it is a different story. You'll have no problems with the major ones, but for some random shitcoin there is no guarantee whatsoever that there is some standalone wallet software which will allow you to import seed phrases.Quote from: Pmalek on February 26, 2023, 08:01:18 AMYour coins could be lost if the original derivation path is something completely unorthodox and there would be no one in the world who knows which one it is.Which again, won't be an issue for bitcoin, but could certainly be an issue for the software for some random altcoin with a poor implementation which is using arbitrary derivation paths and no one knows what they are.",

For accessing the Trezor's Bitcoin funds, you can use Electrum, Sparrow, or even Bitcoin Core. For other coins, it gets tricky; it depends on whether alternative software exists or not. You have to check with the developers / documentation of those coins to get a full answer to this question.",
