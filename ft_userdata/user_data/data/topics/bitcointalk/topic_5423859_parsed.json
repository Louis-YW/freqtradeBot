It is the best way to implement and leverage blockchain features like faster transactions, decentralized, and security.My only question is how? Is Rova any different than the millions of tokens that are already launched in the market? We have multiple coins and tokens that offer fast transactions, decentralised in nature and robust security. What Rova will do anything differently than the existing ones? So I would love to know what's the difference at first?",

      "body": "You really got a great question there.Every cryptocurrency facilitates people to use it as digital currency only and has no real-world applications. If they have, they are very limited to some groups of people who know the technology and sort of computer skills.ROVA aimed to remove those limitations and apply the amazing blockchain features to real world utilities through the crypto ecosystem.
