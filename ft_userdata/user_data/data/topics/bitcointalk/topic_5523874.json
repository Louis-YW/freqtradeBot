As for amount of Bitcoin you could mine (not generate), it depends on various aspect such as your mining hashrate and Bitcoin mining difficulty. You could use mining calculator to get rough estimation.",

With every halving, the block reward decreases, but the costs of mining (like electricity and hardware) either stay the same or even go up. That’s why cost analysis is neccessary to know if its still worth it. Since the block reward decreases over time, mining only becomes attractive if Bitcoin’s price rises enough to compensate. However, if you’re a miner who views your earnings as a long-term investment rather than immediate profit, you’ll probably be fine regardless of the market status.",

A miner this size would solve a block every ~100 days on average.So it's about 0.006%.Also, 50 PH means around 200 S21+ or 100 xp+ hydro so anywhere in the 1.5 to 900k range.At least in theory, he will still need to hit 5-6 blocks at last till he breaks even, even more, if his gear is older and more inefficient.But if he has rented the hashrate for just a few days and hit that , yes, he is already in profit.",
