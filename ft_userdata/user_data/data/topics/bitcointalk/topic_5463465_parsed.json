  "content": "Europe have taken the lead against the US in becoming the first Bitcoin ETF as London based Asset management company, Jacobi Assets announced their product listing( Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF) on  Euronext Amsterdam. The digital assets company had received approval from Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC ) in October, 2021 and had intentions to launch the ETF the next year but had to halt their decision due to the collapse of the Terra ecosystem and FTX bankruptcy saga. They have finally gone live and the Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is trading under the ticker BCOIN and charging investors a 1.5% annual management fee. Fidelity Digital Assets will handle custodial services while Flow Traders take the role of market makers for the fund.According to Jacobi CEO, Martin Bednall, he believes that this launch will be a catalyst for institutional adoption of digital assets and also opined that the fund has been designed to give investors a simple secure and transparent access to Bitcoin.While the US SEC continues to not accept or slow all spot Bitcoin ETF applications, this product has gotten green light in Europe. Let's hope this would push them (SEC) to hasten up.https://decrypt.co/148433/jacob-asset-management-launch-europe-first-bitcoin-etf",

      "body": "News is old already shared by me point is not who shared it first point of saying is, you asked let's hope for other's platforms too. So, i mean to say if they have to prove them then the time was enough for them to analyze the potential but they are keep delaying it. The news you shared it weeks old but the just delayed the ETF results day more just 1 or 2 days ago.Means if this news really have some good impact on those ETFs then by now that impact would be seen by us but no there is nothing which means we should not make that much hopes about these news.",
