Follow Scam Report Format (Use it to make scam reports properly), since IMO there's insufficient information about how it happened.2. Providing proof where they say no verification needed.",

      "body": "@kots1980I don't know if this is the same issue and I cannot vouch for marathonbet but please note I had a similar issue while using betfair a couple of week ago! they denied several times to withdraw a win to my Mastercard because they had a problem with this payment processor.I am using this site since 15 years maybe more/of course fully KYC....and never had any issue. This time they requested additional data (including bank statement of this card used for deposit) and the withdraw was possible just with another payment method/processor.hope this can help",

Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do in this case except cooperate with their customer support and comply with their requests. I am not familiar with Marathonbet casino, but based on what I have learned, they are a licensed and a very old gambling site. Although it seems that they have a lot of bad reviews, it is unlikely that they want to scam you (unless you are dealing with a very large amount of money), so I think it is best to work with them and try to find a solution. This may take some time.",

I suggest posting this complaint on their website, I've seen them help gamblers resolve issues that they experience on gambling sites.",

In the first place, the casino is the one that requested that OP should add another payment processor it is given that he should not deposit on that replaced payment processor and it should be accepted by the casino, he should have tried that and if they did not accept the new payment processor then we have the casino to blame because they are the one that requested it so the withdrawal can be process.QuoteUPDATE... all of a sudden they banned my account, and of course stole my money.That's weird!

They said that if verification is needed, they will inform you about it. They also said you can't verify your account in advance, and before their team asks you to.Quote from: kots1980 on September 25, 2022, 06:50:58 AMthey denied withdrawal without telling me anything... i asked after 4 days, and their response was that my visa card provider has a technical issue, so that i cannot receive my money. Since they are a Russian-based bookmaker, it's possible it's true because of all of the restrictions placed on anything Russian since the invasion of Ukraine. But there is also the question how were you able to deposit using that same VISA card? Quote from: kots1980 on September 25, 2022, 06:50:58 AMi continue contact with marathon bet, and their 2nd excuse was that my card provider has an issue and that i should install another payment method. But installing another payment method means that i have to do another deposit, and play those money arround Not necessarily. Fiat casinos and sportsbooks (all the ones I have played at) require that you withdraw the money using the same payment option you used to deposit. If you deposited with your VISA card, you should withdraw to the same card. If you used Neteller, the money should go back to the same account. However, if there is a problem with the original payment service, like in your case, they will allow you to use an alternative method. But there shouldn't be any new wagering requirements. Discuss this part with their support personnel if you can. Quote from: kots1980 on September 25, 2022, 06:50:58 AMi was keep contacting them, and they got sick of telling me my visa provider issue, and they changed the excese to that i got selected randomly to security check and that i need to provide the following documents. That's standard when it comes to the verification of gambling accounts. What I find surprising is that you were allowed to register an account and deposit money to it without doing KYC beforehand. Fiat bookies usually want to know who their players are asap.Quote from: kots1980 on September 27, 2022, 04:15:53 PMUPDATE... all of a sudden they banned my account, and of course stole my money. On screenshot #4, they wrote that your account will be temporarily suspended until you verify it. Maybe that's why you can't access it at this time. Are they still communicating with you over email? Have you tried talking to them again after the suspension?",
