The sec already missed the first deadlines for awaiting applications, and the second deadline for many of the applications is this month.

We have not also heard the reaction of Grayscale regarding the matter. But if the news is genuine the result will be a review of the application again. The SEC will always have reasons to deny the approval and Grayscale will have to approach a court again for redress. I think the SEC will approve spot Bitcoin ETF only when it has developed a comprehensive policy framework and technical know-how to regulate the sector.",

But they should also be giving the reason for approving Blockrock's ETF. It will serve as a guide for the companies applying ETF as well, there are lots of them, and from what we know GBTC also has BTC with 1:1.  Not Just Coinbase.Amusing how this is pretty much discussed while we are very close to having war in the Middle East and at the same time the current war in Ukraine. I would think there is a chance for ETF to be approved earlier than 2024. They're in a hurry.",

This might be a result of some laziness from the SEC but I think it is not, and another possibility of it can be  a publicity stunt. Overall, if things go right, as this post implies, then we might see early ETF's approval. And just to be frank, if you think this news will make the approval of ETFs to be around 2024 then I think ETFs will be approved without it and we might see approvals of ETF around 2024 maybe in April moth, before halving.Because, this news (of ETFs Approvals) will act as a fuel for the engine of BTC rocket which will take it to the new heights. I have said this a lot of times before.",

It's all about hype and halving the upcoming So both can impact the Bitcoin chart together. Everyone assumes next year will be a bull year. This year was a stable one, to be honest. We haven't seen any significant volatility this year. We have to wait more than two months to see the impact.",

This is especially true since the SEC has already approved several Bitcoin futures ETFs.If the SEC approves Grayscale's spot Bitcoin ETF, it could set a precedent for other asset managers who have also filed for similar ETFs. And it could also be a factor that initiates the next bull run for Bitcoin in 2024. The SEC is one step closer to approving a spot Bitcoin ETF, I think Blackrock application will accept firstly which could be a huge boost for the cryptocurrency market.Good future ahead",

Now, having said that and I must say I too is confident on that to happen, let us not ignore the fact that SEC does not really want to approve one so who knows the shenanigan they can come up by 2024 in either in rejecting or delaying the said application. We know that Gary Gensler is a big enemy of the cryptocurrency industry and he will do anything to stop ETF from operating in the market. It would then be exciting to watch developments on this area and see how SEC will finally deal with this dilemma. Will there an approval...or will there be another excuse?",

They can only do as much as rejection as they can, but sooner or later they will have to give in to the pressures of big financial institutions to approved the very first Bitcoin Spot ETF.  You will have to look at who is the entity, BlackRock, Bitwise, Van Eck, Wisdom tree. This are all big names, so we might see as early as the 1st quarter of next year that we the first ETF will be approved, in my opinion.",
