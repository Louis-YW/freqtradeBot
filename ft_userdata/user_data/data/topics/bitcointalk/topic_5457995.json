I did not find data on the maximum supply of RVO coins, the ecosystem tab on the site says that soon, it is strange that with such a voluminous whitepaper you do not have a description of the ecosystem.REVO layer 1 itself, was live in beta/alphanet since 2020, actually marketing side of it it's something we should make amend. We've been so busy actually devloping things either for clients and community that we left the promotion part aside.Ecosystem page is empty sice it's meant to be a page with links related to exchanges, swappers, services and community driven projects. You can find data related to max supply, distribuition and everything at the chapter \"Economic Model\", or a quick look can be given at https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5458047.0.For RVO we'll have a total max supply of 213,895,000 coins. GRU instead its a pretty basic token contract code, mintable, with current supply of 21,000,000,000 GRU.Contract code is pretty simple and publicly available at https://github.com/revolutionchain/anouk/blob/main/contract.solWe're a little company, trying our best with resources we have. We never got funded, never did an ICO or IPO or similar. And the best resource we have right now are blockchain core devs. Basically nerds on keyboards, not marketers yet",

Yes you have to wait full sync, since revo-qt picks up automatically contract data from the chain itself. If it's not synced atleast to the smart contract deploying date, It can't recognize its own existance. But you can join TG channel and throw in your address for airdrop anyway while you Sync!",
