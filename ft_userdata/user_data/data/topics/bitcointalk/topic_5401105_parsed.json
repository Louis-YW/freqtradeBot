  "content": "The validator on the network did not process the new block for several hours. As a result, applications built on Solana's blockchain are now offline.In recent years, Solana has been the focus of attention in the NFT and DeFi ecosystems because it is cheaper and faster to use than Ethereum. According to the website, the blockchain processes 50,000 transactions per second and the average cost per transaction is $ 0.00025. Ethereum can only process about 13 transactions per second, and transaction fees are significantly higher than Solana.However, the blockchain network was hit by multiple obstacles, and a compromise was revealed in the last year and a half. Most recently, on May 1, Solana was down for a few hours and then brought back online as well after a restart of the validator network.",

Dev said everything already solved but this keeps down anytime. How garbage this blockchain is. This is different with AVAX that never faces this problem. This blockchain is overrated. I hope that people will realize this. I know that this has a very cheap blockchain but if it gets shutdown anytime and people can't do something with their asset.",

But they should have learn their lessons in this kind of outages and fix the bugs whether it's software or hardware as they can't afford this kind of downtime. Uptime should be at least 99.99% or almost perfect. So this is not good for them in the long run, and maybe their validators might left them for good and so the price could suffer as well in the future.",

I am seeing that SOL network is being included in a lot of trading platforms already, so it is getting busy these days. They need to resolve these kind of issues as fast as they can, because they are building their integrity to the community. If this will happen very often, some may have hesitations to use their network.",

Still i also had the news about the recent outages of the Solana blockchain in the news feed of my social media accounts.I am also not really an IT expert but for me it is a pretty concerning thing, if a blockchain completely breaks down twice in only 1 month. So i am pretty surprised that the price of Solana stays relatively stable despite this news.",

The second time around means something is bad on the system and that problem needs to be address right away because you're correct, people and developer will look for a more suitable blockchain technology that don't have this kind of outages so they can have a good system on their platform, if SOL continues to be like this then it will be useless to use this blokchain since small investors will always go for the best option.",

High TBW (Total Bytes Written)        Ledger: 1TB or larger. High TBW suggested        OS: (Optional) 500GB, or larger. SATA OK        The OS may be installed on the ledger disk, though testing has shown better performance with the ledger on its own disk        Accounts and ledger can be stored on the same disk, however due to high IOPS, this is not recommended        The Samsung 970 and 980 Pro series SSDs are popular with the validator community[1] https://solana.com/validators",
