I can see in one of your screenshots that they asked you to fulfil KYC: did you do it? There is no proof there that you didn't abuse their terms or your KYC was valid, and your explanation on the case is very short.Of course, 20k is an important sum of money and you must feel really angry, but to accuse a well known casino here you should provide more evidence. I hope it will be solved, but if the ban was permanent it doesn't look good.",
