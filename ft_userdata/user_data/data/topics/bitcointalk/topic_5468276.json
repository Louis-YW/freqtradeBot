I have been away from crypto casinos until now when I founded my new site in August 2023.https://cryptophysicist.com/The site is still fairly new, so only one review has been published so far, Bspin.io: https://cryptophysicist.com/reviews/bspin-io/Please give feedback of the review to me here or to my mail: jaakko@cryptophysicist.comI would be happy to read your experiences about Bspin.io also here. I would like to add them to my review also if you have any experiences, good or bad. To keep the user reviews trustworthy, I will probably weigh experienced Bitcointalk accounts more and first add them to the review.Why I am back and how CryptoPhysicist is different from all other review sites?The internet is full of review websites and crypto casinos are no exception. The biggest problem in many review sites is trustworthiness. Almost always, the reviews sites earn affiliate income and it is hard to know if the reviews are independent and unbiased.The temptation to recommend an inferior casino can be too big to resist, especially if the casino is offering you a great affiliate deal in return (trust me, I know this happens a lot).However, my mission on CryptoPhysicist is to stay 100% independent. I will only recommend crypto casinos where I would play myself or would recommend to my friends.I will test, analyze and review all the casinos myself. Everything you see on my site is created and written by me. I don’t even use any designers (which you can probably tell), coders, content writers or translators – it is just me.If I would recommend inferior casinos or write things that are not true, you probably would be disappointed at some point and never come back to my site. So there is no intention for me to recommend casinos I wouldn’t play in myself.My aim in the long term is to create the most useful and trustworthy crypto casino review site out there. So I am not after quick short term affiliate rewards and I am not for sale for the crypto casino owners.To read more about me and the idea behind the site:https://cryptophysicist.com/about/",

Maybe even part of the entire community Although I understand you wish to market your website as one of a kind, and as much respect I have for teachers and physicists, it seems strange to add physics to your casino reviewing website brand. How does being a physicist fit into the whole theme? I myself have a physics background as well as a marketing background. You might want to work on your image a bit, since it seems to be all over the place. Concentrate on one thing at a time and prod around to see what people respond to, the most. And not just any people. You need to concentrate on getting the right audience. Posting here was a good first step.",

So I don’t see any issues with this site, as long we’ll get legit reviews and not paid reviews that will make users fall for a scam casino then I’m okay with it.",

      "body": "It is nice to see you here. I will commend you for putting up this task OP making reviews on casino sites for members here to see for themselves and decide on the best option that suits them fine. Of a truth most reviews are fabricated and fake just to get traffic to their website and funny enough these review sites benefit from the affiliation because if anyone registers through their link they have a percentage discount for them so that sometimes makes them do otherwise not minding the repercussions for such act.Nevertheless, the casino you have mentioned looks strange to me. Although it is my first time of hearing of such casino here because I am very sure their presence is not recognised here and as such looks new to members here. If you feel they are good and you have had enteraction with them and as you have said to have reviewed their casino, then you can advise them to identify here so we can know who they really are because we would really need to do our own checks as well.  If I may ask you, what mechanism do you use for reviewing a casino and do you work with team to do the review or you do it yourself? I will also want you to come up plane telling us your affiliation with the reviewed sites because it is certain that you will have bonus for anyone who registers through your website.",

I will only recommend crypto casinos where I would play myself or would recommend to my friends.This part got me. One thing that makes me not trust most review sites is their settings. They are designed in such a way that they allow casino owners or any company that wants their review to be highly rated to be on the top list. Like you said above, they offer a sum that will be hard to resist to the review site owners, and sometimes, if it's a place that allows individuals to drop their betting experience about the casino, they hire unexperienced gamblers and experienced ones to go and drop positive reviews about them on a particular review site in order for them to come among the top, which will help them achieve their goal. But if you know you will be determined enough not to take money from them and make sure that the data used in rating each casino is accessible to all for transparency purposes, then I believe you will bring a lot of positive change to the way casinos are being reviewed online, and a lot of people will trust your review and feedback judgement.",

That's why I ask you:Do you just use this bspin.io casino and how long do you use it?After I saw this bspin.io casino on your website, I researched them and saw that they have many complaints and accusations of scams, for example:https://www.trustpilot.com/review/bspin.ioSince 2020, this casino has had complaints and accusations of scam, we just need to see that this 2020 scam accusation has not been answered, and when you read all the other accusations and dates you will see that you are facing accusations from many different people. as some people have said that trustpilot is not very reliable and see that strangely there is this website:https://cryptomaniaks.com/bspin-reviewQuote from: https://cryptomaniaks.com/bspin-reviewBspin gets mostly positive reviews on sites like AskGamblers, Casino.Guru, and Trustpilot, where it ranks from good to great. The few complaints I found were mostly people crying “Scam!” with no real explanation. There are a few complaints about customer service being slow; others say they have great customer service.However, the few complaints received have not been addressed by the casino in a timely manner. Trustpilot reports that the company has not responded to complaints in the last 12 months.Bspin representatives have been active on gambling forums, but I was unable to find any recent activity there either. That being said, there really are no legitimate complaints. The majority of users are very happy with Bspin.is lying and presenting this casino as if it were honest and the complaints were not true, I say this because trustpiloto has very old complaints and the complaints have not stopped and when we look at another respectable review site like casino.guro we see more complaints:https://casino.guru/bspin-io-casino-review#tab=js-tab-reviewsIn addition to having many scam accusations against them, I also saw this:https://casino.guru/bspin-io-casino-reviewThat's another red flag",
