      "body": "Metaverse was a marketing strategy launched by crypto speculators to initiate a new hype to replace NFTs, so they could continue profiting with crypto. Anyone creating a 3D environment nowadays entitles it to be a metaverse, while in fact it already exists since the beginning of the internet with the first online multiplayer games where players could have their own customizable avatar and walk freely through different scenarios.Now that crypto market has hit a bearish season, projects in general, including metaverses slowed down a lot. It is likely many of them won't make it to the end, what is positive for crypto enthusiasts, since many investors won't lose their money investing in low potential projects.It is still a mistery, though, what metaverses are being developed to stay (and if there is any).",

I like your enthusiasm about metaverse and I believe many people will have enough time to regret not buying some of the potential ones out there.Blockchain and the crypto space is big enough to harbour any type of niche or hype (whatever is suitable) and metaverse, nft is one that will play a huge role as we progress.No doubt there are many shit fake projects pretending to be metaverse, nft but if you can also try hard to identify the ones with potential and long-term goal.",

I agree that the metaverse is a real new world in the future and I support it, which will change a large part of the ecosystem of our daily lives, from the social, economic, cultural, and even governmental spheres, but it will take time. to introduce to all corners of the world.According to me. there is no significant movement in the metaverse project at the moment, mainly due to the bear market and the world situation has not improved due to inflation and unstable geopolitics.I don't think this season is the right time to support the metaverse project, especially since many economists are speculating there will be a global recession in 2023.right?",

Just like on other trends before, regardless of their hype, potential, or being considered as a big deal in the future, always be cautious when putting money on startups. Generally, even if we see the people behind that project as serious and really good, showing extraordinary skills and their technical knowledge is really awesome, it doesn't mean that the project will end up successful in the long run.Even DYOR can't really save us from keeping away at those bad projects, but no choice but to enhance and improve our DYOR skills.",

You are right and wrong at the same time, I think metaverses developed by some of the biggest companies around the world like Meta, formerly known as Facebook, may have a future as I really think many people will use it and even get addicted to it, but metaverse projects created by independent developers like the ones we see in this market do not have too much of a future and they are nothing more but pump and dump schemes without any possibility of ever succeeding.",

I'd see the growing trend of some metaverse projects but we have to be careful choosing them because of scam issues. Maybe, just maybe this will be another big success in the crypto world as the adoption is also growing. Well, I see the current generations are having more fun in social media making these metaverses hit the market and increasing demand.In fact, it was already been talked about in our country and many are excited about this...https://mb.com.ph/2022/10/12/the-metaverse-has-arrived/",

Am almost certain the sale of projects from such big companies will be more like in-house thing or for VCs only.Metaverse ecosystem is broad with huge potentials, the way almost all big names are joining can already tell you this ecosystem has a lot to offer.There is also room for the none branded ones who have something to offer. Just as all the previous trend where full of trash pretending to be legit, there so many metaverse fake projects out there, scammers would always want to take advantage of every situation. Investors should be more smart.",

Founders and Developers of the projects must be talented no matter how much money they have or how much ambitions they got.I am not sure anymore if the whole Metaverse topic will really be the next big thing for the blockchain space. It is hard to tell at the moment because we are in a pretty heavy bear market now for several months and therefore most of the projects no matter what type of crypto project they are has suffered heavy losses. So far for me that whole metaverse thing is just one of the big hype topics of 2020 and 2021 along with Defi, play 2 earn and NFT's. Defi i think is by far the biggest and most important invention of that list. All the other topics will definitely also be still here in a few years but i doubt that one of them will the dominating topic for the whole scene.",
