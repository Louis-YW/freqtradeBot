For example the available liquidity is a big factor too.",

They are used in Forex trading, but I don't recall seeing it mentioned much in the context of bitcoin nor cryptocurrency (a forum search over the past 3 years barely brings back any references, and most are related to other contexts).Is it really a concept worth investing into learning how to user for bitcoin in any way? I'm not even aware of crypto Exchanges managing the concept operationally.",

I'm not even aware of crypto Exchanges managing the concept operationally.Used in forex, not in crypto, it tells about price variation as NeuroticFish has commented about it. Not necessary in crypto because crypto is highly volatile in price if compared with fiat like USD, unlike when comparing two strong fiat currencies like USD/GBP in which profit from traders can be in decimal price variation (I mean price fluctuating in decimal, low volatility). Not necessary at all.",

When you can detect past liquidations, you will have to do one more thing. Look at further past to see from what entries, people likely were liquidated around prices you detected on chart.It will help you to calculate potential good entries around where people likely will be liquidated. They get liquidated but you get a good entry price.They get liquidated by using leverage so you should not follow them, to be safe.",
