Of course by this you still depends on the checking of that store.I don't say you must buy a new phone to be safe because I know each person has different budget.",

Who knows maybe the previous owner place something on the recovery mode itself to hijack your phone, better to be safe than sorry. That being said, i've been using a rooted phone in the past and as long as you know what you're doing the risk is lower. But if you don't, maybe it's better to use a non-rooted phone and avoid installing suspicious apps on it. For now use your pc or something else to manage your crypto.",

      "body": "Some general opinion is that a rooted device is more insecure for applications like crypto wallets or bank apps, but it all boils down to being careful when downloading such applications and being careful about what permissions you give them on your device. It is also important that the device has all the security updates to prevent any attack vector through all the vulnerabilities that exist on Android devices (I assume you have such a device).Regarding the use of crypto wallets on smartphones, I hope you know that these should never be our main wallets where we store significant amounts, but usually hot wallets on the go where we periodically transfer smaller amounts.I personally have never unrooted a smartphone, but there are guides on how to do it, so you can read them. Of course, always be careful when doing such things, you don't want to brick your device.https://www.wikihow.com/Unroot-Android",

Rooting makes the device vulnerable to spyware that pretends to be apps, in addition, rooting will make it impossible for you to automatically update OTA from the company, and security patches, that will make your phone unsafe. We can unroot the device by reinstalling the original ROM for them, if you do not have expertise in this, you should bring the device to the nearest phone store for technical support.",

If one is really enthusiastic doing it for the hobby, s/he should just do it in another device that does not contain any sensitive information.  @OP, like everyone mentioned in here, better get that unrooted first before you attempt to do anything that would involve your money. Reformatting won't unroot your phone. You either need to flash your stock ROM from the phone's manufacturer or use a dedicated rooting tool which I used back then from my old dead phone. Just be careful though as the process might brick your phone like Lucius mentioned, but it should not be a problem as long as your phone has plenty of battery power and a reliable USB connection.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on August 28, 2022, 11:32:44 AMOn a side note, many banking application would refuse to run on rooted device.This is quite nice to know. Back then, I did not install any apps that would involve my money so I was not sure. Either way I might not install one anyway since I am scared to brick my phone and lose access to my banking apps.",

Any Danger?. It’s not dangerous if you knew what you are doing especially on installing mod software because that’s what rooted software main purpose. It bypasses the system restrictions which means you can do anything to your mobile phone software including installation of malicious software that can steal your credentials. Much better if you will not login your wallet on that phone if you are not sure on what software previously installed there.",

According to what I read about rooted devices, I will advice you not to use it.Quote from: https://www.cleverfiles.com/howto/what-is-rooted-device.html?ampA rooted device is an Android gadget that has been jailbroken to install unapproved apps, update OS, delete unwanted apps, underclock or overclock the processor, replace firmware and customize anything else. For an average mobile user, rooting a smartphone can be a sophisticated and scary process.I will not advice you to use a device which its firmware might have been changed.",

Any Danger?. Rooted Android is more volunerable to attacks because everything can be modified from the system settings so even if the playstore wants to scan the installed apps then it may not be able to but since you already formatted the device I hope every settings back to default as original so all you need to do is to avoid installing third party applications and anything you doubt that its not safe.",

Any Danger?. From what we know an android device(smartphone or tablet) is  on the whole safer than a PC connected to internet. So IMO even rooted your smartphone is certainly safer than a random PC using a common OS. Bitcoin hasn't been made to be hoarded by dwarfs and dragons into a magic vault, but to be used by anybody to pay anything. Satoshi Nakamoto whoever he use to be, designed it to be a \"Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\". So if I were you, I would only leave few mBTC on it but I would still use it. When you send your cryptos to an exchange, to a gambling site or to any platform, you face the same risk of losing your coins but nobody panics about that while the amount of funds sent is usually way larger than what you need to be brought with you for a common use.",

Any Danger?. What phone model are you using?I would not used rooted phones for anything serious, but maybe you could install something like Divest OS or Lineage OS if you want more privacy with less bloatware.Best thing would be to use any google pixel phone (even used) and you can easily install Graphene OS in no more than ten minutes, following simple instructions.Than you should add good unique password and use only open source bitcoin wallets , but I would only do this for pocket money and small amount of coins.More coins should be kept offline on cold storage of your choice.",
