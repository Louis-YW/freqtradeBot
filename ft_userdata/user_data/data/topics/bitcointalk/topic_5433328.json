If a board is put on ignore, it will not appear again through the forum home page, but what I think that happened is that BitcoinGirl.Club opened the altcoin board already before in his browser, but later put the altcoin board on ignore. If done like that, he will still be able to access the altcoin board through the altcoin board link already opened in his browser, but forgetting that he put the board on ignore.I guess some people can leave a link opened on their browser for days, weeks...",

In this case, that topic will no longer be seen at the forum main page https://bitcointalk.org/index.php because a whole board will be hidden, including that topic. However, if OP has a browser page that opened that topic before the ignore button was used, OP can still read it. Then it can cause a problem when hitting Report button.OP can still open and view that topic if he has a link too.Another problem is you can not merit any post in that topic and that board.I confirm that I can still be able to edit my post after ignoring Meta board.Sum upIf you ignore a boardYou can open a topic and view posts inside if you have a topic linkYou can edit your posts in that topic, in that board too.Posts in that board will be hidden at your post history page.You can not reply, quote, and merit any post in that board. Reply, Quote and Merit buttons are available but you will get error.",

I have many boards on ignore and after reading the responses I tried on another board results the same error.Thanks everyone for your responses and checking the error. It resolves the issue. New learning though. I will lock the topic.",
