I think other alts like XRP, FTM, and ICP will all see 20x gains soon, particularly ICP with its native BTC and ETH integration, HTTP calls making oracles obsolete, and ISO20022 integration.",

Elon alone is not enough to pull the market up, his influence on his tweets is gone, people are fed up with his manipulation so it is not working this time. Indeed, in a bear market like this, ethreum or any altcoin cannot pump itself without looking at bitcoin. The only altcoin that is going against the trend is probably XRP because of favorable news from the battle with the SEC, but I believe XRP will soon return to the general market downtrend after being pumped to take profits.",

That’s the next trend for XRP, it’s good that they actually score against SEC and yes, profit taking will be the next issue. With ETH, the hype for merge is done already and I can say that the price will stay on it’s current level because the whole market is still down.",

The issue of the US increasing interest rates has been heard since last month, but the decision has not been confirmed until now. But the news also has an impact on anyone they are reluctant to invest in crypto anymore and puts everything in doubt. Maybe we should look for other alternative income so we don't always have hope in the very confusing crypto market like it is today.",

Ethereum only pays out about 4% APY. Compare that with Cake or MAXX finance, which can pay out 80%+ staking rewards.",

If only its price will fall further and stays at $17k then I might agree with that. All btc hodlers have an urge to sell their btc's but it's kinda impossible if they will sell at these low prices. It's not beneficial at all and they might only lose if they do so, so they will just extend their patience again and continue hodling.About the eth, many of those who bought before the merge are done selling their coins while some didn't do it because they think the pump will continue after the merge. I think there will be no post merge pump that will happen but there will only be normal recoveries soon.",
