      "body": "You have a long list of ICO launchpads since you invited people to their experience on ICO launchpads I thought that I drop mine, I only used launch pad just twice just last year and so far all 6 projects I've invested are not doing good in the project, maybe it's because of the market condition or is it because I made the wrong choice of going on a trend projects.Â ICO launchpad is good but you have to pick the one that is independent when giving a rating some ICO launchpads can be bride to give projects good ratings, they are not different ICO rating sites on their heydays.ICO launchpads are good to discover new projects to be an early bird investor but you should have your own criteria to check if the projects you've discovered on ICO launchpads are worth your money.The market is over-saturated you don't have to rely on one source and you shuld have a high standard in criteria when investing in a new coin, I missed the glory days of ICO back 6 years when there are great and profitable projects coming, now all we see now are duplicate and pump and dump coins.",
