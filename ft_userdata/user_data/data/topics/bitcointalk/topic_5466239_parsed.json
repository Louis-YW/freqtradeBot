What matters is how many inputs and outputs your transaction has, which is what dictates the size of the transaction in vbytes. Also note that you should be working in virtual bytes or vbytes, rather than raw bytes. This is the value that miners pay attention to when deciding which transactions to include. 16 sats/vbyte is an appropriate fee at the moment which will put you around 1 MvB from the tip. For a 246 vbyte transaction, this would be just under 4,000 sats, which is indeed around $1.05.A 246 vbyte transaction could be transferring 0.0008 BTC or it could be transferring 8,000 BTC. It is the number of inputs which is important here, not the value of those inputs.",
