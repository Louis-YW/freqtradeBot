  "content": "American securities regulator's given permission to 11 ETFs to their list. It's including Fidelity and Invesco, Grayscale and Ark Invest. BlackRock and Fidelity updated their systems to announce fees less than 0.5% but some won't charge in early days of trading to celebrate ETF approval. ARK 21Shares (ARKB)Bitwise (BITB)BlackRock Inc (IBIT)Fidelity Investments (FBTC)Franklin Templeton (EZBC)Grayscale Investments ($GBTC)Hashdex (DEFI)Invesco Galaxy (BTCO)Valkyrie (BRRR)VanEck (HODL)WisdomTree (BTCW)They've filed accelerations requests so they'll start trading today if they're allowed. It's historic news but approval didn't make bitcoin's price go higher.",

Meanwhile, since there is many threads about the same topic, it would be better to stick in this since it seems to be the first posted in this section https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5481115.0Thank you all for confirming this, I've actually seen more than one thread talking same o. This matter and we are not sure of what to conclude on, I think now that the first thing has been achieved, we should wait to see the implications of this on the market, will it be as a quick action to reflect on the market or it will be a gradual approach to make something different, there's more to see and expect after the first achievement, but we don't actually have the right sense of where it might lead, even though this whole thing is completely something different and out of the bitcoin network.",

It may not be towards the moon, but the possibility of a correction is greater, so do not lose hope. It will take several months and we will see crazy green candles. You may find some positive analysis elsewhere but the price of Bitcoin is unpredictable.",

In fact this is a good sign because that means we still have time to buy bitcoin for ourselves and increase our potential profit, just do DCA so you're not going all in at this current price, you might regret doing an all-in when you buy at this current price.",

It can be said that bitcoin had a positive reaction to the ETfs news but it could not maintain that for long. And you're absolutely right, this correction isn't too surprising since bitcoin had been bullish for months before the ETF news was announced. People should have been careful with that instead of continuing to dream that bitcoin would go higher. Bitcoin's movement is based on buying and selling activity, not just on ETFs news, and if people pay attention to bitcoin's chart, they can see that bitcoin has risen too much and a correction is just a matter of time.",

It's surprising because btc lost value at a time when ppl talked about record price before halving so what's going to make it stop losing more value?People are now attempting to manipulate the market by using the ETF and halving as additional tools. Investors and Sec did not directly approach them for approval, and even the news they were mentioning was false. I believe they were waiting to see how the news would affect the market before claiming that they had been hacked, but I don't really believe that. Aside from the ETF, the price of bitcoin will still rise this year and set a new record high because that is what happens during every halving.Quote from: 2Pizza410000BTC on January 18, 2024, 05:46:49 AMNot What We Expected We were expecting Bitcoin ETF to go from $50K to $70K if Bitcoin ETF was approved but instead it hit a high of $48969.

Since the bitcoin ETF approval did not increase the price of bitcoin as we expected, do you think the price of bitcoin will increase after the halving?Their was actually a very high possibility that it will go higher.  And the estimation between 50-70 is correct because the market is just waiting for something to trigger it for does that are yet to buy the window is still open because if the price starts going up then the price will be the challenge for acquiring bitcoin. Since the price now is around 42900. Their is now way that the price of bitcoin will not go up. During halving it won't increase but after halving their are higher chances that bitcoin will increase in price. Continue holding till when a good profit is made.",
