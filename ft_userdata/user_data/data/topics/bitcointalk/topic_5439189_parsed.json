I suggest politics should be a peaceful practice, what do you think?In most developed nations of the world elections are held without a single bloodshed. But in most developing nations especially in Africa, elections are seen as a do or die affairs because of the desperation of most politicians. Intimidation and killings of political opponents become the order of the day. While some uninformed youths will be used to snatch ballot boxes and serve as tools to carryout electoral malpractices. Until African legal system becomes functional to punish these evil politicians, the system will continue to be bad. Until government positions becomes less attractive and corrupt,then politicians will continue to instigate violence just became of political offices. Africans must also learn not to sell thier votes to the highest bidder. People most vote candidates based on competence and not because of how much he can pay for a vote or his tribe.",

For me, politics is the cause of all conflicts in the world today, the division of power, property, and war, all from the competition of politicians. There are many things we will never see, but I believe that politics is the fiercest battle. Not only bloodshed, but the blood of millions of people even the lives of a nation will have to be sacrificed if it is in their favour. Politics would never exist without bloodshed, I never dared to think of such a promising future.",

Bloodshed feels like a way of the world and I would say, it is far less in politics than as it was in the days of old. This doenst make it any much an adorned practice as no human should lose his life at the expense of someone else's desire to lead.It's no secrete that there are more bloodshed in some nations than the others in a quest to to archive this but, some battles are fought on the sidelines and goes unaccounted for on the quest.",

We have deviated from the main purpose of politics and turned it into something else entirely. We the masses, especially the ignorant once are being used as political tools by this same leaders they vote into office to serve them, they use them and dump them after every election and still they don’t learn from the past. The leaders equip them with arms and give them hardened drugs to make them feel immortal, hence they could kill a soul without feeling remorseful of it at all.

Yes, politics is not only related to bloodshed, but politics is closely related to bloodshed, war, willing to do anything to achieve that is how politics exists. And I also agree with you more, America is the most bloodshed country in this world. Without bloodshed, they would never have been able to maintain their position as the world's No. 1 power until now. Politics in America is considered the messiest I've ever seen.",
