      "body": "Can you share the links though? Because I'm thinking, what kind of fake token this scammers used? And I think the sell will be voided by law because it's obvious that he didn't pay it. So the lesson here is to really first everything first before accepting any transaction that involved something like this. In the first place, if seller is not aware then why would he accept crypto in the first place? There are a lot more questions that answer in this case. And that is why it's better to get the whole story first as to what transpired and how this criminals pulled this scam so that we are going to be warned at least and know the MO.",

A lawyer that will notarized the deed of sale will surely question this kind of transaction so how did story actually happened.Please provide link to the source to verify the authenticity of this story because it’s so hard to believe that this kind of story will actually happened in real life especially the amount of money involved is very huge for this kind of risky trade to slide.",

      "body": "Tried looking for it with a quick lookup but I couldn't find it. This is highly unlikely imo for real estate since they don't necessarily accept crypto as payment in general, they only accept fiat and even if they actually did accept crypto, you'd understand that they have at least some form of understanding about the crypto scene. Now if these \"fake tokens\" were actually valued at the start of the purchase but dropped at some point which lead to the value dropping to zero, I think the real estate agent would be at fault (since they should know about the volatility of crypto at the point when they actually accepted it as payments). It'd be a different thing if it really was a fake token though and for some reason, the agent still accepted the purchase.",

Where is the proof that he is the owner? Kinda case that gets solved easily in courts.I think they say you can't put something on nothing and you think it will stand. This means the matter is going to end in litigation in the court. If the seller will confirm and proof that he received some fake token in payment of his house, the buyer may have to forfeit what he has benefited. This is a matter that will be settled in court and the fact it should involve lots of money.",

Do you have any proof OP with regards to this one? because buying a house will take a lot of documents but if that scammer really great on scamming people, then it can be more easy for him/her especially if the property is located Rural area, but I still doubt about this story. If buying property can easily be acquired like this, I think there's something wrong with the system on that country and needs to be address or else many will still fall on this kind of scheme. If you are not into crypto yet, don't trust any token or anyone that is sending crypto as their mode of payment, this is too risky.",

These only proves that the seller has huge amount of money, so he doesn’t really care, or else he wanted to get rid of the house.Nevertheless this is not new to us that someone got scammed due to this token shit. And I can still see that many people are running to hold as many tokens as they can.Only show interest in tokens which are backed up by famous personalities. Beware of scam.",
