  "content": "I plan to bet more again in the coming season. In the past, I've mainly done that on regular crypto betting sites, but they are increasingly regulated and some of them are no longer accessible in many countries. I am therefore looking for a decentralized crypto betting site that ideally works via oracles and smart contracts. Has anything happened in this area in the last few years, and if so, which sites can you recommend?",

      "body": "Not quite sure which ones are legitimate and operational, but I doubt that this area of betting is something already developed wherein you can have a great experience on them. While true that most crypto casinos are slowly getting regulated, you still can't deny that they are still highly reliable and are, for the most part, trustworthy. There is one platform that I came across which markets itself as the first true dapp casino, but I kinda forgot which platform it is. They don't seem to have any announcement here in this forum, too, so I doubt they are that popular at all.",
