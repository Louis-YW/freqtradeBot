  "content": "Introduction:Glory, Glory to Bitcoin. A young technology that was welcomed with lots of criticism and skepticism just like electricity,  television, the Internet and many other technologies when they were  new. Many thought that Bitcoin will not last up to a decade, infact Bitcoin was classified as a major ponzi scheme and even till now  many people are still not able to understand Bitcoin, neither do they trust it. Despite all the attacks, Bitcoin has not stopped proving all those who distrusted it wrong, Bitcoin kept winning amidst fights from individuals, corporate bodies and even the government. In this article, I will outline some of the fears and doubts of people about Bitcoin that Bitcoin has defeated over the time.Fear/DoubtsHow Bitcoin overcame__________________________________________________________________________________1. Bitcoin is a bubbleBitcoin has experience many crashes which was supposed to be a point at which the bubble will burst, but after every crash Bitcoin will grow stronger and even recording a new all time high, thereby continually sending shame to its obituary writers __________________________________________________________________________________2.Bitcoin will be hacked Many people, especially those who doesn't understand the Bitcoin network has the fear that bitcoin will be hacked. Although,  exchanges,  mixers, personal wallets can be hacked but the bitcoin network has proven to be very secured. The decentralized nature of bitcoin and the PoW protocol makes it unhackable.  __________________________________________________________________________________3. Bitcoin consumes much energy Gone are the days that enemies of bitcoin use it's energy consumption against it. These days, miners are shifting to renewable energy sources. With this, there is no more fear or concern about energy consumption and the safety of man's ecosystem__________________________________________________________________________________4. Bitcoin will be banned  In the early days of Bitcoin,  there was serious fear that Bitcoin will be banned by the government but now Bitcoin has proven that it cannot be banned by the whole government of the world since there is no central government deciding for the whole world. While one country is trying to ban it, another country like El Salvador is making bitcoin a legal tender.__________________________________________________________________________________5. Bitcoin is used only by criminals In the early days of Bitcoin, it was seen as a tool by criminals, money launderers and kidnappers to make  payments without being caught. But in the real sense, Bitcoin network is so transparent that paying with cash is more safe than paying with bitcoin. However, institutions have adopted Bitcoin. Bitcoin is used for purchases and has been used by many companies as payment method. So the idea that bitcoin is being used by criminals has been defeated by Bitcoin__________________________________________________________________________________6. Bitcoin is not scalable  while it has been a general notion and a problem to Bitcoin about its scalability, the developers working on the Bitcoin open source are not relenting in solving this problem.  Today we have layer two solutions like lightning network that has tackled the issue of scalability. We have the implementation of segregated witness (segwit) that has also lightened the block weight, we do hope for future upgrades. __________________________________________________________________________________7. Bitcoin will be defeated by a better altcoinThere have been some concerns that due to some limitations in Bitcoin network that a better altcoin would someday or some time outperform Bitcoin. But it is over a decade and we are yet to have an altcoin that is as secured as Bitcoin and that is 100% decentralized.  Inasmuch as some altcoins have some better advantages over Bitcoin in some certain aspects but in general,  there is no altcoin and none in view to overtake bitcoin. __________________________________________________________________________________8.  Institutions will never adopt BitcoinMany people said due to the volatility of Bitcoin, institutions will never adopt it and therefore global adoption is not possible. But this year, we have seen a great ETF approval and many institutions getting into Bitcoin. Bitcoin has successfully defeated that myth.__________________________________________________________________________________9.  Bitcoin can never function as a currencyIt is true that the vast majority of bitcoin users now use bitcoin more as an asset for investment than currency,  but that does not negate the fact that bitcoin can also serve as a currency.  We have seen people buy houses,  buy lands, buy products online and even gamble with bitcoin as currency and some countries have also adopted bitcoin as a legal tender where the citizens buy goods and services with bitcoin. __________________________________________________________________________________10.  Bitcoin has no real use case There has been fear and doubt that bitcoin has no real use case and is intangible therefore, it will likely collapse.  But Bitcoin has proven that it has a use case such as store of value, investments,  cross border transactions and many more. So, as Bitcoin evolves, the more the use case of bitcoin keeps emerging.In conclusion, Bitcoin has gone through lots of phases where it kept improving , thereby infusing more trust and confidence in the hearts of it's adopters. We should not be surprised that the number of bitcoin supporters are increasing as the day goes by because the doubts and fears in the hearts of many have been cleared, we are hoping for a glorious future with Bitcoin.",

The current fear is about new ATH, and maybe next week it might change, so make a decision by considering the long-term perspective. Nothing is impossible, 67k was impossible but Bitcoin did it, similar to that look forward.TBH, I got this thread's link from the help & beginners section, no matter what your presentation is cool.",

I too have never come across any information or content as regards to bitcoin having no real use case, aside from the blockchain that you talked about, the bitcoin white paper which most of us are familiar with, deals extensively on the usecases of bitcoin, and from the beginning, many of us know that Bitcoin is a currency, used for peer to peer transactions amongst the holders of the cryptocurrency, and was also introduced as a means through which holders can easily without delays and high fees, send money abroad and across different countries of the world easily without any intermediaries or third parties.This are common usecases that any one interested In bitcoin should already know about or be aware of from the onset, it's absolutely funny to assume that anyone will believe that bitcoin doesnt have a use case, how then was Lazlo able to by two pizzas with 10,000 bitcoins in 2010 of bitcoin lack usecase?.",

Perhaps what the OP's referring as used case is that Bitcoin has no real life usage. But we all know that Satoshi originally designed it as payment scheme. But it evolved in the last ten years or so. And so it's really wrong to say that it doesn't have a use case. We can even say that it give birth to crypto base online platform.For sure some old gamblers here will attest that you just need a Bitcoin address for deposit and withdrawal and you will go totally (pseudo)anonymous. And definitely, now it's a investment vehicle, we have institutions and whales and who's who on the market right now.",

Since most think that Bitcoin is a bubble, it is obvious that they think that it will not have use case.  Aside from that, those people who are intentionally downgrading Bitcoin, they will obviously spread the word about Bitcoin having no use case but just some speculative investment that can crash anytime.  With over the decade of Bitcoin history, many had gained profit and many also losses in this Bitcoin trade but we cannot blame that on Bitcoin since it is the person's decision to sell early than have patience and reap a great reward.That said, Bitcoin had proven again and again that it has a real-life case use but those who have ill-intention, even though knows it, refuse to recognize it.",

Thanks once again.@Accardo and @Fivestar4everMVP, what I meant by Bitcoin not having a real use case is the myth that bitcoin is for speculative purposes only.

Most of the explanations in this post are valid and the presentation makes it more interesting. Bitcoin has suffered many obituaries. There have been several predictions that Bitcoin will not exist for more than a particular year, but Bitcoin has even outlived some of the predictors. The negative perspective about Bitcoin is changing rapidly because awareness is growing in many countries.  The government and other institutions are now seeking means to bring Bitcoin under their control via regulatory laws. The new phase of government attack is no more ban but strict regulations which might undermine the main goal of Bitcoin. Another challenge to the use of Bitcoin as a currency is seasonal attacks on the network by ordinals which make transaction fees go very high. This might discourage people from adoption.",

Renewable energy is good, but do not forget that it costs a lot to set up renewable energy for Bitcoin mining, we are talking about millions here, do the math, a BTC Asic miner takes 2800watts to 3200watts to run, a single solar panels and inverter with batteries that will let this miner run 24/7 is insanely high already, that's just for a single Asic miner. It cost me $2,300 to build a 2000 watts solar setup with four tubular batteries three years ago, and today it cost even more, with this setup I can't even run any Bitcoin Asic miner, remember an Asic miner takes 3000+ watts to run, do the math. Renewable energy for mining Bitcoin will cost arms and legs, suited for organizations that are already rich and also remember that the ROI will take longer than expected, it will take years down the road.",
