      "body": "It depends on the type of document you need. For example, my friend has a firm registered in Lithuania and he is from the UK, so he needed to translate most of his papers in Lithuanian. He went to a translation agency and got everything done in a day. There're also other types of documents like I have - CMR documents/waybills. These papers are difficult to draw by yourself and you have to ask for help or find an example of this document and fill it with your information. However, not all of the examples on the internet are right, so I use https://supercmr.com/ to avoid mistakes and to keep my data safe.",
