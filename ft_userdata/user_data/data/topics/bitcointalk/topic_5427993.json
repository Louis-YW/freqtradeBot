      "body": "OP if i can get you right what you're trying to do is laying an accusation on a crypto exchange on bitcoin discussion which is absolutely wrong, we have boards assigned for each category of discussion matters, yours could fit in on reputation or you go to scam accusation should in case you have that strong conviction the exchange scammed with proofs, and if you're talking about exchanges in general and not an accusation was your intention, then beginners and help, economics or altcoins discussion boards can best fit in for your discussion.",

I don't think that many users on bitcointalk have actually heard about this exchange, if any at all. Specially when searching it on coinmarketcap it is near the bottom of the list (176 out of 240) of exchanges with a very low daily volume which means not that many users actually know about or use this service!In any case this is the wrong board as @Doan9269 pointed out. Use the move topic button at the bottom of this page to move it.",

What else can you expect from such an exchange? Running advertisements or signature campaigns on the forum does not prove the legitimacy of an exchange. However, belief in exchange has become difficult in nowadays. The majority of them are quite shady. Simply be cautious.",

I have heard the name for the first time; probably because I wasn't much active lately. But many of the forum members haven't heard about it I guess as I can see few replies from the above.Your complain here without any of their bitcointalk account or without the announcement thread doesn't mean anything. They ahave nothing to lose here LOL.",

      "body": "@saotchynakamuro If you want us to do something about it and potentially stop their signature campaign, you will have to provide more evidence. Its not just enough to mention their alleged CEO, list of his ex companies and say that he is a con artist, without providing some proof that he was behind scams. So please put some effort into this and make a proper scam accusation post in which you will provide as much info as possible.

Anyway, I couldn't find this Crypton Exchange on either Coingecko or CMC. What I could find though is their token called Crypton.",
