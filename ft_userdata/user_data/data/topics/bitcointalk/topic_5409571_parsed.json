This could very well be a dead cat jump. Maybe the real crash hasn't happened yet. That's what Michael Burry (The Big Bear) says at least. Either way it is always the same. Up, down, sideways.Some claim they've seen it going backwards too but I've never experienced it. I think it is ridiculous. How the fuck markets could go backwards? It is against the physics.",

So far there has been about 5 attempts to push the price lower and they have all failed which is another good indication.Price also tries going back up and fails but each time sets a higher low which is another positive indicator.",

A bull run that will be so big that it will change the nature of Bitcoin? Seriously?If you ask me, the next bull market is going to be....a bull market and nothing else. I'm 99% sure that the next bull market is going to be followed by price corrections, bear markets and all that stuff. This is the true volatile nature of Bitcoin and it will never change.The price will keep going up and down. Maybe the future cycles are going to be bigger than that the old cycles, in terms of price levels and market cap. We might be witnessing a 100K price or more in the next years. OR maybe Bitcoin will stay in the 20K-60K price range forever and the 2021 ATH was the absolute price peak. Who knows?",

All this will probably affect the extended bear market, and possibly a new bottom, regardless of the fact that many think that we have completely got away with it.Inflation hit the middle class and the poor the most, because prices really went wild and some food products are even 100% more expensive, not to mention the price of fuel, electricity, gas or electricity. I think that the average person today has nothing or very little left after paying all the expenses, and therefore cannot invest in anything including Bitcoin.",

In addition, they can also try to find other benefits with price fluctuations that keep changing up and down. So they can buy low and sell high.",

Something we still don't know when it ends is the bearish period. Although the bearish season is very possible to end in 2024 (BTC halving on May 2024), it can end sooner or later for some reasons. IMHO, there is no certainty in crypto world and there is no guarantee that the history will repeat. So, always be wise to use our funds, even the current Bitcoin price is already around $23k - $24k, it is still possible to drop again below $20k.",

There's a small chance, maybe that 20% you're talking about, that we hit 6k of 2018 by being at 23k and a crash to 3k which would be something like 12k-15k range. To be honest this ranges are pretty similar if we look at what the price is doing, but also very different because we did not go to 4k then back to 6k and again to 3k, like this year when we hit a low and returned back to the 200 week average. To be honest this year looks very unnatural on the charts like the selling pressure is too high, the highest ever in history actually. You can see that it's a manipulated crash made by all those dumps of Tera and Tesla et al.",
