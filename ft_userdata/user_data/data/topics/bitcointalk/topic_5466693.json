Some of us used a exchange wallet to save their coins and some times the newbies like us does not know the important of securing our wallet, I'm making this post because of my level mates that is ignorant of important of security in a wallet address. Many of us uses a remintano exchange wallet address to save our coins why they does not have a good quality of security like having a seed phrase in their wallet to security the coins.I brought this seed phrase matters to our local board so that we may realize our mistakes should in case some of us do keep coins in exchange, is not good to keep coins in exchange because when the exchange is on maintenance and without proper notification to the users of the exchange platform they will not have access to make withdrawal in the platform, and another thing that come to my mind is that keeping coins in exchange is at your own risky because the exchange can be hacked and your funds will not be find.I will like us to be using a wallet that have a seed phrase like Electrum wallet and other wallets you know that have a strong security to save your coins so that it will not be hacked or taken by another person. And it's good to secure our seed phrase and not to expose our seed phrase to the public because some of the seed phrase when you see another person's seed phrase you can import the wallet from another device and a coins in that particular wallet can be withdrawn to another wallet without your consent.Some of us that complained of missing of coin in a wallet, it happens that why it happened that coins missed in a Wallis because of exposing of seed phrase to the public, if we avoid storing our information on Internet and in our emails our seed phrase will not be exposed. This should be recommended for some one that want to save bitcoin 1. Ledger 2. Bitcoin core3. Ledger Nano4. Bitpay5. Crypto.com l DeFi Wallet6. Electrum",

Although , it is a good wallet. If you are not from Switzerland, you are not affected. Bitcoin enthusiasts are not in support of AOPP. I support full control and privacy, I will not recommend the wallet.If you are having little amount of bitcoin, you can go for online wallet. If you are using an online wallet, your seed phrase and private key are online. Code storage are more secure and safei. If you want to hold huge amount of coins, it is better to go for cold wallet.

Ledger and Ledger Nano are still the same wallets that you are referring to, they are one of the worst wallets so far. Not recommended.It is worth to know that Bitcoin Core or running your own Electrum server will require downloading of bitcoin blockchain which will require almost 500 gigabyte of data. It also needs around 5 to 10 gigabytes daily. This may not be the best choice for people in Nigeria because of poor electricity.",

This may not be the best choice for people in Nigeria because of poor electricity.We're talking about downloading 14 years of Bitcoin transaction history. Downloading Bitcoin core needs a good system speed, a good hard drive, and a solid internet connection. Do not even try to download Bitcoin core in Nigeria if you do not have a starlink internet connection. You might spend 2 weeks or months on a standby download using your Glo or MTN connection to be able to download Bitcoin core. It is possible to complete the task in 24-48 hours with a good system and hard drive and a solid internet connection. It is not necessary to run one. However, running a node benefits the network and increases your privacy.",

You might spend 2 weeks or months on a standby download using your Glo or MTN connection to be able to download Bitcoin core.It is not necessary to run one. However, running a node benefits the network and increases your privacy. It depends on your locations. There is MTN and Airtel 5G in Nigeria. Downloading it with 4G is not bad either if you have good internet connection in your area, but obviously it will take longer time. My MTN 4G router can reach up to 3 mbps in daytime, and more than 5 to 7 mbps at night, up to 13 mbps. 1 or 2 weeks to download it is not bad, almost 500 gigabyte is not small. Starlink is too expensive. If you are in a good MTN 5G location, it has been reportedly faster than Starlink, but it is not what we should compare because they are both supper fast, but Starlink has the advantage to reach more locations and hidden areas where MTN and others data providers in Nigeria may not reach with their services. If anyone do not want to download the whole blockchain, he can go for prune node. But downloading the full blockchain is better. After downloading the full blackchain and setting up the wallet or after setting up a prune node, all you need daily is not more than 10 gigabytes, 4G can handle that excellently, if the network is good.",

I think you still have to download the whole blockchain if you don’t have a trustworthy third party directory, it only saves up space  on the drive and it has its own limitations like one cannot import a private key or an address to bitcoin core because it needs to verify the entire history of that key again and by so will have to download everything again, so prune node can only be use with a new wallet and can’t accept importations and that to me is not convenient. Rather than a prune node how about just settling for a light or SPV wallet that has good reputation like the electrum you suggested first. Once you can’t run full node on bitcoin core better to just forget it entirely.",

However saving or keeping of assets in or with a third party exchange is not in anyways advisable as you have no ownership access to your assets because you do not have the keys to your wallet so therefore to be on the safe side every one is advised to have a well secured wallet just as listed above by our reputable member here  and remember this phrase \" not your keys, not your coin\" this would give you a clear understanding of how the wallet system works.Creating a wallet, you must definitely get a seed phrase which would serve as keys to your personal wallet. With it you can access your assets saved on it wherever you are around the world but if lost, your assets is lost forever. So one would need to be careful how they handle their seed phrase. So if you dey download wallet make you do well download better wallet wey get strong security features so that hackers no go fit enter your wallet through backdoor steal your funds and assets and too no too dey keep assets with third party exchange because Dem no go fit guarantee you your assets safety as e be say Dem dey prone to hack.

You see all those people wey dey use wallet like trust wallet (sorry) unless you no care about the security of your funds or Cz monitoring you no wahala but if you dey find full control use anyone wey get all the features wey I list above and more decentralized features.

      "body": "Utilizing a custodial wallet that you do not have access to its private key to store your Bitcoin is not a good practice because if anything happens to that centralized exchange like a hack you will not have access to your assets, and you will lose your assets if the centralized exchange can no longer pay it customers. Using Bitcoin comes with the risk of protecting your wallet from being compromised. When looking for a wallet to store your Bitcoin choose a noncustodial wallet that gives you full access to your Bitcoin any time you feel like accessing it, like an \"electrum wallet\" or the ones mentioned above. A wallet holds a piece of secret information called a private key or seed phrase it is your responsibility to protect your wallet's private key or seed phrase after creating a wallet and never share it with anyone. You can back up your wallet with a USB key, paper, and CDs and keep it in a location only known to you, with a wallet backup you can easily recover your wallet when you lose your device.",

It is good that after creating your noncustodial wallet that you write down your seed phrase on a paper and keep them in a safe place, in three or more different locations where you can reach alone.I love the idea of writing it on a steel plate because it is fire proof and water proof, unlike paper that can easily be affect by water and fire. Your seed phrase is your coins and that is why you must keep it away from third party to avoid wallet compromise.",
