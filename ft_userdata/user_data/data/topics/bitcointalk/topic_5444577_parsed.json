  "content": "I come from a hard-core farming family, and we are all involved in agriculture. I was able to get ( inherit) an acre of land from my parents, and I started my cocoa farming business in 2010. Since then, it has improved greatly, and I have been able to purchase a sizable amount of Bitcoin with the business, even though it is seasonal and can produce both good and bad results.Although I did everything in my power to increase business adoption of cryptocurrencies, I gave away some Bitcoin and some other coins too, and Bitcoin was my primary goal to use as means of exchange , yet, I have failed badly.Those who buy bags of cocoa from my farm are older illiterate people, I wasted my energy,  trying to even tell them the benefits that comes with paying with Bitcoin, they are not even ready to take advantage of my discount, then I stopped. In 2020, two special buyers are now handled by younger guys, the sons, I thought I will be able to handle them and make Bitcoin payment a possibility,  it still doesn't work, these young lads are just like their old men. So I give up, I decided to talk about this because I still find it hard to believe that no where in this world of agriculture is accepting Bitcoin as means of payment.  Is there anyone into agriculture and farming that are accepting Bitcoin? What advice do you have for me at this point?Should I just give up for now and wait for the future maybe when Bitcoin gets more popular? Or Bitcoin and farming makes no sense together?",

      "body": "If I were a cocoa buyer, why should I be paying in Bitcoin? Yes, there is a discount, but is that discount big enough that somebody who is not familiar with it will go through all the hassles just to be able to pay in something they don't have any inkling of?If I were you, I'd rather not insist on my buyers to use Bitcoin. If they're using cash, they're probably more convenient with it. I don't know which country you are from, but here, those who are in agriculture, especially those who are really on the ground, are the ones who are least techy. There's no point convincing them to use Bitcoin rather than cold cash.",

      "body": "I know how frustrating it is after putting much efforts in achieving something and at the entire end it seems nothing is showing up, your efforts seems to be in vain. I understand your pain mate but you should know most elderly do not have that idea what bitcoin is. They are skeptical about it as they are not digitally inclined to be knowledgeable about it. You convincing them is a waste of time and another is their occupation, farmers spend their time mostly in the farm and resent to digital technology. They think it is a waste of time when all they do is virtually manual labor except for those into mechanised farming. The poor rural farmers would not think about bitcoin because they do not know what it is except the mechanised farmers who are exposed to technology.You should better not stress yourself trying to convince the local farmers because they still would not give in except they show interest in it by themselves. I have come to realize one thing about humans that convincing a fellow who is not interested in something would never give in only when they pick interest in it or they are open to learning new things that is when they would give you a listening ear otherwise forget about it they would not listen to you. What I would advise you to do is to make bitcoin payment optional for them and continue your trading with a little enlightenment on bitcoin to them gradually the ones ready will definitely pick interest.",

Or Bitcoin and farming makes no sense together? From my understanding you haven't lost any money, maybe some time, but that's all. That's not really \"failed too severely\" imho, I think that you're too harsh with yourself.Now to your question: keep in mind that there are still a huge lot of people, many even into IT for example, who don't care about bitcoin. So expecting people in farming getting instantly interested into bitcoin is unrealistic.Even more, if they don't invest into bitcoin (don't trust it) and if they don't actually need to use bitcoin (because they can transfer money via banks and similar institutions), it's not unusual they won't care about your goals/interests.Sadly, if there is banking infrastructure available, people tend to care (especially at first) only of bitcoin-as-investment (if at all) than of bitcoin-as-money.So it's not so much about farming. It's more about what (infrastructure) the people have around them and whether they are interested in investing in this or not. I find this somewhat similar to us (humans in general) looking out for alien life. It's rather unlikely to find that, but that doesn't stop us keep searching and not seeing the lack of results as a \"severe failure\".But it's your time and energy, so it's up to you whether you give up or continue. I will add only one small detail: when a new bull run/FOMO bubble will start, people will become much more interested in bitcoin than they are now. But if they'll invest then, there's a reasonable chance (depending on how late they invest) they'll be at a loss in the following crypto winter (and may blame that to you).",

      "body": "I know what you're trying to accomplish is very good, but to me I feel those people should accept Bitcoin willingly rather than then using because they'll receive some discount from your business. What then will happen when you no longer offer discount to those that are using Bitcoin? Since at the beginning they adopted Bitcoin due to the fact that you incentive the usage of Bitcoin and when that option is no longer available they are surely going to abandon it. Another concern is their age, how sure are you that they will be able to handle losses? From the business you're running I'm not sure if they will have enough funds to cover/sustain and continue doing their business when the market condition is not good. So you should respect their decision of using fiat since they're more comfortable with it.",

What can you do if two old people just want to buy some cocoa then you will ask them to pay with bitcoin which they have no idea what is it. You can simply put a sign \"bitcoin payment accepted here\" so people may have an idea with bitcoin. You already said that you're doing good in your business, you can still invest in bitcoin without asking your customer to use bitcoin as payment. Because if we say \"bitcoin\" people would think that is a part of crypto which they have no idea and wouldn't risk to try it. Why would they hassle themselves if they can pay normally right? Don't give up, farming is hard but its a good business which I respected a lot since they help to supply needs for people.",

Your problem is actually that you expect that these people should pay in Bitcoin, regardless of the fact that they may be ordinary peasants who are poorly educated and work in the fields from morning to night. The thing is very simple, you add the option of paying in Bitcoin, and you tell people that this option exists - everything else you do in this regard seems to put pressure on customers and maybe they will stop doing business with you in the future.After all, you can always use your earnings to buy Bitcoin. You are overcomplicating things that should be quite simple.",
