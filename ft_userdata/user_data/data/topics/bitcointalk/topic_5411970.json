Around 379$ a day.Each coin has its own difficulty, right now Bitcoin is at 30,9T and that will be the one till the readjustment in two weeks. The pool that you linked doesn't even show Bitcoin, it only shows the two clones, cash and sv, so where do you see that lower difficulty?And where did you get those 379$ a day from...God, I have more questions for you than you have for us! EditWhen you're talking about a lower difficulty you mean minimal accepted difficulty for miner settings,  the \"d=\" value?",

There is literally a HUGE difference in difficulty between them...Yes, pools do set a work difficulty for the shares they send to a miner but that has very little to do with current BTC block difficulty. They are 2 different things ref https://kano.is/index.php?k=workdiff",

Difficulty is a value that determines how it's difficult to mine a block and that's the same number for anyone trying to mine bitcoin regardless of which pool they have joined. Each pool has its own pool/work difficulty because it makes no sense for the pool to process every share your miner finds, it also makes no sense to just submit a share that beats the network difficulty, so pools want you to submit as fewer shares as possible but they still want you to submit enough shares so they can pay you accordingly.Quote from: 1n4ho12 on September 01, 2022, 06:32:47 PMAs mentioned, I used to mine on BlockMasters and it has a difficulty of 9050 which gave me a good profit.Well, using a low difficulty pool just means it accepts more shares from your miner, which is useful in determining your hashrate faster than on pools with larger difficulty, but then when it comes to profit it won't change, because a share at 9050 diff is worth half the share submitted at 9050*2, so at 9050*100 diff you just need to submit 1 good share instead of 100 at 9050.In some rare cases when using very slow mining hardware, using a lower diff is better since your miner might not find a larger share and won't get paid at all, but if that's the case, it means even at a lower diff your miner isn't making \"any profit\", and honestly, if you have to worry about pool diff it means you are using the wrong gear for the right coin.",
