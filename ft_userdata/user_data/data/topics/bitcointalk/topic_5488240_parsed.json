Thanks in advance.Well I guess you're  trying to find the statistics for number of  accelerated transaction. Most accelerated transaction  are   transaction  with less fee to the require minimum fee on the  mempool and are mostly  done buy those who have no knowledge about how transaction works ,exchange wallets,  and bounce back transaction (still related to exchange wallet) so the statistic kind of get high when the mempool gets congested Apart from these, then you mean how does accelerated transaction works generally.Else:: I have no idea what you mean",

I'm trying to find whether it increases month-by-month, Your transaction fee and the priority chosen is what determines your first acceleration, if you make use of a lower fee, you are more likely to fall on a long queue waiting, you will determine the acceleration to your transaction from the fee rate you choose to pay, if i get your question right. Quote from: Greg Tonoski on March 09, 2024, 06:36:45 PMat what rate and how many tx out of the total (in a block) are accelerated. Approximate values would do. Thanks in advance.I should get something from here, when making a transaction acceleration, each block confirming your transaction or which quired withing that your ow share of transaction is included will bear the same rate of transaction fee as required with that specific time and your transaction was included to a specific block because it meet up with the required fee rate for that particular time needed to get your transaction confirmed along with others on the same block, you can read more or chain reorg. https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-is-chain-reorganization-in-blockchain-technology",

      "body": "This is probably very hard to calculate.Reason being is that a low fee transaction usually is bumped off the mempool. Or it’s never even broadcasted with most nodes.Then if the sender uses RBF then it appears like a new transaction. Only certain nodes can tell that it was accelerated with a higher fee because they see 2 transactions which might trigger a double spend.",

Thanks in advance.I'm not the smartest when it comes to this but from my experience when you use Lower translation fees you get to wait longer for your transaction to be approved, so i guess you have to use a higher transaction fee but I think there are ways around this tho, you should ask on the development and technical board.Yes your talking about lightning network stuff.",

Since the Miner is the one who includes these Transactions in a Block.  The only variable is how many Transactions they decide to accelerate per Block now versus how many they used to.But then, other than zero Fee Transactions that are included in the Block, I do not see how we could check and create some sort of chart or percentage, even if approximated, on how many Transactions are accelerated.  This would be too speculative and unless the speculated percentages are very tight, I believe the chance of properly checking how many are accelerated now versus years ago is close to null.",
