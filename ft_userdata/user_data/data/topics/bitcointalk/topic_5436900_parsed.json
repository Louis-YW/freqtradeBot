  "content": "Hi.Please treat seriously. There are a lot of satellites, flying at orbit. Also, there is still no publicly available technology stack, allowing to scan brain activity remotely. But, as a regular Earth human being, i assume there're both technologies and people using them in a way nobody knows about. Beginning with very private labs, factories and other units, up to military groups and governmental mils. This fact makes me seriously worry about availability of my brain to be freely scanned by satellites, running at Earth orbit.So long, does it become totally insecure to use passwords? Or worse, any tools, which involve our feelings and memory usage at all? Cause if user uses passwords, then ofc he needs to 1) imagine pass, 2) enter it, 3) remember it. All these actions are technically visible, as long as brain emits (otherwise we wouldn't be able to do MRI and other scans in clinics). Just assume, if there's somebody, who knows how to capture brain emission remotely, and knows how to interpret it to obtain data, that user 1) imagines, 2) enters and 3) remembers.How user may secure his bitcoins, considering all the above? I mean is there any software way to keep bitcoins safe, without knowing or even seeing any sensitive data, keeping able to initialize wallet and send/receive transactions? Or maybe any hardware advice?",

This will be more like an encryption. I tried and this unfortunately doesn't work at all. I need to obtain bitcoin wallet and do transactions. Maybe somebody knows some hardware solution i can use without involving my memory and vision at all? Something i can buy and use instead of password? Perfectly if private key is stored directly on that device. Or maybe i can use one device as private key and another one as a key to the first one, so i don't need to enter (thus know) any passwords and cannot see my private key (so it cannot be leaked through eyes). Please help!",

In such a case, how to secure my fucking bitcoins? You can't their technology is far beyond our understanding, so there is no way we could protect ourselves from them satellites. Best course of action for you is to sell and use a bank, though they could read the minds of bank owners, therefore even banks are insecure.One possibility comes to mind, going underground to hide and live there, there is an entrance toÂ  the hallow earth, there are advanced creatures living out side the range of those satellites. ___________________________________________________I'd like to use this platform to make a request to the guys in the sky scanning brains, \" could you guys give me the private keys for puzzles 65 up to 160?\" Also do you guys ( rather girls ) have Onlyfans?ðŸ˜‹ I could pay for special session after you give me the coins.

Currently there is no solution for most people in here , even techy wise , and you are asking for answers to an extreme problem that has no real basis . We use mnemonics and passwords because there is no evidence that the technology you mentioned exists . MRI scans can only reveal the structure of the brain, not the detailed thoughts in a person's mind .Â  It's like asking if a fart by the sea can smell like a shipwreck.
