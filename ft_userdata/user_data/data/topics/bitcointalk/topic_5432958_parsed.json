This is a miner for the Aleo coin.Releaseshttps://github.com/damomine/aleominer/releasesv2.2.41. The performance of the 30 series is increased by 10%+ and the performance of the 20 series is increased by 15%+ while the CPU requirement is further reduced.2. Support auto switch proxy line function3. Miner API support, easy to connect to cluster management and monitoring tools.Who has already tested? How are the changes?P.S. miners says about increasing the hashrate on the RTX 3080 from 2120 to 2390 H.https://t.me/koliamainer/8541",

In some system environments, there may be 10G video memory cards that cannot work (video memory explosion). You can use version 2.3.0 to reduce video memory footprint.https://t.me/koliamainer/8565",

I can only buy 8 core processors for my motherboards, but I'm not in a hurry yetI think then this is a big limitation for this coin,Ethereum when it first came out it didn't need such a powerful PC and everybody had a chance to mine with for example HD 7870 from Radeon as one of the best GPU-s at that time but only this was an expensive part which could be run even in a dual core motherboard/computer.The fact that this coin asks for such big requirements will only make people who may be interested in this coin to run away when they see these requirements.",
