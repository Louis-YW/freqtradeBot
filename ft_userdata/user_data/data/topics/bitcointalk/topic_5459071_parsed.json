You can use these websites as well to check whether your wallet is eligible or not by entering address. 1) https://earndrop.io/airdrops2) https://earni.fi/",

I started farming a bunch of potential and confirmed retroactive drops just a couple of months ago.I have regretted not knowing them so early especially the likes of Arbitrum, Optimism, Aptos and Blur. Also on the list that I have regretted not participating are the Space ID and Maverick. It makes me regain my belief about retroactive drops. I did receive some from Shapeshift, Dappradar, Aqua a few others, but I blame myself for being busy forgetting about farming retroactive drops that are top tiers. For now I am mainly farming zkSync ERA, Layer Zero, Polygon zkEVM, etc., with some extra money that I have plus free testnets like SEI, Venom, Scroll, Base, Fuel, etc.",

Recently with that ARKHAM airdrop wayback on March into those people who do able to registerthat time did really make out some good money even having that 0 referral did get 100-130$ free money which it isnt really that bad on just simply making that registration.I do able to see someone do make out $100k on abusing multiple self referral lol.I thought airdrop is no more but i was wrong on which there are still people who do really make out money out of this.@OP, arent the sites given above arent that something kind like phishing or what? Im already that skeptical when it comes to log ins or whatsoever.",

Out of all the retroactive drops that I have joined, I just can’t believe that I’ve missed the Arkham Intelligence airdrop. I was not aware of this which makes me miss the July 8 snapshot. Now I see that my social feed was full of Arkham where my fellow airdroppers who are qualified have earned five to six digits in Philippine peso. Rumors that there would be a Round 2 of Arkham airdrop, but I believe it will be much lesser if we successfully invite real people using our referral links. Oh well, just like Arbitrum and Optimism I have missed Arkham. But I am just hoping that other ones like Linea (which launched their mainnet days ago and distributed the commemorative NFTs to us) would be something that I could finally bank big. Same thing to others like zkSync ERA, Layer Zero, Starknet, Scroll (mainnet launch next month), Base, Venom, Sei, Fuel, etc.",

Rumors that there would be a Round 2 of Arkham airdrop...It was my conscious choice not to participate in Arkham, as I knew that I would not be able to attract referrals. Accordingly, I knew in advance that I would not be able to receive an airdrop, since there had never been such a precedent before that payment was made even to those participants who did not attract a single referral. As for the second round, I will also not participate in it, since there is no certainty that this will happen. It will be better if we focus our efforts on more real projects.",

I am looking for these opportunities but only where low fee charged. Arkham given airdrop hunters a very good profit but unfortunately i missed it. I joined Linea testnet and got nft which floor price is now 30$. I will hold it because there is chance of token airdrop in future.",

If you’re doing an airdrop hunting better to have a separate wallet for this so you can avoid getting hacked with your main wallet, regardless of difficulty your wallet can still be expose so make sure to participate carefully and read everything well.",
