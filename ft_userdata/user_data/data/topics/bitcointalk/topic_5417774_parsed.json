  "content": "Over the week there have been countless news of china building a police station in Nigeria and over 20 other countries including American, Asian, Europeans and African.I just came across a news according on phoenix browser that the Chinese Embassy press officer, Zhang Hang in a telephone chat with AIT, said the rumour is based on an ill- intentioned report, made by an anti-china Human Right NGO in Europe. He further added that the is no Chinese police station in Nigeria or anywhere else.https://l.kphx.net/s?d=8875629972127535722&extra=How true is this news? Please let's discuss.",

It mentions that tens of thousands of Chinese citizens have been arrested based on these secret centers, but it does not mention details about the arrests, how they were carried out, and whether there were deportations carried out.The Chinese government had issued a denial of the information contained in the report, but I think someone will believe it because the report was detailed and clear.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2022/10/china-opens-police-station-in-nigeria/On the other hand, these developments can be read from a political point of view due to the Cold War between China and the United States due to the crisis on the island of Taiwan, in addition to China's pro-Russian invasion and support for Russia.",

There won't be any official announcement from China but the control and modern invasion already is happening to became more powerful amd will take control of international trade in the next few years.",

It can never happen in developed countries. Though I don't know how credible the safeguarddefenders source is.",

A whole number of countries are so much indebted to them. I went ahead to read the story from the direct source https://safeguarddefenders.com/en/110-overseasas posted by @kavelj22, and the images were so real and the news also included developed countries like the American and also some European countries as well.Though the real intentions to this news wasn't specified even by the NGO that made the news.One thing I know is that, there are always some atoms of truth in every rumors.God help Nigeria.",

There won't be any official announcement from China but the control and modern invasion already is happening to became more powerful amd will take control of international trade in the next few years. You are right I also believe that the Chinese can do anything to get back their debt fr any country who is owing them. After all they are amony the great countries presently, but I know those countries that are indebted to China,there must have been an agreement with both countries government before China can come down to run their major means of income like the airport, seaports and so on.I have heard similar case after the Covid 19 about a country owing China and China said since they can't pay up their debt China will be in charge of major revenue generating businesses. Nigeria is owing China,I hope they are not preparing to come down to Nigeria since the present government in Nigeria can't pay upÂ  the debt.",

It may end up being true despite government's denials now. The way the present administration of President Buhari has been borrowing money regularly without checks can get Nigeria in problems especially with countries that are not democratic and will not take no for an answer. If China taking over Nigeria will make Nigeria better let it start now. We are fed up with our leaders.",

I find it hard to believe also that this is just a mere rumour, for this to have been started, it emanated from a source. With the large amount of money that the Nigerian government has borrowed from the Chinese, anything is largely possible. Continuously giving money to someone who you know cannot or will be difficult to pay back cannot be without motive, a motive that can be imposed due to the disadvantaged position that a borrower has taken. If the Nigerian government keeps borrowing and being unable to pay back, we will hear more than the establishment of a CHINESE POLICE STATION in Nigeria, maybe an economic recolonization.",

I couldn't agree with you more because naturally, nothing is done without a hidden agenda and this could be it.I hardly think it's something to be debunked or denied by the Chinese government because according to news, one of these \"Service stations\" like they put it is located in Benin city.",
