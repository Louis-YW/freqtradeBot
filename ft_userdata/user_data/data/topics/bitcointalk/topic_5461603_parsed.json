Also  in some countries, restrictions are not clear which makes it \"neutral\" in a away that it is not supported by authorities but are not really that focused with limiting accessibility in gambling sites such as in my country. Many gambling sites are not recognized by the government but many people are still playing simply 'coz they want to and there's no law stopping them. The only risk is engaging to a fraudalent platform wherein it would be hard reporting the case to authorities 'coz in the first place it is not regulated by them. It is a matter of your choice, your money, then that your responsibility.",

That and the fact that these gambling sites literally acquire their official gambling licenses in the country. So much so that you'd see every half-reputable crypto gambling site on the Internet boasting about their Curacao license as if it's something of value nowadays since you can basically get your own for a price unlike back then when there was some value in acquiring it. What's surprising me however is the fact that Macau is not here even though it's regarded as the gambling capital of the world. But I guess that only runs on the conventional gambling aspect and doesn't translate into the online gambling sector. Costa Rica is also one country I'm surprised was here. They weren't particularly known for gambling but for their beach aesthetic or perhaps I'm just letting my heuristics take over.",

In Brazil, gambling is prohibited, but online sports betting is not included in the category of gambling, therefore it continues to be allowed due to the existence of a \"grey area\" in the law, since at the same time it is not prohibited there is also no regulation.And just as in other countries, in Brazil we also have a lot of advertising for sports betting being broadcast in stadiums and on television, but the government is consequently losing a lot in tax collection because it is not able to tax them properly due to the lack of a regulation in this sector.But, as in the entire internet of a free country, it is not possible to easily ban foreign betting sites, so everything is \"free\" here, even gambling in general.",

Licensing is nearly impossible because Monopolies were already established and state doesn't wanna check other companies. Its why odds and winning rates are rather bad here.",

Perhaps its a tactic to maintain mystery and keep us guessing; thats what Im telling myself. Like a good hand of cards, huh? The law is complicated, and you're right about that. Of course, who doesn't enjoy a good mystery?Alternatives in other countries also sound interesting. The faraway places and offshore portals...
