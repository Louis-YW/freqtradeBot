  "content": "Nigerian Government on the National Television Authority (NTA) News yesterday been the  3rd of August, 2022, said, it will adopt 5G network in the Aviation industry and other sectors of the country internet space to fast track the processing activities on the internet. Then I also came to realized that, accepting 5G network in the country is very good development. Ramitano poor Network  When I was trying to make a transaction from  Ramitano  website last week, network was very bad and poor, it delayed my transaction. The worst part was, the price of bitcoin was 25k and in the process of struggling with the network and the site I finally sold it at the rate 22k as of yesterday, At first, I thought it was my device so used desktop, it was the same. So I believe the 5G network which is the fastest network as for now will help to solve the problem of the slow and poor network for transactions and connectivity with other users of the internet.  Click on the Ramitano's image.",

      "body": "As a full citizen of the country the 5G adoption would be ideal if the present government or administration passes away. The new Government would make this dream come to reality. If the project is being implemented by the country regime I tell you is another means of looting and putting the country in harder tighter edge. For me all project should be kept pending.About poor network in ramitano, there are other services you can use to exchange your BTC to NGN, Binance is there with their P2P, gate.io, Lbank and many other exchange that supports p2p or if possibly there some people in the forum who does such services instead of waiting for a particular network to come up before you could perform your transactions.",

      "body": "Technology development is always good news, unless you love conspiracy theories and trying to protect yourself from 5G by wearing tin foil hat. In my country 5G isn't available yet, it should be available by the end of this year. They also going to turn-off 3G completely. But I think that 5G is more important for business who have transfer lot of data. Average user won't feel big difference between 4G and 5G.You're complaining about slow internet. But I doubt that with 5G things will change. Problem isn't there. I think it's because netwrok of internet antennas and transmitters isn't developped well enough in your country. Maybe closest transmitter is too far from your your location or it migh be that too many people connected to that transmitter in your location. Mobile network providers advertising that they cover 99% of country, but I often somehow appear in that 1% that isn't covered.",
