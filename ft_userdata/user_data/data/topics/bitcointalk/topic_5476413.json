Probably many users will join casinos for an alternative of mixer.Casinos are not effective for money laundering. Although there are some casinos that allow deposits and withdrawals without KYC, I am sure if the amount is large then the casino will ask for KYC. If an account has been KYCed then money laundering is deemed to have failedI tend to be more confident that mixers will eventually require KYC for the security of their platforms. Additionally, there is another option using monero (XMR) which has higher privacy. However, getting monero without going through an exchange is also difficult unless using a decentralized exchange. However, I don't mind if money laundering is increasingly difficult to do in crypto because so far what has given crypto a bad image is that it is considered a place for money laundering. If crypto is no longer used as a place for money laundering then that would be great",

Those are regulated businesses on which it they are really that getting in line with government rules and terms on which it is really just that a common thingthat they would really be that putting emphasis on whats been mandated and wont really be totally opposing on whats been put up if they do really want to run the business.We've seen those KYC implementations and its not something new, launderers cant really be possibly be able to penetrate this.Strict KYC rules? for sure it would be strenghten on the time that there would really be some focus in correlation to this specially Mixers are on the hotseat as of this moment.Possible mediums for money laundering would really be monitored for now.",

It’s more risky now as they started with mixers, those usual users will go to casinos, we can’t really know the next move of this US anti decentralization.Casinos now should go full secure and careful about any suspicious activities, probably more users will start depositing unusual amounts and gamble very safely. Smart and strong strategies to avoid such activities are needed in casinos at least so regular gamblers play safely without worrying.",

Take also another possible unrealistic attempt that did not work in casinos,  such as AI usage,  just as there have been some developments of AI in the trading market,  but when it comes to casinos,  the use of both or any form of external actors aside from the gambler is seen as a violation of their rules and that could result into account closer. So for sure casino is always a step ahead of them all and that can be seen in their ability to safeguard themselves all through this time.",

Another important point is that money launderers like to do things quicklythey put a lot of bitcoins in the mixer and in a short time they have their bitcoins cleaned, now look at the casinos, they are places with license, kyc and betting requirements and with that people who put money in the casino are forced to play in the casino, so An intelligent person who is in the world of money laundering crime would not waste time and would not be stupid to use a casino to launder money, it would be the same as asking to be arrested. I think we have to look at current casinos that are kyc, they are very different from past casinos that did not ask for kyc and as a result some criminals used casinos for bad activities",

The main difference between casinos and those mixers if that mixers do not intend to comply with regulators and the KYC policy whatsoever, because it would go against the very own service they try to promote and advertise to potential users. On the other hand, privacy is not necessarily a feature which casinos center around, people go to a casino to wager money and have fun and as long as casinos continue to comply and ask for KYC, they are very unlikely to face problems like those faced by mixers. Though, even though I have never used a mixer (beyond some review campaign I participated in several months ago) I believe I will miss to see them around here in the forum, they had been an important part of our local culture as fas as I remember. Hopefully Monero won't be next in the list of things we will have to give up on.",

There's very few of them that have zero KYC and among those you'd still have to find the ones that are pretty permissive with how they let you withdraw. Most require to withdraw on the same currency after wagering your whole balance. But even if you find a casino that has no wager requirement for deposits...So you deposit in a casino and withdraw back your BTC. What now? Casino addresses are pretty easy to identify. So unless this casino has some epic volumes in the currency of your deposit, it's still possible to kind of approximate your address of destination. That's because casinos don't particularly deploy and coin mixing techniques. Just bi virtue of depositing to a custodial address and withdrawing to a new address doesn't mean that you have completely closed your trace. It might help a little on that regard, but is no mixer.",
