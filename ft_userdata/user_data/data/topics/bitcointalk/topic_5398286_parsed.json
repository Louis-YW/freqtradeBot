  "content": "Hi,I just did a bitcoin transaction from my trezor wallet to my binance account, with BTC network. This is is the first time it happens to me : the transaction is \"unconfirmed\", and moreover there is somtehing I dont understand, I post here the screenshot:https://ibb.co/pzf6yC2What worries me the most is that the amount I wanted to transfer is 0.7BTC, but I dont understand this total input/output (0.99) ? When I look at the outputs, the 0.7 are going to my binance address, but the 0.29 are going to an unknown adress...Does someone has an idea of what is happening to me and how I can handle that ? (cancel the transaction ?)Thanks",

Let's say you have received two transactions. In each of them you received 0.5 BTC. Now you have two UTXOs and you want to spend 0.75 BTC.As you UTXOs must be spent completely, you have to use both UTXOs. So you make a transaction with two inputs and two outputs.One of receiving addresses is owned by the recipient and the other on is your own address which receives the remaining balance of UTXOs. Quote from: DJ-Uka on May 12, 2022, 09:57:09 AMDo you know how I can do to complete or cancel this transaction ?The network is so congested now. If you are not in hurry, just wait. Your transaction will be confirmed.If you are in hurry, you can bump the fee.",

Yes, most likely the 0.29 is the change and you don't know how to see it.As to why, it's like if you give a $100 bill to pay $90 and you get a $10 bill back, what happens is that with BTC it doesn't just go with round numbers, you can get the idea that you've paid with a 0.99359277 BTC bill although the change goes to a different address for privacy reasons, as in some transactions it is difficult to know what the change is and you may want to hide it.",

There are currently around 50K unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. If you are in a hurry you can maybe increase the fee (as long as you enabled the RBF for the transaction) but if you are not in a hurry you can simply wait, it will eventually get confirmed but nobody knows exactly when.",

There's a reasonably good chance that your transaction will be processed before Monday (possibly much sooner). Since you have proven limited knowledge in handling transactions, maybe waiting is a good option.Or, I've seen in that screenshot that you have bump fee button too...(but I'm not familiar with the wallet you're using).",

What I'm more confused about is why he would receive 1 BTC at the end of 2019 when it was worth <$9k, hold it right through $40k, $50k, and $60k, and then send it to Binance to sell during a dip.",
