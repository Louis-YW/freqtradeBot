Keep your second phone in your car or in your basement so that no one knows about it. In case they do find out about this phone then you can tell them it is for work purposes and that is the reason you bought a cheap one.",

      "body": "They know, that's why I don't have much of an issue with it. Now if you're intent on keeping this as a secret, then I highly suggest having a scheduled time for your gambling sessions, this requires you to ask your family's usual schedule though so plan around that and avoid leaving anything that can leak that you're gambling, e.g. your phone unattended and without any locks or whatnot. Maybe even use the 2nd phone if needed (though unlikely, it might just bring more suspicion really). Also I don't think it's much of an issue if they see you watching analysts whether it's related to gambling or not, just say that it's an analysis of the fight and well, you were curious about it. Quote from: sunsilk on September 02, 2022, 03:25:24 AMI think it's better for you to tell your wife that you bet. It's a much better feeling if both of you are open to these things that you do and it's up to you what reason you'll say, whether it's a hobby or you're really into it and just prove that you're not addicted and you're still in control.It'd be really great if they were understanding of it. If not though, then OP hiding it seems understandable, especially in the cases of families (instead of your partners).",

Your post is little confusing, but I am guessing you do place bets, but you are lying to your wife? I don't think that's a good idea. You shouldn't be hiding anything from your wife. You will eventually get caught and things might not end well. Better talk to her and let her know that you place only few bets and try to explain why you do it. Buying things on amazon and placing bets aren't the same thing.",

It's a long argument when your wife suggests buying this or that on amazon yet you gambling your funds. lol Simple, keep everything gambling related to your phone. Hide it somewhere that blends to your normal apps where it is usually unnoticed. I've been doing stuff like this with my phone especially when I am paying for an online game or a mini gambling games. Having a gambling app in your home screen will make your wife suspect you for participating to gambling. Also, do not restrict your wife from accessing your phone.",

But sooner or later she will find it out believed me. So it's better to just play if she is sleeping or if she is not around. But as I have said, it will be a big problem if she found it out later. Just tell her straight up that you are betting on game or in a sports and playing slots. And let her play too, at least that's what I did during the pandemic. But she is not looking to play like every day. Just the regular \"we want to pass the time\" types of playing. And after that whether we win or lose we stop.",

Not you, but pertaining to the question. I think it is not bad for your wife to know if you are gambling or not, it can help from addiction, because you will not want to be addicted if your wife knows that you are gambling. But as for children, I will also suggest that you should hide it. Women are very sensitive, she may later find out if you are gambling, but provided if she really mean it to find out about it. But we may be of different opinion about this, and I can say anyone is wrong, but the most important thing is not to be addicted, which could ruin ones family apart.",

That shows that you're afraid of something you know your partner would be angry about. There must be a reason she would react that way, so that's lying already.Maybe there's an underlying past factor that you have done to why she suspects you or something. It's still best, to be honest about what you are doing and be thorough on why you are doing it; maybe she'll understand.When it comes to hiding, it's best to do it online, I think, but I still don't recommend hiding it; it just means you have a problem.",

Some women are crazy when it comes to controlling your finances. Maybe that's why I will remain single for the rest of my life.  I don't want any woman in the world to control my spending and use my money. Maybe you should have some secret savings for which your wife doesn't know.
