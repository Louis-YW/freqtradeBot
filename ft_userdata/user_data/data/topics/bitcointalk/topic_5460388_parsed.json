      "body": "I think the reason why a fast food place doesn’t have their own drivers is because they would need to be paid asAn employee and there are probably hours during the day when there are no deliveries and they would still need to get paid. Maybe McDonald’s can do this but every other restaurant can’t hence most just use Uber Eats.The issue lately with Uber Eats is the price. The menu is marked up and you need to pay a delivery fee and tip. Many people don’t want to tip because it’s already expenses. Sometimes like $25-30 for a BigMac meal. So they don’t tip and then no driver takes the order and it doesn’t get filled. Great for Uber bad for the drivers and customers.",

      "body": "Instead of moving I'd use the word adapting. E-hailing company are able to do that because they already have the man power and vehicle to do that job. Fast food chains or restaurants, on the other hand, will have to hire their own drivers/riders and get their own vehicles for it. Moreover, they also have to pay these rider/drivers the same salary as their regular employees. With the many food delivery options on the go like Uber eats around then I'm sure they would rather do that instead.",

Just imagine if you only open the app of that specific restaurant but you want other food. That is why it is best to have one app that has multiple restaurants that you can choose from. This is also one of the reasons why I choose it over using the restaurant's app. Also, I found sometimes that the restaurant's app was very buggy and not accessible.",

      "body": "That's quite a good question, Well the answer is in your post, which is that e-hailing companies already have transportation networks already built. Like new companies which are not e-hailing like KFC etc. do not have any transportation network built so in order to do that they first have to spend a lot of time and money on that. But i think now they have reached a place where they don't have to deliver your food to your doorstep because they are brands like MacDonalds etc. So this maybe a reason for them not to shift to E-hailing. Instead, they use other E-Hailing services like of uber, etc. Because Uber drivers are using bikes, cycles, etc. to deliver food from one place to another and those places are like what 1 or 2 blocks away from each other. Which is not that big distance.",

A perfect example would be KFC moving into E-hailing.It's easy for the E-hailing companies to dive into the food delivery business, and will be easy for them to dive into any other delivery package for that matter because they are already in the transportation system. For example, Uber is already in the system, they are popular. Therefore, it's just for them to alter an app and call it whatever name they want, let it is known to the people, and the business starts.As for restaurants, I don't believe it's difficult for them too, that's if they want to introduce it into their business, especially when they are popular and have all it takes like KFC. Only that it might not be part of their business focus. They could just make it known and bring experts in the distribution and E-hailing field. Although, some would consider the cost-effectiveness of it and rather partner with services like Uber Eats.After all, a partnership is part of the business, you don't always own it all.",

So they adopt to the changes and deliver food since to many demands at that time and to many people used the app since they don't want to go outside due to the pandemic scare.",

      "body": "For those of you who might not have a sense of history going back this far, there's an old documentary from 2001 called e-Dreams, and it's all about this former Goldman Sachs guy who wanted to get into the dot com boom by starting a delivery service in NYC (which expanded way faster than it should have), and they'd either pull stuff from their local warehouse or go somewhere to buy what you ordered and then deliver it to you via bike messenger.  If you ask me how in the holy hell this was considered a strictly internet business I couldn't give you a good answer, but my point is that what all of the current delivery services are doing isn't a new concept at all.  The business that does the delivering just jacks up the price of whatever it is your torpid ass can't get up and get yourself.And there are plenty of businesses that do their own delivery.  But either the cost of the service is already baked into what they charge or they do it as a very nice customer relations feature (like my local mom-and-pop pharmacy, for instance).Quote from: Helena Yu on July 20, 2023, 04:46:50 AMLet's say you want to order from KFC, Subway, McDonald, Pizza Hut and Starbucks at the same time, will you choose to use ubereats or 5 applications from each restaurant?Um.  That scenario could only apply to a minute percentage of any food-ordering population at any given time, and I'm picturing somebody who can't fit through a door frame ordering food from all of those places at once.  You never know what someone like that would prefer.  Back in the real world, people who don't have money to waste on middle-man delivery services are probably going to just order from some restaurant that does deliver, like Domino's or the like.  They're still not super cheap, but the alternatives are highway robbery IMO.",

This is a whole, new, layer of different businesses operating according to the scheme that the business has built. It can be anything - transportation of passengers, mini-transfers, food, orders from the store, gifts, ..... And this is just us talking about the logistics vector. And you can \"uberize\" any other direction. The meaning of \"uberization\" is not a cab, it is a new approach to interaction and participation in business, and it can be both global international and microbusiness. In this case - extremely simple, comfortable conditions to become a participant of this business - both as a \"seller\" and \"service\"",

Companies like Uber are simple transport companies, they move people and can potentially move anything in those vehicles. They would have no extra outlay to accommodate such a change, except maybe making sure that drivers have appropriate extra insurance if required. Restaurants do not have fleets of vehicles or third party drivers, so would have to build up that infrastructure before they could move into the transportation arena. It's a huge upfront investment that would take years, if not decades, to start paying for itself - plus many of them already do have drivers if you look at places like dominos, so it's a completely moot and pointless discussion",

Uber also became popular here in my country. Shortly afterward, however, direct competitors came to the fore and took so much away from Uber. It eventually stopped operating in the country, although there were also legal issues involved.If it's only about wages, it can easily be addressed, but if it's a lot more than that, then they could easily be defeated by competitors. Grab, for example, came out with better offers both for users and employees alike. And they successfully brought Uber to their knees, at least in certain parts of the world.Anyway, I don't think Uber is owned by Saudi. It's a US company. Bin Salman may have invested in it, but he doesn't own it. He's not even the largest shareholder.",

Vertical integration of businesses to serve a counterpart is more difficult than people might realize. A restaurant business doesn't implement e-hailing without spending an immense amount of resources/capital in R&D in order to develop an effective service. It's cheaper just to license Uber's technology, which is to say, have a restaurant listed in app and let Uber get a fee out of every order.",

They have an established ecosystem of local supply chain and even more than that they know how can they integrate technology along with that and obviously their brand value from the existing E-business as well. The traditional restaurants aren't able to matchup with technology and even if they get technology it's almost impossible for them to tie up technology with their supply chain.",
