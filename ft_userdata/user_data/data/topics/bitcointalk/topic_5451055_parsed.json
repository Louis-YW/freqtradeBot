What is the quickest method to do, to make sure it gets confirmed as fast as possible or after the first block that gets mined?Do you recommend me sending custom fees, or the recommended fees that is in Bitcoin core?If I want to send a custom fees, how much sat do i need to send per kilo byte to gets it confirmed fast?",

In this way, you don't have to pay higher fee or you don't have to pay lower and wait long for confirmation.",

So: Transaction Fee: Recommended. That's currently 0.68308 mBTC/kvB, and estimated to confirm within 2 blocks.Quote from: GR Sasa on May 03, 2023, 07:27:21 AMLet's say i want to send 10 Bitcoins using Bitcoin core to only one other address.I'm not sure how serious you are, but if you have 10 Bitcoin in a hot wallet, you have other things to worry about. This should be a setup with cold storage, including offline signing. Getting a confirmation in the next block shouldn't be your priority when handling a quarter million dollars. Make security your priority.QuoteWhat is the quickest method to do, to make sure it gets confirmed as fast as possible or after the first block that gets mined?Note that fee estimates are based on the past, and the future can change. If the next block takes a while, and more transactions pile up, your fee may not be enough. If you want to it to be very likely to get confirmed quickly: overpay.",

I was worrying because of double spending. Incase someone gets my private keys after me sending a transcation, i need to make sure it gets as soon as possible to my targeted address, so the attacker doesn't double spend it and takes my money before me taking my own money... That's why I asked what's the correct fee i need to send, in order to get it confirmed in the next block.Anyways, thank you guys for your answers!",

I rather just import my private keys into Bitcoin core with a encrypted wallet...With this a attacker cannot find or use the Bitcoin core command \"Dumpprivkey\" to show my keys..So i assume i'll be safe then...OR other alternative... i just buy new brand new Notebook for 500$, i only download bitcoin core and import its keys there... with this there is no way a malicious software or any attacker could steal my keys.. because Notebook is new.Yes, indeed i'm learning...

This exposes them to potential attacks. Even if they are encrypted at rest, they must be decrypted in order to sign a transaction or a message, an attacker could try to brute force your decryption key, they could plant a key logger on your machine, and so on.Hot wallets as described above are one of the least secure types of wallet. You should look in to either a good hardware wallet (such as Passport), or a permanently offline system.Quote from: GR Sasa on May 03, 2023, 02:04:03 PMi just buy new brand new Notebook for 500$, i only download bitcoin core and import its keys there... with this there is no way a malicious software or any attacker could steal my keys.. because Notebook is new.A separate brand new device is a possibility, but only if it never connects to the internet and remains permanently airgapped. This means not connecting it just to download an update, or just to download Core, or just to broadcast a transaction, etc. It should never connect to the internet. Put Core (or Electrum) on it via a USB drive, and transfer unsigned and signed transactions back and forth via USB drive or QR code.",

      "body": "All what was written about fees is correct, but just for record (and maybe for novice users):Blocks are \"mined\" by miners which do some calculations based on the given difficulty set for some period of time. Difficulty is adjusted every 2000 blocks, just to have the average performance 1 block every 10 minutes. But, it is average speed, it does not mean transaction will be processed in max 10 minutes. Unfortunately we cannot tell when next block will be mined. For example in the current \"evaluation period\" we are statistically 20 blocks late and soon difficulty will be decreased by +- 1%.As a consequence, you should be aware that it is possible to wait a long time for block and fee does not change anything. The risk is that if block is very late (it happens that we have 30, 40 minutes or 1h without block), fee which was sufficient 1 h ago, is not sufficient now, as your transaction will be removed from the 1st expected block as other users prepared lot of transactions with much higher fee.I skip talking about low-fee transactions purged from mempool as we talk about high fees.",
