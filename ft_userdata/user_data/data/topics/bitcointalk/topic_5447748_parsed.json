      "body": "Are those 1 USDt denomination chips pre-loaded with 1 L-USDt ? If yes, what is the pre-loaded status of the chips included in the Signature Set? (since the chips included are of different denominations, I was wondering if none/some of those are pre-loaded with L-USDt )I am aware that you are not the maker of those chips, however, I was wondering if you know this info, or if you would be kind enough to ask the maker.Regardless.... THANK YOU for another awesome group buy !!!I will place my order shortly -just wanted to know the loading status beforehand, to determine ordering quantities-  Edit: (with moar questions ) Does the \"25 chip set\" comes in a box -as in the photo- without capsules, and the \"50 Capsule set\" without a box but in plastic capsules?Are there limited quantities reserved for this group buy, or all orders placed till the deadline will be fulfilled?",
