They paid $500,000 in fees to transfer only $200 worth of Bitcoin.The good news is that F2Pool, a mining pool, confirmed on social media that Paxos, a crypto company, has returned the excess $500,000 in Bitcoin transaction fee to the rightful owner as a reimbursement.Link to the confirmed transactionInformation Source Link 1 Information Source Link 2",

They were a business to business setup.f2pool is large company.paypal is largepaxos is large.If you solo mine or mine at a few small pools there is no pool wallet coins are simply few direct to the miners.I am U.S.A. based miners. I mine at this pool https://pool.laurentiapool.org/#/minershttps://pool.laurentiapool.org/#/workif we had hit it those coins go directly to us not to a pool walletI would have received 9.6 coins about 7.2 would have been a mistakeanother miner would have received about 11.5 coins about 8 would have been a mistakethe third miner would have got 4 coins about 3 would have been a mistakeIf I refund those coins 7.2 I would need quite a lot of assurance from PayPal and paxos that 194k of taxable income goes on their books not mine. I would need to create a legal agreement to refund them.Well not my problem and some programmer is going to be in trouble for the error.",

There is no fixed amount for fees paid to miners to get their transaction confirmed so it cannot be capped at a certain range, one can argue there is an ideal range but you cannot fault a miner for accepting higher.",

Why the hell? What's so expensive in manual work that makes you want to risk so much money for writing (probably non-reviewed) code which would automate that process.

I don't know how taxation works in the US, but if the pool sends you bitcoin, is it considered immediately capital that must be reported? Don't you guys report from realized profit only, when it comes to bitcoin?",

I didn't have doubts about F2Pool returning the money to the user, they are already established as it is, and they probably earn this much amount (and more!) just from the sheer amount of miners in their platform, this is but a dime to them so to speak. Not gonna lie though, as some of the people in this forum when news about this thing broke out I thought that this was a form of money-laundering scheme too, to make that 500 grand a little cleaner by expecting reimbursement but that's a little stupid and baseless looking back. Anywho, everyone got their happy endings, f2pool will surely receive more people coming in and trusting them moving forward just from this success story alone, and I hope this user's going to be a little bit more careful next time.",

I mention my small mining pool with a small chance of hitting that block. But there are many unknown miners maybe 10% of all hash goes to unknown miners. This means they had a ten percent chance of never seeing that money.Or a huge hassle to get it refunded.Like I mentioned I would need a lawyer if my little pool hit it.I likely would put 8 of the 19 btc in an escrow account until I and the other miners were sure we have no USA tax issues refunding it.Some people mine fully anonymous if they hit the refund would not have happen.It makes it plain and simple error. Shame on them for poor security.If the send wallet had only 5 btc the worse mistake would be only 4.99 btc",
