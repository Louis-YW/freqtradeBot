  "content": "I have come across a lot of informative threads on This forum with a lot of important information about the crypto space especially Bitcoin.Over the years a lot of these threads have  been  created of which most of them were guides amongst many other categories like updates or analysis data.however it was so unfortunate that some of these threads were created during the period when imgur was used to upload images on the forum and due to the imgur server problem on  the forum, most of these images turned out to be broken.Although TalkImg was used as a replacement for imgur most of these old images were still left broken making some of these old threads lose their simplicity as those images served as a form of additional information or illustration in these threads. Ever since I frequently began coming across these threads with broken images two questions have always been on my mind which are;What caused imgur crash?Is there a way to fix these broken images?With respect to the second I have a suggestion in mind on fixing these broken images however I believe it would require collective efforts for it's proper effect.My suggestion goes like this;Since these broken images still have their links in the threads, these links can be taken and used to download the the original images from imgur. After which they can then be re uploaded to TalkImg.these newly uploaded links can then be sent to Ops to update the respective posts.This is a proposition that I intend on doing if necessary I suggest that forum moderators and other higher rank members select quality posts that deserve editing with respect to Their  images so I can carry out the re-uploading and sending of the new links to the OP's of the respective threads.The main assistance I would need is selection of quality threads especially from main boards. Your opinion about this suggestion would be very much appreciated.",

The images on Imgur still work perfectly with other sites and forums I know, I just don't know the issue that is causing good images to be invisible here. It was first the most popular Imgur and now about 4 other hosting sites are off and on.I was shocked yesterday evening that formerly shown images from \"Postimages.org\" were no longer visible, all good images were gone just like that. But on checking again now, they are visible again. It calls for concern.",

If you check some of those threads properly, you will find out that they had been created several years ago. And the ops of such threads might have been gone for a long time and inactive. So even if you were able to fix the broken images(of which I don't know how you intend on doing all of them by your self) you still won't be able to replace them on the original thread. There are lots of threads I've seen with broken images so finding them would take most of your time of which I don't think you would be willing to sacrifice(except you have nothing doing).The best solution I can think of is for the ops of such threads, if they are still active to try updating their broken images when they are less busy, using the script written by Try ninja Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images. But if you still want to help, you can fix the images and send the links to them just as you've stated.",

I already fixed all my broken images, using script made by TryNinja - it's simpliest and easiest way to do it and you don't have to manually replace hundreds of images. Many users also did same thing, but there is still so many topics with useful information have broken links and it looks bad. Unfortunately, not much can be done to solve this issue because authors of these topics is inactive or they don't care.

Thumbs up to joker_josue for finding a solution for some of those image proxy error issues by launching TalkImg. Although, the joker_josue's solution is currently working like charm and will continue to work in the same way but unfortunately the old Imgur images are still present in most old threads and haven't been replaced by the OP's of the threads. I believe that Theymos will soon make some changes in forum and allow users to click on the links of those images which give image proxy error in embedded form. Let's wait for that time and if you still want to view some images of a thread then you can simply quote that thread and you'll see the embedded links in the quote and then you can copy and paste those images to see those images.",

A 5-10 minutes fix 100 images, perhaps. The script runs in your browser. Basically, you open the page of all your posts, and run the script. It will copy the images to TalkImg, then automatically edit the post with the new link. In all posts.I remember that when the script was launched, my server received thousands of images in a few hours, that I quickly had to scale the service to handle all this input of images.Note the story here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450546.msg62249204#msg62249204",
