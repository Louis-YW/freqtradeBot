  "content": "Quote(Kitco News) - As lawmakers in the U.S. introduce bills pushing back against the creation of a U.S.-dollar-based central bank digital currency (CBDC), Texas is opting to go a different route with the creation of a state-issued, gold-backed digital currency.Based on the text of Senate Bill 2334, which was introduced by state Senator Bryan Huges (R), and House Bill 4903, which was introduced by state Representative Mark Dorazio (R), the legislators are looking to require the state comptroller to establish a digital currency that is fully backed by gold and fully redeemable in cash or gold.“The comptroller shall establish a digital currency that is backed by gold so that each unit of the digital currency issued represents a particular fraction of a troy ounce of gold held in trust,” the bills state, adding that if needed, a private vendor can be enlisted to help establish the digital currency.The comptroller would also be required to create a mechanism that would allow the new gold-backed digital currency to be used by citizens for their daily transactions. “In establishing the digital currency the comptroller shall establish a means to ensure that a person who holds the digital currency may readily transfer or assign the digital currency to any other person by electronic means.”All gold reserves backing the digital currency would be held in a trust with the Texas Bullion Depository that is controlled by the comptroller or another entity appointed by the comptroller. “The trustee shall maintain enough gold to provide for the redemption in gold of all units of the digital currency that have been issued and are not yet redeemed for money or gold,” the bills read.There will be no limit on the amount of gold-backed digital currency that Texans can purchase. As soon as a purchase is made, the comptroller will be required to “buy a fractional number of troy ounces of gold equal to the number of units of the digital currency issued to the purchaser, and issue to the purchaser a number of units of the digital currency equal to the amount of gold that the comptroller purchases with the money received from the purchaser.”When someone holding the digital currency wants to redeem it for cash, all they would need to do is present it to the comptroller or a designated agent, who will then sell gold held in the depository account equal to the redemption amount and transfer the funds to the redeemer, minus any fees.Holders can also elect to redeem the digital currency for gold. The comptroller or one of its designated agents “may manage redemption of the digital currency for gold by the use of bars or coins of standard sizes and may pay fractional remainders in cash as necessary to facilitate the transaction,” the bill states.The value of each unit of the digital currency will be determined at the time of a transaction and “must be equal to the value of the appropriate fraction of a troy ounce of gold at the time of that transaction.”And as a way to reassure investors in the fund who are worried about issues like bail-ins, the bill explicitly states that “Money received from the purchase of the digital currency, gold purchased and held under this chapter, and money received from the sale of gold in response to a request for redemption is not available for legislative appropriation.”All fees generated from the management of the fund will be deposited in an account established in the general revenue fund to help pay the costs.Both bills end with a line saying, “This ACT takes effect September 1, 2023.” At the time of writing, neither bill had been assigned to a committee. In order to become official law, they must first get a committee hearing, pass by a majority vote, and then be approved in a full vote by the state Senate and House.https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-04-06/Texas-moves-to-create-gold-backed-digital-currency.html....Could gold backed digital currencies be the next BTC ?Some might recall venezuela proposed to create an oil backed blockchain based CBDC around 5 years ago. The concept of backing digital currencies with other assets is definitely not new. Earlier this year geopolitical analyst Peter Zeihan laughed at russia for using aircraft to ferry gold shipments to conduct cross border transactions. Now it seems texas is poised to implement the digital transaction solutions which Putin may have desperately needed but not been able to secure. With global concerns of inflation and economic downtrends gaining precedence. Could a trend whereby digital currencies backed by precious metals or commodities eventually replace international reserve currencies like the dollar emerge?",

Could a trend whereby digital currencies backed by precious metals or commodities eventually replace international reserve currencies like the dollar emerge?A lot of people are already looking for an alternative reserve rather than the US dollar; it won't also be a bad idea for them to go back to the old ways where the majority of all countries reserves were based on physical gold.The digital part is where I actually don't think most people will buy the idea; making it digital means they will have to lock off the physical gold and make it digital as the USDT is pegged to the physical dollar. How long will it retain the same value as the real-world gold market? What will happen if the blockchain where it's been minted breaks down? To me, these are a few factors people might consider before considering it as a national reserve.",

Although I don't think the amount of distrust toward this kind of currency will be similar to how people view USDT as being shady. Can't be helped since they never publish their details explicitly anyway.",

The constitution, being the highest law of the country, overpowers any state law. Even federal laws will have to abide by the constitution. In the first place, state sovereignty is not absolute. They're free within structures. When the constitution was authored is immaterial. If there are certain provisions that won't fit or aren't anymore applicable to the modern world, it can be amended. Until then, it remains as the supreme law.Quote from: odolvlobo on June 14, 2023, 12:55:45 AMQuote from: Darker45 on June 14, 2023, 12:04:23 AM~snip~Definitely illegal according to Article 1, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution:QuoteNo State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.Unless they can convince the Supreme court that \"bills of credit\" is referring specifically to paper.Probably not. I assume those specific letters in the constitution aren't literal. However, I'm curious: is a digital currency backed by gold valid considering that the constitution exempts gold and silver in its prohibition of states to issue their own currency?",

If they buy more gold for their treasure, they can mint more digital gold currencies (tokens).We will have to trust audits about their gold reserve in vault.

Although, it's a unique concept in the world of crypto-currencies, but still it won't be able to compete with Bitcoin in the world of crypto-currencies. The new form of crypto-currency will be controlled by the banks and the government and will be 100% centralized while Bitcoin is famous for its decentralized nature.I'm very sure that if such currencies are even get listed on current crypto-exchanges, they will still have some limitations. The exchanges might put some limits on trading of such pairs and that will be posed on those exchanges in order to protect the price of the coin. Whatever the result of such currency be, but it's truly exciting news to see such currencies in real world.",

I don't think they are simply crazy. On what basis can a company in Texas create a shitcoin? Because as far as I know shitcoins can be created in the USA.  Maybe if they can't, the Texas government can hire a private company and there's a loophole there.",
