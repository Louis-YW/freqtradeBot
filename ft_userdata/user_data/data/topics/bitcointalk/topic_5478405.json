Of course, this is not possible in every store that exists in the world, but it is possible in many countries where Bitcoin is a completely legitimate means of payment. If you go to El Salvador, you will probably be able to buy a bottle of water or whatever you want and pay with BTC (LN) - and if you go to the island of Boracay, you will certainly be able to buy water and pay with BTC.Here, for example, I can now go to a local site and buy water or any other drink and pay with Bitcoin or some altcoin - or I can buy anything else that is there.I don't know what kind of mainstream ideas you fantasize about, but Bitcoin will probably never be the choice of the majority but of the minority that wants an alternative. In addition, the idea of Bitcoin as a currency is disappearing more and more, especially when we take into account the on-chain fees that most people do not want to pay.",

Therefore, bitcoin will always be overshadowed by bankers who want bitcoin and its adoption will not go well. However, dropping bitcoin is certainly not easy, because bitcoin is very transparent and has a system that can make people interested(decentralized).And currently bitcoin or crypto will definitely be a little difficult if you want to become mainstream in financial terms. Because the banking sector is still standing strong at this time. So it will definitely take longer for bitcoin or crypto to become mainstream.",

Difference is with the way we are using it. If it is with mode of payment, then there's only a small percentage where it is being used as it is. Bitcoin and other cryptos are widely used as an asset or an investment and there's nothing really bad about it. With its wide acceptance, there'll be more years to come before its total acceptance. It is now known by many but there is a mix of impression towards this technology and we should wait further for improvements on such viewpoint. Global currency on the other hand is something.",

That's funny, I'm shocked to see this why would anyone spend Bitcoin to buy water bottles? Bitcoin was meant to be a p2p payment system and it still is but these days people find it more usable as an asset rather than a p2p payment system. You can't really buy a bottle of Bitcoin at the current network condition because the fee would cost you more than two bottles of water. It's possible to buy bottle of Bitcoin with water in normal network conditions but I'm pretty sure that no one is going to use Bitcoin to buy a bottle of water.",

Nobody would like to make a transaction where the fee is almost half the actual amount you want to transfer. I believe Bitcoin, or crypto as a whole cannot be \"mainstream\" as you say because everybody has not gone digital. There are places where you still need cash to make a purchase. They don't even accept bank or card transfers, so how will they accept Bitcoin? Then again, how do people accept Bitcoin when it is currently so frustrating to use?",

I feel like that is not going to be as much of a big trouble as people think it will be. You have dollars in your bank account, you wire that to some exchange, nearly no fee at all, maybe a very tiny one, then you buy bitcoin with the dollar you have in the exchange, only the trading fee and no transaction fee at all, then when it goes up, you sell that bitcoin back to dollar, again just trading fee, nothing big, and then you use that dollar to wire back to your bank account, and you have spent nearly nothing, maybe just 50 bucks at the very large case, and that is a ton of money, usually something less than a few dollars.That's why you should not consider transaction fee as a huge deal for a newbie, because if the newbie is doing a lot more than this, the yare doing something wrong. I believe that newbies who spend hundreds of dollars on each transaction and moving money around like crazy just to make more money, they will have bigger issues for sure.",

So, looking openly, with bitcoin and crypto since its launch until now, its scale is much larger, and I think at a speed that is really fast, it won't take too long so that you can witness some regions accepting crypto as a popular means of life, and there is no need to impose too much on how to use bitcoin because in the end, the core thing is still bitcoin.",

The current btc is not suitable for such a transaction ofc, but that's irrelevant to the possibilities of blockchain. Really, be it a water bottle or a Playstation 5, or a Ford F-Series, the physical goods market evade cryptos and that's the only challenge for it's growth. Humans need fuel to live, and they but it with fiat. And the reason is political otherwise you would have a plethoric amount of entrepreneurs willing to accept blockchain powered money for their products. Elon Musk tried it for a time with tesla, there's little doubt why he dropped the opportunity. West Africans and Hindus getting access to internet won't make a huge difference also c'mon.Restraining blockchain powered money to a digital stuff used to buy nfts, steroids and cocaine online or evade tax but no physical good such as water bottle is exactly buying into the establishment narrative about cryptos.",

Bitcoin is also a valuable asset.I don't think that the main issue is the resistance of major actors like governments, banks, or lobbyists. Bitcoin is volatile, Bitcoin doesn't scale well, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there's nobody to blame for Bitcoin going up or down, and Bitcoin transaction fees regularly rise too high.
