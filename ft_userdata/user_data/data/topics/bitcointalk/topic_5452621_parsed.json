  "content": "Perpetual Stablecoin: Looking for Specialists to Counter the Coming Financial CrisisI apologize in advance if this post looks illiterate and misspelled in your language.This is my first and last post here. Based on available information, our team can no longer postpone the launch of the project. Soon there could be a global financial crisis and a possible sharp depreciation of the dollar and other fiat currencies.We announce the recruitment of a team of true professionals. A perpetual stabelcoin is being created, the value of which will not depend on any fiat currency and will be based on a number of different parameters. Stablecoin will link digital cryptocurrencies and the real economy.Separately, we need partners - liquidity providers!P.S. Our team consists of volunteers who want to create a solid financial foundation for their families. The first months of launching perpetual stabelcoin we will not be able to pay salaries. We are looking for thoughtful, established people who are willing to spend some of their free time for the future of all humanity.Please circulate this message to potentially interested people. For security reasons, we will not advertise or mass-mail this message.Contact the team at: eternecoin@proton.me",
