Doesnt need it out because this is the whole purpose of Bitcoins existence on which you could really be your own bank on where you could put up those Bitcoin savings into your own wallet which no other can control or own but only you and this is the beauty of it.You could make use of non-custodial wallets which you do possess its keys.When you are planning to save and accumulate for long term then you could do on what you do like.Just make sure those PK or seedswont be exposed to someone because if so, then you are giving them access into your wallet.Having a Bank is totally contrary on what use case does Bitcoin have.",

      "body": "The point of saving with banks or funds is that you earn interest. Basically they will lend your money to other people and those people will return back more than they borrowed from you. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, and if you want to lend it to someone, the burden of negotiating the terms and collecting the debt will fall on you too. There are no decentralized wallets that let you to own Bitcoin and earn interest. There are centralized platforms that let you do that, like certain exchanges, but this means that it's essentially just like a bank. Except it's not fully regulated and insured, so there's way more room for failure. So why be greedy and earn some extra 2-3% per year and risk losing all the invested coins, if you can just hold Bitcoin and see its value double or triple in a few years?",

Nothing will happen and you can access your wallet anytime you want as long as you're holding the private keys/seeds that the wallet has provided to you. It's worse than if you've got this plan and you do it on an online wallet or an exchange. You may earn some interest if you deposit it to their interest accounts but since your plan is to go back on it for some time in the future and you're uncertain about how long you'll just keep it there. It's much better to keep it in a wallet where you hold the keys as you also hold the funds by having that. There's no headache by just holding it to the wallet that I've said where you hold funds and keys rather than aiming to have those interest piles up and earn little from it but the risk is too high that the platform might go away and may suddenly file for bankruptcy.",

Yes it's possible, i did on almost 3 years and my bitcoin still save even don't have many. But if you bitcoin holder, make sure you have to good patience because the price will make holder crazy and want to sell it if price going to dump. Because of that i never save it on exchange, i save bitcoin on place where have difficulty to send it.",

Yes, is possible to have your own personal wallet were you can save your money for future purpose which is the best idea that will bring light into your investment when the price of Bitcoin increase higher like never before in the market. There are some positive things you will start experiencing when you start saving your money into your wallet, because wallet is more secure and safe than bank when your personal details are safe in your hands. I think, Bitcoin investment is the best investment compare to other fiat investment that will take a long time before the income will manage to increase small.",

Yeah, the question might seem stupid but taking your rank into account and the number of posts i can say that you just entered the crypto-verse. So i must say knowledge of Hot and Cold wallets along with the pros and cons will give you an idea and will also tell you the effects that Banking savings include while crypto wallets don't. 1. You do not have to open accounts of wallets as you open for savings accounts of banks by filling in your all information.2. You do not have to give custody of your assets and digital securities to the banks instead by using crypto digital wallets you are the one who will control your assets. If you own the money then why give custody to banks? 3. Yes it is possible to create a wallet address for BTC and to store any other currency (crypto) you want to store. 4. Nothing will happen to your account because crypto wallets provide you the full custody of your wallets you can store as much as you can and for as much time as you can. 5. If you have fear of losing money then i must recommend you to read the following compilationsSome superior aspects of Bitcoin over Banks we overlookBitcoin versus Banks--> read this thread thorughly you will defenitely find interesting things to learn. Here are some compilations from where you can start.[Crypto Wallets] Cold and Hot Wallets and their Approach-->You can choose any of the mentioned wallets, depending on the value of your assets like if you want to store BTC for long term like saving wallets then i prefer cold wallets (hardware wallets) because it has the maximum security levels but as per your experience i prefer to use hot wallets like Trust wallet, Mew, etc. because installation of hot wallets is easy but if you want to install a hardware wallet then check this tutorial How to Install Tails OS on USB flash drive for Wallet Purpose",

And although in the future it will most likely not be as profitable, you don't have to jeopardise your bitcoin by depositing it in a bank to get a little extra interest.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on March 14, 2023, 09:55:12 PMSo why be greedy and earn some extra 2-3% per year and risk losing all the invested coins, if you can just hold Bitcoin and see its value double or triple in a few years?This.Quote from: Despairo on March 15, 2023, 03:54:43 AMYou don't need to have Bitcoin saving account in order to invest Bitcoin, just buy through P2P or exchange and send it to your non custodial wallet.Yes, the best thing is this. Buy regularly to the best of your ability, and withdraw to your wallet, to a wallet where you manage your private keys. You have to change the mentality, OP. Bitcoin if used correctly is completely different from the banking system. With it you are your own bank.",

Â Rather, it looks like an impersonal metal account - this is a special type of bank deposit, which is denominated in grams of precious metals (gold, silver, platinum, palladium).

The goal with a savings account are to gain interest, so some Banks will offer fixed savings accounts where you constantly deposit or transfer funds into a fixed saving account to get more interest. Bitcoin wallets are different, because you do not get interest on those bitcoins that are deposited there. Yes, the Bitcoin price might increase and you might get much more value from those coins, because it is valued more... but that is not interest. The benefit of having bitcoins in a wallet are the accessibility of that money. (You can lock those funds with smart contracts, but it's a more complex process and I think it should only be applied to people that do not have the discipline to save those funds)",

Bitcoin is created for our own privacy to invest . meaning we can keep sending our money inside and let it there as long as we wanted and then we can withdraw in time that we needed , in this we are free from hassle of banks and government , but this happens only if Bitcoin is not banned or prohibited in your country because things will change if your country has banning for crypto.",

Nothing will happen to Bitcoin (except just increasing and decreasing in price) and your wallet as long as you take very good care of it and keep it in a really safe place. It is a very possible thing to do and as long as you can take good care of it, nothing will happen to the wallet even if you don't open it every day to see the amount of the balance. So what do you think is impossible in this case now ? Because bank accounts are now also digital in nature because you can see and control them via a smartphone device in your own hands, as well as a Bitcoin wallet, if you use a hardware wallet, then you can of course take very good care of it and don't just store it carelessly if you use it.

Funny question though. With bitcoin, you are your own bank, which means you can do what ever you like with you own money. You can decide to have a bitcoin wallet that is generated offline on an airgapped device, copy some addresses for backup, and also backup the most important thing which is the seed phrase, having the backup in two or three different locations. You can be sending bitcoin to the wallet anytime you want without spending it.
