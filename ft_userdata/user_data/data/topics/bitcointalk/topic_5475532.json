  "content": "I'm currently searching for an advertising network that supports Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to pay for the ads. It's not necessary that's a crypto-related service, it can also be a traditional service where I could pay e.g. via some kind of gift cards which can be bought with Bitcoin or altcoins (hasn't to be anonymous, registration with real name/phone number is also ok).Until now the most trustworthy crypto ad service seems to be A-Ads (also called Anonymous Ads, link), which is online since 2013 (afaik) and Trustpilot looks quite good. There is also BuySellAds but that seems to be targeted to bigger customers, while what I'm searching is an Google-Ads-type service for small campaigns. My question is:- Does somebody here have experiences with them as an advertiser? (positive/negative, everything counts  )- Does it make sense to advertise projects which are not crypto-related there?- What about international (non-English) traffic? I'm mostly interested in Spanish and German.- Are there other trustworthy crypto-accepting ad services?I have of course already googled a bit  There are several lists like this one, which show some alternatives to a-ads with even better impression/traffic statistics.But then I read also this article which strongly recommends against typical crypto ad services like CoinAd. Coinzilla or Bitmedia aren't described that negatively there but seem to be very crypto-focused, while at A-Ads I see also packages for campaigns which are not crypto (nor adult) focused.Adshares could be interesting perhaps, so I'd be interested in opinions about this one too.Edit: I added Bidvertiser to the services which seem interesting (a very traditional ad platform accepting Bitcoin), see the post here. So if somebody has experiences ..",

When i check https://a-ads.com/ad_units/new, expected income is far lower if you filter ads under category \"Investments\" or \"Gambling\". Do you choose to filter those category or not?2. After reading https://a-ads.com/earn/, it looks like A-Ads doesn't check your website before you get earning. Is it really true?",

      "body": "I have two sites where I displayed A-ADS although I am not yet maximizing its traffic there is still a flow of traffic from time to time it used to be good until they introduced this Quoteglobally unique impressionsQuotePlease, mind that we've got an alternative way of counting unique impressions. We count as unique globally unique impressions which means that a single IP address will be counted as unique only once every 24 hours when the visitor encounters any of our banners on any of our publishers’ websites. It isn't counted as unique again during this interval no matter how many banners the visitor subsequently sees and what websites he visits. So, our numbers of unique impressions will be much lower than those reported by other networks or tracking tools for the same traffic.https://a-ads.com/blog/how-do-you-get-paid-as-a-publisher/My understanding of this is if one visitor, visited a site that displays A-ADS prior to visiting your site that also displayed A-ads they will not count the impressions from your visitor because he had already seen the banner from other sites, so expect lower impressions, and since my sites are related to Cryptocurrency I hardly get a lot of ads about Cryptocurrency, I stopped displaying A-ADS after the platform that they keep promoting in my banners turn into a scam site of course I don't want to promote scam sites on my platform.I will maximize my traffic soon and have some sites coming up and I'm also looking for a good advertising network, so keep us updated on this thread about good alternatives based on your experience.I am thinking of using Adsense again I used it years ago but now checking what has changed on their terms.",

      "body": "I have some experience with A-Ads, though it's not fresh, I used them few years ago. It's not bad network, but also it depends what you expect to get from them. From main crypto ad networks they have probably lowest approval requirements for publishers. So, you shouldn't expect to get high quality traffic as your ad will be displayed at not the most professional websites, faucets and etc. And I don't think that's best place to advertise products not related with crypto. IMO, A-ads mostly fits to promote affiliate links, while if you want to sell something, better look at other networks.Quote from: robelneo on November 27, 2023, 09:21:22 PMMy understanding of this is if one visitor, visited a site that displays A-ADS prior to visiting your site that also displayed A-ads they will not count the impressions from your visitor because he had already seen the banner from other sites, so expect lower impressions, and since my sites are related to Cryptocurrency I hardly get a lot of ads about Cryptocurrency, I stopped displaying A-ADS after the platform that they keep promoting in my banners turn into a scam site of course I don't want to promote scam sites on my platform.It doesn't sounds good. As I understand, it means that ad is displayed on your site for free and you wont get anything for it  from some vidits.And scams, in general it's problem of all crypto ad networks, but I agree that moderation is less strict on A-ads. Though, you can't avoid scams even on Google Adsense.",

Maybe it's a bit better now, but I know that I had significantly worse results than, for example, Bitmedia, whose ads I had at the same time. Plus, I didn't like their interface at the time, it was very complicated to use, and the other thing that didn't suit me was the quality and format of their ads was such that every page looked like some junk cluttered with ads.In essence, a lot depends on the quality of the content you have as well as the number of daily traffic.",

      "body": "Thank you already for your experiences - looking of course for more, also perhaps from an advertiser's perspective I guess if the experience from the publisher's side at a-ads is bad, it should be good for the advertiser? Now a bit more seriously, I think the \"global unique impressions\" may make sense for some advertisers. You would then not get paid twice if you chain several sites or pages together, which for the advertiser contains the danger that he has to pay twice for lots of impressions on visitors which aren't interested in your product. It means also that if you have a site that is typically viewed by a public who visit lots of crypto-related sites, then you would be paid less (due to the higher probability that you have to \"share\" global unique impressions) than if you publish the ads on a site which targets a completely different public (e.g. something not crypto-related) which would not visit other typical crypto sites with a-ads units.In theory this would mean that the algorithm rewards non-crypto sites, which would be good for someone like me who wants to advertise a non-crypto product, because at least the incentives point to a \"diversification\" of the publisher portfolio. But what I'd be worried of is of course the quality of the publishers. And of course if the publisher's experience is bad, the quality of the publisher portfolio will not increase.",

      "body": "Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 29, 2023, 11:25:05 AMIn that case, those advertiser should avoid paying by impression count altogether.Point taken. Those advertisers then should opt for CPC.I've looked around a bit in the A-Ads interface but I don't find this option, they only have a \"click estimation\" when you play around with the slider to set the daily cost. But according to the few bits of documentation they provide, you pay always for impressions, not for clicks, which is quite bad (even if it's not exactly CPM).That's displayed on their help site:Quote from: a-ads.comThe daily budget is the amount of money you allow us to distribute between ad units during a day in exchange for a share of their impressions. There is nothing written about clicks, only impressions. I was thinking to just run a test campaign for a few dollars but that is a major drawback, because this way there is absolutely no incentive for the ads network to allocate the ads efficiently to \"matching\" publishers, so I'll look for alternatives. It's a bit a pity, really, that they don't offer CPC (they seem to offer affiliate campaigns but not with an easy interface and probably only for a high cost).Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 29, 2023, 11:25:05 AMIt's interesting perspective, but i wonder whether non-cryptocurrency user feel bother when seeing ads shown by A-Ads. My little experience (since i usually block ads) shows ads shown by A-Ads is more annoying or less interesting than Google Adsense or other major service.Of course that depends again from the advertisers' quality. What I guess is that they try to diversify their publisher portfolio with this method but aren't really achieving it. I personally don't remember having seen A-Ads ads somewhere (maybe on a faucet many years ago) so I can't say really much about the experience.",

      "body": "Update: I found a traditional ad platform which accepts Bitcoin (and some other cryptos too): Bidvertiser. Maybe some remember them, some 10 years ago in several publications they were described as the \"main Google Ads alternative\". I think now they have lost that rank to Bing ads or even to Facebook/Instagram/X, or to something like Outbrain, but they still seem to be operating.I've created an account and lurked around a bit. In general they seem to provide lots of options, also geotargeting (which would fit my needs), so I would love to try a test campaign. But unfortunately the minimum deposit you have to make is $100. This is a small amount for a serious campaign, that's true - but to play around a bit without knowing the real potential it's too much for me, and it is also a little bit suspicious, as I remember that in the past Bidvertiser had problems with click fraud. At least I will continue to investigate about experiences. I have thus added the title of the thread to include Bidvertiser into the options I'm interested in.I have also registered at Adshares, but the amount you need to create a campaign is also over $100, and you have to spend it in a single day! That's definitely not the right platform for my small planned campaign ... (I thought about some hundreds dollars but for a campaign lasting 1-2 months).By the way: there's a related thread (not started by me) about experiencies of the \"other side\" (publishers).",

I've looked at A-Ads, Coinzlilla, bitvertiser, from the top of my head. It seems there is still a space in the market for an advertising network/solution that can provide effective advertising and favorable conditions for both advertisers and publishers alike, and I am surprised there is no solution already. The only reason why I can think that is, is because of the rise of social media advertising and the free strategies that can be used to get traffic from these sources, which everyone uses.Quote from: davis196 on December 20, 2023, 12:09:44 PMI've tried using Bidvertiser 8 years ago(2015) and wasted 50 dollars on advertising with zero results.
