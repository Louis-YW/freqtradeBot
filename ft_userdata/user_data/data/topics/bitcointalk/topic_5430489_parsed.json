But one thing I noticed is that many people spend hours upon hours here, like really long hours, which made me think, like how come?Do you guys make a living commenting and being here or are you really that passionate about web3/ crypto and blockchain?",

People spend hours and hours using social media everyday. Bitcointalk is slightly similar — it's just that 95% of conversations are concerning Bitcoin/crypto and not some celebrity gossip or something. Bitcoin/crypto is at least far more interesting in my opinion.Quote from: Eternalman on December 20, 2022, 10:20:36 AMDo you guys make a living commenting and being here or are you really that passionate about web3/ crypto and blockchain?Some people the former, some people the latter.

Plus, you can find a lot of entertaining dramas among the members here, including how other members defend themselves when they are caught off-guard breaking forum rules.Now if you ask me, this forum actually serve as my go-to website to create a habit of learning bitcoin on a daily basis while being rewarded except when there are a lot of schoolworks",

Or playing games (online or offline). Or on TV.So it depends from person to person, really. Going out is no longer \"the thing\" it should be. And if staying in, why not here?This forum (too) is a very interesting \"world\", and spending time and being part of the community doesn't look like wasted time.Of course, getting incentivized to be here and post is an important part/factor. How important, again, depends from person to person and also probably on how big the incentive is (depending on the campaign) and how badly the person needs that money. I would also not underestimate the interest in the actual people in here (online friends made on the forum).Quote from: Eternalman on December 20, 2022, 10:20:36 AMDo you guys make a living commenting and being here or are you really that passionate about web3/ crypto and blockchain?In my case it's (also) both (the interest/passion about Bitcoin and the entire underlying technology and also the incentive) and, I'd say, even more than those two (ie the people).",

I am sure it would have been interesting for any oneI think there are still many forums that specialize in specific areas and are very active, so even though many claim that this way of communication is less and less attractive, for anyone interested in Bitcoin, this is still much more than an ordinary forum. I say that because this is where it all started, and this is actually where much of the history is found, which also includes all the posts from Satoshi in the early days.I think that the expression \"people seem to be dedicating their lives to it\" sounds exaggerated, because I am sure that most of the members spend most of their time in some other places, doing some completely different ordinary things. Of course, there are always members who really spend a lot of time on the forum, but for some this is much more than a forum and that should be understood in some way.",
