But we prefer bitcoin and other crypto casinos because of the ease of transactions. There are some crypto casinos that belongs to scammers.

Anything that has to do with KYC is not about security but privacy. Quote from: nitrobetting on July 27, 2023, 09:53:44 PMCrypto and bitcoin casinos require an email. That’s it. Also, every deposit and withdrawl is via a specific code. So the chances of your transactions being hijacked is close to zero.There are some crypto casinos that make KYC mandatory. You need to start reading the terms of services of the gambling sites that you are using. Be it KYC or no-KYC crypto casinos. Both KYC and no-KYC casinos always include that they can demand for verification from any user at anytime. I am referring to centralized casinos which are what most people are using.KYC and how safe your transaction is are not related at all.

Instead of looking for licenses I would say to look for reputation. That is the best thermometer to check if you should deposit and play at a casino or not. Reputable casinos are operating for years already and have a solid base of users who have been there for a long time already, without any serious complaints to make about the services offered. Maybe a casino like that doesn't have a license, but it's still a safe place to bet.Each casino is unique and their situation must be analyzed individually by gamblers when looking for a reliable website to play online.",

One will expect them to have seized their operating licence but that is not the case in most cases,  and this is one thing that has bordered on the trust and reputation of the casino,  so mate you are very correct to have said that reputation and reviews are sure ways to know the right casino to gamble on.",

Took the words right out of my mouth brother. Player recommendation is the best replacement for \"licensing\" really as it guarantees that a site is not only reputable, it's also fun to play with. Although checking this forum every now and again to find out which casinos are reputable or not isn't so bad either in my opinion. All in all it boils down to finding the right casino by means of looking for those that the people is trusting. Don't take any chances with this one as it's better to be in a casino that is reputable with no bonuses and perks instead of getting reeled to play in a shady casino with lots of bonuses and perks and then by the time you withdraw your stuff you're blocked and your account is banned for some reason.",
