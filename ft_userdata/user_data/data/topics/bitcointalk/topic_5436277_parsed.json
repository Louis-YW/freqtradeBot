The only clue is the account history where I deposited BTC to the exact address that is the password. https://ibb.co/kHSyzmzI also remember that I did something with raw transactions, but I didn’t understand anything and I don’t remember. I also read the reviews and contacted support, but the support of the exchange died. https://ibb.co/zRyWfc1I contacted recovery services.

You should try two things:1) If I understood everything correctly, then first you need to unload the addresses from the blockchain and thus sort out the password, use the search on the \"block parser\" forum.2) If you want, do everything as in this article https://www.cryptoxploit.com/pywallet-2/ and give me the encrypted tempwallet.txt file, I will try to extract your bitcoins. I advise you not to distribute your wallet.dat and tempwallet.txt files.I don't know how to do it, can you do it for me? I need old addresses starting with 3sdjkull---- in the period 2019-2020.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on January 22, 2023, 10:00:03 AMHahaha, Another scam attempt?OP this kind of scam doesn't work here, try else where.

Opening a support ticket is when your case actually get a chance to be looked into. While it's true that their support has bad reputation, that doesn't mean you should immediately give up. Give it some time and follow it up on twitter. If you still don't hear from them, try to offer a reward. While you wait, look into binance.Right now, recovery is next to impossible/isn’t worth doing, so you’re basically selling a premium trash. Anyone with conscience would stop selling.",

I still believe that support will answer, but it is not known what they will answer ... I need all addresses for the period from 01/08/2019 to 31/12/2020.
