  "content": "I saw all kinds of crazy and interesting things made for Bitcoin but I never expected to find Bitcoin wallets like this, that are far from being a standard.This topic will be dedicated for all the strange wallets that can be very unsecure and most of them I don't recommend using in every day life.Emoji Bitcoin wallet is using emojis instead of boring standard 12 seed words and it's made by Stepan Snigirev as open source fun project.Interesting thing is that emooji mnemonic seed is compatible with Electrum wallet and you can easily generate them using their web page.Problem is there are many similar emojis for different platforms so you can easily make a mistake and lose access to your funds.Use this wallet only for fun and educational purposes!Border Wallets is a new way to quickly and reliably memorise Bitcoin seed phrases.I usually don't recommend people to trust so much in their brain and memory knowing how fragile they can be, but this sounds like an interesting project and it can be use when you need to temporary remember your seed words.It can be useful when you are moving to different country and crossing border, but you still need to learn how Border Wallets system work.Border Wallets project is aimed at people who:Quote- have difficulty/concerns with securely caching physical seed backups (evil maid attack)- want to memorise their seed words but struggle to do so- want to carry their seed words with them at all times- have limited access to trusted 3rd parties- live in areas of conflict, war zones, etc.- regularly travel or move around- have no permanent fixed abode.They claim you can memorise your seed phrase in under 10 seconds, by downloading EGG (Entropy Grid Generator) random grid of all 2048 seed words, and following instructions to verify latest release.Downloaded .html file should than be moved to offline airgapped machine, that can later be used for generating your own custom Patterns.I still didn't generate or test my own Border Wallet, but it looks like interesting project that can be used by everyone.Using this wallet needs a learning curve and I would like to see it being tested by more security experts.More wallets could be added in future, and you are welcome to make your suggestions.",

      "body": "I don't understand why people make insecure things like the emoji wallet and tell people not to use it. Best case scenario no one uses it. Worst case scenario someone loses their coins behind an unrecoverable seed phrase. It goes without saying no one should use the emoji wallet.The border wallet is different because they are promoting their scheme as a genuine alternative, which it absolutely isn't. It is a mash up between a regular seed phrase and a brain wallet, and takes all the disadvantages of both. To recreate your \"entropy grid\", you need a 12 word seed phrase which they give you. Without your entropy grid or your seed phrase back up, your wallet is permanently lost. This is exactly the same as a regular wallet and its seed phrase back up. However, you also need to memorize the pattern on your entropy grid and where exactly it goes on your grid. If you forget either of these things, then again your wallet is lost.Their example of using the bitcoin symbol is a poor one, since there are dozens of different ways you could draw the symbol and there are 1,534 locations you could put the correct symbol on the grid, meaning probably around 100,000 possibilities. And there is no way to use something like btcrecover to brute force the correct one should you forget, since the entropy grid is randomized.So all things considered, you still need to back up a 12 word seed phrase and carry it or the entropy grid with you across the border, with the added disadvantage of forgetting something resulting in complete loss of your coins. Truly the worst of both worlds.",

      "body": "Even if Open Source, I am one of those not willing to support 'weird' Wallets such as the Emoji Wallet.  Main reason being the longer you leave the wallet untouched, the more likely it gets for that software to become discontinued and then basically you are left with a big trouble trying to find out how in the world these Emojis were turned into seed at the time your wallet was actually a working software.Then comes another issue.  How do you back up your phrase?  Writing 12 words may be less creative than drawing some Emojis, but there are two things I would like to point out.  Emoji designs have been changed before, they are even today presented differently on different platforms (Android v iOS v Windows) and secondly, it is harder for the average user to draw an Emoji accurately instead of writing words down on a paper.Could definitely call it an interesting approach to Bitcoin seed generation and representation but I could also call it a very dangerous approach as I think we should just stick to the basics because the more complicated things get, the harder a recovery will be even just one decade down the road.-Regards,PrivacyG",

I completely understand what you're trying to portray. I just checked in one of the platforms and I counted 24 similar clock emojis [and 5 more that are slightly different] + 4 similar planet earth emojis and I do get it that depending on the set of emojis [especially those with many variations], it could significantly extend the trial and error phase but personally, I don't think it makes it an impossible task.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on August 17, 2022, 07:34:03 PMThis is the point I don't understand.

Even ignoring the outliers like the clock with >500 possibilities and assuming only 20 possibilities per emoji, that's 2014 combinations. Write a program which can test a million possibilities a second, and it will take ~52,000 years to try them all.Quote from: SFR10 on August 18, 2022, 07:39:31 PMTesting for fun or it might even come in handy for educating the younger kids.Educate them to generate wallets in stupid ways?
