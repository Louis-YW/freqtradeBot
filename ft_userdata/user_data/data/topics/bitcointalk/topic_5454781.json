  "content": "Like everyone else in the bitcoin community we all have a special question for Satoshi Nakamote, so two AI engineers created a bitcoin GPT called talk2satoshi. The chatbot claims to be Satoshi and answers question like Satoshi. I've been poking around with the bot, asking it different questions. It is open AI trained and has 5 sources where it gets answers, users are allowed to add sources too. The program just launched yesterday by two twitter users Pierre Corbin and @hugoferre_ I noticed the bot answers same questions differently, asked it same question repeatedly and got different answers. I chose the answer I like, though I missed one excellent answer, I didn't screenshot it. Currently the site is delaying due to multiple requests.",

By writing scenarios for why Satoshi did something? That’s something the internet has done for a decade.. unless there’s a flaw in the way Bitcoin works and AI somehow gets to find it or a solution to existing problems, for Bitcoin it’s useless!It’s only created a new trend of scams called “AI Coins”, basically ICO/ICP/ICD/IC[insert_letter] reloaded and made a lot of room for very damaging behavior like plagiarizing using it! I said a few days in another post, AI is in this case pretty much text spinning..",

Those tools are basically trained on data available for free, and they have been trained in a way that they can answer your questions based of that data. We can't rely on such tools because most of the times the can be inaccurate and that thing can cause misconception.I recommend you to avoid such tools because it doesn't make sense to invest your time and energy with bots and that's really a sign of madness. Now, the so called engineers are creating such useless bots that claim to be Satoshi the real genius behind the creation of Bitcoin. How could they add the intelligence of someone like Satoshi Nakamoto? I think they won't be able to add such level of intelligence forever.People like Satoshi aren't born everyday, such geniuses are born once in a decade, and they are born to bring change in the minds and the systems. Just try to imagine that how much work the Satoshi might  have done during the creation of Bitcoin. He must have not slept for hundreds of night for creating and fixing Bitcoin and its code. It's literally a scam to mimic such a genius guy by a useless bot.",

Having talk2satoshi AI seems to be useless since we all know that the AI answers are just nonsense and just lines that are made by the developer, I just doesnt see the reason for it.

AI can’t function on their own, they need data’s from the internet to support their reply they give to you.

Well, Bitcoin has nothing to do with the Forum. The Forum was created to discuss Bitcoin. Every forum user is not Bitcoiner. I do believe there are a lot of users who do not own Bitcoin. Some of them are altcoiners, and some are no coiners! The forum community cannot control Bitcoin. It's created to be decentralized and will remain the same even if this community doesn't exist anymore or theymos decide to shut down the forum. Bitcoin will remain decentralized. Is it enough explanation to back my claim that Bitcoin Decentralization has nothing to do with the BitcoinTalk.org community?

I understand that the AI trend is here to stay but how can someone compare an AI bot with a human mind is out of my understanding.  This is the craze AI Created these days. Content creators started relying on AI, and they teach others how to use AI and how their life can be easier. Just imagine someone becoming a Web developer using AI and building a website. Now, when he needs to change something and check the code, he doesn't know where to check or understand what to do. I am afraid of AI. Elon Musk talked about this day which we are seeing now. He has a dedicated Video titled \"I Tried To Warn You\" - Elon Musk LAST WARNING (2023) in His Youtube channel. I don't know if I like him personally. But, I agree with him on many things. At least he doesn't talk shit.",

This is a useless toy that has nothing to do with Satoshi.Why do many perceive the answers of AI as a source of truthful information?

I don't immediately recall what exactly happened, but I am confident to say that satoshi gave the forum to some other admin, theymos eventually became a moderator, and after some period of time, theymos became the head administrator of bitcointalk. This appears to be a fun project, but generative LLMs are not good at stating facts. I am not sure exactly how the model that is being used on this site was trained, but I suspect it is likely the output may have a similar writing style as satoshi, but will not necessarily say something that satoshi would say. (there are sources other that satoshi's direct writings, so there may be many instances in which it will not match his writing style)",

I love the idea and concept of the AI that's why I shared it here, because those guys spent time on this and they did it for the cryptocurrency community it looks unprofessional yes, but it serves one purpose, fun. And we are learned enough to understand that the AI is not Satoshi it all gets information from already existing contents, and the forum should learn to appreciate any work that has to do with the growth of bitcoin, regardless of who built the AI, as if they were members of this forum, they'll be appreciated too, I appreciate them it's worth it, that's their contribution and they can build it to learn more about bitcoin. Newbies can interact with that AI to learn new ideas since it has nothing to do with investment and critical against some altcoins.",
