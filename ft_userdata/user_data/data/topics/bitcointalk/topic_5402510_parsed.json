I am yet to purchase and redeem an amazon giftcard, but I'll take a blind faith that they work like Google play voucher where you input the code at the back of the card and your amazon account will be topped-up? So why would a thief sell them at discount rather than get a full amount of the balance on the card? Like TryNinja, I'm just trying to understand the situation here.",

But in this situation is cleary a scam, no need for interpretation or understanding the situation, it is just a scam.",

You should've searched for his/her \"telegram\" instead [that's how I was able to connect the dots]!",
