These are some form of manipulative terms, and if people start to react then the market could get boosted. This will help him on the acquiring of Twitter.For now his manipulation has failed in the cryptomarket as well in the traditional market. It is time for him to find new way to make some disturbance in the market. Surely he'll have alternate plans, because he's a genius billionaire among all.",

Elon's fanbase seems to include many other successful tech CEOs who defer to him. All of the ideas Elon posted for the future of twitter, seem to be ideas he got from another tech CEO. Jack Dorsey has an interesting concept for a future social media platform which Elon could end up funding. Its a really good design concept. Although I think there are several competing concepts trying to achieve near to the same thing. Tesla has shown that it can be very flexible and think outside the box when it needs to. They're outworking their competitors and could be ahead in development of EVs by a span of years. Even toyota can't touch them although toyota supposedly had a 5 year technology advantage over other automakers in developing and building hybrids. Tesla could have a bright future is like saying water is wet at this point.",

He understands that he has the power to manipulate the financial or economic decisions of so many people. His comments now can make people start to buying Telsa shares which might lead to an increase in price. It is clear that Telsa is a visionary firm that has become a key player in the future of the automobile industry but making this statement now might have other hidden reasons. Apple would be very difficult to unseat as the most valuable brand because of its ceaseless expansion and diversification into different technological sectors. It is also a higher innovative company like Telsa. Its products a highly valued and known even in most developing countries.  Saudi Arabia is the most influential country in OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries). Over the years this organization has spearheaded the quest to make crude expensive through supply cuts and quota systems. Sanctions against Iran and Russia have also been beneficial to these oil-producing states. Aramco is currently making a whole lot of profit. The firm published that its net income increased by 90 percent in the first quarter. Elon Musk did not give a timeline for his prediction, but I doubt if it would come to pass in the next five years.",

We are talking about trillions here, and at the same time a man at one point wants to charge Ukraine for using his internet for the key defense of the country, and it is a measly amount of $80 million. However, it seems that the hypocrite will finally profit from the war, because the EU is discussing paying for the use of the Internet.Quote from: https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-consider-pay-elon-musk-starlink-spacex-internet-ukraine/Speaking to POLITICO, Landsbergis suggested Ukraine's internet access should not be left in the hands of a single \"super-powerful\" person who could \"wake up one day and say, ‘This is no longer what I feel like doing and this is it.’ And the next day, Ukrainians might find themselves without the internet.” He continued: “I figured that it's probably way better to have this as a contractual agreement between, let's say, a coalition of countries that could purchase a service from Mr. Musk, the Starlink service, and provide it to the Ukrainians and keep on providing it to Ukrainians.”",

      "body": "I would take anything from Elon Musk with a very cynical view if I was you. He has no qualms and his integrity is questionable. He just says things that people like to hear and such, appear to the mass, you know. But once it comes to profit and money, those nice and fancy things about his bravado are thrown out of the window right away.For example, you know what Elon Musk has said about wanting to keep Twitter as a 'freedom of speed' platform. Then he's shilling for Russia regard about their invasion, about what kind of peace deal Ukraine should take, giving away their land to buy a 'temporary peace'. Cause he doesn't care about what happen after that, just his money at the front, at it was right now from Starlink giving away for Ukraine's troop to use which cost him money.Or when he's shilling for the CCP regard about Taiwan's status. That Taiwan should accept the 'one country, two systems' ploy from the CCP when the fucking thing has been played out and shown people the true color of the CCP. It was in Hongkong, their freedom was taken away, massive protests against CCP, and eventually, capitulation under CCP's 'one country, two systems'. All for what? For his company, Telsa to receive tax exemptions on their cars in China.If you still believe in what Elon Musk was saying, you're a fool.https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4685519QuoteTAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Two Tesla models were handed tax exemptions by Beijing on Monday (Oct. 10), after a report cited the company's CEO Elon Musk as recommending Taiwan should be run along the lines of Hong Kong's \"one country two systems\" model — and one day after China expressed approval of his plan.On Friday (Oct. 7), the Financial Times published an interview with Musk when he recommended Taiwan become absorbed into China as a special administrative zone that is \"reasonably palatable.\" The tech tycoon then speculated that while it \"won't make everyone happy,\" the terms of Beijing's rule over Taiwan could be \"more lenient than Hong Kong.\"",
