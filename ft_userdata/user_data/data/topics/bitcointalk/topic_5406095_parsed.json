  "content": "I was looking at ways I could make micro payments for services that cost me cents and stumbled on Bitcoin Lightning Network.Â I was intrigued to find that I could make payments as low as 0.000001 BTC for services that require micro payments! Meaning I can pay for my local dish in BTC without delegating custody to a third party for fund trusting.With Lightning Network, multi signatures help keep the transaction open and transparent between both parties in which user A wants to buy commodities from user B and user C servers as an escrow which releases the funds when user A and B are both satisfied and then funds get disbursed with the sigs of the three users.",

Tried to explore it in the past but did not find where to use. I have seen some site that accept lightning but I never needed the product they were selling. Maybe we need some signature campaign who will pay in Lightning Network.",

If it's meant as a general discussion thread about Lightning; we have those already.Since we don't have a Lightning subforum, I understand it may not be easy to find them.Here's a list of All Lightning Network Threads In One Place:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5345664.0Especially The Lightning Network FAQ and Lightning Network Observer are great for keeping up with general Lightning news and talking about general Lightning subjects that don't require a whole new thread.",
