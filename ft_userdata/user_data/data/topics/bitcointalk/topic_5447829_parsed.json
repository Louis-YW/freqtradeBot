My very first experience with them is awful and with all the scam accusations i dey see online about them I no surprise to see this news wey you dey announced so. Sadly I no think say e get anything wey the authorities fit do for this matter unless e get people wey go carry the exchange to court and them go compensate people at the end still fit no reach the money wey you get for the exchange.This kind news na one reason dem advise us not to leave our money for exchanges, e no matter which side the exchange dey whether na decentralized or centralized e no matter, no trust anyone of them say you wan use them as bank or wallet for storing of your coins if not na you go still surfer am. Majority of the service providers for this industry no dey registered and we know say regulations no dey this side which means anything can happen and the government go turn eye commot. For this side na you dey incharge so dey do things you know go benefit you like having total control over your coins.",

But this story about paxful leaving or crashing down is somehow confusing sha, well since wey I join this forum wey I come day hear story about crazy exchanges wet go just dey hold people coins till before you know one day dem Don crash, well my only prayer be say make our number one exchange platform wey be binance sef no come up with one obnoxious excuse about them shutting down because e go red well we'll for people wey actually get coins for there.",

You know, one will never complain about or hate a platform until they have had a taste of its unreliable service. I did a search about them, and I saw scam accusations against them in 2019. Now that they have closed their business, a few people have started threads asking if there is any platform that can replace Paxful. I have not used this platform, but some who introduced me to Bitcoin made mention of Paxful and asked me never to use the platform in purchasing crypto, although he did not mention if he had any bad experiences with them, but from the way he sounded, it seems they have shown him the pepper lesson before.",

      "body": "I must say that this news came to me as a rude shock, I was still in the defence of Paxful a while ago when Localbitcoins exited as though they understood the business better. Not knowing that their days are also coming to an end soon. Personally, I've never been a fan since they have an unfavourable high fee, but this is sad for those that are making their livelihood from this scheme. Particularly those that are already rigid and trusted there, they will be looking elsewhere like the P2P of exchanges.The exchanges are now where many will run to as they are stable and don't do the P2P only.",

E dey happened like that, sometimes na coincidence but for thos one, I see say na good coincidence sake of say,  e show says you keep up to date with the issues since the time you create the exit thread here in the local board,  at least to some of us here you do two very important things which are. 1: Yoh makes me notice say one cryptocurrency exchange like Paxful dey exists,  and na your thread I first read about the exchange,  I mean reading in detail about the company,  I have seen their advert on 1 or 2 occasions but since I have no rate them as a good cryptocurrency exchange,  I no border to check them out. 2: the second thing that your new thread make me know was say,  e help us with the update and in the new update,  their covered more detail about what the closure was and which services and features of the exchange were affected and why. So for me, you do well!",
