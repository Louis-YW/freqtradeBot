  "content": "What happened::  Ponzi MLM Trading platform mtfe collapsed their business scamming approx 1 billion dollars of it's customers. They were offering a high return on investment from fake AI trading. They promised their users that their AI will make profit everyday and there are no chance to lose. Their main target country was Bangladesh and 90% the scammed money from Bangladeshi people. Bangladeshi National news portals reported;Quote from: https://www.daily-bangladesh.com/english/economy/86169MTFE, a Dubai-based multilevel marketing or MLM Ponzi model business, has shut down its business by escaping with around $1 billion or around Tk 11,000 crore in the name of investing in cryptocurrency. Cyber ​​analysts believe that about 90 percent of the $1 billion is from Bangladeshi investors.News worth reading: https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/crime/ponzi-trading-app-mtfe-collapses-tens-thousands-lose-everything-684958Quote from: https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/crime/ponzi-trading-app-mtfe-collapses-tens-thousands-lose-everything-684958MTFE, an online Ponzi scheme disguised as an opportunity to trade in international financial markets, collapsed, leaving tens of thousands across the country penniless.Issues began with a so-called system upgrade two weeks ago. Users have been unable to withdraw any money since then, and on Thursday night, the virtual accounts of almost all users went negative. The unregulated broker claimed to have incurred gigantic losses in the automated trading it pursued on behalf of clients. An app offering opportunities to trade crypto, forex, commodities, and even foreign stocks in its shadow platform, the MTFE recently spread like fire. The platform pretending to earn and pay back from trading offers unbelievably easy money to users. The offer was tantalising enough: spend $26 a day and earn half a dollar per day in return. Keep the app open for half an hour a day to let the system run the supposed trade. For a winning trade, earns half a dollar and for losing, the penalty is equal. The catch is one earns more than $2 as soon as someone new joins the platform with their reference — the textbook way of how a Ponzi scheme works.The MTFE app available on the Google Play Store, which reached people even in upazilas, asks customers to practice trading in the simulation platform and own the profit or loss made. Predictably, almost everyone opts for the other offer called the robotic trading service MTFE provides, which has been showing to be more profitable days than losing ones. Several thousand people from Banaripara Upazila of Barishal have invested at least Tk50 crore in total in MTFE. Investing in foreign assets is prohibited in Bangladesh and that is why MTFE users have to buy cryptocurrency from a gray market first and then pay the platform. Again when they are paid back, the platform gives them crypto currency which the Bangladeshi MTFE users convert to dollars first and then into local currency. People barely needed the reverse process as they only kept pouring more into the platform at any cost, said more than a dozen MTFE users who dream to grow big and become salaried team leaders of the cyber company that no one can reach if the app stops. Almost all the users in Rajshahi, Sylhet, Cumilla, Chattogram and of course in Dhaka the reporters talked to know it well that MTFE might be another app to get shut down any fine morning.  They still invite others as it helps them earn more. One such user in Barishal has over Tk2 crore invested through the app. The MTFE users in the district's Banaripara often meet to celebrate their \"success\". A Facebook page of MTFE users has nearly fifty thousand members.  Scammers Profile Link:  NoneReference Link:  https://mtfe.io https://mtfe.caAmount Scammed:  $1 Billion ApproxPayment Method:  UnknownProof of Payment:  N/APM/Chat Logs:  N/A",

It was already predicted that they would scam. No Ponzi schemes and MLM Companies will last more than a few weeks. But people fall into their trap because they offer high returns within a short period of time. Some people thought it was not a Ponzi scheme because the platform introduced a new technic: Fake AI trading. One of my friends invited me, and she told me that AI would trade for you, and you would profit from trading. I told her that there was no guarantee that AI would make a profit. I know many people within my friend circle who invested in MTFE and got fucked up. I had to warn them about these Ponzi schemes, and I did my job. I asked them not to invest in such fucking scam. BTW, Another ponzi scheme website Catly.io collapsed as well. They disabled selling Catly, and investors got fucked up.",

I used to discourage many people from investing in various mlm, ponzi, but actually they didn't care about my advice and they ended up getting scammed later. So now I don't give advice to these people. Hopefully those who have fallen victim to this MTFE scam will learn from it and focus on developing skills that will come in handy for real life earning.",

But most of them have zero knowledge of what the internet is. Well, it's a different discussion. I don't want to be more off-topic here.Regarding asking someone- I have been asked by 2 people. One from Bitcointalk and one from real life (my friend). I asked them how it works and they told me the details. As it totally sounds like a scam, I asked them not to invest. But the one from Bitcointalk has invested and lost.People here in Bangladesh dream of being rich overnight. That's where the problem is.Quote from: ScamViruS on August 19, 2023, 04:30:05 PMHopefully those who have fallen victim to this MTFE scam will learn from it and focus on developing skills that will come in handy for real life earning.There's one thing common in the Ponzi scheme. Both scammers and investors don't get changed. Scammers create one project, scam, and come up with new projects. While the investors get fucked, regret and again invest in another new Ponzi project. That's what I have been watching in the market lol.",

Once there were revenue sharing websites, those websites were scammed one by one and such investors faced huge losses. But they did not learn anything from that incident, after that many ponzi schemes came in the market and scammed these investors again. If they don't learn something this time and stop dreaming of getting rich quick, they will continue to fall prey to scams again and again.",

A few days ago, my cousin's sister just hit me up on WhatsApp and said that there was somewhere they invited her for a seminar in a city somewhere in Nigeria, and they were advertising this so-called MTFE,\" and she was convinced enough that she wanted to invest some of her cash in it, but lucky for her, she chatted me up and asked me to check the company review. They even have a customized thank-you bag. Just by searching the name on Google, I noticed it was a Ponzi scheme, and I have to convince her that she should not spend a penny on that place as she will end up not getting back any of those.Her luck is not even up to 72 hours as of when we have the conversation, and they are already declared scams. I just pity those who have lost their hard-earned money on this, as this was just a mistake that could have been avoided, but their ignorance and greed blindfolded them.",

Nobody would say to me about their investment if they did not want to invite me. One of my friends wanted me to invest, and that's why she discussed it with me. She tried hard to convince me because she wanted some commission. That's how it's spread. The problem is the majority of them did not know that those platforms may scam while others were expecting them not to collapse too early.

They have run the project for a long until govt found a lot of illegal activities and complain against them.

When i checked their package and profit criteria, I remembered all those Ponzi projects scammed in past. My cousin was also ready to buy 500$ package and Thanks God that they haven't invested in thia ponzi project.I think Pakistan and Bangladesh are the main countries who are scammed. Unfortunately Pakistani CEO of MTFE is one kilometer away from our house. His monthly salary was 1000$ and he has 800 referel. According to his, he was earning daily 8000$. Many users who even don't know how to deposit and withdraw invested on behalf of this CEO and he was making withdraw and deposit for people.Somedays ago when withdraw stopped, my cousin ask CEO about withdraw, he told that he recieved hos withdraw and others will also recieved but after two days it clear that project ran away. Now he has to give all users fund because he announced that anyone use his referel code, he will responsible for capital investment. I think this will be easy for him because most of the user withdrawn capital but problem is that when you recieved withdraw, Greed will force you to invest more. Let's see what happened next but these greedy people will never recover and will invest in another ponzi schemes without any research.",
