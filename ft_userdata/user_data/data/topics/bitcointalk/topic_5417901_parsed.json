      "body": "I don't think I have ever scammed anyone, bitbollo only expressed his opinion for a service I advertised and I did it only to advertise reflink.Regarding stratchbitcoin, I never stole anything from anyone, it was a project I ran and then discontinued. Because it was just accusations from users that I was trying to steal, and that the algorithm was not secure. If you go and read all the discussions, I've always replied to everyone, but unfortunately I understand that with cryptos the smart ones have multiplied and it's full of people who hope for nothing more than to steal from their neighbour. I can assure you that I have never done that. I also wanted to say that in this forum if you try to do something that a senior user doesn't like you are always branded as a scammer. Anyway I've sorted it out I don't need any more, thanks anyway. I see that even though you are not a saint, you have had users give you negative trusts: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=131361",
