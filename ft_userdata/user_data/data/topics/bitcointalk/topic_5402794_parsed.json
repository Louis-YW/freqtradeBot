      "body": "There's also a way to do it without an escrow, but it requires you to pay for the first hour up front. A forum account is worth more than $100 so a hero or legendary member won't risk getting accused of scamming anyone for such a small amount of money. Let us know more about the job and what skills are required. I know how to write a review, if that's what you want.",
