I just finished checking the site out and I must say that the site has very simple designs and is much more of a lottery rather than a full casino where other games are available because the only game i saw on the site is Bitcoin price prediction games by choosing a number which is the lottery number and once the number os the lucky number the predictor becomes the lottery winner.I don't know if there is the development of other games underway, but then we must give the team a warm welcome just as you have done and hope to see more positive outcomes from this casino.",

Do you intend to do some kind of contest and promotions? this has also helped a lot in marketingthey are instant games.. so if you like slots or scratch off tickets- you'll like my games.",

It's actually more about old school hacker type.. i wanted the brand to have a retro look and feel. I personally love it. I hope it will grow on all of you. I disagree about the SEO comment.. SEO has to do with the keywords on the site.. Your main search traffic is from keyword searches.the site is not for everyone. it's for people who are looking for unique games-not the same old stuff.",

Because I'm most case using of 0 in a domain is from scammers and not for real sites. Either it is from artificial sites or for a dubious reasons. The site is very much simple to understand. And since the project is a new one it will need more customers in to visit the site and if the op need that he has to contact a manager to handle a signature campaign for more popularity.",
