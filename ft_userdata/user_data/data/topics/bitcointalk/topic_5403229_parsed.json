  "content": "Hello Everyone, Hope everyone is holding strong in these tough times.I am building an automated wallet tracking solution named DefiDash. It became quite daunting and tedious to manage my wallet in DeFi as I was not able to check the PnL seamlessly and without this visibility one cannot intelligently DCA. To get rid of using spreadsheets and manual trackers I built this solution. Hope this is something that adds value to many out there. Its tough luck for me that when I got the tool ready market has tanked, nevertheless I would like to validate my idea with the community here. Please feel free to be as brutal as you want with feedback, critical feedback is only going to help me make it through these bear months ahead. Thanks in advance.Here is the link to the tool: https://www.defidash.finance/Thanks much!",

If you can't at least put up a warning.I have seen DEI and USDO and this stablecoins unpegged from the USD value a long time ago.",
