  "content": "Singapore / March 31, 2023 / Huobi, the virtual asset trading platform, announced a strategic partnership with Gala Games in Web3 ecosystem development. It is a platform that offers an ecosystem of play-to-earn crypto and non-fungible token (NFT) games across genres on the Ethereum blockchain. Both parties aim to cooperate in the investment and listing of top projects in the Gala ecosystem and will also join hands in terms of ecosystem building, co-branding, project development and community building.One of the unique features of Gala Games is that it allows developers to create games that are truly owned by the players. This means that players can buy and sell in-game items as if they were physical assets. Developers cannot modify or delete those items without the consent of the players. Under the Gala brand, the company has also worked with other Entertainment and Music partners such as movie studio DreamWorks, AMC, NBCU, legendary game developers Peter Molyneux and Will Wright, as well as music greats like Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube, Kings of Leon and BT.A Huobi executive stated, “Building a global Web3 gateway is a crucial long-term goal that demands robust technology, sophisticated infrastructure, and strong ecosystem support. The partnership with Gala Games will accelerate this process and the integration of the Gala Layer-1 blockchain will improve the underlying on-chain technology. Projects built on the Gala ecosystem, such as GameFi and NFT ones, will have a reference to work with in order to implement the proper Web3 infrastructure. Innovative and quality projects in the Gala Games ecosystem will also be considered for investment and listing in our commitment to offer high-quality and diversified assets to our users.\"Gala Games President of Blockchain, Jason \"BitBender\" Brink, expressed the significance of this collaboration, stating, \"Integration of our layer 1 blockchain into popular exchanges like Huobi is absolutely crucial with the level of mass adoption we’re looking for. This partnership empowers tomorrow's developers to create a more stable and secure Web3 future.”About Gala Games:Gala Games is a web3 games company that uses decentralization, player ownership and reward economies to create a revolutionary new way of gaming.

While it's understandable to be wary of a project after a negative experience with a particular exchange, it's important to weigh each project on its own merits and not make an overarching judgement.I think Huobi's partnerships with leading organizations have demonstrated a commitment to broaden the adoption and development of Web3 technologies. Additionally, the partnership with Gala Games demonstrates continued interest in layer-1 integration and ecosystem development. As with any investment, it's important to do due diligence and make decisions based on a thorough analysis of the project, its team, and its potential for growth and success.",
