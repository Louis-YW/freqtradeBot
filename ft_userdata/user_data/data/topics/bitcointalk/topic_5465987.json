  "content": "I've seen this new movement of adding smart contracts functionality to Bitcoin using sidechains. Ever since Taproot was implemented, developers have been working heavily on this. We now have Rootstock (RSK), and Stacks as sidechains which provide smart contracts functionality to BTC. This could be game-changer as it'll make Bitcoin similar to Ethereum in every way. But even better because of the BTC blockchain's higher level of security. Sometimes I wonder if smart contracts are even necessary on Bitcoin, since we already have a plethora of smart contract platforms with their own use cases (Ethereum, BSC, Cardano, Cosmos, etc). Bitcoin was meant to be used only for financial applications. Adding smart contracts would complicate things even more, opening the path for vulnerabilities/flaws and whatnot.What do you think? Is it a good idea for Bitcoin to have smart contract features? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much.",

Is it a good idea for Bitcoin to have smart contract features? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much. Another way of looking at this is what you call \"having smart contract features\" actually means \"having token creation features\". In which case the answer is no it is not a good idea because tokens are still useless and they would only clog the network with more junk.Even if some day a usefulness is found for tokens it is still not a good idea to have them in bitcoin because there is no point in accumulating all features into one project when we can have more.Having them in a side-chain is better but only as long as they don't end up spamming the main chain for their pegs.",

It sounds like you're talking about anchoring on the Bitcoin blockchain. To be honest, I've heard similar discussions in the past, although it is not focused on smart contract platforms but just altcoin anchoring. I'm also on the neutral side, if anchoring is the goal I don't think it will affect any security or fees. It is difficult to encourage users to use smart contracts if it is difficult to use or understand/verify though. At the end of the day, any spammy projects will likely die since their users will need to pump out a lot of fees, just like what happened to ordinal. CMIIW.",

Bitcoin blockchain has a better level of security because it is decentralized, not centralized like Ethereum. It can not be manipulated by a person, a group or core members, to vote then decide rollback the blockchain (Ethereum did it after their DAO hack).Manipulation can be from a core team or by a hack to own enough power on the network but with Bitcoin, it is impossible.From Ordinal BRC20 tokens, I see they are harmful for Bitcoin network and I am against Smart contracts even with side chain to bind them with Bitcoin.

However as far as I know, RSK works offchain (or it used to be) so RSK won’t affect the network in a bae way unless something has changed. On the other hand if bitcoin mimics eth, this means eth made the right moves way earlier than btc. There was a time when btc didn’t want to become like eth. At that time I thought eth was making a mistake addi all those features to their network. Since btc is now trying to follow the same path, it seems to eth was doing the right thing… However right and wrong can easily switch places nowadays. If all those features cause a fatal bug on eth, we will probably thank btc for its simplicity.",

All of the attention is on Ethereum and the likes. Good for Bitcoin, because it was never meant to be an \"All-in-one Blockchain platform\". More features = greater security risks. But there's nothing we can do about this if the community gives their approval. After all, Bitcoin is decentralized and open source. Between Stacks and Rootstock (RSK), I think the latter will prevail in the long run (it's been around for quite a few years). RSK is based on the EVM, so developers could easily port ETH smart contracts into Bitcoin. I wonder how this will work when BTC's supply is extremely-limited? The future is quite unpredictable, so expect the unexpected. Just my opinion",

Most people don't care about decentralization these days. All they want is to make money from crypto within the shortest time possible. It's all a matter of what's most convenient for them. I'm afraid Bitcoin-based smart contracts will remain a \"niche\" used only by a small few (particularly academics & tech enthusiasts). The vast majority of people will use centralized smart contract platforms like Ethereum and BSC. This is good for Bitcoin, because it will drive away \"scam projects\" and \"shitcoins\" (tokens) elsewhere. If BTC were to be used heavily like ETH, fees would become utterly-expensive. Not to mention, transaction confirmation times will be even slower. Projects like RSK and Stacks are sidechains, so the impact on fees and confirmation times will be minimal. As long as everything stays \"off-chain\", there should be nothing to worry about. Who knows what the next big thing on Bitcoin will be? Just my thoughts",
