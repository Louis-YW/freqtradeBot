  "content": "Renounced is just a stupid buzz word! Never fall into trap by just hearing this.Deployer can still run functions and do scam. For example, you often come across function `manualSwap`. All they need is external function without onlyOwner scope Lol!Either take help of contract analyzers or any developers can read the contract out for you!This is latest trend scammers are following! Have Safe Trading! Edit:Sorry for not being comprehensive as you all pointed out in comments. So in a nutshell, contracts can have functions like below and can run such functions to rug pull even after Renounced.function manualSend() external {        require(_msgSender() == _taxWallet);        sendETHToFee(address(this).balance);    }    function manualSendToken() external {        require(_msgSender() == _taxWallet);        IERC20(address(this)).transfer(msg.sender, balanceOf(address(this)));    }Above function converts tokens available in the contract to eth and send eth to deployer wallet. These days contracts are releasing approx 25% in it or 10% in contract. These functions allow us to pull plug softly in different wayFunctions no need to be like above, it can be literally with any name. Hence, Renounce is just buzz word and should be careful!",

Besides the users did not understand the technical detail, mostly they also did not aware of the possibility of the technical capability, which is my main point. So surely it is blissful for the scammer to make a handy improvement to their scamming scheme technique. Since it is programmable, I'm sure it will keep evolving by maximising the flexibility of the contract function and any idea of improvement technique.",

      "body": "Renouncing ownership of a contract means that no one controls it. This prevents any further modifications to the contract. However, it does not restrict the deployer from transferring assets, if the contract's source code includes a manual transfer function for it. It's the buyer's responsibility to thoroughly examine the source code before investing. Blaming \"renouncing\" without knowing its function is unreasonable and is inaccurate. This title will mislead people. Renouncing a contract makes a contract decentralized and it ROCKS!",

As I understood, the first function sends ETH to a fee address, and the second one sends erc20 tokens to msg.sender (being the function caller). So after renouncing the contract, there are lots of possibilities to work around it and scam people, as well as simply removing liquidity. Thanks for going into some details!",
