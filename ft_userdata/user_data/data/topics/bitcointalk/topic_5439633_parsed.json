Rule of thumb: any website that offers you more than few % yearly profit is a straight up scam. You should generally avoid all staking platforms as not your keys, not your coins.Quote from: Sandra99 on February 12, 2023, 06:56:57 PMdoradus like a 8bit.ltd ?8bit is even a more obvious scam. Selling ETH with a 30% discount lol.",
