If you're using Sparrow wallet how do you avoid self transfer warnings but proceed in whirlpool mix securely?\"Possible self-transfer\" is one of the blockchain analysis heuristics used to cluster an entity. When software detects transactions with a single output or when it is unable to determine which address change has been sent to, it automatically assumes that a user just sent funds to himself, that is, to the address to which he has a private key. It is arguably one of the most accurate metrics because users rarely have an exact amount they need to make a payment: in most cases, a transaction will have at least two outputs, one for actual payment, and the other for change that is sent back to the user making a payment. So, no matter how many wallets you create, \"changeless\" transactions may always be assumed to be self-transfers regardless of their real purpose.",

I stopped using Sparrow on Electrum EPS so connect direct to Bitcoin Core in localhost. I’ll keep EPS for Electrum wallet tests. I haven’t sent funds from my Sparrow wallet or Sparrow created Bitcoin Core QT wallet that’ll be done soon so it’s about Sparrow wallet whirlpool mix.Sparrow whirlpool mixed after I’d shut down the computer I wasn’t sure if the mix would work but it worked. It's set for 3 whirlpool mixes you can change it for your requirements. Sparrow whirlpool mixed once but it’s set to 3 in my settings. If Sparrow wallet’s open there’s an option in Bitcoin Core QT to access my whirlpool mixed Bitcoin. It’s convenient & helpful because Bitcoin QT display makes it easier to choose which wallet I’m viewing. My bitcoin sitting in Badbank wasn't mixed so should I mix them before spending?I've paid 0.0005 BTC which I've read Samourai Wallet takes for fee. I've paid less than 0.0001 BTC which I'll assume for Sparrow wallet fee & Bitcoin fees. It's a big fee paying 0.0005 BTC for Samourai services. I don't know how much Bitcoin should be whirlpool mixed for 0.0005 BTC fee to be acceptable I'd advise 0.05 BTC so it's 1% fee. Are my estimations I close to your acceptability? Sparrow wallet and bitcoin fees are added extra. I'm confident Sparrow functions completed but it's 1 mix on setting of 3. Should I repeat mix manually for achieve 3 whirlpool mixes? I've read it's one 0.0005 BTC fee for unlimited mixes of one UTXOs.When whirlpool mixing which priority's best setting?    It's amazing I'm getting free limitless help so I'll continue asking questions & seeking advice. Thanks",

You can see the fees for the different pools here: https://docs.samourai.io/whirlpool/basic-conceptsTake the 0.01 BTC pool as an example. You can enroll a single output of 0.01 BTC and pay 0.0005 BTC in fees (which is 5%), or you can enroll 70 outputs of 0.01 BTC and pay 0.0005 BTC in fees (which is 0.07%).Quote from: arabspaceship123 on June 20, 2023, 12:39:38 PMI'm confident Sparrow functions completed but it's 1 mix on setting of 3.

How to cancel transaction for refund?Firstly I would say that spending coins after a single coinjoin is not best practice. Far better to leave them and let them be remixed for free as many times as you can to increase your anonymity set. Secondly, judging by your screenshots, I'm not sure they've been mixed at all yet.

Free remixes are dependent on new liquidity entering the pool, as well as your UTXOs being randomly selected from all the UTXOs in the pool. This is the biggest downside to Samourai in my experience. You can sometimes be waiting days for even a single remix. Having more UTXOs in the pool and leaving your wallets running 24/7 will make you more likely to get remixed.The progress bar beside one of your UTXOs should increase to around 30%, and if you mouse over it it should say \"Registered input\". This way you know you are waiting for a remix. In your screenshot with the progress bar completely empty, then I suspect your wallet is not properly connecting to either the coordinator or the network.",
