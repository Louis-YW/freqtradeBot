Without verification, you can only deposit crypto and send funds to other Coinramp users.You have two types of cards: Card limits and Card+ limits. Although the limits are different, there are no additional conditions for obtaining Card+. They are the same requirements, which are verified your ID.

This is the max limit a card can load based on our bank requirements.

We use (regulated) services like mercuryo.io to handle crypto deposits and exchange, as we are not a crypto exchange. I hope I answer your questions, let me know if there is more I can help with!",

Maybe because I currently use some virtual Mastercard service that also supports crypto doesn't have such fees. Otherwise, different businesses have different ways of operating. That is just my feedback/observation.",

We are currently looking to find the right fit for us. Thing is, with the current fees it will be very hard for you to get any traction in EU because we are satured with bunch of cards with very low fees, high limits and even cashback. At the same time, you ask $15 per month to just use the card, then $2.9% card loading fee etc and on top of that we still have to do KYC like for any other card with much better terms.Don't get me wrong, it is good thing for us users to get more crypto cards and I wish you a good luck (assuming that you are legit company).",
