Sorry my friend for your feeling but I'm asking and I'm new its worth in my Trust wallet around 300B Anyone can make a token and fake-valuate it at any price they want. If there is no liquidity, it's just a number and there is nothing supporting the number that you are seeing.Loyce is not sharing his feelings with you, he is telling you the facts:1. You were scammed if you paid anything for the tokens.2. Your tokens are worth nothing.Even if you dropped the price to $100, it's unlikely anyone would buy them from you.",

Some scam exchanges perform double scam, where give you the price of the token worth thousands of dollars, but it is listed in one exchange. When you want to withdraw, you will be asked to deposit some bitcoins or complete some conditions.If the token is not listed on more than 10 exchanges and has good liquidity, it is better not to trust the value that appears to you, because it will most likely be fake.If I say now I have 10 bitcoins and I want to sell them, a lot will give you a value for them, but if I say I have 100 billion of X unlnown coin, no one will want that, big coin numbers does not create value.",

Sadly this industry is one of the scammers in it, where they constantly innovate their strategy to fool people like OP. Too bad for the OP to experience this, but this will be a warning for others unfamiliar with this kind of scam yet. It's always right to read first before rushing into an investment because most of the scenarios out there are like this unless you already know what to do, and you can prevent such things from happening to you as well.",

So that's others can see your billion dollars worth of tokens So right now, you are considering yourself to be a billionaire.ðŸ˜‚But let me just ask out of curiosity: how much did you spend purchasing this Bugs Bunny token that has turned you into a billionaire, and how long has it been?Checking through CoinMarketCap, the token doesn't even have a dollar volume.But can't coin trackers do some kind of investigation before they can possibly list some tokens? Because a visible price on the user's wallet, combined with greed, is what most often deceives victims into buying such scam coins.",

After checking the address of its contract and full information, you will know that you will not be able to sell or transfer it because it has zero liquidity, and there are malicious codes found in the contract address. It was a mistake that you did not do your own research before buying this scam meme coin. There are thousands of scam coins on Pancakswap, and the listing on this platform is free. The price in front of you for this scam currency now in Trustwallet is an imaginary price, as there is no one who can sell this quantity now at this massive price because the currency that you have has no value, does not do anything, ignore it entirely and if you interact with the currency contract, try to revoke your wallet through the following link: https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker",
