Cryptocurrency is on the gray area that makes SEC more powerful because they can introduce or sight a favorable law that will make staking as security. I wonder if these avengers attorney can make a change on dealing against SEC since XRP is having a hard time dealing with them even Ripple has a good reason on why they are not a security token.",

It seems you have some good details about this recent case and I will be glad if you can give out a link to the news so I can get to read it myself then I will be truly grateful as I look forward to it.This is another case to show that government is really trying so hard to fight crypto and I hope things goes well with Coinbase and I hope that the full details of the news or better still the thread should be updated with all the results of the hearing and court readings  because I will love to know how things finally turned out to be and what the fate of Coinbase would be.",

So far, why is coinbase the only one who was forced to assemble to battle? It's like the whole crypto space is yelling out to Coinbase to save them.  The outcome of Coinbase's efforts to prove to the SEC that proof of stake projects are not securities remains to be seen. The fact that Coinbase has assembled a team of experienced attorneys indicates that they are taking this issue seriously and are prepared to fight their case.It is worth noting that Coinbase is not the only cryptocurrency company that has faced regulatory challenges recently. Many other companies in the crypto space have also had to deal with regulatory issues, and it is possible that more will follow in the future. As to why Coinbase seems to be at the forefront of this battle, it could be due to a variety of reasons, such as its high profile, its size, or its unique business model. Ultimately, the success or failure of Coinbase's efforts will depend on a variety of factors, including the strength of their legal arguments, the SEC's response, and the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies.",

For Ripple, things can end up with huge fines, although for Ripple it will be little money.The SEC's hunt has only just begun, and a fair number of projects will suffer this year. In America, precedent legislation, so all large companies will pay fines. American law is not bloodthirsty, pay the fine and move on.",

All the policies and forces against just a single purpose in my country's politics are somehow stopping Khan from taking the charge of government again and on the crypto market, the approach is quite similar to stop somehow Bitcoin from dominating the financial market.",

Even they are making strict laws against cryptocurrencies which shows their intent is not crypto-friendly.Anyways i am hopeful that against all the odds, the crypto exchanges will come strong as the whole crypto community is with them. they just can't force the exchanges to shut down and crypto to die when the public wants to invest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.",

So far, why is coinbase the only one who was forced to assemble to battle? In my opinion, the Coinbase exchange team or lawyers have the right to submit all things and actions that they think are detrimental to Coinbase, they show civil evidence and cases that are being faced by Coinbase exchange to the SEC at this time.As well as the SEC, they have the right to protect investors and also the SEC is responsible for overseeing the regulation of the crypto market and also they the SEC cooperates with the Department of Justice in handling certain cases in the current crypto exchange actions, their laws are official and strong, of course there are winners and losers in the name of war, if Coinbase has strong evidence in this case, of course they can win against lawsuits in court to face the SEC and vice versa.But the SEC has full rights to protect anyone who is involved in crypto exchanges that lead to fraud, as far as I know the SEC before taking a decision and action against a particular crypto exchange declared as a fraud, they SEC usually has collected several databases, analyses, reports, electronic data and so on against the exchange, but if Coinbase can prove that they are not fraudulent and wrong, I think it's fine, but to find out who wins in this lawsuit, of course we need to look further into this war.",
