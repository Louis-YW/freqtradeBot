  "content": "Simple emission    1 coin per second forever. Simply fair. Simply disinflationary. Decentralize the wealth.Simple block interval    One minute. 60 seconds. 60 coin subsidy.Simple consensus    Proof of Work. Most cumulative difficulty wins.Simple protocol    In (pure) Mimblewimble, outputs are Pedersen commitments r*G+v*H    combining value v and blinding factor r into a single curve point.    The blinding factor serves both to hide the value and to control ownership.Simple audit    Σ unspent-outputs = Σ kernel + offset * G + height * 60e9 * H    Each kernel is a provable commitment to 0 (as is offset * G)    height * 60e9 is the expected number of nanocoins emitted in height blocks.Simple PoW algorithm    Cuckatoo Cycle. Find a 42-cycle in a huge random graph. Instantly verifiable in 42 lines of code.Simple Difficulty Adjustment    diff’ = diff * 4-hours / (4-hours - 60-seconds + last_block_time)Simple mixing    CoinSwap can non-interactively mix thousands of self spends each day or hour.Simple scripting    No scripts, aka scriptless scripts.    Supports nearly all Bitcoin script functionality, with none of the complexity:   multi-signatures, atomic swaps, discreet log contracts, bidirectional payment channels, etc.Simple implementations    Small Rust and C++ codebases.Simple security    Complexity is the enemy of security. Keep it simple to keep it secure.",

That's why we always advise to DYOR and the risk involved, invest what you can afford to risk attitude here because you just don't know what coins you are going to put your money and what it's gonna do in the future.",
