      "body": "Never had any experience using this wallet but do you have any exchange option than zigzag.io?Or I think if the wallet still allows you to send funds in the lightning network why not send them directly to any exchanges that support lightning? Then withdraw them and send them to your on-chain wallet.Or you can open a channel on Electrum Lightning to receive your funds from bluewallet.",

Electrum supports both on-chain wallets and also lightning networks.To use the Lightning functionality on Electrum, you will need to install the Lightning plugin. Just go to \"LN channel\" -> \"Open channel\" from the menu and then search for the \"yes\" option.  Once you have installed the plugin, you will need to connect to a Lightning node and open a Lightning channel to start using Lightning transactions, on that way, you can simply transfer your fund.",

Since there is no impact on ON-chain bitcoin, you can move you funds back to On-Chain bitcoin wallet. To do this you need to go to Lighting Wallet on your blue Wallet, Go to Manage funds, then go the Exchange Zigzag.io, where you initiate a lighting Payment and finally receive your bitcoin on a bitcoinBTC address.",
