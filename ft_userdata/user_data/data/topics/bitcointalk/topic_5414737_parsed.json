  "content": "Hello everyone,https://coindik.com/I will talk about my project that we have been working on for a long time.Did ever you wonder where people find the best new cryptocurrency projects, coins and tokens like Doge and Shiba Inu? They use websites like CoinDik. Cryptocurrency projects are listed here before CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and major exchanges. Find the best crypto moonshots on our website. However: before investing always do your own research (DYOR)! Listing on CoinDik does NOT mean we endorse the project, they could be scams. Be careful with your investments.You can add free tokens and airdrops and offer voting advantages to all users. only registered members can vote and can only 1 vote. vote never spam like other sites and this highlights the best project.we have daily lucky spins section. lucky spin rewards are low  as our website is new. We are constantly improving our website and we care 100% about your ideas.We would appreciate it if you could criticize us harshly.thanks",

There are no other metrics other than votes so this makes the ranking questionable already. It's mainly just showing the strength of each community and not about the unique use cases or other important features.",

We are building a platform where all crypto lovers can discover new projects and expand their visions together.  of course people can always be unreliable so DYOR !",
