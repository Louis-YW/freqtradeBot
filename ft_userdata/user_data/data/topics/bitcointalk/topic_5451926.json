I've noticed is abnormalities since last week and until now we're still suffering  this shit which is very wrong and I thought it was just some minor irregularities and I was hoping it gets fixed before it gets noticed but unfortunately tye reverve is now the case as it is becoming so obvious and it seems no one is doing anything about it but rather just relaying on hopes and fate which I'm sure would save us.20 dollar isn't bo small money in ny local currency and now one has to pay 3 dollar even for no priority and 3 dollar is over 2 thousand naira in ny local currency.",

As a result, if you are desperate to bet, use the medium priority and risk having your transaction delayed for some time, or if you can afford the high priority transaction fee, you are good to go.",

I think we all know it, Ordinal is the hot thing this year and traders, investors, and even scammers are taking advantage of this. There's a post made by @pooyah87 which tells how scams are increasing in numbers, which results into flooding the network and increasing the fees.It's a really rough situation right now without the knowledge of when this is going to end.",

For me I personally have resolved to myself not to make any other transactions on the network again until the the congestion is less and fees reduced because it is too much for me, and I can only pay such fees when I am under pressure. For gamblers who this development is affecting, It is frustrating, but for the time being you can stop gambling on crypto casino's.

And those are all the big ones like the mentioned stake, but also sportsbet.io, nitro and so on.Actually I have seen no site that lets u deposit A and withdraw B. Those must be fiat sites that only offer crypto to attract more players.When you deposit btc, you play with btc. That means your winnings are also in btc -> can only be withdrawn in btc.I gave up on btc with gambling a while ago. Almost all good sites offer altcoins as an alternative.At stake for example you pay like 2$ in withdrawal fee (even still now) for btc withdrawals, while with LTC or XRP you pay 0.01$ or less. Easy decision.",

Probably until we get another trend on cryptocurrency market. Right now NFT on Bitcoin blockchain are killing network and whole idea of Bitcoin. The situation is similar to expensive transaction in Ethereum network and popularity of DEX. That trend started to lose its power when metaverses were announced and people have switched their attention to it. Right now Bitcoin is following Ethereum path imho. So I see two options for you, make deposits now and keep balance on gambling platforms, or wait for months for lower fees.",

This has attracted the attention of those who want to create their own tokens similar to NFTs and list them for selling without the need of any smart contract. This is causing congestion due to minting of NFT tokens. I would suggest you to conduct your transactions during off-peak hours (at night or early morning) when fee is comparatively low. https://www.makeuseof.com/reasons-bitcoin-transaction-fees-are-so-high-right-now/#:~:text=As%20people%20continue%20to%20mint,very%20suited%20to%20high%20demand.",

Or course, that is mostly wishful thinking, more tokens and useless NFTs will continue to be minted as long as the developers continue to leave this unsolved.",
