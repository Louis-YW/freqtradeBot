Bitcoin has been in existence for more than a decade. Try some Google search about it and you will find a lot of answers. Considering the amount of spam on this board. I think you just slided away from getting banned on this forum in a illiterate  manner as you could have got your answer by simply.doing a Google search.",

If you are also looking for something that isn’t under government control then bitcoin decentralization offers that. Also it is well known that investment are majorly assets that have the potential to grow in profit and also bitcoin is a great ROI assets due to its volatility, but just like other assets this same volatility is what makes it a risky investment because just like it increases it also most at times have its lows. But with long term holding plan, the risk of getting to it lows to the point where you sell at loss is minimized. If these are all you seek from an investment asset then bitcoin is that asset",

Well, coming to your post let me tell you Bitcoin is not a investment platform like any other platform which assures you big profits on daily, monthly and yearly basis.Btc is a digital currency, and you better know how a currency is used and for what purposes. Other than that, BTC is the best source to store value for your money. I am assuming, you have not a slight information about BTC, and still it is your last hope because last hope means definitely something important option. Well i recommend you to read the following thread before jumping into your last hope.The most iconic bitcointalk threads. History on BitcointalkBy reading above thread, you will atleast get some knowledge and will definitely understand the functioning of BTC. There are so many thread i could recommend you, but that will lose your heart to move forward to it. So, i think, for now just watch some videos about BTC and how it is the Father of all digital currencies.",

I was introduced into it.Yes, Bitcoin is trust worthy, it is far more trust worthy than fiat currencies that we all are using on daily basis. Bitcoin is a very valuable and a great asset for the ones who want to invest into it because the returns from Bitcoin investment could be as high as 2x in coming years. Some people even predict that Bitcoin could reach higher price of $120k in coming bull market which is expected to take place in 2024-2025 after the halving event. Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 and since then it has been delivering up to the expectations of the investors without any issues, and that's why you can trust Bitcoin for your investments.I recommend you to learn about Bitcoin first because many investors make a mistake when they want to invest in Bitcoin. Most of the investors chose custodial wallets for their investment which isn't a safe way to invest in Bitcoin because those custodial wallets can not be trusted. If you really want to invest in Bitcoin then you should definitely learn about Bitcoin wallet software like Electrum, and once you gain enough knowledge about that software wallet then you should invest a few dollars in start until you learn everything about that software wallet. Make sure during the creation of your personal wallet you should save your private key and your seed phrase. I have seen many people who forgot about saving their private key or seed phrase and later lost access to their Bitcoin. I recommend you to learn about the private keys and seed phrases first and then you should create your personal wallet. Once your wallet is created you should save your seed phrase and private key on multiple storage devices that are in your control. You should never allow anyone to access those storage devices, and you should also backup your wallet.dat file on those storage devices. Once everything is done and you're sure that you have gained enough knowledge about Bitcoin wallets then and only then you should invest in Bitcoin and once you purchased Bitcoin then send those bitcoins in your wallet, and after receiving your bitcoins in your wallet you should disconnect that device from internet and turn it off. Never use that device again, and only use it when you want to resell your Bitcoin for a higher profit.",

Bitcoin is trustworthy than stocks and other cryptocurrency because its a real decentralized asset which means no one controls it aside from the community. Blackrock and other huge financial institution is already making their move to be involved on Bitcoin. This is a great sign on how trustworthy Bitcoin is.",

Bitcoin have been existing for 14yrs and has become one of the most valuable asset in all assets. Bitcoin was created to be an alternative currency,it uses a p2p method of payment and goes beyond boarders without a third party. It gives privacy and gives financial freedom to its users. All these has made bitcoin worthy ever since it was launched. The rate of adoption keeps on increasing everyday by day and has overcome every form of attack on it from government and scammers.",

I was introduced into it.In the year of 2023 no one but newbies are going ask this question.Your question will be more appropriate if you ask that if Bitcoin is suitable for investment to gain profits. Obviously there is no doubt about the trustworthiness of Bitcoin. It's the first digital virtual currency which is decentralized and also the most popular.You can have some knowledge about it's popularity and volatility if you take a look at the chart. It has gained all time high price for several time and pumped hard. But as it's volatile it dumps also in the bear market. So take a look at the chart and hope you learn if it's a good investment for you or not. If you can afford some risks of market crash or going to invest for long term then undoubtedly it's the best investment to choose.If you want a safe investment then you should research more and have to choose the right time to get in. And always use non custodial wallet for your funds safety.Here is Historical Data of the Price of Bitcoin:Image Source: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-price-history",

I was introduced into it.What are the things that you did that failed? I would have suggested you give a bit of a narrative of what they were, because that will determine how you handle your Bitcoin investment. Normally, Bitcoin is for everyone who embraces it, but embracing Bitcoin means you need to learn how it works, the security measures to safely secure your assets, and how to make your privacy a priority. Why I think you should have given a bit of detail is so that the user here will know how to guide you very well on the aspect of Bitcoin investment.But if you must know, and also speaking for myself, Bitcoin investment will not fail, but if it does, then I will just take it as one of those things that is always preached about not holding all your eggs in one basket. That's why you should also take note of the rule that states, \"Never invest what you can't afford to lose.\" The reason is so that if anything goes wrong, you will not have total regret. Also, investing in Bitcoin means that you will learn how not to joke with your wallet security; otherwise, you can lose your asset entirely.Again, Bitcoin investment is good; just learn the rules that apply and you are good. Note that you buy the dip and hold it until you make a profit that you are satisfied with.Cheers 🥂, Dr.Bitcoin_Strange 👺👺",

Unlike if you ask elsewhere.I think you have to realise that this cannot be convinced just by asking because this needs more learning because if you only ask on the bitcointalk forum I actually feel that you already know what the answer is and actually doubt it so you need to look for independent information or research further so that you fully believe it.",
