What would be the highest price of bitcoin in 2023? Make your guess here:Bitcoin price guess, 2023This thread should not be mistaken for what the price of bitcoin would be in 2023, it is about what the price could in January 2023. The open price is $16550. Will bitcoin price be less volatile like January 2019 or not? If not for FTX implosion, probably bitcoin could still be around $17500 to 21000 by now, but the implosion led to the present price bitcoin is at now, if no further bad news which is likely and possible, good news will later be what is going to be everywhere and it will be a sign that bitcoin will increase in price, but will the price of bitcoin in January reach significant high price?Will bitcoin price increase in January?Is bitcoin getting back to $20000 in January or not?",

A healthy bounce is probably a good thing to wait for and then after that a few more healthy bounces (higher lows).",

However this doesn’t account for any macro conditions.If the fed goes crazy with hikes or if there is some collapse of some large bank then that all can quickly change. A lot depends on how the inflation numbers will look next month and beyond. This is why it’s hard to predict a good price.",

You forgot to mention the Terra/Luna, Three Arrow Capital, Voyager and all the rest.The crypto world really seemed like a house of cards with all those companies, who were borrowing coins by offering unrealistically high returns. The 2020/2021 price pumps/bull runs really seemed like a price bubble and the bubble popped in 2022. Now, we are waiting for the next price bubble, but there's no demand that will pump the price.The Bitcoin price would most likely stay below 20K during the entire winter. Maybe the spring will be a little bit bullish(it depends of the global situation) but I don't expect nothing radical. The summer of 2023 will be a continuation of the crypto winter and I expect the price to stay in the 12-18K levels until the end of 2023.",

That's being said I will want to make my observation and prediction of bitcoin price in the month of January 2023, the market is still in recovery mode from the whole crisis in the cryptocurrency market throughout the last quarter of 2022 have really affected the price of bitcoin in this early days and the festive period just ended with most cryptocurrency community members still on holidays and no much activities in the market right now businesses are not fully open yet all these factors contribute to the bitcoin price movement so the month of January may go through a period of slow market increase and high resistant level which is around $16k-$17,000. But for quarterly predictions I can agree with the $20,000 BTC price because of the long period involve which aids price and market activities.",

They are still in the recovery stage and this could be one factor that holds them to invest for now due to continuous decline after a huge surprise. I can't make myself not lose hope but as the current situation remains like this ( low demand), I would say reaching $20k this month is quite impossible.
