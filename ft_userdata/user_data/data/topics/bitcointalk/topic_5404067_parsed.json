  "content": "By this time last year, China had been loyal patrons in the purchase of US natural gas but seem to lose interest as they have located a better, closer source. The US- China energy trade deal, entered in Jan 2020, after the trade war between Washington DC and China in 2018 during Trump's administration, entailed a pledge from Xi's govt to buy about $200billion worth of US goods and a $52.4 billion in energy.   China's crude oil imports from Russia soared by 55% from a year earlier to a record level in May, displacing Saudi Arabia as their top supplier. Could China's reason for switching to Russia from the US as a result of closeness of boundaries or is there an ulterior motive? While the US are aggrieved that they've been snobbed, Russia has a lot to be grateful for as the 30% discount offered to the Chinese government looks to be piling his coffers despite the sanctions from the West aimed at crippling their economy. In May, the Kremlin raked in around $20bn just from the exportation of oil alone! https://toutiaoqushi.com/us/articles/1524e08b7865856c/",

      "body": "If the amount of oil imported to China was substantial, this might've just been a way for China to increase the strength of the Yuan to increase their earnings from their exports market and solve issues they might be having with covid and their economy (like the housing market).China is still the second largest holder of US government bonds too from what I could find (holding about $1tr). This could also just be taking advantage of Russia's situation too - if you're being offered the same thing at a 30% discount, it'd make sense to go with that.",

Where I live gas prices have basically doubled during the last year and things are probably going to get worse during the winter, so if a government that is not involved directly or indirectly in the war can take advantage of the situation and get cheap gas then I am not surprised they take advantage of the opportunity given to them, after all most of the economies of the world are in a bad shape and getting a discount in such a strategical resource can be critical to slowdown the inflation rate in their country.",

Both the EU and US have committed to transforming their energy sector into green energy so it isn't clear that some countries will revert back to traditional based energy sources. Germany is reverting back to coal, but they are a singular case. The US in particular haven't been increasing their oil production, and green energy forms are undeveloped so they can't produce the energy they need through greener methods.Russia can still sell to China and India. Ruble is somehow one of the best performing currencies as of late. It's solely based on energy.",

Increasing the strength of Yuan will not make it attractive for trading with other countries. Most economist also have the same opinion, they have to maintain its value low for every country to trade with them. Same with Russia's  ruble they have to maintain its value so  trading gas and oil from them will continue. And to make this happen they have to invest somewhere outside build relationship to other countries.Its not just motive to circumvent the sanctions but build relationship like how  China did to different countries through the BRI. They invest everywhere, Russia offer loans too  just recently they provided loan to Sri Lanka.",

It would be much easier to just get those gas and energy or whatever really from Russia instead of any other nation. Plus with Russia in war, they are sanctioned and they  can't sell their gas to too many places, hence they would be willing to do even discounts to china as well.This will result with China preferring Russian gas for a decade or longer and they will not care about American politics. Sure China and USA had a \"trade war\" before, but this would be like trade break up  I know that sounds silly, but China just found a hotter and sexier gas provider, and they want to go with that.",

Some really joyfully clap their hands and yell \"brotherly China is saving Russia\"  But they don't understand that the market has simply been redistributed, where now the terrorist country is leaving the European gas market, and is trying to sell unnecessary gas. This is used to the fullest, China. And in such a way that the saying \"You don't do that with friends\" is quite suitable here  China is forcing Russia to lower the price to the level that China wanted. And Russia cannot refuse China, but in fact the \"big brother\"!And at this time, Russia, which even economically (with gas) tried to terrorize its friends in Germany and France, is quietly and calmly replacing the United States with its own gas, and a significant event already occurred a month ago - the volumes of gas sold by the United States on the EU market exceeded the volumes sales of gas from a terrorist country.",
