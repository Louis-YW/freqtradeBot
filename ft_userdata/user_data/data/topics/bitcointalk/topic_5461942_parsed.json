We can say its work like traditional banking finance but with the help of blockchain this could be done on their own as the platform served as your easy to go access while banks used personnel to do it for you while this one gives you the freedom to manage it well and monitor it anytime.

It's unavoidable, but it isn't going to be as simple as everyone seems to think, where regulators control everything. Regulated Decentralized Finance can be build on even on decentralized permissionless ZK blockchain where we don't have to share everything with regulators. All they need is that we need to prove something they require. And with zero knowledge proofs we can provide the proof without revealing anything we want to keep secret.Assets can be issued on top of that blockchain and while native coin itself can be permissionless, assets can be issued on L2 and have some qualities that regulators want, like transactions being reversable, private and instant.",

By fighting against such absurd regulations, the US government will have no choice but to step back and let crypto run its course. No one can predict the future, so lets hope for the best.

He argued that the DeFi industry is in dire need of regulators, otherwise it has no chance for serious development, for some kind of acceptance. This is because there are a lot of random and temporary people coming into the industry, who fill the market with temporary products, the purpose of which is to enrich themselves at the expense of investors. Then these people disappear and appear under new nicknames and new brands.

It's complex, but not impossible to achieve. That's if we're talking about adding KYC at the protocol level. But doing this will greatly defeat crypto/Blockchain tech's original purpose which is to eliminate the middleman for good. Bitcoin was created on the basis of decentralization in an era where centralized financial institutions (banks) were about to collapse. We should not repeat the same failures of banks by making the whole system centralized. If \"De-Fi\" complies with KYC/AML, then it wouldn't be decentralized anymore. Hopefully, the US government will understand as it finds no viable way to properly regulate the industry. With greater flexibility in crypto regulations, the industry could grow without limitations.
