I am sure this is not my internet connection.2. The ANN could be better in design perspective. Why don't you add the texts on the design and then convert everything into BBcode.3. Bitcointalk is the biggest cryptocurrency community exists ever. Building a brand in the community eventually is profitable. I would suggest you to market the brand in the community while you are continuing your marketing in other platforms.Good luck.",
