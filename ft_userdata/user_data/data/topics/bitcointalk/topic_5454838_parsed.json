Through your bank details, your details can be known by diggers, same goes for email address if you use your real identity to open it.This is only possible if you are using a centralized exchange to purchased and sell Bitcoin. Also you will encounter that kind of sensitive problem if you do something wrong because no one can access your data on centralized services without request by the authority to share your information.Sharing publicly your wallet address is not a big deal at all if you knew to keep safe your private key properly. Most of the scammers blatantly posting their address publicly to scam people. If this people hiding from the law can do it without a problem then why normal people will worry on doing same thing?",

This is a mistake!Nothing can be revealed when you just post an address that has either zero balance or that you have just deposited some coins from a really private source, like a mixer and that's it.The moment you start using the address that has been linked to your profile and the more you post about your profile, with every single action your privacy gets eroded till you will not be safe anymore, and in extreme cases it might be even worse than a bank. Let me give you an example, of how badly this can turn- you purchase from that address a hard wallet since a ton of chain analysts can label almost all business and value at the moment of the tx, they will see you have made a transfer of the exact value of a Ledger Nano X.- Ledger does what it knows best and leaks the data againSo now everyone can link all the addresses that have paid the price of a ledger wallet to the addresses posted online on social media, and here you go, addresses bc1xxxx, with a balance of 100 BTC which is tempting to any thief has a user that is from Shangri La and here you go, the address, your phone number, and everything are now tied together and your privacy is gone, forever!And it's not just that complicated, you order a simple pizza from that address, the pizza store owner knows your apartment address for the delivery and knows from where you have paid him, from now he can have a new hobby, let's see what this customer of mine has been doing, oh, he just withdraw 20 BTC, half a million from ana exchange...Hmm, I know a few guys!!!",

It is again good to use non-custodial wallet for keeping your bitcoin safe and own total right to it.Indeed, just by seeing someone's public address, no one will be able to find out anything if the owner of this address has not told anything about himself. Since all addresses are immediately visible on the blockchain, we can see any of them. If there were any direct danger because of this, then the owners of the largest amounts in bitcoins would have faced it long ago.Most of the issues that have come to light are related to the careless storage of private keys and seed phrases, as well as the fact that the victims widely talked about having bitcoins, which attracted the attention of criminals.For security, it is important to store your private keys and seed phrases as securely as possible, never transfer them to anyone or store them on a computer that can be attacked by viruses.It is also important not to tell anyone you have bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. There are cases when someone talked about their bitcoins, and then was attacked by criminals who forced the victims to give them private keys from addresses with cryptocurrencies.Since the number of addresses in the blockchain is quite large, it is undesirable to use the same address repeatedly if it has already been associated with you in some way. You can always get a new address for more security.",

If you use an address that isn't linked to your identity, people can of course see your transactions with the address on the blockchain, but they can't know the real person who uses the address. But an address that is connected to you can reveal your true identity, for example if you use a centralized exchange like binance that holds your personal data, if there is a data leak, people can trace and link true identities with your address because they now have your personal data; this is the reason why KYC is somewhat dangerous/risky.",
