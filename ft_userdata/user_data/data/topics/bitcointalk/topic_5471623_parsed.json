Every 2 weeks IIRC, they're giving away games consistently. That's where I got my GTA V for free and many zombie games like Dying Light, Tomb Raider and many good quality games.",

Used to install a bunch of mods just for different storylines. A timeless masterpiece!No doubt!Well, the time's up I guess boys but if you ever want to purchase it since it's been given for free. There could be a blast of many players gonna come to the server and enjoy playing with it. Just this time, I don't know if the mods are still applicable if it's on Steam. But anyway, those that have missed it for free. Don't worry, it's not even pricey at all.",
