Make sure to calculate your theoretical profit too before buying any gpu so you won't be faced with unexpected power consumption with little to no profit.",

      "body": "If you provide us more information, we can help you in a better way, because there's several things happening right now:ETH the main altcoin to mine is changing to POS, and another coins can't absorb the hashrate of ETH without harming profits, there's only a few days left to mine ETH, so it's wise to wait just a couple more days, 2 weeks at least.Nvidia can reduce prices even further and pre owned markets can be flooded again.But if you want to buy no matter what, 3060ti, 3070 and even 3080 are good choices of cards that mine most algos, not only Ethash, and a possible better value to resell.You need to compare prices too.Please, post here about the prices of GPUs in your country, and if you're planning to mine with a single card, a rig etc...",

I searched for some info based on your input and found \"GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3060 Eagle OC 12G (REV2.0) Graphics Card with 2X WINDFORCE Fans, 12 GB 192-bit GDDR6, GV-N3060EAGLE OC-12GD REV2.0 Video Card, pci_e_x16\" at price of US$511 including all taxes and shipping charges.Model No.: GV-N3060EAGLE OC-12GD REV2.0Memory clock speed: 15000 MHzI understand that mining alt coins will be profitable after a couple of years when the price of alt coins will increase. I will start with just 1 graphics card now. The price of 3070, 3080, 3060ti are little bit expensive and offers RAM 8Gb - 10GB. And above card gives 12GB RAM at lesser price.So, please give your opinion on this card.ThanksDavid",

You will not be able to mine a lot of coins from 1 video card, but in addition to consuming 120 watts for mining, you will receive an additional consumption of 50-80 watts for the operation of the PC system unit",
