  "content": "Last Night I was using My mobile Phone and i stumble upon a website which is kind of exchange where we can buy or sell cryptocurrencies even we can make transaction using this website.I Created my account on this website and there i saw an option of referral and promotion. I click on it and tried to find a promotion code for this which was 6d479tvu. After applying this promotion code i received 0.2 BTC into this website wallet as available balance as you guys can see in above picture.I tried to withdraw this amount 0.2 BTC into my Binance wallet. Then they said verify your account. e.g KYC i started to verify my account. 1. First Step was simple like enter your name, Your Date of Birth etc. 2. In second step they said me to deposit amount in btc into website wallet which i found scam in my mind so i didn't deposit any amount into website wallet. Why this question arise as scam in my mind? 1st... 0.2 btc for free like no exchange offer you that much amount for free..hehe 2nd... they want me to deposit first into their wallet.Maybe after this deposit i would lose my money.My suggestion to you guys avoide these kinds of scam and stay safe.",

It should be known to all that there’s no free money online and if you’re greedy enough to find one you’ll only end up getting scammed. And this site you’re referring to has recently been used to spam the forum by some newbies account so if you were vigilant enough you should have known to stay away from it in the first place.",

It is warned many times as one of best ways to lose your bitcoins.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsOn top of that, you received a very good offer that is too good to be true. 0.2 BTC is a very big money and it is impossible you can easily get it as a gift and think more, they provide it to many people not only you.Lastly, you made a bad mistake, I see your email address. You blurred something on the screenshot but did not blur what you need to do most.Blur it and attach a new image, please.",

      "body": "Don’t you think they might have tricked you to get what they want that is your details when you filled that KYC. Although the offer of 0.2BTC might be way off it but they were right to actually ask you to deposit before you can withdraw the offer. This one looks definitely like scam but i would say you wanted to rip them off too because why would you take their reward to enrich another exchange (in this case binance). I know once the withdrawal was successful you wouldn’t even come back to the exchange again. Every exchange that runs this referrals always has its set of rules like you depositing first before you can withdraw as this will give them more liquidity so it is normal when they ask. This doesn’t mean you should believe any of this either.",

      "body": "The best guide would be to ignore it in the first place, it's shady because you can easily withdraw the bitcoin with that amount since the withdrawal fee for bitcoin is like 0.0002 higher or lower, it proves that it is a scam, you should not also share the referrals once you have found out.This has been happening since 2017, yet some people still falls for this kind of scheme, that is why they never go away.",

Personally only the thought of receiving 0.02 BTC should have sounded alarm bells in my head and what said @Zaguru is correct; what if you had put yourself in danger by filling the KYC. I guess your curiosity was piqued when you saw the amount being offered and you decided to try it but imagine you fell for the deposit some BTC part and you got scammed, I guess you would have come here to report that the site is a scam site, trying to prevent others from making the same mistake, right. Perhaps you may be too ashamed to use yourself as the victim and probably create an imaginary friend who got scammed? We should be careful of how we let our curiosity and greed get the better of us so we don't become victims of scammers who just want to lure naive users.",

For sure most of the time they will promote that you will only withdraw those funds once you make a deposit for the fees, its worth it to exchange your information just to hope to earn a large amount instantly in crypto way too risky like you are just showing your self can be use for identity theft sooner or later there's a problem may arise.

Unfortunately if you did that you should have done a random email and random password because scam platforms like this never ask for any verification.It is possible that now your email is in the hands of scammers and then misused or continue to spam your email, this is a concern because they will always try to access your data from your own toledoran.Regarding platform sites that offer promotional codes of up to 0.2 BTC it is bullshit, there are no other platforms with big prizes, this will not be true.",

      "body": "What happened there is just very simple. It's a broker site owned by just one person or group of scammers. You created your account, and they got notification for your account creation. They generated a code and sent it over to your dashboard, where they could have just manually topped up your account, but they didn't let it look like a scam to you. Now they offer you a promo code and let it appear as if you are a lucky person to receive that bonus, and they don't do it for everyone. That amount is just what they wanted you to see, and your KYC is not that important to them; all they need to do is use that deposit and convince you that you have it all to yourself. The KYC is just to convince you a little further that they are real, and they want to make sure you are real too. Applying for the KYC in the first place alone means you are already falling for their scam scheme. Assuming you proceed with the deposit, you could have just been paying for things that you don't know until you realise it's a scam, and then they move on to another person. We already know that no one is giving out any free money on the internet right now, and trying to chase such will only lead one to get scammed out of the little they have. When you come across such a website, the best thing to do is to ignore it, click on any kind of link, and proceed with registration. You are risking your own security, as you don't know what kind of link it is and what came with the email verification link they might also send to you, which could be used to bridge any of your personal info in your device, be it wallet or other personal data, and then again, you just handed your email over to scammers, so be ready to be receiving series of scam emails from unauthorised senders from now on.",

      "body": "There are thousands of such scam sites out there. I saw some day's ago a scam exchange site they brought bounty campaign for bounty hunters. They offered the bounty hunters such offers that the bounty hunters acted upon. They paid 5 to 100 USD per week to each participant on their website. It was mentioned there that minimum 100 USD can be withdrawn. When the bounty hunters had 100 USD in their wallets, they had to deposit a minimum of 1 USD in their exchange wallet when they went to withdraw. Many people made deposits as per their terms but later they got scammed. They are not allowed to withdraw. I've provided proof here along with the bounty link for those watching to see that Allready has eaten three negative tags. But you all be careful no one will ever do this kind of scam remember one thing no one can ever earn money without hard work those who offer money without hard work you will they are the godfather of scam.👉 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5462392.msg62799142#msg62799142",
