  "content": "The Bitcoin network transaction fees are currently at the highest in nearly three years since July 2021. This indicates that there's a strong demand for the Bitcoin blockchain network.Last weeks have been a bit crazy, with insane fees one day and very low fees another day. I use Exodus and Blockchain I also got a wallet at Noones (old Paxful)If i want to send $100 from Exodus its $30 in fees. almost the same at Blockchain a bit lower i think around $20.But if i want to send from Noones it only cost $0.50. Why is this?I know Noones just open their business and what to attract customers. But if they are available to have that low fees why is not Exodus or Blockchain?With fees like this its not worth to use bitcoin as payment method at all.Do you guys/girls think this will stabilize soon or will we see more like this, with normal fee´s one day and extremely high the next day?EDITSeems to go back to some kind of normal, slow but on the right way.Unconfirmed  303,547 TXsLow Priority46 sat/vB$1.77High Priority51 sat/vB$1.97But it goes up and down very fast, but the unconfirmed tx´s go down more and more for time pass by.I would say it would be more or less back to normal in 48 hours or less.",

It's not a must for you to proceed your transaction with those default set fee on those wallets, I have not used exodus before but. I think you should try some wallets like Electrum they will allow you to customize your transaction fee before you can proceed your transaction. This morning when I want to send out funds from my wallet to another wallet I notice the fee was showing me about $4 which I saw as something extremely high, since I was not in a hurry to process my transaction I use the manual process and reduced it to 0.8$ which went successful for me.",

Paxful suspended withdrawals and blocked some users from accessing their funds when they shut down. The same could happen with Noones or any other CEX. So you shouldn't be using them as a personal wallet.",

I understand that it's frustrating, but it may happen if the network is congested. If you're not in a hurry, I'd suggest you try again later and lower the priority by decreasing the satoshi per byte. You'll wait a few more hours, but you'll pay a significantly lower fee, and in the worst-case scenario, you can speed up the process by bumping up the fees. I always used a lower priority and paid 1/4th of what I'd have to pay initially.",

This indicates that there's a strong demand for the Bitcoin blockchain network.That's definitely a sign of increase in transactions as the more demand goes towards transactions the higher will be the fees. The main cause of such increase is due to increased demand of transactions and sometimes it can also be caused by decreased number of miners. In today's case it's due to high demand for transactions and in such cases the only way to get faster transaction is by adding a higher fee. If you check the price of Bitcoin you will see that it's increasing everyday even after market corrections and that also contribute to higher fees.QuoteLast weeks have been a bit crazy, with insane fees one day and very low fees another day.

Why is this?If the fee at Noones is low then that doesn't mean they are doing that purposefully to attract more customers. That can be due to many factors and one of those factor is the structure of the fees they have set. I believe that the transactions made via Noones might be slower sometimes. If you can set custom fee on Exodus or Blockchain info then that might be helpful as their automated selected fees are very high for such amount.",

I don't think mempool congestion resulting in high transaction fees and slow confirmation time can be caused by a reduction in the networks hashrate, there are so many miners and even if the network loses miners from time to time, it cannot be so significant. BTC's mining difficulty is also adjusted after every 2,016 blocks, so if there is a reduction in the hashrate within that time the network would reduce the mining difficulty to ensure that blocks are mined at least 10 minutes on average. A massive decrease in the network's hashrate is going to affect the security, because then it becomes possible for a 51% attack to happen.",

This is a regular and normal occurrence in bitcoins. There are times when the mempool is congested due to many transactions that need confirmation. The more the number the transactions to confirm, the more higher the network and transaction fee will be. This is normal and something expected when the mempool is crowded as mentioned already. It raises concerns, but if you are not in a hurry you can wait patiently till the number of transactions reduce, as it will surely happen. This high transaction and network fees can be a challenge to usage of bitcoin in business as a means of payment.",

Not sure whether they use the same fee calculation method or not, but as far as I can tell from my not-so-accurate observation is that they take the median fee of the next block and add another 1-10 sats on top of it to make sure it doesn't get buried by other transaction. One of the reasons is probably because they want to prevent the average joe from complaining that their tx fee is set too low hence why they always overpaid it.
