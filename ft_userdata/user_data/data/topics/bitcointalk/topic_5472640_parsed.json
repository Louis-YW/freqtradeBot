  "content": "Greetings, fellow members, and other high-ranking members in this forum. Today I decided to pass a motion after adequate research for some months in which I discovered that bitcoin talk is not a forum that focuses on only educating each other about bitcoin and other cryptocurrency but also a community that we discussed, which I am sure most of us in this forum spent more time here than in the physical society, so the motion I came with is that why can’t they create a section or board where health and other health-related issues can be discussed?Because of the look of things, there are many challenges of health facing the world at large, so if a board is created where health issues can be discussed, I am sure those that are always in the forum can know some solutions to their health issues without even seeing a physician because not all health issues require a physical or doctor; some issues need counselling, so I will be glad if there is a board or section where health issues can be discussed. For instance, in gambling, politics and society, economics, and many others, discussions have been made, and with a health board, a better understanding of our health issues can be identified immediately. If the need to see a doctor is needed, you can go in time, so all suggestions are welcome.",

      "body": "It wouldn’t be looking as you want but considering the fact that this forum is for bitcoin and cryptocurrency this health talk’s definitely belongs to the off topic board which we already have. I know your next question is probably why the politics and society board, I would say I don’t know either but even the topics on those boards are looking like topics that belongs to Off topic discussion. If someone should have a health problem I don’t think Bitcointalk will be the place he will actually come to for solutions like the way we see with cryptocurrency discussions here. As such having a separate board for a discussion that doesn’t happens everyday would simply be looking useless. So my best fit is, it belongs to the Off topic board",

So anything that can influence economics and cryptocurrencies like Politics and Society, gambling deserves a board. I have seen so many crypto related casino grow after having some of their promotions in the forum.If we are to go by your suggestion then we shall have people ask for boards about car talk, Food talk, Housing and Interior design talk etc.You want to discuss health? There are some health related forums out there like (https://patient.info/forums) that you can sign up to. There you will find many qualified doctors and people with different conditions seeking for help.",

Child boards are usually created when there are so many threads of the certain topic that they simply dominate the board and since that's obviously not the case, there is no need for one. As simple as that. [/quote]I raise a motion for this topic to be locked by OP.",

There are not even many threads concerning health issues in this community; if not, there might have been a need to add a new board if theymos wants to, but if you want to discuss healthy topics, you can do so on the off-topic board or on your local board. You can start a thread with the title \"Thread for all health-related matters\" (just my suggestion, though).",

They might not want to talk with you or want to suggest some kind of medical issue. Well, even if they want and try to, all they can say, is go for a walk, try not to eat fast food, do physical exercises, maybe join the gym. These are some basic tips that a person can suggest, but medical issues or talks are so sensitive that many people here do even use GPT and want to fill out for the signature campaigns. In short, they might share wrong information which might look good at the moment but once followed by a patient can cause harm.You should seek for other forums that are solely for the sake of medical issues and discussions.

If you look at the economics, you will see that most of the discussions that have been discussed there are all about how cryptocurrency has an impact on our economy, policy, and society. So, it's not that I’m trying to terminate your suggestion, but as others have said earlier, you can discuss this type of thing in the off-topic. Creating a board for health issues discussion will not be of any use. If you want to teach people how they will be able to take care of their health issues, you can create a thread in the off-topic.Quote from: hd49728 on November 03, 2023, 01:14:33 AMDiscussions about health issues are similar to Politics, can cause spam in the forum.

Even though we know his idea is not a bad idea, it’s not as he thinks boards have already filled the forum and every discussion has a specific board, so creating more boards will be as if you are congesting the forum, and we are here for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",

All these sections and board you mentioned are in one or the other linked with bitcoin. For example, talking about politics and Bitcoin, governments are starting to take an interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and are working to develop regulations and policies around them. On the side of gambling, Bitcoin is often used to fund online gambling since it's a quick and easy way to make payments. It's also a popular option for people who want to gamble anonymously. On the part of economics, Bitcoin is a positive force for the economy since it allows for faster and cheaper transactions and it's a way to store value without relying on traditional financial institutions.Almost all sections of the forum is related to bitcoin either directly or indirectly including LBs. The off topic is the perfect place to discuss what you are suggesting. By the way, we have other forums that we can discuss heath or related issues, we can not expect Forum to cover everything. It has covered almost thou, take your time to check out some other forums too.",
