  "content": "Hello. I'm not really accusing daniel for scamming but rather just an unnecessary locking of my funds every time I deposit for 3 months. This post is an attempt to get his attention since he never responds on email.I've been playing on bustabit since 2020, around 2 years and a couple months to be specific. Bustabit was the first time I ever gambled in my life, and as a result, since I had never even really watched gambling, I didn't expect to lose practically every time so I got really upset every time it happened. Daniel's response to this anger he saw me display in chat was to indefinitely ban me for the reason: \"Problem gambler\". This is simply false. I try to voice this to him every time but he just blanks my messages. I understand why he believes this, due to the fact that the emotional attatchment I displayed to the money I was playing with, but the honest truth is I was just new and wasn't farmiliar with the feeling of losing. Ever since this ban, which happened about one and a half years ago, I have continued playing peacefully (No display of anger or upset in chat) on accounts made with VPN's to bypass the ban. I've now been gambling pretty regularly for 2 years, and as a result, lost the emotional attatchment to money that I had during the early stages of gambling. I accept that when I lose I lose, I keep emotions to myself when winning as well. However, every time I get caught, my ability to bet AND withdraw gets locked. Betting is permanent and I am only able to withdraw after 3 months every single time I get caught. This is frustrating because every time, I am peacefully playing minding my own business, just enjoying his site. Every time I ask why, I get the response \"You are indefinitely banned for being a problem gambler\". I ask him \"What do I need to do to prove that you're wrong? I will show ID's, bank statements, anything to prove that I'm playing with affordable amounts\". And he never responds. Daniel, I am asking you now. Tell me what you need to see. The reason for my ban is objectively false and I will prove it to you. Respond to this and I'll reply with photo evidence of anything you request. Just give me a second chance. I haven't caused any problems at all since before the initial banning from around 16 months ago. You have no reason to be strict. The ban reason is false and I can absolutely prove it to you. On a second note, assuming you're just going be the strict fucker you always are and deny my offer to prove your ban reason is false, and keep me banned, at least just let me withdraw. There are 2 accounts, TDWW and TDWW2 that you locked. Ideally however, I'd like you to accept my invitation to see proof that I can afford what I'm playing withI beg you just dont fucking respond with the usual copy pasted \"You are banned indefinitely, any funds you deposit will be locked for 3 months\". Just let me show you evidence, then once you see it, give me a second chance to play without having to be undercover. I trust you will do the right thing and let me prove my innocence to you. I was really stupid back then with the rage I had whenever I lost all, but you need to understand I was new to gambling and wasn't yet used to the feeling of losing money.",

Not trying to let everyone know my address/name/age/As per the first paragraph, this is more a comment on his false ban than a scam accusation where I request for him to show the heart to let me prove my innocence. However if you want proof that my funds are locked from being able to be withdrawn, I can provide that here:https://gyazo.com/aa5596d93255990f7721e7cc6614644dThe funds are locked. I do find this annoying but I'd much rather request to just be unbanned entirely by proving I'm not a 'problem gambler' than just ask to withdraw the funds only.",
