You will not gonna cost more than a 100$ if you are only inquiring on the actual minting cost considering you already have your smart contract code.But launching token in general including development and marketing will cost a lot more assuming you will create a real project and not a shitcoin that will rug after the funding. I have no experience in regards with this matter. My opinion is based on the previous testimony of users that create their own project. Are you planning to start your own project?",

I think that if you have coding and PR skills then you can launch your own coin with little to no money. What I see often here is that they get fundings from investors to fully launch their project. Ofcourse I can't say these projects are legitimate. Those coins that actually have some value, those probably are the ones that the devs had pit money into from the very start.",

Although if you don't want a headache just copy paste the code from github and edited a little bit, but it makes your project less attractive. The truth is Code audit is expensive   because is part of security",
