  "content": "Hello everyone, I mined some satoshis more than 10 years ago, and just now I found the HD with the corresponding cgminer folder. I never messed with bitcoins again, and I don't even remember what the process was like. Is there still a possibility to recover these satoshis?If so, some instruction would be most welcome.Thanks in advance.P.S. The software version at that time was 3.7.2 for Windows.",

I assume this is only possible when you have that particular PC on which the mining happened and *.dat file is stored? If yes, then it means that particular PC and dat file has got coded connection which may not work on the other PC if downloaded or transferred. If no, then why is that so and through current advances why is it still that much hard to do it. OR is it possible to get the bitcoins back even if you have *.dat file from some other device but now want to get back the bitcoins from it. How this file works and what is the information that is stored in it which makes it so helpful while recovering the bitcoins?",

How this file works and what is the information that is stored in it which makes it so helpful while recovering the bitcoins? The PC or miner software isn't connected to the wallet, if you have the wallet files you can use it on any operating system that it supports, of course, most often that file will be encrypted and you will need a password to decrypt it so you can access the coins, but finding that wallet file is the first step to any \"hope\", if you have it, you have a good chance of remembering or even brute-forcing your way in, if you don't have it, your chances of meeting your coins again are 0.",

Because if you are not going to have the access to those file or data then it is already proven its useless to run behind that. It is really dangerous to have the data on anything that is electronic. It can get fried, corrupted, or lost anytime without prior notice. Imagine working on computer peacefully and suddenly there is high electricity voltage frying the HDD and losing that .dat* file with it. There goes the bitcoin. I think one should mine the bitcoins ----> transfer to paper wallet --> Lock it away.  The best course of action so far.",
