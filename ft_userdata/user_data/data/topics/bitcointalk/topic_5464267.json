  "content": "Maybe this is just my own clap of hand to seek a small attention from every Bitcoin Investor, precisely for new Bitcoin Investor because I know that most the experienced investors already knows better than I do, I guess so. Not to say more or less, I just know that this concerns us all. I was thinking that before the end of this year Bitcoin will spike and get to $60k or not lower than $40k or far above it and it has just been my prediction, I also did not think that Bitcoin will even drop bellow the $28k level again this year, but I believe I got disappointed on my assumption and it was really a good thing that my assumption failed, because if it had not, I will not be able to buy bitcoin around $26k and also bought in $25k. I know one day I will look at my portfolio and I will be happy for Investing in Bitcoin. Like I said that this is just a clap of hands to call our attention because I know it concerns us that we need to buy the dip, even if we are waiting for the bottom, but you can still buy the dip and keep it in your portfolio, because Bitcoin price just don't fall in the hands of any man or authority to control. you can be waiting for the bottom and the price of Bitcoin will just begine to go bullish again. My reason for saying  buy the DIP while waiting for the bottom.A; you may be waiting for the bottom and the market will recover so quickly than you less expect.B: Because you will still make profit if you buy the dipC: because there were even investor who bought at a higher price and you have a better opportunity to buy the dip.D: If you are holding for a long term, you don't need to be scared of buying the dip. thank you for reading my topic.",

Well, I tried at Point D only. this is the safest and most comfortable in my opinion. My reason is because if someone buys current for long term hodling this is not a problem which means for him. Precisely those who want to take a new entry should think further and if there are investors who feel uncomfortable with the fluctuations in the crypto market, then they might consider taking a break first while staying informed of course.",

      "body": "There is no right or wrong time when buying Bitcoin. When you enter the market, that's when your time starts, so it doesn't matter if you are buying the dip or the top. Give it the right time, and you will be making the profits for which you have invested. It's all about holding for a long time. The more you hold, the more profit you can gain from Bitcoin investment. Maybe you will make less profit, but you will be making a profit from that investment if you have the will to hold for the long term. Buying at a low price will always give you the advantage of making good profits. This market is an opportunity for us to fill our bags with more Bitcoin which you can buy at a low price. Pinpointing the bottom is very hard, and you don't know when the price will be bullish again. This is why it is always advised to do DCA.",

I quite agree with these points, and I know that the current price of Bitcoin is really on the dip, although some predictions are still suggesting that the price can go down a bit. It's wise to apply the dollar cost average strategy and keep accumulating now so that even if the price falls more, you will have some fiat to invest. I believe you understand what I mean. For example, if you have $10k that you wish to invest in Bitcoin and you feel that the price can fall more, you can just decide to invest $3k first, or 50% of your asset at first. Then you can keep the balance and keep DCAing with it, so that at the point of another dip in price, you will still have some fiat to invest. Your speculation about Bitcoin is very high, and I don't think Bitcoin can reach $60k this year; even $50k is kind of unlikely to happen, but we can't really be very accurate in our speculation, so let's hope for the best.",

But as you said I am very much optimistic that bitcoin prices might not go beyond 40000 dollars this year.Considering what Op is saying about buying the dip and not waiting for the bottom. I so much know that nobody knows the bottom. But at least we know the dip. It is better you buy the dip using the dollar cost averaging method and be consistent about it and you will not regret on the long run. Waiiting for the bottom is something newbies cannot do and even experts find it difficult to predict the exact bottom.",

A; you may be waiting for the bottom and the market will recover so quickly than you less expect.This is how you tell it all. It is the reason that backs the infamous DCA strategy towards bitcoin investment. You get to invest the much you have when you have not minding the price at the time and be rest assured that bitcoin would pump some day.The price of bitcoin is highly volatile and unpredictable. It’s the one thing that helps the keeps the coin going and the project from those who would just come hunting for profit from taking what they will and leave without any proper plan on hodling through the various market conditions.Your best bet or proper plan would be, to buy and hodl for an indefinite time and you need a lot of patience to do that.

If you are able to buy the coins under 25k usd, then consider yourself lucky and buy the coin irrespective of its price. You should start accumulating the coins when you see a dip. If you expect that bitcoins will go more down and then only you will buy then definitely you will miss the best price where Bitcoins can be brought.

My prediction for Bitcoin was between $35k to $40kI don't believe Bitcoin can get to $40,000 this year anymore, but a part of me still believes it can get to $35,000. It's not too late. If it can go down from $30k to $25k right now, then I believe it can also go up from 25k to 35k. We've seen Bitcoin go up 7% within hours recently.

Buying as you go is always the best, just as you have explained. One might be waiting for the price to dump more to the bottom, but in the process of waiting, the reverse will be the case. That's why DCA is usually the best way to accumulate, as it usually creates room for this. There's no need to wait until the price has dropped to the button, but you can just start accumulating depending on the amount you have to spend.If one is lucky enough to meet a dip while planning to buy some bitcoin, that could be considered an added advantage, as you will have the opportunity to buy more at a cheaper price.",
