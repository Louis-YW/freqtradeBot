  "content": "I found that these Japanese concepts can also be applied by in Bitcoin space. It can be of help to both newbies and older bitcoiners but I will mention mostly newbies.  1. Ikigai (生き甲斐): Ikigai is a Japanese concept referring to something that gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. You must identify your motivation for purchasing or investing in bitcoin as a beginner. A strong sense of conviction is required. If not, FUD, bull and bear markets, government crackdowns, and all the rest will carry you away. I want to think that individuals who are labeled weak hands are those who haven't discovered their Ikigai in the bitcoin community.2. Shikata ga nai (仕方がない): The Japanese phrase shikata ga nai, or \"it can't be helped,\" indicates cultural norms over which one has little control. You must accept that you have limited control over certain things in the bitcoin world and let go. For instance, it is impossible to influence bitcoin's price. When the bear market begins and ends is out of your hands. It will allow you to concentrate on what you can control once you realize that some of the occurrences in the bitcoin environment are beyond your control. For instance, moving your coins out of a CEN exchange  to a cold storage is in your control.3. Wabi-Sabi (侘寂): In traditional Japanese aesthetics, wabi-sabi (侘寂) is a world view centered on the acceptance of transience and imperfection. The relentless pursuit of perfection often leads to stress, anxiety, depression and hasty judgement. Newcomers to bitcoin must understand that there will never be a perfect market where everything runs smoothly. Bitcoin is volatile, mining bitcoin could use up a lot of energy, might not yet have widespread support, and might not be as anonymous. Consequently, you will feel peaceful and at peace of mind if you accept the flaws in bitcoin. 4. Gaman (我慢): Itis a Japanese term of Zen Buddhist origin which means \"enduring the seemingly unbearable with patience and dignity\". The term is generally translated as \"perseverance\", \"patience\", or \"tolerance\". When you HODL as a beginner, especially during the bear market and all the bad news and events, you are building your Gaman. 5. Oubaitori (桜梅桃李): It is a Japanese concept which means 'The art of never comparing yourself to others'. In the bitcoin space, never compare your journey to other. One guy owns one bitcoin, another has ten, and a third has 0.022 satoshis. It's perfectly fine. Do not compare your bitcoin progress to that of others; instead, concentrate on yourself and your own growth.6. Kaizen (改善): Kaizen is a Japanese term meaning change for the better or continuous improvement. For those just starting out with bitcoin, improvement must be continuous. Long-term hodling cannot be their only option. For further information about the bitcoin industry, they must do their own research, be curious, ask questions. You cannot have faith in the bitcoin principles unless you have improved yourself and your knowledge of bitcoin. 7. Shuhari (Kanji: 守破離):  is a Japanese martial art concept which describes the stages of learning to mastery.The idea is that a person passes through three stages of gaining knowledge: It can also be applied to learning about bitcoinShu (守): In this beginning stage newbies follow the teachings of one master precisely- maybe on YouTube. These master may include Andreas Antonopoulos, Jimmy Song, Saifedean Ammous. They concentrate on how to do the task, without worrying too much about the underlying theory. If there are multiple variations on how to do the task, they concentrate on just the one way their master teaches them.Ha (破): At this point newbie begin to branch out. With the basic practices working they now start to learn the underlying principles and theory behind the technique. They also start learning from other masters and integrates that learning into his practice. Ri (離) : Now the students aren't learning from other people, but from their own practice. They create their own approaches and adapts what they've learned to their own particular circumstances.That's all for now. Thank you for reading.What other ideas do you believe apply to those just entering the bitcoin world?",

      "body": "The concepts are quite interesting and I thank you for sharing.And these concepts remind me of my experience in Emotion Control in trading and investing in bitcoin.because I also have principles that are almost the same as those 7 concepts. it's just the terms that differ. Like my goal in investing in bitcoin is because I have a strong reason and a goal to achieve. and it fosters strong motivation and desire to continue investing in bitcoin.For beginners it will be more suitable for them to find the right reasons for them to get into bitcoin investment. and in an effort to grow their confidence in bitcoin investment.
