You posted people should invest in crypto and not commodity in the topic title but you posted that cryptocurrencies are not hedges against inflation in your post. Both contradict each other.What I know is that cryptocurrencies are scam. Bitcoin is not scam and it is what crypto should be but they are not. Bitcoin is the hedge against inflation among the cryptocurrencies while others are not like that but gambling.",

I was expecting you to give us the reason for investing in Bitcoin and why you think it is a better investment choice than commodities but the body of your post completely negates this and is even explaining why you think investing in commodities is better. Did you do this deliberately or it is an innocent mistake? Are you against Bitcoin? If yes, what do you plan to achieve in a forum where Bitcoin is being discussed when you already chose commodities over Bitcoin? Please explain so we know if we should place you as Bitcoin critics or not.",

I suggest you study a little more about bitcoin and the whole monetary system, money printing, economic cycles, how it is minted, how mining works and all these things... it is a process that takes some time to digest, so after all this you will see that the reality is totally opposite of everything you wrote.",

Both contradict each other.All said where being contradicted. What I understood about some newbies posts recently is that they forces themselves in using the professional cryptograph terms which they're not even conversant with.I keep saying it that newbies should be better of good position by asking questions instead of advices and engaging on speculations of what they're not as well conversant with.However, crypto is the hedge to commodity and global inflations because it potential volatility values is as good as source of storing values potentially to increments in a long time.",
