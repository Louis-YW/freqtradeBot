That being said, I am really curious about how you guys send money to a crypto casino.I personally use Nebeus Money Accounts, which essentially are bank accounts with IBAN and Sort Codes for crypto hodlers. The thing is that, thanks to this feature, I move money from my crypto account to my Nebeus IBAN in the same app and instantly transfer money from one account to the other.I even receive my salary there. Then I buy crypto and send it to my regular casino’s wallet. I do the same but vice-versa when I want to withdraw my crypto gains and convert them into fiat. I found them super useful to manage my crypto/fiat operations!If someone opens a Money Account, please share your thoughts here!",

      "body": "Recommended way: have your coins on a noncustodial wallet and send it to the gambling site that you are using. If you want to convert from crypto to fiat, do that separately on decentralized exchange, instant exchange or centralized exchange. I have no problem with crypto casinos because I send crypto directly to my account and withdrawal crypto easily, I have other ways to convert crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto. But if it is about crypto gambling site, I do not have anything to do with fiat, it is crypto to crypto. If Nebeus is legit, but which I do not know, it can be helpful for those that use fiat-only casinos if the banks in their country do not support wire transfer or bank transfer. But we in crypto do not have any problem as we deal with only cryptocurrencies.",

You are simply confusing crypto exchanges and ownership of it, if you do not have private keys, then this crypto does not belong to you, but Nebeus owns it, for example.",

I mostly find casinos that accept crypto that the wallet I used have too which I can transfer my funds to a casino. What I mostly use is xrp since it doesn't cost that much on transaction fee compared to other crypto that the wallet I used cost in each transaction. The problem with the wallet I used is that I cannot change the transaction fee or custom fee.",

Having a wallet that contain cryptocurrency can be more easier for use to send to any casinos of your choice and prevent the risk of using a third party site that could compromised your funds anytime with higher risks. This is a preferable alternative for your which is not bad and I know any persons that would be interested in trying it out could easily switch Nebeus.",
