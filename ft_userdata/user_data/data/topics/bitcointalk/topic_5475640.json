Me and my friend had ETNY token which needs to be swapped and we both failed to do verification of  proof of address. As Escrow service cannot be done in such condition, so we ask one of the active member of the @bptrades who was Kiran at the time. He told us that he would help us out of humanity to swap from ETNY to ECLD. His message saying help and humanity: https://imgur.com/a/ZXL5gn3We first didn't believe him so we asked to do transaction in batches, first 2010 ETNY and second 3000.72 ETNY, a total of 5010.72 ETNY.We risked the first 2010 ETNY because we were skeptical and sent 2010 ETNY to account he mentioned.His message of sending address: https://imgur.com/a/Nzw1uO3Transaction hash of us sending him 2010 ETNY in bloxbergnetwork: https://blockexplorer.bloxberg.org/tx/0x240abde0dc76858f2ea43b0fafa6cbf777d6287e146ee8560f49037ed7c15867But surprisingly he really swapped and sent the 2010 ECLD back to our wallet address.Transaction hash of sending back: https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x049bdddc458ee3c2fb80e8a62559d47cda2132676e5e02a78e831d1aa19ee2a7Now as we saw he really helped and were satisfied to see there are still people who help other out of humanity and sent him 3000.72 ETNY, he said he had to go for Namaz reading.Transaction hash of us sending him 3000.72 ETNY in bloxbergnetwork: https://blockexplorer.bloxberg.org/tx/0xa4f32052039db89c66d99852d97f3d9342fa7dd54a5a51518349b49abf6c6123His message of saying: https://imgur.com/a/QMWZov6Yeah we respected his culture and beliefs and waited for him to come online.

Proof: https://imgur.com/a/N1nBY3QHe was a pretty smart scammer and played so well on your psychology, knowing you will first send a lower amount before sending the bigger portion after establishing the trust. Scammers use this format a lot and it usually work for them. Well, you were actually helpless in this situation because the team at Ethernity Cloud did not do well requesting for KYC long after their token sale and bounty conclusion and payment made.  Besides, they are building cloud base computing with privacy as a key word,  what then is the need for KYC? Quote from: safal on November 27, 2023, 07:41:59 AMYes of course it was our fault to trust stranger blindly, but we should expose the despicable and scammer people. That's all.If you're reading this, Hi Adil or, should I say Kiran. Like I said before, it is never your fault but that if Ethernity team that changed the goal post at the dying minute. I read somewhere that their adopted KYC system banned some countries who they allowed to buy their token during their ICO years ago.",

As a reputed member I never trade without an escrow. I don't know why you believe any member without researching about his reputation. Albon is the man who deal as a third party to secure payment and the good thing is that he doing all those without charging any penny. You should have to wait until he back online. If you read pinned post(rules of trading) ,I hope it wouldn't happen.You did a well job by making this thread. You did most of research already and some experience member will expose him. He will not able to join bounty after tagged. Next time kindly deal through escrow service regardless of number of tokens.",

Like they say experience is a teacher, I believe you must have learnt your lessons  the hard way which is not worth it but however,  this was uncalled for you going through such experience.This is why we are advised to always seek a reputable escrow  for transactions or deal we are not sure of the people involved. Escrow services would help reduce some stress of potential scam from both sides and gives one assurance but however the deed has been done and it is good you dig further to unravel the faces behind such heinous act. Since they have been exposed, I believe members would take caution dealing with them and having nothing to do with them in the nearest future.Absolutely, I got my lesson and its now imprinted in me forever. Yeah, other people soon started escrowed swap, I guess god wanted me to have a lesson. I hope everyone will be safe from these scammers.For sure those who have come in contact with this thread should be able to take note of those scammers and do away with them. Their details have been exposed coupled with their identity as well. So we now know who they are and can not fall for them if they do decide to come facially with their deceit. If it is possible to go further in dragging them out together with their social media handles that would serve them better for scamming people.",
