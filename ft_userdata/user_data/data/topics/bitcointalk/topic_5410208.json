      "body": "I don't see that this news is particularly important considering that there are a lot of tourist locations where it is possible to pay with Bitcoin, and the Maldives has always been for those with deeper pockets in terms of prices. What doesn't fit into the story is Thailand, which banned cryptocurrencies as a means of payment a few months ago, and the article claims that it is possible to do so?The only thing that comes to my mind is that there is some kind of exception for crypto payments coming from abroad to the account of certain companies. Otherwise, I don't see how anyone would ignore the very strict laws in that country, although until recently I thought that the ban on payments with cryptocurrencies in Turkey was a serious matter, until a forum member explained to me that the law exists only on paper.",

      "body": "10 years ago any of the remote Maldives islands still had laughable, expensive dialup. Be surprised if things have changed since these private owned resorts actually don't have a demand for even basic internet. Holidaying people.This is my way of explaining what Lucius asked... Because those islands are private, Maldivian law is absentia there. E.g. they sell pork and alcohol on those islands but it is criminalised on the non private islands.That was what I learnt there anyway. Definitely sense a use case for holiday goers who probably might be watched... Missing super yachts anyone?",

      "body": "I know Soneva as a resort company and years ago I heard the news from them in the Maldives but I don't think if they are really famous, accepting bitcoin can be a good point for them and this will definitely help them with getting more and more customers because accepting another payment method itself can be a good point and if we are talking about bitcoin I'm sure this happened because of the demand from the client's side so they can use bitcoin instead of other payment methods which can be a good experience for them and good advertising for this company.",

Most likely is not as a result of demand from client because we have seen places where clients make demands to pay in bitcoins, and even though there are many demands, the company/establishment decides to stick with traditional fiat. IMO, this is a strategy to show that they are growing with technology and because this is attractive, their resort can become the number one choice in that location for tourist who are visiting to have a good time without minding cost.",

It is something to say that we are moving forward to reach the main reason for this creation, it won't make instantly but it takes slowly and it is soon to happen where many individuals will make use of this for their major online transactions. What we just need is to keep spreading Bitcoin, not in a form of investment but as an alternative form of payment, the community needs awareness and more information.",

What this resort have done will surely make few more resorts operational in the location to add bitcoin payments. I'm not sure of the legal status of bitcoin in Maldives. However a step forward is always appreciable.As Maldives is more popular for tourism it adds more value. Because there is difference in addition of payments option in a local tourism region and an international spot.",
