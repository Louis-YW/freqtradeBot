      "body": "If the platform did not give you any results, it is very likely that others would behave the same. Searching on Etherscan, the address is too short for it to give a suggestion.If you are sure that the address exists, you may want to download the full node, and manually parse the address by yourself, and then do the search locally. All in all, the forked code on the platform above seems to only search for an Ethereum address that is involved in a transaction. So, the address is empty is also a possibility.",
