The main issue is that even though people pay taxes for it, you dont really make that work for 40 years. I mean do you think someone who is 60 years old right now, that could start paying taxes in 80s 90s being available today? Absokutely not, so todays kids working pays the taxes for todays elderly so that when they are old tomorrow, tomorrows kids would pay for theirs. This decision helps just a bit withkut a doubt, it doesnt suddenly make economy better, but it allows a bit of a lee way to cyt the spending and government not hurting the economy too bad. Obviously I know this because when I was a kid people retired at 40-45, and we started to spend taxes for them, thankfully its 60 years and even 65 years old in most cases, and that definitelymakes it a lot better now that it makes everything later, not that our economy is any better but at least its not that much worse.",

But now they have to work for 2 more years to enjoy pension.",

I admire the French people's fight; although two more years might not seem much for us, as the retirement age is already quite low compared to the EU's average, the French are fighting to avoid any potential further increase in the future or other measures taken against them. Seeing that they didn't react to the first one, why not increase it further?",

One of the advantages is that the worker will enjoy more years of service when they appear to be young and able to work. One of the disadvantage is that the younger workforce would not have space to be accommodated in the work space.But talking with respect to this topic, the increments of the retirement year from 62 to the 64 should be made in such a way that it would be the opinion of the worker to continue the next two years, if not they should retire with their whole benefits.",

Workers who are approaching retirement age should be given a choice after appraisal to keep working or retire. What sense does this make? Would you agree or disagree?Usually the Government's decision to increase the retirement age depends on many factors, including life expectancy, labor requirements, economic conditions, and social policies. Several countries face the problem of labor shortages and increasing the retirement age can be one solution to overcome this. If I see that President Emmanuel Macron made the decision to increase retirement age from 62 to 64 it was wrong, so there were pros and cons because there was nothing urgent. After all In general, some people at the age of 64 are no longer able to work properly and productively, while others may experience a decline in their health and skills that affect their effectiveness at work.Besides that, increasing the retirement age can also trigger several impacts, one of which is triggering negative reactions from certain groups, such as the news that you share with trade unions and social organizations. In this case, the French government should carefully consider these impacts before making a decision to increase the retirement age. Therefore, I do not agree with President Emmanuel Macron's decision.",

However, it is important to note that ageism in the workplace is a real issue, and older workers may face discrimination and be forced into retirement even if they are still capable and willing to work. In terms of the benefits and drawbacks of retaining older employees, it is essential to strike a balance between experience and productivity. While experience can be invaluable, it is also important to recognize that cognitive and physical decline can affect job performance. Employers should consider alternative arrangements such as part-time work, flexible hours, or job sharing to accommodate older workers and maximize their contributions while minimizing the negative impact on their health and well-being.",

No one can discriminate senior workers in a workplace, remember they are the people who get in the work first, and others are like juniors to them.  In work ethics, it is often that seniors are getting the respect of their juniors.  If a person wanted to discriminate they will discriminate regardless of the age of person they wanted to discriminate.Also, I don't think that underperformance will be the issue in this decree.  Since we cannot see any major changes in the performance of a person if ever the retirement age is increased by 2 years.  Other people are working even at the age of 70+.  I agree that it can bring both positive and negative emotional and psychological impacts to the worker but it is what it is, the government implementation of an increased age retirement bracket will not please everybody.",

      "body": "I always believed that relegating senior and experienced workers to advisory positions with less hours and decent pay is a good way to go. Giving them a choice to accept this role or quit working won't hurt any company that they're working on. Experience and knowledge is always respected and valued no matter the field is, and you can't pass it on to the young ones without a senior teaching them a thing or two about their industry. The retirement age they have imposed is okay, though there should always be an option for these seniors to continue what they're doing albeit in a less physically-intensive work load and of course, reduced amount of pay, but I guess that's just me wanting these kinds of things to other people. I want to retire early, but I understand the void that it will leave me once I no longer do what I'm doing for years all of a sudden.",

It is important to note that late retirement may not be feasible or desirable for everyone, as individual circumstances and preferences vary.

As we grow older, experience should become a major part of our jobs instead of just relying on physical strength, the older workers can also be shifted to positions that won't need much physical strength so they can work longer and earn enough money to help them in their days of retirement.",

It makes \"sense\" from the perspective of the government who are forced to meet the obligations of the citizens they forced to participate in the social insurance plan.

But this needs to be managed carefully to ensure that it doesn't affect the company's performance at the same time. This is of great significance to the protection of workers' rights. Allowing seniors to continue working or to retire depends on their choice and due diligence by the company.
