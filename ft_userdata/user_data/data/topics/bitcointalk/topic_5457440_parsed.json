The old world is gone and the power to be, are pushing their own agenda and uncontrolled immigration is one of the major ways they want to use to achieve their goals. What is really disturbing to me is that why are Europeans not having more children than people from developing and third world countries. The standard of living is far better than these places, but they decided not to have children. The extinction of white race is coming maybe in hundred years the native will become minority in their own land. People need to wake up and not self-destruct themselves from within, the funny thing is that most of these people do not see this as a big issue.",

Does this makes sense to some of you?So... I am assuming that you have some sort of conniving theory about the vaccines (which I assume is the reason for the censorship of your YT account). I reckon it's because it's a \"theory\", sadly not enough people understand the term and they push it as a \"fact\" instead, and said facts were, well, going against what was needed to fix the problem. Back then, people NEEDED to understand what the hell was happening and what they needed to do. It was not a time for \"conspiracies\" since lives were at stake, not only theirs but also those around them due to how it was spreading rather wildly (I mean the entire world went to a lockdown, that's enough to showcase how dangerous it was). As for the AI, I don't see how they stand side by side here. Sadly I can't really understand what your \"old world\" means here, except that you were rather dubious of a lot of things back then, but I don't think being dubious of AI is anything since, well, no one is forcing you to use it.",

The world has moved but you can still cope through learning and observation. I have also thought about contributing to my country politically but that world seems very risky and dirty. In my country politics is now synonymous with corruption and bribery. Elections are now won with money and not the character of the candidates. I have decided to avoid politics until it becomes clean. Citizens should be allowed to peacefully express their political views without restrictions and intimidation. Your views on immigration are your observation. Some people are of the view that freedom of goods and human resources should be encouraged because it is important. They feel that immigrants contribute positively to the nation's economy. Labor shortages are corrected with foreign workers and some immigrants establish a flourishing business. Like you said we should encourage legal migration but sometimes illegal immigrants have no choice. They are faced will situations that push them to embark on deadly immigration journeys. developed countries should assist citizens of our nations because they really need the help. If foreigners will not harm the host country,  they should be welcomed.You are welcome to the forum and hope you will enjoy yourself. Regarding privacy, you have to put extra effort to enjoy it.

Th point of all is: I´ve been in that \"official\" world of politics and media etc. I have a newswebsite and social media attached to it. I/we have become a brand.But after a few years in this world it makes me wanna leave that world again. It makes me nervous. There are some very scary truths about politicians and worldcontrol.That makes me want to go back to the \"old times\". But I see clearly on this forum that the services, goods that sold are not interesting anymore. So I struggle to find my way back here. Ik keep on reading ofcourse. It is not always a good idea to post exactly what I have been done and doing now in the \"100% legal world\" if I can call it like that. People will abuse it.",

Does this makes sense to some of you?I quite enjoy what you have to say and don't feel bored reading it to the end. But the important point is in the final revelation that this world is so perfect in every way. Regarding the cycle where almost every country in the world feels the same impact from one event. Like Corona, in the end, all governments apply the same restriction system. Not only applies to old age, even children, youth, women, and men must follow the set rules.Why were the systems and rules the same when Corona started? the answer is in the media that controls us and is quickly spread widely spread by representatives of every country. The era faded and the Corona era was over. Now the world is facing a new chapter and the most popular issue in the economic sector. Cold war, US standing threatened. With the dollar weakening, the BRICS challenge for the strength of the US economy continues to be at stake. Then apart from that all our roles are only as executors of the system that has been arranged in such a way. Because we are not important people, unlike you who have thousands of subscribers and can guide followers to apply your understanding. But I'm not, just a victim of the system itself.",

All data was collected during lockdowns and vaccination. Are they also collecting DNAs as well?  Conspiracy again but why not? Old world is gone indeed.",

      "body": "That time was crazy.I saw all my friends and family doing such irresponsible things.Wearing masks, living in fear, they felt they wanted as many vaccines as possible.I lost a lot of friends because of \"corona\".They did not want to talk to me anymore. I never wore a mask, ever. My world became smaller, but I was okay with that but my family and friends did not accept my criticism. I was a \"conspiracy theorist\" and a \"danger for other people\". Some familymembers were sceptical but because of social pressure, even my own mum, took the jab. I still regret I could do nothing to talk that decision out of her head. And the the very young chidren from my sister...There were always shops where you could buy without a mask. It was expensive, but I will never let the government make me wear something very unhealthy.But many people had no choice. They had to choose between their job and taking the jab or getting fired. But even then.This shows my opinion about corona and the jabs in short. I do respect other views and one day we will know the truth.",

Changes are happening continuously and even you won't be your currently \"yourself\" tomorrow.What I have been seeing since the pandemic is that governments and regulators have adopted harsh measures against who they believe to be contributing to the disease's spread. At first impression and until the contrary is proved, it seems a noble attitude thinking on common welfare, right?However, such harsh measures aren't restricted to health affairs. They also go further, through the political sphere. In some countries people are persecuted and imprisioned for their religious or political preferences. And regards this matter, it's nothing new. Since the ancient socities we see this happening.It's all about power. People conspirate, lie, betrayal and kill to reach the top of the pyramid. Common sense is manufactured by the powerful ones within time. I believe we live in a big lie with a false sense of security and constitutional guarantees that don't exist for real.Since you are a conservative, you should know only God is to be trusted and followed. Forget about human ideologies and idolatry of fake celebrities and political figures. Even regards news about Covid you should be careful with the kind of content you absorb. There are many fake news being spread by supposed conservatives...",
