I have vow not involved in abortion and she is also scared of it. Now the father wants her to succeed him in the ministry like she also have to answer the call of saving souls from going to hell fire! She wants me to go the father and tell him that I want to be a pastors when am not, and I don't know it, I can't even fake it. Though her reason be that when I became a pastors within few weeks she can quickly tell the father she has fall for me  for marriage but the big issues is that she is not up to the age? This matter is difficult and confusing! What do I do? If you're in my shoes",

If I were you instead complaining what happened I will find some ways to help the situation. Also you said she's not up the age? Brother seems like you've done something with a minor better take the responsibility and ask for forgiveness.",

While I completely agree with you (and then some): I always thought foxes (even pups) knew better than to waste their time trying to make sense of human activity. Better to ignore most humans (or bite their tender bits), and instead spend your energy doing good foxy things. Didn't your fox family teach you that?",

If you don't wanna do that, then you will have to pay her dowry and child support, otherwise you will see not a good day in your life.",

Here are some steps you can take:Have a conversation with the girl: Talk to her about the pregnancy, how she is feeling, and what her plans are. It's important to listen to her and take her feelings and wishes into consideration.Discuss your options: You and the girl should discuss your options for the pregnancy, which may include keeping the baby, adoption, or termination. It's important to make a decision that is right for both of you.Support the girl: Pregnancy can be a difficult and emotional time, so it's important to support the girl in any way you can. This may include attending doctor's appointments with her, helping her with household chores, or just being there to listen and offer emotional support.Take responsibility: If you and the girl decide to keep the baby, it's important to take responsibility for your role as a parent. This means being involved in the child's life, providing emotional and financial support, and being a positive role model.Remember, having a baby is a big responsibility, but it can also be a joyous and rewarding experience. By taking responsibility for your actions and working together with the girl, you can create a positive outcome for everyone involved.",
