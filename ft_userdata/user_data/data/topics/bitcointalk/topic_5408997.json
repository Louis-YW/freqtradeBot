Better. The time I spend on the forum I don't want to spend it angry, that's why I haven't been in the political section for some time and I tend to avoid discussions on other boards if I see that the positions are entrenched.Quote from: airfinex on August 07, 2022, 11:43:53 AMTell  who you think is influential and why.https://bpip.org/Report?r=mostmeritUsers from this list best fit the description.You just answered the question yourself. I would extend it to those in the top positions of not only earned merit but also most trusted and most recognized.For me in particular LoyceV would be number 1 not only because of all he knows about the forum but also because of his thick-skin mindset.",

Any member can dispute whatever they want if they do not agree with it, i understand there is free speech in the forum, you can likewise criticize what you do not like. Leaving tags, whether positive, negative or neutral is for every member of the forum, distrusting people too, so we all can use it.Hell if there is even a way to create a club  anybody should go ahead and create theirs if they want, FREEDOM!",

Because even with his post count and merit and everything else. He is not known there. He could read it every day but we would not know that. Heck I'm even like that I made my 1st post in the gambling section today in months. Read it a lot, just don't talk about it so to speak.

I may be on top of that list (while it lasts), but that doesn't mean I could influence people. I may be able to convince some users in certain ways (such as how to use the Trust system correctly), but in my book being influential means you can influence people in any direction. I don't think I'd be able to get people to use some shitcoin for instance (nor am I willing to find out).I like to think of it as \"I can only show you the door, you're the one who has to walk through\" (quote taken from Morpheus, but I sure hope you knew that already when you read it).Quote from: Poker Player on August 07, 2022, 12:00:41 PMFor me in particular LoyceV would be number 1That doesn't make me influential.

I suppose that if he is not mentioned it will be for the same reason as Satoshi, although he is active, he doesn't write much. Btw, I hope someone will give some merit to airfinex, I am out atm, but I think he deserves at least one because after so many drama threads lately, a thread that can have a funny touch is appreciated.",

My second user is Ddmrddmr: i was first attracted to this user when i came across a thread created by @fillippone that says  [FUN] Is DdmrDdmr even human? then i also give a glance on his profile and since then, I've always respected his abilities beyond doubts in giving out the best to the smothiness of the community, i also wonder if he never get tired and how he multitask himself to arrive on achieving outstanding results, he has many threads that involve taking time in extracting data form the forum such as that of Bitcointalk Ranking-up pipeline- Those close to their next rank (lacking Merits) which is consistently updated.3. My third are these two wonderful set of users: Fillippone and Ratimov, i intentionally bring them together because there's similarities in their thinking approach and creativity, i love to read their threads because they always bring in new ideas in doing things, they take alot of their efforts in doing research about a particular area, they picture a particular need and create a fill on the vacuum space, i wish to develop upto their abilities in the nearest future.",
