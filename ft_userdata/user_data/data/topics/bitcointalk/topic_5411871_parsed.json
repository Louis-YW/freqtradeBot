So, no matter what price of the token they're gonna to sell the token make the market of that token have more token in the market rather than buying demand.So, until now most P2E project cannot provided this common problem for P2E project. That's why, most the token value is always dropped. If you investing on P2E Project, holding the token with a long term is not recommend. Because the game it self always generated a new token.",

People keep thinking that watching a few gameplay videos will make you understand what kind of game it will be but I can promise you that it won't be like that.Unreal engine 5 is out now, you think games will be able to use that and build stuff that would be realistic and then put crypto in it and make it online and hold thousands playing ALL at the same time? Of course not. But I can shoot a 5 minute video showing me playing that game, it won't be real and it will not exists but from the videos you will think it might be, and that's what people invested into.",

The developers are only building it blindly without even aware if inflation and grinders have become the main problem why play to earn was not so successful like another project that was working in the different field. I think that can be seen from how fast dump that happened with SLP. No more new players, the price down so fast. People complaining about their ROI.",

What do you think about the future of projects like Monkey League and Thetan Arena on the long term.I think that the current state of play to earn crypto projects is basically exactly the same as the one of all the other crypto projects at the moment especially those that only appeared within the last 2 years or so. The whole crypto market is still based around hype cycles in my opinion and one of those cycles that were ongoing in the last two years was the play 2 earn games. During the height of the hype wave there were dozens of new p2e projects coming up each and every day.Now that we are in a bear market that is already ongoing for several months it is not a big surprise that most of those projects are already dead again or almost worthless. I think that only a small percentage of all p2e projects will still be around in a few years.",

What do you think about the future of projects like Monkey League and Thetan Arena on the long term.There are many projects that I know of that only focus on catching up with the trend of launching tokens, but they don't bring a good product to operate and maintain the product they create. In this market, a few have been very successful in this area and applied many others, leading to a very false hype about the idea coming to the actual product. In general, if any party makes a quality product, I believe this field always has potential benefits that it can create, but to be more honest, my investment in this is still because of trends but not the quality they create in the product much, because basically I don't really have much inspiration with entertainment products like this.",

P2E has too many problems to solve if it wants to continue to attract players, otherwise it will disappear like ICO.",

Seeing this condition I have left the project that smelled of gam since early January, because it seems most of the projects will not last long. Unless you can take advantage of the moment when it was just launched and then when it feels profitable, you can sell it. However, this method is certainly very risky.",

What do you think about the future of projects like Monkey League and Thetan Arena on the long term.I think most of those P2E crypto fall in price because all of them is basically the same, they just in different packaging. Most of them are just a similar or even identical MMORPG that rewards the player with collectible in game item. The player just move from other P2E game to another and make a profit from the greater fool thery, the one who come first will make profit the other will suffer some loss. What the P2E games developer need to do to be successful and stay for long term is find something new kind of game and concept.",

But it's obviously too risky to invest in P2E tokens these days. Further risk when OP invests in unfinished projects, and unfinished products while the token value has decreased by 93%, the possibility of OP losses is quite high.",

Most of them are no longer encouraging as what they've used to be before and all of them are hit by the bear market.I guess majority of them won't be able to survive and if there will be some that shall remain, they will just a few of it. It's not the same anymore and the bear market really removes a lot of projects.From the usual crypto projects to P2E games and other types of crowd funding in the market.",

By the next bullrun, for sure projects in this business model will grow. I'm not sure if the old projects that came out last year will grow, but still, the industry is not dead. Likewise, I am not sure that in the next bull run these projects will not be used only for speculation.

The game fails, and the value of the game's token tanks like there's no tomorrow. For those wanting to play P2E games, better invest early and get profits as early as you can then get out.

Before the P2E trend started, there were tons of gamers worldwide who have spent hundreds or thousands of dollars for these games like skins, bundles, etc., without expecting anything in return even if the game shuts down in the near future.Because of the term \"play to earn\" or \"P2E\" itself, it's not sustainable and draws a lot of criticisms and being hesitant to engage themselves in the play to earn space. The Gamefi industry should now focus on what games were really meant to me, which is for fun. Crypto, NFT, etc., should only be treated as bonus perks on top of having fun playing these games.It's time to remove this term instead but we can retain \"GameFi\" to condition the minds of gamers letting them know that these games are only for fun. It's just that the edge of Gamefi is that we own the skins, bundles, etc., in the form of NFTs. Just my opinion guys.",
