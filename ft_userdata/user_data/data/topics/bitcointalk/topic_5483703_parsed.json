Is the risk worth it, you are expected to ask yourself all these.Some risks are not worth taking, how sure is he for the market to experience a bull run or go in opposite direction,  since the market remains unpredictable it is not of certainty if after the interval of two years the market will be profitable for him to sell and return the money. Atleast if he is earning little income with the mindset of becoming a Bitcoin owner he can then apply the DCA strategy it will help him accumulate some good amount of Bitcoin with time.",

I personally do not like the idea of Borrowing to invest in asset like bitcoin because of its volatility, so it is a bad idea to me. I see your friend is actually trying to maximize profits by looking for a duration of two years to return the funds which ideally should have bitcoin price higher before then. But I will tell you that it is still a prediction that bitcoin will raise after that years, there is a probability that it wouldn’t increase before your friend pays back the Loan which might lead him to lose. Take for example last two years there was a heavy bitcoin dump say your friend had take this loan around January 2022 and decides to pay back this year, he would have been in loss now because the price then was above $45k and not that now. Bitcoin has been advice to be invested in with an amount of we can afford to lose even if it is our money, so borrow funds is way out of the equation except you have a good collateral to fall back to",

Even if we do consider that there's no interest if he borrowed funds from his friends, it doesn't change the fact that there's no guarantee that he'd get his money back. That guarantee is something those who have their own money and invest with it can afford to not have but those who use loans? They NEED to have that guarantee, and it's just dumb to assume that it's going to naturally happen. It doesn't matter that many people think that Bitcoin follows the same historical cycle, it can always change at any moment. Just get a job really. Or if he wanted to invest now to not miss out on any possible growth, then get a job and get a loan. Use the loan to invest and use the job income to pay back the loan slowly. This has an issue with the scale of the loan though since it's not realistic to loan a big amount then having a job with peanut salaries.",

      "body": "It’s easy to say that your friend will not be panicking since the duration of two years is quite long. But if you are already trading but still not making significant profits but only consistent losing within that 2 years, then most probably you will surely develop worries on how you will be able to pay back that loan. Remember that trading won’t never guarantee a fixed and consistent profits, regardless of how good you are in trading. If you are highly skillful on it, you might be making massive profits but it won’t be happening at all time as there are still inevitable losses in trading at some point. Now, the question is if you are skillful in trading? Because if not, it’s better not to take any loan that you will only regret later on. Save if you want to trade, and trade of an amount that you can afford to lose. That way, if you lose, at least you are not compromising other people’s funds.",

The interest of taking loan for two years and the profits that could generated from investment, if the investments would yield 5x of the money borrowed then he should go borrow but if he knows that after borrowing he wouldn't get 2x of the money borrowed then no need to go borrow any money to invest considering the interest rate of taking loan for two years men that would be an outrageous loan.

This is basically a more extreme version of leveraged trading, because for leverage you have to start with something, but if you're taking a loan you could be tempted to invest without any of your own money.And with Bitcoin specifically, its volatility plays a huge negative role here. You don't know when there will be ups and downs, but you have to pay back the loan at a fixed date. Now imagine that when that day happens Bitcoin is in a huge bear market and you have either to sell at a loss and find more money to repay the loan, or suffer the dire consequences of defaulting.",

Or is it like the banks and other financial institutions which require regular small payments with a term of 2 years? Provided the loan amount isn't big enough that paying it would require him to work day and night and cut on his basic needs, I guess this one's tolerable. Certainly, within 2 years, the price of Bitcoin will surpass $42,000. But your friend can't be greedy. It's borrowed money. He has to be practical and realistic.

Meanwhile... He is considering to take loan from his relative to pay back within the range of 2years.This is to say he would have such range of time without a panic to pay back. ~SnipThis issue is often the subject of long debate. Because investing in bitcoin with borrowed capital is not recommended. Even though the person running it already has extensive knowledge about Bitcoin, the risks are still very large. Because you need to remember itthat no one knows what Bitcoin will look like in the next 2 or 3 years. The possibility could continue to develop or even experience setbacks. So this is where the role of capital used will be very useful to minimize risks that may occur. Indeed, if you look at Bitcoin today, it looks like Bitcoin will continue to experience good growth in the future. But you need to remember, don't just think about the good side, but the bad side must also be remembered and taken into account.Because if we invest in an asset, including bitcoin, the calculations must be complete and not only think about the good side. Because in an investment there are always two possibilities that can happen.So even though your friend has mastered and has extensive knowledge about Bitcoin, this is of course not enough and there are still shortcomings. Because for example, right now your friend is borrowing money from his relatives to invest in bitcoin. Then your friend promises his relatives that he will pay the debt within 2 years. Of course this will affect his mentality. But even so, the possibility of making a profit is also not small. Because currently bitcoin is in the right condition for the time of purchase. Because the Halving and Bullish Market will definitely arrive soon. For this reason, at this time bitcoin investors have the opportunity to make a profit. So at that time the opportunity to make a profit will be very big for you friend. However, my advice to your friend is, don't wait 2 years to pay off the loan. Because it would be better if, for example, your friend has made a profit, then the loan money must be returned immediately.",

If the pattern that has happened in previous Bitcoin cycles is repeated the next 18 months or so will be bullish, meaning buy now to sell roughly then it seems like a good move. The problem when you use borrowed money is that you don't make the same decisions you make when you use money you have to spare. If things don't go as planned, if suddenly there is a big drop in the price, when you have invested with money that you have to spare you ride out the storm and do nothing but if it is money that you owe don't be surprised if you make rash decisions like panic selling.",
