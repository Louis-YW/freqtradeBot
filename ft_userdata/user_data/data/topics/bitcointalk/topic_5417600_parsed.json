Nothing to market Thank you kindly Even if you don't plan to sell, still it's the Collectibles section that holds the best answers for your problem.First of all, bitaddress may not be the best choice, arguably a web script may not be random enough, plus you have to be careful about downloading and running that in a safe environment.This topic may give some ideas: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5416519I personally would put Electrum on a live OS USB stick and run it from there, generate a new wallet and get a private key.About the \"paper\" there are some useful topics to read:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5296179.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5290065.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414479.0",

Nothing to market Thank you kindly Do you want to generate an address without recognizing the private key, thus ensuring that the private key is known only to the buyer? Or do you want to generate the private key securely?The step of generating the key and printing the QR and then placing security seal is not complicated and with a little technical knowledge you can generate the key safely. @NeuroticFish comment is enough for that.The problem is if you want to generate a private key and only want the buyer to know it, which will require more details.",

Nothing to market I would look for new simplified QR codes that you can easily draw with your own hand, and I saw this being used by some diy hardware signing devices and hardware wallets.You can easily draw this QR codes on regular paper or even engrave them in stainless steel plates, but adding security seal is mostly a security theater in my oppinion.Don't use any thermal printers for long term QR codes because ink will fade away fairly quickly.Instead of generating private key I would consider generating seed words that can later be used for generating more addresses.Iancoleman website would be a good BIP39 option for this, if done correctly while being offline, or you could just use Electrum wallet.https://iancoleman.io/bip39/",

      "body": "If you simply want to use bitaddress don't generate them there instead generate them to some trusted wallet like electrum as suggested above other suggestion is bitcoin core and Armory wallet run them offline including the bitaddress. And then the private key that you generated from another wallet import it to bitaddress under wallet details and then enable the bip38 passphrase to add additional security/password then get the QR code under Private Key BIP38 Format and the key that starts with 6p. You can later decrypt it on bitaddress just make sure never connect the device online to avoid leaks and always do it on an offline device.",

Sure, but since you'll probably put some money there, you should make sure you've generated it safely.Quote from: dkbit98 on October 19, 2022, 03:19:57 PMInstead of generating private key I would consider generating seed words that can later be used for generating more addresses.Indeed, that's a viable option too and since 24 words can fit nicely in a QR it can even make it easier (to read) at the recovery/claiming of the funds.",
