For example Oasis Network.People look at technology in crypto far too often. In principle, this is true, but the technology is often not the reason why projects increase in price. Otherwise, there would have to be completely different projects in the top 20 than are currently there. Many projects with outstanding technology have disappeared into oblivion over the years. Hype, momentum and marketing are much more important factors for the success of a crypto project, just look at Doge or Shiba. What I want to say is, don't worry about the technology if you want to see price increases for your investment.",

It doesn't even make sense when you are buying at the current situation when market is still continue to dump. That does make sense to buy such token but with the current market trend and are you sure to enter in the market? I may feel worry about that. This reminds me with the bad trend that happened before. Once you are entering into the wrong position and you will be loosing a lot.

Devs ever so often would change their marketing approach to suit the current trends so as to profit off those trends and that seems a bit dubious, not saying that's what Oasis is particularly doing as I've not followed the project.Quote from: tyz on May 09, 2022, 10:38:15 AMHype, momentum and marketing are much more important factors for the success of a crypto project, just look at Doge or Shiba.

In essence, I see what you're saying as both right and wrong, and it can't work in a positive way to please some individuals or crowds.

What I want to say is, don't worry about the technology if you want to see price increases for your investment.There are not many investors willing to learn the core technology of cryptocurrency or any related crypto terms. They know all of the \"buzzwords\" like Web3, smart contract, Defi, GameFi, Metaverse, etc... However, when we ask them about what exactly those terms mean and how those techs will shape the future, they beat around the bush and talk about how much money they will earn by investing and their dream of Lambo.

But they may have  chance because this is very popular in stock traders, remember this is listed on Robinhood. Its almost true though that most layer1 project in the past were gone below the rank. But there are still that keeps popping on the news with very minimal updates like the WAVES and NEO. The prices of these two still are worth if you  bought in 2017 so layer1 tokens is not so bad as long as you have bought at the right time.",
