  "content": "As we all are aware Bitcoin Halving is excepted to happen around April-May2024. Dare I say whatever price BTC sits on today is irrelevant and can expect an exponential growth after May2024. If we look back at each time Bitcoin Halving took place in the past (November2012,July2016 and May2020) We have seen tremendous growth in prices due to supply shock. I think anyone who truly believes in Bitcoins future could not ask for a better timing to invest into it right now.Even for those who want short term goals could easily see their investments grow like crazy by next halving which be in 2028.\"Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it\"This is just something i thought i would share with the community if someone wasn't aware but let me know what you believe and also please feel to share your thoughts on this even if you disagree with whatever i've said above.",

      "body": "I'm just talking about the history that I know, even though I've never experienced it myself when halvings have occurred.According to history, every time a halving occurs, the price spike is very large and I will justify this because more than 5 news sources that I have read, including more than a small group of experts in the crypto world, have explained the positive impact that will occur regarding the Bitcoin halving which is predicted to occur in 2024 corresponds to a 4-year event.Even though the Bitcoin halving will have a good impact on Bitcoin investors who have a large amount of Bitcoin, in my opinion, investors who expect big profits through price returns during the halving must do it consistently and need to prepare everything well before the halving occurs.The huge profits that investors will get during the halving and after, are not limited to Bitcoin investors alone. In my opinion, the positive effects in terms of profits will also be experienced by altcoin investors that I know.For me, these are the times that test investors' patience in holding Bitcoin in the midst of a market situation that is experiencing correction and experiencing difficulties in improving what I have seen myself since I have been active. This means that in the midst of an increase, the price starts to move, suddenly returns to the bottom, or rather at the previous price.",

It is logic to see less growth rate when an asset has higher price and bigger marketcap, it will have less growth rate.In future, we might see big growth after like two cycles, not a single one when block subsidy becomes smaller and it potentially makes halving has less impacts on price with only one cycle.

Any asset will have a limit to its growth and at some point it will reach its maximum and saturation. Similar to gold, it also has a very good growth period but will gradually stabilize and bitcoin is no exception. That is also the reason why many people are gradually switching to investing in Altcoins with the hope of earning higher profits but with more risk.",

If you don’t want to regret again next time, you should try and buy when you have the money to invest just do it and don’t wait for the price to drop to zero first because that might never happen, bitcoin price is just not predictable when you will be waiting for it to drop is when it will go up and so on, so buy and hold now for you not to regret again, the bull run is coming we can’t tell exactly when but it will come so why wait for it try to buy and hold for long in other not to be taken by surprise.",

Bitcoin is still very young, the software is a BETA version that is still in full development. So even though it doesn't seem like it, we are at the beginning of all this.We are definitely heading towards price stability even though it would never be like a a stable coin but the fluctuations that some Alt-coins experiences due to volatility is not the same as that of bitcoin. The volatility rate of bitcoin price is no longer high again. If we look at the price we are even expecting in the next bull run many will tell you that at most it will be a $200k new ATH which is just like 3x from the current ATH before we would have even predicted a 5x to 10x but no the market is not that too volatile and that’s why the best thing is to hodl for a very long term Quote from: thecodebear on January 25, 2024, 02:08:11 PMETF and halving are entirely different events.

This high level of sale as expected is by whales because they knew many will give in and once ETF is approved they will take their profit early before the market actually corrects. The idea is look into long term and not a short term like ETF hypes",
