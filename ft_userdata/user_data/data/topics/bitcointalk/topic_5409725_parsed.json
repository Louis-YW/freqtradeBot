These attackers acquire the private seeds of a user's wallet after clicking on a link in Google sites or Microsoft Azure. They then obtain the data of the users’ accounts in any of the exchanges being phished. Once the user inputs their info, the sites return an error message and prompt them to contact a support operator that will further obtain more info about the user should he/she comply, thus, they successfully steal their funds.Netskope however strongly recommends to users, never enter their info after clicking on a link. Instead, visit the site you are trying to log in to, directly or better still, use a secure web gateway, capable of detecting and blocking phishing in real-time.Will there ever be an end to cryptocurrency scams?https://news.bitcoin.com/netskope-discovers-hackers-are-using-google-sites-and-microsoft-azure-to-steal-crypto/?utm_source=OneSignalPush&utm_medium=notification&utm_campaign=PushNotifications",

Even if it is a legit site, there is no reason to ask for private keys, seed phrases, or passwords!",

It is possible that we may witness a decline in the number of persons that fall victims to cryptocurrencies scams as the years go by and more persons become more aware of them, however I doubt that it can completely seize. Scammers are constantly devising new methods to swindle you, you should always be on guard. Dating scams that was the earliest form of cyber scam is still in existence so it will be naive to think cryptocurrency scams are going away anytime soon.",

So the only solution is to moderate it and continue spreading the news that cryptocurrency is not a get rich quick scheme.",

The problem is not only that there are bad people who take advantage of the situation with cryptocurrencies, but actually the biggest problem is the millions of naive people who are easy targets. You only need to ask them in an ingenuous way, and they will do everything that is asked of them because they are blinded by ignorance and greed.The education of young people is crucial in order to reduce the number of scams, because the prevention that would result from arrests and punishments is not something that works.",

      "body": "Even the best of us get caught out. Several weeks ago, I'd been waiting for a package from X courier company. And it so happened that afternoon a scam phishing email with the name of the courier arrived. Didn't even think, opened it directly from the notification. Read that the delivery was withheld as I wasn't home. Annoyed, since I WAS home, actually clicked the link inside before belatedly checking the link/email.Obvious phishing, and I didn't proceed but of course, had already marked my email as active to all those spam bots. Cue delivery of fresh bout of spam.Best thing to me personally about how not-yet-super-user-friendly using a Bitcoin client is, is that even with a scam attempt, you generally have to go through quite a bit to get fully hooked, at least with phishing.All this security advice memos fall on deaf ears though.My partner's office, top of the line in their field, every single monitor has every single access code written.And all the time I still see people waaay more educated than me use Google to get to a login page for whatever service they use.(Just realised I sort of went down a pointless rant)",

People will risk several years in prison, if on the other hand there is an option that they can provide themselves with a comfortable life without much trouble - and all that is needed is for them to succeed in scamming a few or just one rich crypto owner - just 12 words can mean hundreds of thousands of $ or even millions.Quote from: stompix on August 15, 2022, 01:54:10 PMSo I would bet at 1:1000 odds that the FED will use BTC 100 years before we celebrate 1 day without somebody getting scammed.It is a bet that you will certainly not lose, because human naivety and stupidity is as endless as the universe.",
