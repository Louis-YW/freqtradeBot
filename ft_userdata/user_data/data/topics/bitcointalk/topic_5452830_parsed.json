Odds and gains on winning those aren't worth money imho, especially when you get them eventually free by playing normal games.But since you asked, have you tried gems bonanza? I haven't made any stats but i feel like i don't win from it as often but when i win, i sometimes win big. And gold rushes are cool, i am not sure if they are worth buying as i don't buy bonuses but they can be very profitble, especially if you are not playing with smallest possible bets.",

It features a unique Western theme and offers a bonus buy feature that can lead to lucrative bonus rounds.Remember that slot preferences can vary from person to person, so it's important to try out different games and find the one that suits your preferences and playstyle. Additionally, it's worth keeping an eye on new releases, as the slot landscape is constantly evolving with new titles and features being introduced. Good luck and enjoy your slot gaming experience!",

Sometimes I do have conflicts of interest in choosing the casino to play on and in some cases,  my choice is driven by the number of wins I have hard on a casino and anyone that my luck shines more by winning in the past will be my choice no matter the bonus that may be offered by others.",

Just like I stated in my earlier comments,  it is better to follow your known perceptions rather than follow tips from social media influencers.",

The main reason i prefer playing this specific slot more is the amount of chance i had with it and also the low cost spins with higher chance to get into a bonus buy with few spins only as it was the case with my experience.I also saw many videos about Dog House with big wins so i may give it a try later.Quote from: Volgastallion on May 15, 2023, 08:31:14 PMMan, take this like an advice, NEVER follow this kind of things on Youtube, the mayority of them are fixed to show you they win, or they play with money that its not of them, so take care about it.About your question, doesnt exist a better or worst in reality, only exist in our heads, but after saying this you can also search in what you find more comfortable to you.For example if you want to win big use more high volatility slots than medium or low volatility.Thank you for your advice my friend, i already know about the manipulation going on with some YouTubers just to promote some casinos and I’m well aware of some known youtube channels that manipulate the slots chances of winning beside using fake money to gamble. But there’s also some good YouTubers with fun content so we can’t judge them all because of that. I gamble just for fun and never took it seriously.I think i prefer medium volatility so i don’t lose that much over time",

I probably played a few more non-myth themes but it's been so long I can't remember lmao.I reckon it's all just up to luck though? Sweet bonanza may just have been the game when your luck was at the top. I'd still say try out a lot of others, slots cover a lot of themes so it'd be a waste to not try the lot of them simply because you were luckier on one.",

Whether you get a big win or not depends a lot on variance and volatility and that's what makes the OP like a type of slot more or less, the moment he has a couple of big wins in Game of Olympus he's going to like it.",

If you think exactly the opposite is possible because you are more often playing in the sweet bonanza than other slot games to get a better experience in the slot games, maybe you should try with the same portion, play only 1x in each slot game and so on after that you can really feel which slot games will give a better multiplier.My best experience is in other slot games namely Big Bass Bonanza and my guess because I more often play these slot games but this is not up to max win and not from buy bonus features but from a normal spin with a multiplier of about 700x but after that only get an average multiplicator and it is small, and I'm sure every player has a different experience even though playing in the same slot games.",
