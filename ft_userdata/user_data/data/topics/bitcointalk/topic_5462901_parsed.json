Yes odds = 2.0 No odds= 1.5 I used to see this kind of thing with some casinos. Could you please elaborate on how your platform is different?Yes, there is a casino that is very similar to what OP is offering Futuur - Predict the Future! I've checked OP's platform https://getfoz.com/ but there's a connection timeout, he mentioned besides lack of funds he lacks user base but why he did not promote it here the first time he launch it?It's better to also post what potential investors will get if they support the relaunching of the platform, and why the site is down the domain has not yet expired Domain, is it the host you should at least make it online for potential investors to see.Quotegetfoz.comRegistrar:Dynadot IncRegistered On:2023-04-20Expires On:2024-04-20Updated On:2023-05-23",

It is 50% odds in here and you need to be matched with opponent who selected opposite odd for trade to be executed.",

It is 50% odds in here and you need to be matched with opponent who selected opposite odd for trade to be executed.It is this way that is not very clear to me. I was saying that since your project is only focusing on opinion, it means you will have large collections of events to give good number of options for people's opinion. I was going to check how the odds would be generated, but you mentioned that one needs to be matched with an opponent who selected opposite odds. I do not have the complete idea of your project, but I am seeing more of gambling than trading.",

Even though I released a testnet recently, the lack of funding forced me to stop.The key thing you wrote was, \"due to a shortage of users\". if that's really the case and you don't have enough interested users, then the idea itself is not good enough.Quote from: fasticr on August 11, 2023, 10:06:50 AMIf there are any Whales out there interested in giving this project new life, feel free to reach out to me on Dm. It's a great opportunity to be part of something unique!I'm not sure how unique the idea is, for example, I've seen similar platforms before where participants placed bets on the weather forecast. And that idea ended ingloriously like yours.",
