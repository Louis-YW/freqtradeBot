If someone is influenced by this, then he is a fool, because every day Bitcoin trading is worth 22 billion dollars - 3 million dollars is very small. In fact, I see news like this as motivation for us that holding Bitcoin in the long term is profitable. So there's no need to overreact to news like this.",

They got it free because there was no demand on Bitcoin when they mined them, as well as there was no competition. Now the demand is very high and people are willing to pay 60K to buy a single coin. What's unusual in it? Why should he burn on donating 50 Bitcoins? Yes, he got it for free but it's completely okay to profit today from them.Quote from: BitGoba on June 28, 2024, 07:19:56 AMEarly adopters of Bitcoin mostly sold their Bitcoin.

It's predatory for someone to sell some of their assets?? That's a bizarre take. Just a regular person deciding to sell (or at least move) some of their bitcoin. Nothing good or bad about it, just someone doing whatever they want with their money, same thing everybody does everyday.And nobody is \"making people\" pay $3 million for this. It's a market. People buy and sell willingly at current market price. Also each market participant is an individual who is trying to help themselves, not other people, so your \"that's not helping them is it?\" comment is super bizarre.

I'd really like to see anyone resist selling at least 1/3 of that right now and the rest at the height of the bull run. After all, I don't see anything controversial in that, like many others who commented in this topic. There have been dozens of such cases over the past years, which only means that much less BTC was actually lost than some estimated. If those 50 BTC are bought by a rich investor, then I can only say that $3 million is too little money for so many BTC.",

I can't say it's a free money because they work for it in some kind of way, because the hash power of their computer did the work, and they didn't get the computer for free. Moreover, this shows how important early knowledge is to those who seek.I don't think this occurrence will stop anytime soon. This wallet that was recently revived was a dormant wallet till the owner decided to transfer the funds to a centralize exchange. There are so many dormant wallets that are currently inactive, but with time, the owners will start moving their funds.But what surprises me is why the owner choose to move his/her funds at this point in time when Bitcoin price is far below it's ATH.",

Many investors now like to criticize and call early investors stupid for selling their bitcoins too early.
