  "content": "Hi - I'm new here.I am planning on transferring my BTC from an exchange to a multisig 2/3 wallet on Sparrow. I've been researching this a bit and it seems like quite a rabbit hole to go down for self-custody. I will also preface this by saying that I am not the most tech savvy individual and have no computer science background. I originally bought a ledger nano to do single sig cold storage. But I think my new plan is to buy a relatively inexpensive 8 gig laptop and only put Sparrow and some anti-malware software on it. And it would remain offline except for the very rare occasions that I would be buying or selling BTC. I'm planning on being in BTC for the long game. I was also planning on buying a Trezor wallet.  I've been thinking I would then create a 2/3 multisig wallet using sparrow on the laptop and distribute the three devices between my house, my trusted ex wife's house and 1 or 2 safety deposit boxes. I was considering adding a passphrase but it seems like more complexity than I want to deal with and I'm assuming statistically the chance of my multisig wallet getting hacked even without a passphrase is pretty low. My goals are to keep things highly secure, and allow access if one of our two houses is compromised somehow using the other two private keys. I would also like my ex wife to be able to access the BTC for our three young kids should I die or become incapacitated. I was also planning on downloading sparrow onto my home Mac and creating a watch-only wallet while leaving the other laptop secured offline essentially like a third cold storage wallet but using a Sparrow private key.Here are my questions:1) Does this sound like a reasonable plan? Is it overkill?2) is it reasonable to not use a passphrase with a 2/3 multisig wallet? It seems like another way to get locked out of your BTC despite also making it more secure.3) What would be the ideal distribution of these devices (the laptop w/ Sparrow , Ledger and Trezor), the two pins, the sparrow password, the three seed phrases, and the single file of the xpubs? Again the options would be my house, my ex's house, and 1 or 2 safety deposit boxes.i would want her to be able to access the BTC if I die but not be able to access it until then. I'm thinking I keep the Ledger, she has the Trezor, and then put the laptop in the safe deposit box. But I'm not exactly sure where to store each seed phrase and then the pins and the Sparrow password and the X pubs. I'm assuming you don't wanna keep the seed phrase and it's accompanying cold Wallet device in the same place. It's definitely a lot of stuff to keep track of. 4) Is sparrow a reasonable multisig wallet or is there a better application?5) Which anti-malware and/or antivirus software should I use on the laptop? Free ones would be nice. And any thoughts on which cheap reliable laptop to choose?6) if I log into my account on sparrow on my home Mac does that compromise my security, even if I'm not using the private keys and just checking the balance in a watch only account? Would it be better to use some other application instead of sparrow for checking my account?7) i've also heard that it could be useful to run the browser Tor which helps anonymize my browsing when I'm on the sparrow app. Is this necessary? Also seems like another piece of complexity that I would rather avoid if it doesn't make a big difference. If I use this browser, can I still use it on Windows if I buy a Windows laptop? I've also heard that if you lose your x pubs you lose access to all of your bitcoin, but I've also heard that that's not true. Can someone elucidate what the deal is with the x pubs? I understand that it allows you to re-create a new multisig wallet if you're wallet get lost or stolen, but I've also heard that if you lose it, you can lose access to your bitcoin or if someone finds it with one of the other seed phrases they can gain access to the bitcoin. Is this true? Any thoughts on where or how I should store these? I'd rather not have to encrypt a hard drive I'm thinking I may just print out the X pub on a piece of paper and keep it in one or more places secure. Any thoughts on how and where?Thanks a lot for everyone's help!",

You can consider to backup your seed phrase in steel plate or something that resist against fire, corrosion etc.Quote4) Is sparrow a reasonable multisig wallet or is there a better application?Sparrow is already a good wallet, other wallets are nothing different.Quote5) Which anti-malware and/or antivirus software should I use on the laptop? Free ones would be nice. And any thoughts on which cheap reliable laptop to choose?Not an anti-malware/antivirus user.Quote6) if I log into my account on sparrow on my home Mac does that compromise my security, even if I'm not using the private keys and just checking the balance in a watch only account? Would it be better to use some other application instead of sparrow for checking my account?It's not, the another alternative is track in blockstream.info by using their onion address.Quote7) i've also heard that it could be useful to run the browser Tor which helps anonymize my browsing when I'm on the sparrow app. Is this necessary? Also seems like another piece of complexity that I would rather avoid if it doesn't make a big difference. If I use this browser, can I still use it on Windows if I buy a Windows laptop?Tor, Mozilla, Chrome etc are browsing software.Windows is a operating system, like Mac, Linux etc. Of course you can use Tor in Windows, but it doesn't as good as using Tor in Linux since Windows is a spyware.Quote I've also heard that if you lose your x pubs you lose access to all of your bitcoin,Nope, xpub can only track your address and all the transactions, you can't have access to your coins. But if someone have your xprv, they can access your coins.",

Mac OS comes with Gatekeeper, Notarisation and XProtect[1], while Windows comes with Windows Defender.Quote from: SoulRebel on February 23, 2025, 05:18:14 AM8) I've also heard that if you lose your x pubs you lose access to all of your bitcoin, but I've also heard that that's not true.

Any thoughts on how and where?Without additional context / any reference link, i would speculate you heard about security issue when attacker know your master public key and one of child private key which can be used to obtain master private key. In such case, just make sure you never leak any kinds of private key.[1] https://support.apple.com/en-nz/guide/security/sec469d47bd8/web",

      "body": "I got nothing for you on the technical side, but how does a 3/4 multi-sig, with you holding 2 of the keys, appeal to you. This way even if the other 2 keys are found and conspired against you (your ex-wife found the key at her home and got hold of your safety deposit box key?), they can't spend the bitcoin (which they could in a 2/3), the most that could happen is the bitcoin would be frozen until something was worked out?",

I don't know if it's possible, but what I was thinking was doing something with the safety deposit box where they only give my ex-wife access to it if I were to die or become incapacitated. But I have to look to see if that's possible. This way, she would only get access to the second key if I wasn't around.",

Any thoughts on how and where?Xpub are simply just the extended public key which can be used generate the child public keys, this doesn’t restore the wallet like what the  extended private keys (Xprv) or seed phrase will do, but rather with it all addresses associated with the wallet can be found and transactions visible. Reason why Xpub is needed to be stored in a multisig wallet is because when restoring your multi sig wallet you need your own private key or seed phrase and then the Xpub of other co-signers wallet, this is to generate same address. Ideally it is usually stored or written in same place as your private key or seed phrase and then stored. With a different Xpub from the other co-signers you will be importing a wrong wallet. The choice of the multi sig wallet you want depends on how you want to safeguard the wallet keys, to avoid redundancy most people usually stick with the 2-of-3 multi sig wallet. With one with you, one with your ex wife as you said and probably one with your parents or bank vaults as some people do. It depends solely on whom you trust. While setting up your airgapped device make it is not devices that been online before as mere formatting wouldn’t eliminate all the malwares it might have had before.",
