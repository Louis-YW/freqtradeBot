  "content": "Over the past year, the number of T15s running at our farm has dwindled from over 100 to less than 50. Today I finally got through processing all the dead units and discovered the PSU, the APW8 was the faulty component on nearly every single unit. I was able to tell this by putting a known good PSU on the 50 dead T15s, one at a time. Almost every single HB, CB, cable and fan was totally fine, just a bad PSU. Some totally dead, others just not delivering power correctly. So now I have 50+ totally functional T15s that are just missing their PSU. So my question is:Should I seek to buy 50 used APW8s to get these machines hashing again? Or just cut my losses and sell the working hashboards and control boards?Does anyone have experience with this PSU type? Will they continue to die at this rate if I buy more?",

Good to know. Wish I'd known a lot sooner lol. Do you have any experience repairing these PSUs? I don't have a PHD in power science but would be willing to try.",

Iâ€™d go a step further and say if the metal capacitors by the power rails look exploded or leaky this is the only repair you can make without the electronics expert. They are the aluminum capped ones with the blue or red striped on the side. J",
