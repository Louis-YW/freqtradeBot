Thanks for confirming that you have nothing to counter.Why are you so mean?It's clear this is a new exchange, the old was zat.gg and this one is zat.io!Obviously, it's....different!  I think he is trying to get rid of all zat.gg links, probably already scammed a few  and want to erase those traces, which is pretty stupid. He deleted the Twitter account and the youtube videos, but somehow he forgot about the other topic here Nice rates btw:",

Not forgetting that on that very Trustpilot page, there are a couple of 5 star positive reviews which were made on the same day just 2 minutes a part The first review was made at 10:49 PM The second review was made at 10:51 PM on the same day I'm giving Op a couple of days before i flag and tag his profile. His exchange is just one big fat lie.",

What the hell you don't know what should your terms & conditions. I know some parts of the Terms & Conditions would be the same, but you should write it your way without plagiarising others. This is a strong red flag for your exchange. So yea, I will suggest avoiding it.",
