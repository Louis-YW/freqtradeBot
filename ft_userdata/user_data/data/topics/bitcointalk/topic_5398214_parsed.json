  "content": "Bitcointalk Education CenterUniversity is Originated from Universe, means vast. Therefore It is a place or educational setting in which people dwell to learn and acquire vast knowledge. Bitcointalk is a place where people came to learn different crypto currencies in various Boards. But there are two major Faculties (Boards) in the Bitcointalk University. Which are: 1. Bitcoin2. Politics 1. Bitcoin is the Main course of the University (Bitcointalk). Under the Bitcoin Faculty, there are sub courses to learn. Which are:1. Development & Technical Discussion2. Mining3. Marketplace4. Economics etcThese are departments (Boards) in the forum and there are child Boards under these above mentioned. 2. Politics. Under politics. There are: 1. Meta2. Politics & Society3. Beginners & HelpThere are other Boards under here but these are the Main ones. Please understand my point I Know why I choose these two Boards as the main two Faculties (Boards), though there are a lot of Boards from English to local boards but whatever Board you discussed, you discuss either Economy or politics. Â Example: If you are discussing about Mining, Trading, Marketing and Bitcoin as a whole, it is all about Economics. And the Same thing with Politics, when you discuss about a country adoption of Bitcoin, and that becomes Political Economy which under Politics. For the clear understanding.. In English language, there are many types of Noun but all the kinds of Noun can be fused into two. Concrete Noun and Abstract Noun. Anything you mention as a NOUN is under any of the above. So as it is said, all the other Boards are under these two Boards in the forum",

Read the forum title again. What does it tell you? The title doesn't say anything about politics, does it?I do not see any politics here. Well, maybe to some extent, the economy. Bitcoin should not be political.It is evident that you tried your best to tell us about your vision for this forum.

      "body": "Op, your post is a representation of what you percieve about this forum. Hey! I can say that you are so so wrong in this imaginary university you created.If you are to have two faculties in bitcointalk, they should be;1. Bitcoin Faculty 2. Other Faculty. It is Bitcoin and others and not Politics and Economics. I want to reaffirm to you that everything you see in this forum exists because there is first a Bitcoin (Bitcoin discussion, technicals, dev etc). Without Bitcoin, everything you see here wouldn't have been here. Even if your university is not real and cannot be real, in your imagination, give the king his position.",

      "body": "You have wrong perception about this forum since if we talk about university it has a instructor teaching there fellow students about things they need to learn and structure is really different, but here you will solely do that and obliged to do more research. Although those section where many discussion really helps and from that instead of calling it university we maybe can decently call it as crypto library where we can search or browse some information regarding on things we want to learn.",

The title doesn't say anything about politics, does it?I didn't forget the main course, which is bitcoin itself but I was thinking that bitcoin is under economy because bitcoin is a currency and currency is under Economy. Since you have advised me, I will change it. Because you know better. Quote from: lovesmayfamilis on May 12, 2022, 06:49:54 AMI do not see any politics here. Well, maybe to some extent, the economy. Bitcoin should not be political.There is politics in the forum. In my observation there is a very big politics in the forum. Bitcointalk is a university and a community. And University has a structure which is hierarchical. From top to down (Legendaries to Brand newbies). And also there are leaders, powers and authorities. Therefore, the Faculty of Politics is still stand but the economy will be changed to Bitcoin Faculty.",
