  "content": "I made some research about Bitcoin time lock to save money for the upcoming childbirth of my wife this coming March. I’m planning to hold my Bitcoin until the day that I need it.To make it short, I read same topic like this on other forum and it mention https://coinb.in/ which can create and redeem a time lock transaction. I just want to know if this service is good or there’s other way that I can do this using electrum wallet only without the need to move my fund outside my electrum wallet?",

      "body": "Use Electurm do not use a 3rd party. I have never heard of that website it might be legitimate but you want to be doing this from software you have verified and believe is secure. How does that website work anyway? I think it would require importing your address to do it. I would recommend sending it to a wallet that has been created offline and is not easy to access to stop the urge of you accessing it until this day comes that would be easier. Quote from: BlackHatCoiner on February 08, 2023, 07:46:07 PMThe question remains. Why locking up funds when you can just send them to your child's wallet, keep the seed phrase and wait?Resisting the urge to sell or buy things maybe?",

I’m already controlling myself properly by limiting my gambling activities but I don’t want shit happened in case I knew that I have funds to play. I will check this feature on my electrum wallet desktop version.

IActually I’m just asking if coinb.in is a legit website to do this stuff just to make sure my funds will safe after the time lock. Thanks for the detailed guide.I will close now this thread and update once I successfully create my time lock or if I encounter some problems along the way. Thanks to all",
