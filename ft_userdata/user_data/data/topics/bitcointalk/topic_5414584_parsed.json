I do try technical analysis but it's more like on a basis or something similar, I never set it as something that's going to happen as guaranteed but I also never put it past me to acknowledge the chances of it happening together with a bit of understanding about the results of fundamental analysis. That was in the past though, nowadays I just hodl and DCA, trying to read the market is stressful and most of the time of me trying to understand just makes me misunderstand it more.",

Unlike Fundamental analysis, this one is only good in the long-term, and Fundamental does not use MACD or RSI or any indicator that use for technical analysis. Binance already has an explanation for these two strategies I would suggest you read this \"Fundamental analysis (FA) vs. technical analysis (TA).Or if you are looking for more about these two analyses you can find more from this \"Awesome Crypto Trading\" it includes free tools, simulators, and guides.",

It’s not necessary to master them but atleast consider them in doing trades and to have basis on analysis. What important is that we know what decision to made when dealing in the market depending on the market situation as well in news and how it reacts in it’s previous charts.",

That is why the same technical method, the same knowledge, but the results and predictions of many investors are always different. Cant say they are completely useless because sometimes the past will repeat like we are expecting bitcoin to recover right after the halving, it has happened in the past as well. But don't over-trust it or abuse it completely. We know technical analysis, know fundamental analysis, and whales and sharks out there know too.",

Both fundamental and technical compliment each other and in the end they play out the same thing. All you have to do is to be attentive to details and follow your strategies to the later.Anything that happens in the fundamentals is always seen playing out in the chart. I can agree with you that Fundamental is the main analysis, but if you are not aware of the fundamental, with the movement of the chart, you will understand that something is happening and you will also understand to the extent it will happen because of the kind of movement that the chart is making. But only the knowledge of fundamental will not be able to tell you where the fundamental effect will end.",

Yes, but at least to me that is the correct way for them to evolve.",

If you will combine these two different analyses it could gather more accurate predictions of the market price. So there is no need to choose which one of them is the best because both are very useful in trading what you need. Some traders prefer to have more than one reference in analysis so that they can predict with have an accurate result.However, all of these are just a tool in trading, it always remains unpredictable on the side of the crypto market.",
