I sent a transaction, and after 24 hours it still says \"This payment has not been transmitted yet\" and I can't spend any of the amount I have (equivalent to $22.57).Sorry if the question was asked in the past.https://prnt.sc/f4Vrt8D193j2https://prnt.sc/lrDNcnE91pVVhttps://prnt.sc/71TYYQfKGGIbHow do I solve this?Thank you!",

Your screenshot shows about $1 (0.00003730BTC), which isn't worth the fee and the receiver can't even spend it. For small amounts, I use LN or even low-fee altcoins whenever possible.",

Depending on what you're paying for, you could suggest it. There's not really a point in \"earning\" a dollar worth of Bitcoin with current fees.Quotethe same thing about altcoins. Do you recommend any specific (valueble) altcoins for this?It doesn't really matter which one you use, as long as the service accepts it. Most accept at least a few different altcoins.

That way, your transactions will be more consistent and predictable. So, if you're looking for a reliable option with relatively low fees, Litecoin is definitely worth considering. Due to its popularity and established reputation, Litecoin is supported by a wide range of platforms, wallets, exchanges, and payment processors.",

So  both of you recommend Litecoin, I will still use bitcoin because I want to support the Bitcoin ecosystem but it's a thing to consider, thanks! I don't have anything against using Bitcoin for everyday transactions since that's its intended purpose. Personally, I rely on it for some of my regular payments. However, I make an effort to choose moments when the network congestion is low to avoid high fees. As you said, every bit counts, particularly when it comes to donations. And, as you experienced yourself, Bitcoin may not be the most ideal solution for small transactions. Unless, of course, you consider switching to Lightning Network transactions.",

Bitcoin Core's current estimate for a confirmation within 7 days is 15.943 sat/vbyte. That means, to be confirmed within a week, each legacy input adds at least 0.00002519BTC in fees when the receiver spends the money. So your dollar doesn't count, twothirds of it is lost by the receiver.Of course, it is possible for the receiver to keep low inputs and only consolidate them when fees are low again, but their wallet may not be that smart and I've seen many transactions that pay more in fees than some of the inputs are worth. So chances are your donation is lost entirely.",

Don't you think they should add Filecoin? Kidding, I don't know when they listed Filecoin there but I believe the donation part was something to do. Otherwise, there would be a few more popular altcoins there, at least I expect LTC everywhere.Edit- I just learned that both internet archive and Filecoin is working on the same goal almost.",
