      "body": "You should be able to use the seed phrase in Electrum[1] (on step #4 click Options and select BIP39 and then choose 'legacy' if asked about the address type)  and then export the private keys[2].I don't see why you would do that when the wallet is empty though. It's probably better if you just create another wallet.

      "body": "What is the exact name of your old wallet?If the seeds are BIP39 there is a tool that you can use to extract all private keys from your seeds check the link below.- https://iancoleman.io/bip39/It's simple to use just download the page first or download it on GitHub and then run it offline and then paste the 24 seed phrase into that tool then scroll down to the bottom to find all derived addresses and keys you can copy them or download it into CSV use the toggle button if you want to copy only private keys.The only problem when importing them into Bitcoin core there is no command where you can import them in bulk you will need to import them one by one using this command importprivkeyI heard there is a script to import the private keys in bulk but I can't find them maybe someone here still have this mass or bulk import tool.Edit: it seems that I found the script here check this https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5358855.msg57937910#msg57937910",

Correct me if I am wrong.Not sure how much time it took until services start to adopt it, but BIP39 was first introduced in 2013 as you can see here[1].It's also possible that they had their own way to generate them, like Blockchain.com back in the day but I doubt it, since there's nothing about that in their repository[2][1] https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki[2] https://github.com/greenaddress",

Based on the screenshot provided I think this is the wallet you are using : https://cryptoslate.com/products/greenaddress/And they do have 24 words seedphrase which will be supported on Electrum if I am not wrong.Anyway if you want to extract private keys for a particular address which is also possible though just select the address you want to extract the private keys and check out the keys and use it to import on Electrum or others.",

Based from your screenshot, it looks like Green wallet with \"2FA\" (Two-Factor-Authentication).Sadly, that type of wallet isn't recoverable through other wallets and all required private keys can't be extracted.That's because it's actually a MultiSig wallet and the other cosigner key is in their custody.I haven't used that 2013 version so I can't tell if there's a way to get access to the cosigner's key nor how their derive the correct keys.",
