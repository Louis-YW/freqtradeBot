So, it depends on what the cryptocurrencies did, bitcoin surely doesn't give a single care about that, in other words, it is completely against bitcoin's motive. There is absolutely no benefit for the bitcoin to be complied with.Its different whereas some other altcoins rely on the financial institution for their own project, in that scenario surely that will have some benefits for themselves.",

It describes a common platform for the development of messagesQuoteSome of the most impactful benefits of ISO 20022 adoption include: Increased interoperability by supporting non-Latin alphabetsMessages can be grouped based on data components from different payment methodsMessaging can be used for a wide array of purposes, including domestic payments, cross-border payments, high-value payments, ACH, and real-time payments. Increased data quality and automation will lead to easier fraud detection methods Less human actions and more automation could lead to increased accuracy You can also refer to this site[1]  for more information about ISO20022[1] https://supraoracles.com/academy/what-is-iso-20022-and-how-will-it-impact-the-crypto-industry/",

Since as stated if declared security it needs to secure a license from the authority to conduct and established a company.  Though Ripple denies that allegation.QuoteThe famous Ripple v/s SEC lawsuit started in late 2020 with a complaint from SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission), that Ripple has conducted illegal security offering from one of the XRP digital assets. SEC lawsuit claims that XRP is known as a security in the cryptocurrency market and is not a cryptocurrency",

TGCrypto is a place where promise is worth more than product.So if you want to invest in ISO20022 compliant projects to profit on their pump during ISO20022 hype train ... its much better to chose good projects that does not have that, but fallow every hype train we already had in crypto (defi, nft etc.). Pump on \"soon we will be ISO20022 compliant\" will be much bigger than actually being ISO20022 compliant from the very begining.Quote from: JeromeTash on July 09, 2022, 07:13:56 PM1. Ripple2.

Funny ripple is at the top list of ISO20022 complaints projects yet went through series of investigations of some shady stuff over the years. In as much as it is good to be security cautious regarding investment we can also agree that this has little or nothing to do with actual security of any project. But if this is going to be a thing i do want to see how it will help shape the crypto space for the better and eliminate fake projects growing rapidly.",

Ripple is one of them. The other is IOTA. There's a thread about IOTA's fraud in one of the boards in this forum. I just can't seem to locate it right now.To invest in one of the coins above, I would rather invest in Doge or even a joke token like SHIB",
