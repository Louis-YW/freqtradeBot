  "content": "cryptopost.com is a premium domain name with some cool backlinks. I purchased it on the Namecheap auction but never had time to add quality content and build traffic. I added an autopilot script that publish short articles with Youtube embeds, but that was supposed to be just temporarily until I build a real website with SEO articles.I paid $4050 for this domain on the Namecheap auction a couple of months ago and would sell it for $4500 now. I can show an invoice if needed.You can contact me via private message or email vamius@gmail.com",
