It’s already ended so no advertising. And we are collectors there’s many factors that could make something very collectible I’m trying to figure out if this could have one of the factors.",

Maybe I’m wrong, but so far all the Ordinals collections available don’t have any function other than looking pretty right? I wish the space would build something that did something. Community organizations that share proceeds with members have been around for more than a decade… That’s why this first round of tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain feel like nothing more than a grift to me, but I do have high hopes for the future when someone makes an inscription that does anything.",
