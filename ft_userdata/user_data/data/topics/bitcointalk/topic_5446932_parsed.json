  "content": "QuoteThe grue lurks in the darkest places of the earth. Its favorite diet is adventurers, but its insatiable appetite is tempered by its fear of light. No grue has ever been seen by the light of day, and few have survived its fearsome jaws to tell the tale. Interesting forum Factoid. I discover it on the forum ad space.A grue is a fictional, predatory creature but how it's related to Bitcoin and it's community?",

Some were chosen by VIPs/Donators according to theymos, so they could have no relationship to bitcoin, just an idea or idiosyncrasy they have.Quote from: theymos on March 21, 2018, 07:21:49 PMA few of them look like ads, or seem out of place - those are free factoids that Donators/VIPs get. Factoids are not normally supposed to look like ads....- A random forum user reading a random factoid should have a good chance of thinking that it was interesting, funny, or useful.I never knew about Greus, so it could pass off as interesting.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/adrotate.php?adinfo- Jay -",
