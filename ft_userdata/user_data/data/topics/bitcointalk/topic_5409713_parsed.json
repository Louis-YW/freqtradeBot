Making multiple copies of your passwords on paper make your password more vulnerable.If you can not memorize your password, then I'm sorry to say that it's not important to you.

You can have backups in case something bad happens (e.g., you lose your phone/computer, disaster, mental ailness, brain damage)I use Bitwarden and I periodically do backup maybe thrice a month. What I usually do is exporting the unencrypted .csv file and store it on a multiple flash drives in separate secure location while the master password and its associated backup email is written on a laminated paper to keep it from wear and tear. With that, you'll have no reason that you lose access to your PM.I also that you can backup your Keepass database both on online and on physical storeage though.Quote from: Yawa2020 on August 13, 2022, 09:31:52 AMMaking multiple copies of your passwords on paper make your password more vulnerable.Maybe I am missing something, but I surely don't understand why making multple copies isnt good LOL.",
