Auditing companies don't audit whitepaper or other aspects of the project and they are solely focused on the smart contract and nothing else so the fact that they are audited doesn't have to do anything with their plagiarized whitepaper.Quote from: Apocollapse on May 08, 2022, 12:59:48 PMThis raise a question how an audited project isn't work very well and anyone shouldn't only rely on the word \"audited\"While project being audited by a reputable auditing company is certainly better than its not, it certainly doesn't mean that project is legit, or even that is not possible to exploit smart contract. For example, one of the most well known audit companies Certik has its share of fails, where smart contracts they audited got eventually exploited. Just wanna add that even if smart contract doesn't have weakness, it still doesn't mean that project is not a scam as  there are multiple other ways to disappear with people's money.",

Then how do you explain that? we want to get valid information before investing, I hope you understand about that.and on the site we have:and you are saying that they say they are audited by the company Analytix Audit, something is not right in this story or I'm misunderstanding it. another thing is that they have 3700 members on their telegram channel, but strange that no one has asked any questions on their telegram channel, this is something very strange, has anyone here tried to ask questions about them on their telegram channel? about Plagiarism, this is something simply unacceptable, if they had the whole idea then they wouldn't need to plagiarize, when in a project there is plagiarism then the creators of the project are lazy and can be people who don't take the project seriously and that even can disappear with people's money",

Another interesting thing on that screenshot is that they claim to be audited by Certik very soon, while they already have their logo on their website, which is another red flag for me and it's a very well known tactic of a scammy project, to use the name of popular company like Certik to appear more legit.

      "body": "If I may add more red flag to the project --well, rather move the info here as this findings are also available on their ann thread linked on OP's opening post-- they claimed to be KYCed by an KYC service provider which I barely ever heard of --not that I ever followed any news of KYC, KYB, KYD, KYT, and other KYseries available on the net-- and the document issued to prove this certification is rather funny looking, which prompt me to look further. They're customer number 878 according to their certificate number, but the KYC company website itself is just one week old, a rather wonderful feast if they can check and certify 878 projecrs in one week. And more, the link to their certification page is non-specific like, for instance,Code:https://kycspy.com/index.php/kyc-report/878Orhttps://kycspy.com/index.php/kyc-report/EXISInstead, their full link is as follows:Code:https://kycspy.com/index.php/kyc-report/Which rather looks like the \"certification company\" is another dummy website of theirs to boost their \"credibility\" with no prior projects being certified before, only them.",

Gg.Audit companies are mostly after for the payment from their clients.They may even put in their disclaimer that they are just an audit company and they are not responsible if the company turned out to be scam.This is the sad part in any market, because for them it is all about business. And don't care about the companies that they are working with.As long as they can put a disclaimer and say they are not liable for any financial losses of the customers of their companies they are dealing with.For example, Certik made a name already so the investors have high regards on the projects they audited and used their logo.So people mostly forget to dig more about the project and its capabilities because they are trusting that the audit company already did their job.",

So far, you've been asked three times on your ann thread to provide a proof that you're really hired. And so fr you keep evading it. Repeatedly insisting that you're just hired --like the post you made on your thread, I quote below-- without giving any concrete proof is rather... not convincing enough. Something like a screenshot of your discussion with the \"team\" or a screenshot of your contract from Fiverr is simple to be provided in matter of seconds if it's real... unless the team is nonexistent and you need to photoshop the said screenshot from nothing. That'll take time.Quote from: JeffTannes9 on May 11, 2022, 05:42:06 AMMy duty was to post this topic here and thats what I was paid for.I don't know 0 about this topic and you should contact the devs which I posted above.",
