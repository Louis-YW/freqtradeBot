Rent prices were going insane in some of those, especially in the big cities.Here is one examplehttps://jam-news.net/how-the-war-in-ukraine-affects-the-real-estate-market-in-georgia/The gain temporarily helped prices of imported goods, then it was offset completely long term as demand boomed and so did the purchasing power thanks to the inflow.

There is a sharp growth curve now, but that cannot be simply credited to immigration of Russian citizens with the numerous factors such as tourism, agriculture, exports etc.This is now about the growth of GDP, it's about the currency pair, the economy of Switzerland didn't grow extraordinarily during the crisis but the franc still appreciated 20% versus the USD.You can look at both the three currencies mentioned and see the same bump happening at the start of the war:https://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=AMDhttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=GELhttps://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=KZTThen you can go and check some of the currencies of countries that were not involved but still had a good year, like Vietnam or any other Asian country, and see that the pattern is not there.Quote from: un_rank on February 01, 2023, 06:09:41 PMIn-order to draw a pattern here, there would need to be more information about the credentials of the Russian emigrants,I'm sure the FSB would love that!",

Most of the migrants to Russia doesn't hold Russian citizenship and therefore they are not covered by the draft and mobilization. Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are now facing an influx of mostly richer ethnic Russian immigrants from Russia. Anyway, most of the cities in these countries are dominated by ethnic Russians. Almaty used to be a Russian majority city, and even now they comprise around one-third of the population. Astana is still majority Russian.",

The exact opposite of the statistics you wrote is happening in Turkey. Real estate prices increased and it became impossible to own a house after the Russians came to Turkey. Rich Russians live in Antalya and Istanbul. The constant increase in house prices leads to an increase in inflation. Especially in the regions where Russians live there are incredible increases in food prices. While Turkey is struggling with high inflation, lowering interest rates and continuous irregular migration increase inflation even more.",

They are neither rich nor ethnically Russian. I have a slightly different information... According to the sources of information that I use, the majority of Russians who left for Kazakhstan are ethnic Russians (Slavs).  People who left for Kazakhstan, Georgia, Turkey and other countries in September 2022 are mostly young, energetic, mobile, educated and non-aggressive people.  Such people will benefit any country they move to.  Many Russians have now moved to Asian countries (Goa, Bali).  Many people really want to move there, but are busy caring for their elderly parents.  For Russia, the current events are a huge catastrophe - in fact, the old aggressive idiots are destroying the Russian youth (the future of the country).",

I've done it but haven't come across anything interesting, so I guess, as they say: \"no news is good news\". Maybe there simply aren't any drastic price increases.If you're truly interested in first-hand info, they have some local threads in \"Other languages/locations\" section.

A country like Armenia is very small, and if there is any massive exodus of people to it, it is certain that its economy will flourish, since it has been growing rapidly for years. Unfortunately, the Russians displaced from Russia to those countries are not rich because most of them have ethnic relatives in those countries.If the currency is stable and does not complain of inflation, the rise in prices is explained by the increase in demand, since the number of consumers has increased.",

They will go further, where there will be no influence of the Russian government at all and where the standard of living will be much higher. Those who do not have the opportunity to flee further flee to neighboring states. It seems to me that such refugees from Russia are more likely to create more problems for these countries than good.Of particular note is the political side of this Russian resettlement. Russia is attacking neighboring states, including now Ukraine, under the pretext of protecting the Russian-speaking population. The Kremlin has already threatened Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Georgia with war even recently. Therefore, it is better for these states to get rid of everything connected with Russia. They will be more wholesome.",

After Feb 2022, there are multiple sanctions and restrictions also on Russian individuals. If you're Russian and don't have any foreign citizenship, you might struggle to even get a tourist visa to any of the western countries, not to mention moving there permanently.According to visaguide Russian passport holders are no longer allowed to even enter Czechia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.And if you happen to somehow get allowed to stay in any of the developed countries, transferring your wealth from Russia to the west can pose a whole lot of problems.But with enough money, you can still live a pretty luxurious life even in countries considered to be poor.

I can talk long enough and talk about a lot, but this form clearly suggests a different format. I'll just say a couple of FACTS. At the same time, facts that concern not only Ukraine, because The communist / Kremlin regime is an evil on a really planetary scale,so. I will take the 20th century as a starting point. Although believe me - and before that there is something to talk about.It was the USSR that was the second hand that unleashed the Second World War. Together with Nazi Germany, the Stalinist USSR began to destroy Europe.1920-1950. Repressions of citizens of the USSR. Repression. Torture. Murder. Deportations of entire peoples. Documents were deliberately destroyed to cover up the crimes of the regime. According to various estimates, more than 5,000,000 million people were destroyed, More than 6,000,000 million were simply maimed both physically and morally ...1933 - Deliberately staged Holodomor - the genocide of the Ukrainian people. I will add that similar \"steps\" were taken against other peoples of the USSR, but the victims in Ukraine were the greatest. Destroyed (shootings, starving to death) about 7,000,000 ethnic Ukrainians. INTENTIONALLY!1939 - an attack from the east on Poland, which was defending itself from Nazi Germany, on the western front. Mass destruction of the meir population. The cynical shooting of captured Polish soldiers and officers, the destruction of the intelligentsia, and those dissatisfied with the invasion of the USSR.1939-1940 - Attack on Finland. Annexation of approximately 10% of the territories. Murder of civilians.1941-1945 - meat grinder with his recent friend and partner. Tens of millions of citizens of the USSR died. The main reason is the idiotic management of the army. \"Victory victories\" at the cost of millions of victims, which were the soldiers of the Red Army, who were thrown almost unarmed, wave after wave, against the German troops. Thoughtlessly, they threw meat on their citizens.1979-1989 - War in Afghanistan. More than 2,000,000 CIVILIANS destroyed by sadistic methods.1992 - Armed conflict in Moldova. Annexation and construction of a puppet pseudo-state of the PMR.1992-1997 The so-called \"Civil War in Tajikistan\". Provoked and supported by the Kremlin.1992-1993 War in the territory of the sovereign state of Georgia. Annexation and creation of a pseudo state of Abkhazia1994-1996 The first Chechen war Chechnya, Russia destroyed the Chechen people, because of their LEGAL decision to secede from the Russian Federation.1999 Dagestan war. Kremlin-instigated massacre in Dagestan.1999-2009 Second Chechen War Chechnya. Global destruction of the civilian population of Ichkeria. More than 300,000 inhabitants of the republic were killed.2008 Another provocation and attack on Georgia. Annexation of territories and the construction of pseudo-states South Ossetia.Victory2009-2017 destruction of people dissatisfied with the Kremlin authorities. In the republics of the North Caucasus2014 Application of Crimea. Then the annexation and the proclamation of pseudo-states of the PDR / LPR. Total destruction of Ukrainian cities and civilians.2022 is the beginning of a new wave of offensive, with the use of medium-range missiles against PEACEFUL cities and civilians. total destruction of Ukrainian cities, villages... Tens of thousands of civilians were destroyed, in an extremely sadistic way. Mass torture, violence, looting....Bottom line: the USSR / RF destroyed tens of millions of people. Hundreds of millions were made to suffer ... Both their own citizens and in other countries ...Is this childish thinking?PS About the \"Western-sponsored coup\" - are you telling me a direct participant? )))) I have to upset you - propaganda has destroyed your brain irreversibly!By the way, the events of 2013/2014 are called \"Revolution of Dignity\". We fought for our freedom, rights, dignity. Although these words are not familiar to you or they scare you Do you have anything new in your training manual except about Iraq and the \"Western-sponsored coup\"?",
