I have to start over because the full 600MiB has been wasted. I looked through the debug.log, but there were no discrepancies that would have indicated why the accident occurred. On Oracle VMWare, I am configuring this system with roughly 650 GB of disc space.I have 600MiB of cached data; is there a way I can flush it to disc and restart the download? It will also be useful to understand what is causing this issue?",

It is used to improve the syncing process the default value is 450 but you can increase it depending on your RAM sample you have 8 GB you can set the dbcache to 4 GB or 4096mb.If you notice that dbcache is changing as you said it goes down would you mind trying to edit your bitcoin.conf file and add this \"dbcache=4096\" Don't forget to edit the 4096 as I said it depends on your RAM memory.",

And then it goes down.I have to start over because the full 600MiB has been wasted.Are you perhaps talking about \"prune block storage\" size?Because losing cached data wont be much of an issue and wont cause your node to restart IBD unless the actual data written on disk were corrupted.Or is it the cached data of your VMWare?In that case, it's more of a Virtual Machine specific issue than Bitcoin Core.Quote from: Egii Nna on August 18, 2023, 08:54:19 PMI looked through the debug.log, but there were no discrepancies that would have indicated why the accident occurred.Can you share your logs?You can paste the latest session inside [code][/code] tags,just remove the unnecessary repeating lines (e.g. \"new tip\") and those that you think are private info (e.g. PC Username).",
