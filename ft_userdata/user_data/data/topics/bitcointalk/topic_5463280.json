  "content": "What happened:  Earlier today, I put in a deposit on the Whirlwind.money mixing service. After the transaction got the required number of confirmations, I requested for a withdrawal from my note to a wallet address with a 0-hour delay. However, it's been 10 hours now, and the transaction hasn't been processed or shown up on the blockchain. There wasn't any warning or indication of the service being down, and I just realized later that there were issues. It turns out other members were also in the same boat, waiting for their money.Profile Link: whirlwindmoney[edit] Type 3 Flag: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;flag=3197Reference Link: [ANN] Whirlwind.money | ⚡No Fee⚡ | Ultimate Privacy | Anonymity Mining 12% APR🔥Website Link: https://whirlwind.money/Amount Claimed: 0.004 BTCPayment Method: bitcoinProof of Payment: here's all the evidenceAdditional Notes: Based on information shared by some members in the ANN thread, it appears that whirlwind hasn't been handling any withdrawals since August 9th (which is almost 5 full days as of the time of writing). Quote from: sam00 on August 12, 2023, 06:49:54 PMQuote from: fillippone on August 12, 2023, 11:25:02 AMPlease update us on this.This sounds extremely weird. You do still see the satoshi's in your note, don't you?No, the Note balance has updatet but there has been no transaction so far. Something seems stuck.Quote from: TryNinja on August 12, 2023, 11:31:54 AMMy last withdrawal was on the 9th, got the coins.Looking at an explorer, the last outgoing transactions were made on that date: https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/bc1qf8h5k6sash8007vpesymxkw2xsg5d0r3j4l5vmcrwpz2pqu66fjstzgd3rThank you for that information! As I made my withdrawal on the 11th, I guess that something is stuck :/Quote from: Rikafip on August 14, 2023, 05:31:53 AMI made a withdrawal of 0.025 BTC yesterday afternoon (like you with 0 hours delay) and so far nothing. Did you get the money, or email reply yet? And there are a few other issues as well. LoyceV summarized it nicely:Quote from: LoyceV on August 14, 2023, 08:33:25 AMSo, to summarize (and correct me if I got anything wrong):The website isn't profitable (yet)Deposits are workingThe website claims to pay a very high 12% APR on depositsThe daily awards aren't always being addedWithdrawals stopped working 5 days agoThe signature campaign payments happen off-chain and thus can't be withdrawn nowUser whirlwindmoney hasn't been here for more than a monthSupport doesn't respond to inquiriesNo matter what the reason is, this looks bad.This isn't a scam accusation (at least not yet), but a heads-up for the community. Taking everything into account, I believe it's in everyone's best interest to hold off on using the service for the time being. It would be wise to wait until we get some feedback from their representatives and the service gets back on track. I'll keep this thread updated as the situation progresses.",

Any issue regarding payment should be solved In 72 hours, if they delay then \"something is Fishy\". You done a great job by posting it here so until this problem not solve , no one should try Whirlwind service.Why not whirlwind team make deposit and withdraw decentralized if possible to make their service more smooth. I think if they release all payment now but still there will be doubt in every mixer user to use it especially when amount is big.",

I'll keep this thread updated as the situation progresses.It's good that you posted this thread to draw the community's attention to Whirlwind's mysterious events. So far, they haven't responded to emails sent to reassure their customers about concerns highlighted by members and withdrawals that haven't been processed and completed yet. The other thing is that Hhampuz has put their signature campaign on \"HOLD.\" I agree with him in his remarks regarding that no one should deposit his currencies or use their services, such as generating a note or withdrawing and the like, until things become apparent in the coming days; I hope that they will respond to their emails as soon as possible, or that their representative on the forum, whose last activity was July 04, 2023, will attend to update the topic of the announcement and reassure and calm the users of the mixer. The whirlwind team has paid a lot and done a lot to promote their platform. Their services have been running smoothly for a long time. I hope that things return to normal again.",

I've been assured that nothing has been lost and that all will be taken care of tomorrow meaning all currently pending withdraws will be processed and things return back to normal. It was an unfortunate situation is all!I've asked my contact at whirlwind to reply in this thread whenever they can with further details, so from now until then/tomorrow night there is no need to panic even if I wouldn't recommend you to deposit until the backlog is cleared.
