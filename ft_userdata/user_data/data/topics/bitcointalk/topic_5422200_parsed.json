Unless you contacted telegram devs/support[1] and request to change things for you or make an offer.[1] https://telegram.org/supportGreat that he follow your command but there is still a problem here. He is now using bold text in his sentence. You ask why red is always associated in China? Well, I guess that is because the colour of their flag is also red . I think this dice emoji is bad to use for betting because like you said it is centralized so there is no way to win on it.Contacting the telegram dev, and bribing them money only to make the game in favour with us sounds ridiculous and I don't think telegram devs are that corrupt to agree with that conditions. I bet that they are already making enough money but in a more fairer way so there is no need for them to risk their reputation here.",
