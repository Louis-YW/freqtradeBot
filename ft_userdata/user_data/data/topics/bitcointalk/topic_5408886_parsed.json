      "body": "There’s plenty of ways and methods to earn from freebitco.in such as participating in daily jackpot, you need a big amount of bitcoin and you start wagering and playing on their multiply btc  gamble game you can win up to 0.1 btc daily if you can take the first place in wagering. The second choice is betting on sports and events which you can make a nice profit if you doing it well, there’s also weekly lottery which is simple and need a lot of luck.Otherwise i don’t recommend you play that much on multiply game or depending on it i have been a user of this site and had much experience with it there’s no effective method to make consecutive profits of it.",

      "body": "I've been on FreeBitco.in since 2013 and have been gambling for almost 20 years.Here's some advice.Gambling is a bad investment long term. You will lose in the long run. If the house edge is 5% then you will lose 5% of all your bets (on average) over 10,000 bets.It would be better to hold over 0.0003 BTC balance and earn a steady 4.08% annual return.You can also stake Fun Tokens to earn interest and get free spins. Free spins will earn you rewards points, lottery tickets, satoshis and more.I would change the settings to get Rewards points instead of lottery tickets. 1 Reward point is worth 1 Satoshi.Don't buy lottery tickets, don't buy raffle tickets. Try to win them on free spins. Just save your earnings and let it compound.If you want to test your luck, here are my favorite stategies (YOU STILL CAN'T BEAT THE HOUSE EDGE):1st Method (Auto-roll)- Set base bet to 0.00000005- Bet Odds to 1.91- Bet on Alternate- On Win Return to Base Bet- On Lose Increase Bet to 220%For starting balance can be anything but I recommend at least 30,000 satoshis.This is a modified Martingale strategy that increases bet on a loss until you win. If you have unlimited funds you will never lose. But eventually you could lose 10x or 20x in a row and bust out.Only gamble with small amount. If you have a large balance, then withdraw temporarily or set a Loss Limit.2nd Method (Auto-Roll for Jackpot plus earn lots of points)- You can play for any Jackpot, I like going for 13 Sat to win 0.001- Set Base bet to 0.00000200- Bet Odds to 1.12- On Win return to Base Bet- On Lose return to Base BetYou will steady lose satoshis with this method, but you will get a lot of chances to win the Jackpot and generate a lot of rewards points. Also will get Lambo tickets after betting 0.005 total.I like to set an amount like 20,000 satoshis. and just generate points and tickets. If I lose it all it's ok, I've won the Jackpot probably 5 times. It's a 1 in 10,000 to win.3rd Method (Get lucky, a little into a lot)If I have less than 30,000 satoshis for a withdrawal and I want to try in win big, this is a decent bet.Say you have 20,000 satoshis. Go to Manual BetClick Max on Bet Amount then click the /2 (Half) button 3 times.This will leave you with:- 8 bets of 0.00002500- Set Bet Odds to 30 (Win chance of 3.17%)- That gives you a better than 25% chance to win 0.00072425 BTC.Like I said, gambling is a bad investment. It is for entertainment purposes only. It would be better to invest your Crypto, by staking or earning interest.No matter what, the House Edge will average out. You can only get lucky in the short term.Hope that helps, Good luck!",

I’m now trying this simple basic method of auto betting but all you need is a big amount of bitcoin, the more bitcoin you have the more chances of this strategy to keep going. This is my settings on auto betBASE BET 1 satoshiNO. OF ROLLS Make it more than 10kON LOSE INCREASE BET BY 100%That’s all you need to change and let it start. You can make 0.0001 daily This is a quick test on less than 5 minutes",
