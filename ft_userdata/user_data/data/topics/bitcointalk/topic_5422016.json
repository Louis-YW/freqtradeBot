  "content": "If there is anything good after what has happened recently is that it seems like people are slowly realizing that centralized exchanges and other platforms are not the place to keep your crypto, hence the drastic increase in the hardware wallet sales. Its still long way to go though. but it is a good news nevertheless and who knows, maybe this won't be forgotten (like in the past) and people keep with the habit of keeping their bitcoin by themselves.Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/trezor-reports-300-surge-in-sales-revenue-due-to-ftx-contagionA major hardware wallet provider, Trezor, has recorded a major uptick in wallet sales in the aftermath of the FTX contagion, the firm’s brand ambassador Josef Tetek told Cointelegraph on Nov. 15.Trezor saw its sales revenue surge 300% week-on-week and it’s still growing, Tetek reported, adding that the current sales are higher than a year ago when Bitcoin reached its all-time highs at $68,000. Trezor has also recorded a significant spike in its website traffic, which increased 350% over the same period, the exec noted.According to Tetek, Trezor is quite certain that the uptick in new wallet users was a result of issues with FTX, a crypto exchange at the center of the latest industry scandal involving the misappropriation of user funds. The spike in demand for Trezor wallets started early last week, exactly when “rumors of the FTX insolvency started circulating,” Tetek reported.",

People realize to get out of exchanges. Many users probably are just installing wallets and saving private keys on paper so if the Trezor is just available in local tech stores a lot of us are probably buying also.",

It's just a business like any other and it is important to produce and sell as much as possible and make as much profit as possible.

      "body": "I'm not at all surprised that the collapse of FTX boosted HW device sales. 300% is still not that much, let's see how sales of hardware wallets turn out next week when Black Friday starts. Trezor has already announced upcoming discounts, which means that there may be even more people who want to buy a HW. How well everything is going well for the hardware wallet manufacturers, the demand for devices of which has so suddenly grown. One FTX fiasco leads to so many changes in the entire industry. Trust in centralized exchanges has been lost and it looks like the end of an era (or is it?). Users will now count on themselves and store crypto in their wallets, like trezor. How long will this last and how quickly will the FTX incident be forgotten?",

Hell, even a decent wallet where you keep your money ID/bank cards etc is not much cheaper, if any.

In the end, who cares about 15-20 dollars more or less if you plan to store thousands of dollars worth of crypto. As a matter of fact, I bought mine when I had only few hundreds of dollars crypto left as I lost 90% of my bitcoin due phishing.

They do not sell the cheapest model anymore, Ledger Nano S (49.99), only the Plus version for 79 usd (whcih is basically the same with more memory for shitcoins)But it's not like they raised the price now, €79 was for sure the price back in at the begging of the year when I ordered one, everything is getting more expensive if they raised the price by 10$?? it's a bit understandable.That being said I would advise everyone to get one now, not just for the security but with the avalanche of orders nobody expected they might not only rise the price but also run out of them for a month or so till they order more as I don't think they keep tens of thousands in stock.  Also, don't forget to order it with a different phone and a different address than your own, the nano might keep your coins safe, but ledger (the company) is not that safe with your personal data  But this is really good news, it means at least some have realized the danger, even if just a few hundreds as we don't know what 300% might be, 60 more sales or 6000, it still means fewer victims when the next collapse will happen, and unfortunately, it will, just like earthquakes, everyone knows one will happen sooner or alter but almost everyone is caught by surprise when it does!",

Not a honest one, clearly. It attracts, because people's greed is bigger than their brain and it pays (from the poor souls' money).Promoting shitcoins... some many promoters are getting scammed, some few may get paid, but for every one disappointed and leaving the business, 10 others come filled with hopium.Just look at the shitcoin bounties, no matter if they're targeting bitcointalk or the social media platforms.On the other hand, honest businesses don't have unlimited money for advertising (although I would love to see Trezor signature campaigns here, for example) and since they don't have the possibility of doing scam-rinse-repeat cycles like the shitcoins, their visibility is limited.On bitcointalk some try to tell the correct ways, but really, the vast majority don't care to read, just jump in for the promises the shitcoins bring.",
