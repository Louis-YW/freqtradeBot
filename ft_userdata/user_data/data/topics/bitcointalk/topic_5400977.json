The senders address is unavailable. Thankyou",

      "body": "It is not possible to search by wallet balance from a block explorer because the secret nature of derived public keys prevents their addresses from being linked together. The best you can do is search the individual wallet addresses respectively [for a wallet.dat with lost password for example, the public keys can still be accessed directly from the file using tools such as pywallet as they are stored unencrypted]. It's easier if you made transactions from these addresses because you can just look at the payment histories of the various services you paid for.",

It's not possible Blockchair to specify that a receiving address must be unused. The best way of narrowing it down from here would be for OP to know how many inputs and outputs were in the transaction.",
