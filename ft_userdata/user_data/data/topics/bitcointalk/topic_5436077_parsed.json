Not sure how many reputable casinos around here send bonuses to inactive accounts to see if they can make them gamble, though.",

Or maybe you think just by leaving the account after registering, there should be a bonus? Did I understand it right? About the bonus though, yes there is but don't always expect that. You really need to make some deposits to get started. Aside from that, always keep in mind that bonuses always come and are associated with certain terms, and expect that you will really need to spend money in your own pocket to be eligible.",

Register, leave, and wait for the mail with an injected deposit bonus when you log in again. Like a \"welcome back\" bonus. But just like you said, there will always be that injected TOA before you can claim it. Either reach a certain wager amount or deposit a huge amount to receive it. This doesn't really work out well as gamblers think it is an instant reward. Then, you can see them reaching out to Customer Support without knowing they forgot to read the whole details of the mail.",

Those \"shopping\" and \"airlines\" gives you discounts and vouchers, but you will have to make a minimum purchase to be eligible for those offers. At least most of them works like this. Casinos will also give you some conditions such as making a certain amount of deposit before being able to claim the bonus, and if you want to withdraw the bonus, you will have to meet a certain rollover requirements. They won't give away anything for free. If they did, people would be creating multiple account, leave it and wait for the bonuses to arrive. They would abuse the system!",

But this at least they know you'll bet unlike just registering. It's all marketing that makes the business run. They do different kinds of giveaways, like claiming so you have to be active first before you can claim like with faucets.",

In my experience, I had better bonuses with old casinos that I used to regularly play on back then so you still have to spend some money since not all casinos are that generous and would give out good bonuses to all registered players.",

Naturally, I reckon said bonuses should be locked under certain conditions, like depositing x amount before being able to use y amount of spins for z games. It's good yea, but if you weren't originally a big gambler I don't think said bonuses would even be that attractive, after all, it's locked behind depositing money. It's the usual marketing stuff, heck even outside of casinos, just other mmo games would give out bonuses for returning players most of the time.",

It's actually an investment. They need to spend a little for their bait, make it a little more attractive. When you get back, you will be spending more than you receive. But don't expect these baits to not have a catch. They're really not free of certain conditions. If they are, they don't amount to something.",

But it's not just for entire new accounts that have been abandoned for good. There will be certain rules and exemptions for it. So, if you've been gambling for that casino and you've wagered a lot, there's probably a better treatment than of those that are wholly new registers that haven't deposited any amount. And in good faith as they miss your visit for a long time, they'll give you some bonus that will force you to be back again on them and spend it.",

Though having this kind of casino is really taking care of existing gambler and also they are making them feel thay they are important.

So it may be a good policy to open an account on a gambling site, gamble for a few days, then leave the site and wait for the bonus.  It might work",
