      "body": "I remember a documentary about South Korea that showed that many young people in that country really see cryptocurrencies as their only way out, considering that it is very difficult to succeed in a society that is extremely competitive when it comes to the labor market. There are even some crazy norms regarding appearance, so young people go for various aesthetic operations in order to get a job more easily.This idea makes sense to me, because if the population is getting older, the only way to change that is to encourage demographic policy in the form of incentives for having children, but in Busan they obviously don't have time for that and are looking for \"children\" who are already grown up and can contribute to society. The only thing that is bad in this whole story is the fact that such crypto hubs attract various suspicious projects that result in a lot of nice promises, and end up with a lot of disappointment (for investors, of course).I just hope they don't invite Mr. Kwon if he ever comes back from exile, because he's just bad for business.",

But focusing on other industries will seal the deal. Also as Crwth mentioned, providing financial incentives for the family planning related things will also have a long lasting effect. The major reason why young people are afraid of having babies, is the financial burden that comes afterwards. If this can be bridged along with job security, could counter the issue in Busan.",

Does this seem reasonable at all?The problem of population aging can be dealt with by other means, including the encouragement of childbearing and the relative abandonment of birth control policies. Of course, there are more effective methods that I am not an expert to mention or even care about.South Korea is one of the most developed emerging economies, and the crypto field is able to open the door for more investments. But not the field of crypto alone, but all other technologies such as artificial intelligence and robots.",

The aging population is the effect of birth control policies that have even made the younger generation not interested in having children. One of the easiest way of attracting youths to this area is through flexible immigration policies. Trying to attract only young South Koreans might not bring the expected result because they prefer living in Seoul which has better facilities than Busan. But opening doors to crypto experts from other parts of the world would help speedup the process of rejuvenating the population of Busan. Most youths from other countries would be very comfortable in Sasun because it definitely has better opportunities than their home country.",

Will Busan focus on crypto or will their interest move to AI instead?It doesn't feel like people over 65 years at 17.5% is an unreasonable or especially high amount, that seems quite normal in fact. Not every city can be some variation of a tech hub and having an older work force makes them less suitable to draw in younger talent. There are likely better ideas out there, but then again they could really push the ability to work from home, so as long as the areas and housing properties are suitable for a young audience then it could draw them in. Low prices, availability, good connectivity and nearby attractions will be the main drivers for this connected audience. Hong Kong doesn't have a chance to be anything now it has returned to Chinese hands and all trust in it as a banking hub has evaporated now the CCCP are in charge.",

It will definitely be productive to make a crypto hub in another city to attract young people and make city stronger. Simultaneously, this hub shouldn't be locked inside the country, they should make international projects with English language as a default. But that's not the only solution. This fact just reminded me that Japan has aging population problem too. Asian countries make it hard for foreigners to settle in the country. Sometimes migration is a key to fight aging population too but I'm against migrating violent and unskilled people, they should simplify the process for good young people who are interested in their culture and would love to live and work in their country.Quote from: Lucius on February 14, 2023, 03:58:40 PMI remember a documentary about South Korea that showed that many young people in that country really see cryptocurrencies as their only way outIn what way did South Koreans think that cryptocurrencies are their only way out?",
