  "content": "Hello Guys! am excited to share my btc buy story with you today Okay, so I have been planning to change my old laptop for quite some time now (HP Folio 9470m - 4g ram, core i3 4th gen, 500g) which has served me well to be honest, am a light user so the spec was ok for my everyday office use. But I needed an upgrade and I was thinking of something mid-range and durable with a decent battery plus I need to change the brand so I did a little search and decided to go for Dell Latitude 7480 (corei7 7th gen, 8g ram, 256 ssd). I made plans to go hunting for one (pre-owned not brand new) and suddenly i thought, what about haunting the tech market in my local and see who among the traders has knowledge about btc and who will be willing to sell for BTC! the thought was appealing so I head downtown to haunt for a btc seller.Arriving at a section of the market where pre-owned gadgets are mostly sold, some sellers approach me and i told them am looking to buy a dell which they all have and i now said i am only paying in btc and they suddenly stop trying to get my attention, some of them said that \"online money the government has banned\"? nobody will sell for btc in this market, the rest ask what is btc? so i tried to explain just a bit to those who have not heard about btc what btc is but i was unsuccessful to convince them to accept btc. it is either fiat or nothing.I move to another section, ask a couple of them, still the same result then i saw a young guy across on the other side of the section and i approach him, told him what i want he hesitated for a while and so i ask if he is into crypto he said yes i smiled and knew i had to convince him, he said he has an account with Binance, owns some dogecoin because that's what his friend who introduces him to crypto bought for him.... was like really? lol.  I told him this is his opportunity to truly own the number one coin, I told him what he stands to gain if he sells for btc and held that btc in a couple of years. I gave instances of btc price history from previous years,  at the end of our little chit-chat, my guy was ready to get down to business.  We agreed on a price of $300 equivalent to my local currency. The transaction was pretty straightforward, i did a quick transfer of $300 BTC worth to his binance acct and within minutes he received notification of payment and the deal was sealed.He said he was actually thinking of buying a few btc but he has never used the binance p2p and he is not sure how to go about it, I showed him it was very easy, I did a quick p2p sale from my account and showed him all the process, he was really happy i could see his excitement because now he can buy on his own without relying on his friend to help him. I was glad to make my first physical buy with BTC and most of all impact more knowledge to a fellow crypto enthusiast, we shared contact and i promise to help him whenever he finds something unclear in his crypto journey.    And so i left with a smile on my face and my little companion               I have been using it for more than a week now and everything works great so far.",

If i was in their shoes, I will exercise some skepticism as well if someone walks up to me offering to give me bitcoins for my goods. Also you have to understand that some are there to stack up money to be able to continue business, anything that is not cash seems a difficult process for them. You were lucky to have found someone to accept your bitcoins, but for ease next time only approach a vendor that clearly puts out a notice that they accept bitcoins if your intentions is to pay in bitcoins. Don't go around offering to pay for goods with crypto, it seems dubious.",

      "body": "It's sad that those sellers were treating bitcoin like it's some kind of dirty money. With online marketplaces it's always fine when you accept all their terms, but when you say \"but I want this\" the problems begin. They usually bail or don't want to accept it, or think like you're planning some sort of scam, even if it's some kind of little thing. I remember when we went to buy a car and we sat down and told the seller that everything's fine, but we want to pay half in a bank transfer and half in cash. It was nothing really, should be no issue whatsoever, but I remember the man and his wife exchange looks like \"What do you think? Are they planning some scam? Any red flags?\" People can act too suspicious sometimes when it comes to money.Anyway, congratulations on your purchase, may it work well and as long as you need it to.",

Several people shared how they bought motor, cars or other physical goods using bitcoin and the bottom line is that you have supported bitcoin as a means of payment.So maybe it's good to ask, do any of you also buy lambo with bitcoin? Certainly not impossible isn't it.I currently have plans to buy my first motorcycle using bitcoin, I hope it will become a reality early next year. But somehow I don't think I should announce it on the forum even though it's a good thing to say. OP congrats to you for successfully buying that laptop with bitcoin, I have the right to respect you.",

It can go unnoticed out of habit, which is why I pointed it out to the OP.But I think that the owner also might not be interested in leaving his history and completely formatting the entire disk.You're right.",

It seems to me that there is nothing wrong with this, and in the end, he was \"ripe\" for his first bitcoin purchase. I congratulate him on that. Nice story that I enjoyed reading. But I was a little upset, as it was seen in this story, that there are still a lot of people who are still not ready and not willing to accept bitcoin as a means of payment even after so many years of existence of it and the heights that it has reached. Let's hope that over time there will be more people on the marketplace willing to buy and sell for btc. To be honest, I foresee the inevitability of this.",

Imagine, then bitcoin will be used just casually and then government will need to rethink about the crypto space for sure. Alongside usage of bitcoin with fiat currency could be best combination ever; atleast for the crypto lovers such as us. Hope so we see some more stories like this in the coming days. I will add up mine too once I do. Im only backing off due to crazy 30% flat taxes on the transactions.",

I want to add that I would also reflash the BIOS, since theoretically, the former owner of the laptop can leave a malicious application here. Instead of formatting the drive, you can completely replace the drive with a new one, and use the old one for less sensitive things like interacting with bitcoin.",

Although the gap is still very wide i think we will get there slowly and steadily. Now i can truly say i have bought an item with btc and i understand the feely very well.",
