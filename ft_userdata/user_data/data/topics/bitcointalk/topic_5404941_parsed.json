For July I am even more confident that a bounce will definitely happen this month, although if I stick to my past predictions, there will be a bigger drop in July.",

Unfortunately, I don't have a chart to show to support my prediction, that is how my faith in BTC worked and I believed in it.Probably the FUD was still there even though we know whales are starting buying now like in El Salvador.

If we assume that history repeat itself then the year 2023 can be referred to year 2019 of the previous cycle.  It goes down by 80% so by the year 2023 it is possible that BTC will go down to $14k.  So yes, according to the graph (but I already voted no before I read the OP.)",
