I see that you're throwing the Bitcoin casino terminology quite religiously. Does this mean that you're exclusively looking after bitcoin casinos and other casinos that offer cryptocurrencies aren't included or am I being stupid right now lmao. The site's well made as well which is something that I gotta give you props for, but at the same time and I would like for you to take it as a compliment, make it look more streamlined and intuitive with user-friendly interfaces to make the site more pleasing to the eyes and more accessible, cause as it stands today there's some parts of it that are completely barren in terms of designs and while I love how the site looks, a lot of people may not share the same opinion as me. Anywho, love what you're trying to do here, appreciate it. Hoping for your success kind sir!",

Anywho, love what you're trying to do here, appreciate it. Hoping for your success kind sir!Hi Casdinyard, thank you for taking the time and checking our thread and website. I greatly appreciate your feedback and we will definetly look into the areas you mentioned, the design is clearly something we have to work on and we hope to accomplish improvements there in the near future. While we are mainly targeting BTC technology based platforms at the moment, we're also strong believers in many other crypto technologies within the gaming realm so we will try to expand more info for such platforms as well in the future. Again, thank you so much for your kind feedback",
