Every dip is an opportunity..this (november) ATH is not the ultimate ATH of this 4year cycle, the true ATH of this cycle will hit in 2025. and a dip correction before end of 2024 wont be a 'bear season' but simple a minor dip/correction(some could call it a cub(baby bear))the true bear/ correction will be after the 2025 ATH.. so a dip/correction before end of 2024 wont be a \"bear\", just a dip/cubspeculation is that value-bottom is still swinging around $60k and that 'could be' tested before year end, and before the start of the real ATH in 2025",

Every dip is an opportunity..The current decline in bitcoin prices was not planned, I think this is purely a market movement responding to negative news in the past few days, and as a result the price of bitcoin has been corrected quite deeply due to many investors who are worried that their assets will be eroded further.However, there is no need to panic too much, because bitcoin price correction is a normal thing, especially before a bull run, usually bitcoin will be corrected several times, until then it bounces back. Currently, Bitcoin seems to be looking for momentum before going into a bull run, and old investors already understand conditions like this.",

They will discourage their followers in buying Bitcoin and they will try to create a negative impression about Bitcoin. The whole objective of these guys buying Bitcoin is to make quick money through it. That kind of mind set about Bitcoin makes them vulnerable and that is why they sometimes ask such questions. This clearly shows how insecure they are about Bitcoin, since the world or those surrounding them have invested or made profit through Bitcoin they follow them without understanding the concept.",

Bitcoin always follow the same pattern for the last 3 cycle, before Bitcoin hit $99K, Bitcoin price already rise to $70K and it was happen before Trump won the election. It's happened in October, where it follow the same pattern where Bitcoin bull season start from Q4.",

Big or small correction, plummet or not, Bitcoin recovered from past corrections, plummets and it has made new all time highs with new halvings and market cycles. It's enough for me to ignore short term corrections.This means a lot to counter it.See a note on price increases with past corrections.",

While that's a good question and probably asking it for his own composture to the market and how he should decide, it's just so happen that the Kraken X account manager is active. It's possible that we might see a plummet once Bitcoin reaches $100k but that's another story. The majority is talking about breaking new barriers once Bitcoin tops again and able to reach that as it opens another idea on how high it will be for the next year to come.",

      "body": "Of course bitcoin will have a significant pullback once at or near 100K. It can't just keep going up forever without any kind of correction.That is how the stock market and how financial markets work, and bitcoin tends to correlate strongly with the stock market. When Apple and Amazon hit $10, they both had a large short term correction. At $100, both had another large correction, and so on. Why? Because those price levels tend to be strong psychological resistance levels. Same thing goes with every other successful company in the Fortune 500. It's not exclusive to bitcoin. But some people are too dumb to understand that's how any financial market normally functions. Prices go up and down, they don't go up forever, or go down forever in a perfectly straight line.MKBHD should stick to talking about iPhones and Teslas, because he clearly has zero clue about financial matters.Even when proven wrong time and again, he keeps spewing the same mindless talking points.MKBHD is like the black version of Peter Schiff who has been saying for years bitcoin is worthless and will go to zero.  Like the Inverse Kramer effect, every time they open their mouth about it you know it is a good time to buy!",

It was his first contribute to society and something for his fans yet he decided to milk them off it.I just gave that context because remember that saga and his sceptical approach to Bitcoin, I wouldn't say I'm surprised. In all fairness, it would mean that he doesn't have bag of bitcoin. Probably regrets and wants to fud it to get a lower price to bid.",
