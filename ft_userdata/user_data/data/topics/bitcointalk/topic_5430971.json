  "content": "Hi to everybody.I bought a Radeon RX Vega 64 8 GB and yesterday I tried to install on mining rig. I must point out that until yesterday 3 RX 580 Sapphire Nitro and 1 Nvidia 1660 TI cards were installed. I removed all the cards and tried to install the VEGA 64, but the system does not see it.Motherboard is B250 Mining Board BTC 12GPU Where I was wrong? What do I have to do to make the system to see the card?Thanks a lot",

Other PC, just like B250, haven't got any PCIe x16 slot, so I have to use riser. My risers aren't 010S version, but why do you advise this version?Should I change any setting on motherboard BIOS?thanks a lot",

You don't need a PC but a motherboard, processor, memory and power supply, + any 64 GB SSD. You can buy it very cheap on AM3 socket architecture.If I buy a used video card, then I disassemble it, change the thermal paste and thermal pads as necessary, clean it from dust, test it and then install it in the mining farm.Even if you bought a video card with verification, it may be damaged during transportation.",

Video cards 56 and 64 RX vega have difficulties with overclocking settings and usually the vega 56 video card was flashed with bios from vega 64 to get a larger hashrate, but there were no big problems with these video cards. You won't get that experience with Nvidia",

Most likely it will run again, goodluck",
