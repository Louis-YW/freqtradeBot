  "content": "It is not a new news in the cypto space that country's governments ban the use of crypto currencies in their various countries for their various reasons. every country has their reasons of banning it. But I understand it as a personal interest, because the demand is very high from the citizens, mostly the youths of these countries are very much interested to use cypto currencies but the government is restricting them to explore it. The governments only cure about themselves not the citizens. What the citizens need Â is not what they (the governments) need, if not, I did not see any tangible reason from any government to stop the citizens of using cypto currency (mostly bitcon) which has no harm to humanity.Countries that ban bitcoinThese are some of the countries that ban the use of bitcoin in their regions: Algeria, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Colombia, China, Egypt, Indonesia, India, Iraq, Iran, Kosovo, Nepal, North Macedonia, Russia, Qatar, Oman, Morocco, Turkey, Tunisia, Vietnam, Nigeria The reasons of the bansThe followings are some of the major factors of the ban:Economic FactorPolitical factorLack of Regulation factorClimate factorCriminal factorprevention factorEconomic Factor: El Salvador adopts bitcoin to expand its economy but accepted as a legal tender, it was only few citizens used it for daily business transaction, so, IMF, gave a warning that there is risk of countries that accepting bitcoin to be used in their countries because bitcoin is not a stable currency (coin). Though, many countries banned it before El Salvador adopted it but the prediction was there. And also, Bitcoin is a visual currency that not everybody will have access to it.Political factor: Citizens, mostly the youths in the world undermine the states authorities because of bitcoin. Really most countries do not provide jobs for the teaming youths in their countries so when bitcoin came, they abandoned the government with its activities and focus on bitcoin.Lack of Regulation factor: We are all aware that bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency which is out of government control, so with that they have to stop it coming to their countries.Climate factor: Bitcoin uses network and network is not reliable because if the climate is bad or there is is conflict between countries, it will affect the transactions process. Criminal factor: Since bitcoin is an online currency, criminals will use it to defraud users onlinePrevention factor: It is to prevent what has been happening in the globe. such as: MMM and other penzi scheme likes.https://www.lawyer-monthly.com/2022/01/crypto-crisis-why-are-countries-banning-virtual-currencies/https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/04/27/bitcoin-ban-these-are-the-countries-where-crypto-is-restricted-or-illegal2Conclusively, authorities do not concern the welfare of their citizens but for their personal interest. Government is selfish and self-centered. Government is to create enabling environment for the citizens to do business. The question is. Where is the enabling environment?",

And I think for now it's still the same because in some other news that I read on liputan6.com it also mentions that there are several crypto exchanges that have officially become sponsors of the Qatar world cup.And a little quote that I read on the cnbcindonesia.com website says that \"Bitcoin exchanges have been opened in several Muslim countries. BitOasis is the first virtual wallet in the Middle East. This digital wallet is not for customers of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Currently BitOasis available in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman\" (Kalimullina said).Likewise with what @Jawhead999 said where Indonesia has not banned Bitcoin until now even though it cannot be used for payments. But to save it is still possible and it is not a problem for all Indonesian citizens.",

Most of the restrictions are really on commercial use of crypto (not just Bitcoin) -- if you're trading it or using it to facilitate business, then you're not allowed to use it. That actually makes sense from most regulatory perspectives if you consider that most of these countries already struggle with international financial compliance, they simply don't have enough resources to monitor yet another system/network they don't even fully understand.But they're not going to go after individuals who buy and own Bitcoin. Localbitcoins will prove this (check out trades for Indonesia, Turkey, Egypt, to name a few). That's not even needing to go unmonitored p2p like Bisq.",

They completely rely on debt to pay their expenses mostly, for this they give out bonds etc. You loan them money, they pay you interest. The problem is that in many economic zones like japan and europe interest rates are negative. You would loan out money and get less money back, its completely ridiculous. So who would still loan them money? The problem is: they arent capable of raising it, because otherwise they would go bankrupt. So the central banks have to start buying trillions in bonds(both government and corporate bonds), by just printing money and financing governments/corporates expenses, which is something that is not even their task and was frowned upon when the system was still healthy. Otherwise entire economies will start to collapse. So you could argue its governments themselves that are weakening national security and welfare, by having become completely reliant on debt that is financed by central banks, instead of the market itself. It has consequences for all of us, because this money is created out of thin air and making our currencies worth less and less and their own citizens poorer over time, and entire nations fragile. The spiral of debasement, there is no fix inside the system itself anymore.The only reason they would ban Bitcoin is to keep their monopoly alive and this system running, but ofc they will use lies about national security and welfare as cover ups. Even tho the only real way outside of this debt-based monetary system trap is something like Bitcoin that isnt based on debt. The problem is, if they do this they will lose control over the money and cant use it like before anymore. So they rather choose the dumb way of going against Bitcoin to keep their ponzi alive, as it makes fiat whales incredibily rich similar to PoS, as they have the power to rig the system and get most of the printed money/ bailouts. An example for what happens when a country cant pay back their debts anymore is sri lanka: now they have exploding inflation and no way to pay for energy, food medicine imports etc.Quote from: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-61505842Sri Lanka defaults on debt for first time in its history",

If it's a strong democracy and the public opinion is strongly in favour of something, it is unlikely that political parties won't take it into account and won't argue for the things that resonate with their supporters. If an issue is divisive or if a small number of people care about it, it can be neglected. If it's an authoritarian state, very strong opposition is required to change the decision (or overthrow the government, so it's more difficult). You've listed many countries, but like others have noticed, I believe not all of them banned Bitcoin (some considered bans, some restricted certain activities, some are fairly open to cryptos).A reason for restriction can also be ignorance, poor-informed decisions.IMO it's almost always better to regulate cryptos and get the money into the state budget than make serious restrictions or impose a ban.",
