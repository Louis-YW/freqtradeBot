  "content": "Hi there, I'm auctioning a 2014 Cryptonic Monero pure silver physical coin. They are the first physical Monero coins ever produced and they are very rare, there are only a couple auctions of these coins (pure silver and silver plated) found on the internet. The only similar succesful trade that I know of is that someone bought a 2014 Cryptonic pure silver coin for $1700 in 2017. Because of this it's hard to estimate the value of the coin, if you think it's not worth it please refrain from posting in the thread.I am the original owner of this coin and can post the e-mail I received when I ordered the coin from Cryptonic, also the owner of Cryptonic posted in my reputation thread and trust page.Photos: upper ones made with normal lighting, bottom ones made with flash from my phone. These are older photos of a silver plated coin I have but the pure silver coin up for auction here looks the same, if you want I could post new photos of the coin up for this auction.Please limit posts to bids or comments/questions about the item for auction.STARTING BID: 0.115 BTCMINIMUM BID INCREMENT: 0.001 BTCBUY IT NOW: 0.2 BTCEND TIME: JULY 10TH, 2022, 23:59:59 Amsterdam timeESCROW: If you want we can use a trusted escrow on this site, I haven't been on here for a long time so I don't know who currently is a trusted escrow here.Payment due within 24 hours of auction end.SNIPE: Any bid made in last hour will extend the auction 15 minutes.If within that extended hour a new bid is made, 15 minutes will be added to the auction from the time of that bid.PAYMENT: Bitcoin BTC, can also accept ETH, XMR and USDT if that is fine with the potential escrow too, if you want to pay in another cryptocurrency we can discuss that.SHIPPING: Shipping fees included and based on location and preference",

Yeah I believe since you bought that one in 2017 there hasn't been an auction, let alone a succesful trade of one of these coins, especially one from 2014. We offcourse don't count that ridiculous thread",
