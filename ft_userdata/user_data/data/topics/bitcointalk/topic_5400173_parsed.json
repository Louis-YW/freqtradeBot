  "content": "How do you calculate price of grain  / materials ,how can you predict future price?Example:Today you got 1 ton harvest of wheat per hectar , \"stock market is dead do to EMP bomb \"... what is the price that i should ask for my 1 ton of wheat ? If i store the 1 ton of wheat in a silo how much should i ask for it next year ? Example:Today you got 1 ton steel , \"stock market is dead do to EMP bomb \"... what is the price that i should ask for my 1 ton of steel ? If i store the 1 ton of steel   how much should i ask for it next year ? What formulas should i use to determine the price ?",

Just have a good eye for news and be really active.",

Fundamental analysis - it is a method of measuring a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management.The end goal is to arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in order to see whether the security is undervalued or overvalued.

Technical analysis - it is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.

I believe the government should guide those small farmers since they are the one who are being abused here, in my country their products are being paid for a low price but when those big companies put it on the market, the price increases more than 200% of its original harvest value.",

Reduced supply of water is correlated with higher base price of crop and meat production.Chemical fertilizer is produced from natural gas. The value of gas is also rising which prices into the base cost of grain production.Shipping and transportation costs are also rising and priced into the base cost of production.Farmers will seek to find market alternatives which are more affordable. At a certain tipping point organic fertilizer will become more affordable in contrast to chemical fertilizer.But in general rising costs of water, natural gas, fertilizer and shipping will be priced into general production and lead to price hikes. With the exception being subsidized farms which might produce at a gross loss to maintain affordable food prices for the general public.",

      "body": "There's no single formula to determine the prices of all kinds of goods. There are a number of factors involved. But basically you have to add up the entire cost in producing the product and then add the markup as your profit and that's it. Your markup will, in turn, be affected by certain factors as well. The demand and supply is a huge factor in this. However, there are also policies which put limit to the profit. The overall price will, of course, fluctuate regardless of the markup because the cost price is dependent on several factors also. In wheat, for example, the prices of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and others will have an effect.",

You might have to sell at a loss.Anyway, the price cannot be determined by a formula. It is determined by the market. As a seller, you would want to get the highest price that somebody is willing to pay.",
