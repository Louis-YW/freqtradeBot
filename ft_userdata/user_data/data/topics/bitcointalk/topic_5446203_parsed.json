I will not buy directly from them unless they fix what they did.It is a principle thing for me.I recommend no one buying from them directly as they have been terrible the last two years.",

So while people go on about how it makes blocks get better fees, well, you can find plenty of NTF filled blocks without high fees.Looking at bitcoin disk usage, it appears to be about a 30% increase per month since this shit started.",
