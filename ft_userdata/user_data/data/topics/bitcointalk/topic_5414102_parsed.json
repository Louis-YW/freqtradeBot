Then hold. Hold and wait for the bull. When the bull market is at its peak, then sell. With this strategy, you will surely make some profit, but there is no guarantee of how long it will last.and of course, you must not panic, you must be patient.",

You can always utilize profit on this market by opening long position or buying in every low everyday because the price will surely recover on the next daily candle if it’s bull market. Bear market is the obvious opposite, this is the time when shorting the market is preferred or DCA(Dollar Cost Average) to slowly stock tokens that you want to save in preparation for the next bull run.",

During a bull run, we should take that moment to take profits and don't be greedy as much as you can because you might miss the train.And the same goes for the bear market, it's the moment to start buying because we might also miss buying at the cheapest price or if not the cheapest, at least a very low and affordable price compared during the bull run.",

Bull cycle - the market is on massive bull run, meaning the price keeps going up and reaching all time highb. Bear cycle - the market is down, and there is more selling pressure on traders, pulling the priceSo in order to utilized and make some profits, buy in bear market, prices are so cheap and they are in a discount. and then you just have to be mentally prepared to go on this cycle because you might be tempted to give up when you see your portfolio losing so much value.

A bull market is a condition where you can sell your coins at the highest price. For some coins, the price can reach the highest price ever reached.In contrast to a bull market, a bear market is a condition where you can buy a lot of coins that have the opportunity to go high when the bull market arrives. These coins usually have a good history, but not all can get a chance to go high during a bull market.So you can use the bull market to make big profits and the bear market to buy lots of good coins.

That is one is where the price heads upward while the other is on the opposite direction. To be able to utilize them, one must buy whenever there is a bear and then sell whenever there is a bull run.I know this sounds easy to say but it was actually difficult because we don't know the exact time if where will they come, this is why many are buying on wrong times because they can't wait for the bear, same thing when they sell. They can also sell early and regret when the actual bull run comes. They then end up doing silly things like buying during the bull but they can still earn something if they get lucky that the bull run continues.",

The Bear market on the other hand, is the direct opposite of the bull market because at this point, there is always a continuous decrease or fall in the prices of crypto and at this point long term holders are likely to make losses.The bear market exposes the strong and smart investors because despite the fall and depreciation of the value of their portfolio, they still hold and keep waiting on the bear market's return, while others might sell along the line because of fear I always advise the use of stop loss because it helps greatly when the bear market comes saving you the emotional stress of watching your portfolio depreciate and you can just buy again at the peak of the bear run which helps to maximize profits.",

Bull means when price is appreciating and going higher while bear is decrease in price. So how profit is made is in the investment time. You buy a coin during bear which is the time it has dropped, then you can buy more at lower price and you can sell the coins you bought at bull time which is at higher price, then you will make profit.",

Subsequent work is to create a strategy to initiate your investment plan in different markets.

Life for most of us is a constant search for opportunities and being able to identify them is some key to making some good profit.When it comes to cryptos, bear and bull market. The bear market is one way to eliminate weak hands, to make people want to secure there asset by making withdrawals but your surely loosing when you do. You've have better chance at buying and wait for the bull market to come. Better still, you get to hold what you've got until the bulls come. No need to entertain the fud that would come around as that's some season for it.The bull market gets to give your holdings some huge value. In all that, its best not to sell all your holdings. Just a few if you must and when you have to.",

That is, to acquire most coins as possible during the bear market (since currencies are cheaper), so you hold them and sell for profit once the bull market begins. You just have to be patient and the more money you have to invest the better, because it can take up to few years until you can conclude this strategy for financial gains, so the profit must make it worth the time you had to wait.",

When the market pump, I buy few coins which are red suggest. After that the coins cross 10% to 20% up, I sold the tokens.It's quite risky which seems you're investing altcoins that we don't know becomes shitcoin in the end.Stop-limit could be applicable when you're in trading but it scratches your head for sure if you don't have the technical skills to predict those coins.Here's what I suggest to you.Do Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) on investing in top altcoins (not shitcoins) or focus on Bitcoin and when the price keeps declining, just keep buying until such one day there's a bull market come.",
