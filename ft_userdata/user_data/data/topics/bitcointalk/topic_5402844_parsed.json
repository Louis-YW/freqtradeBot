  "content": "Hey,I have previously called how $BTC will be at 200 MA in Feb 2022, I guess I was ahead of time in finding how comparable 2018 market was to 2022.Now once we are here at $21k, I think Bitcoin bottom is in.How I can say that?1. Monthly RSI2. Stochastic RSI3. Hash Ribbon4. Weekly EMAs and MAs5. MVRV-Z Score6. BEAM IndicatorLet's begin 1. Monthly RSI -RSI is at 40, previously whenever this happened, bottom was in. 2. Stochastic RSI -Whenever Stochastic RSI below 5, bottom was in.3. Hash Ribbon -Whenever Hash Ribbon Indicator shown Capitulation Signal, Bottom was in,4. Weekly EMAs and MAs -25 EMA crossed 100 MA, bottom was in. This week, the same happened.5. MVRV-Z Score -Whenever MVRV-Z is in green zone, bottom was in. The chart below is in 2 days delay so has not counted $20k BTC price.6. BEAM Indicator -BEAM stands for \"Bitcoin Economics Adaptive Multiple\". BEAM divides the price of bitcoin at any given moment to a moving average of past prices.Green Zone In, means bottom is in.I love sharing information and my analysis with everyone, rest is upto you how you want to make use of this information.Good luck and I hope you will make it out if you haven't already this bull run anon.",

      "body": "You may be right for the buttom ending or closing of it all for hodlers to have another fresh air and opening of bullish thread. But it may not come to end just on a spot. The RSI and stochastic oscillator are basically indicators that show overbought areas and oversold but not reversal. Using reversal indicators are more accurate for a time frame watch especially like longer time frame , daily , weekly or monthly. Therefore to wait for the monthly time and using support and resistance calculation is more important in this bear time. Sometimes market can be overbought or oversold but it keeps eating down prices and stop loss like it is has been happening around $32/30k price area down up to now at $21k.",

All markets are tanking, and the crash and crisis of UST and now Celcius mean crypto is no longer perceived as a safe hedge against inflation. I'm thinking stock-to-flow and 2-year bear cycle, while governments keep fighting inflation. Bull markets make you money, but bear markets make you rich. Build up durig a low sideways bear trend if it's business as usual, and wait for the next halving to awaken the beast.",

About the bottom, I mean that this weekly candle close should be it.But as you know Bitcoin has never been under a scenario of recession before, things might change this time.If we go up, it will not be able to surpass 28k as that support is now a resistance.For some reason, I feel like a long daily wick might be the final decision maker in this scenario.Let's see how it goes",

True, and speaking of options expiration, bitcoin future will have it's last trade June 24 and then settlement in June 27.So along the way as what previous data shows, we might see price going lower and maybe it will go below $20k. So regardless of what the TA is pointing, there could be no validation and yes, no longer reliable. So I'm still expecting worst, I thought that June might be a good month for us, but it seems we don't have any respite from the bears.",

      "body": "I hope this is correct, certainly seems well founded because the path to accuracy in predictions is multiple perspectives of which these indicators should give some insight.   Even if we are forming the bottom pricing it still requires testing and probably we do that multiple times before moving substantially later.  I think we might take this whole year, there is still a ton of doubt circulating and the majority of people dont derive any confidence from these array of analytics so confidence is low and I think price also will take time to develop.The price action is really close to the bottom, we dont have any clear momentum upwards.   The process to turn this around from negative to positive, first we arrest the fall and stabilize and probably require time to do so.",

Also holding their coins will be way easier for those that are just entering the market, because even if this is not the absolute bottom how low can the price actually go and for how long the price will remain there? So this is  great entry point for those which are willing to go against the trend and invest in bitcoin right now, I will admit that doing such a thing can be scary for a newbie but without a doubt it is the best move they can do at the moment.",

A lower than $20k price is a good entry already better not to waste the opportunity if ever we see this price again. Bear market is indeed a good opportunity to buy and hold, strong money always come on a bear market. With the current situation of every country right now, I think it will take years before we totally recover but doing a good decision right now can be a big thing in the future so invest wisely.",
