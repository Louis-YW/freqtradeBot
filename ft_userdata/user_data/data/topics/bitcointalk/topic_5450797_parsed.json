Or they are using a wallet which estimates the wrong fee, that's the only logical explanation I can imagine in such cases because I have paid higher fee with Electrum when I wasn't much expert on the fee part. I can't imagine why people would such higher fee when they can even get their transactions confirmed in the next block with far lower amount of fees, specially the third transaction in the OP which had more than 1000 sats per byte! In most of my transactions, I pay lower than 1000 sats in total",

These days almost all wallet software have feature to adjust fees. I use Electrum always and most of the time the default fees are higher than the minimal fees which is fine to get the next block so knowing to adjust fees is very important for anyone who is in bitcoin.Another reason could be, not aware of what fees to set but in this particular case it does not seem the suggestion from the wallet software was followed too. 653 sat/vB seems too high to suggest. The sender could be testing something. Or he missed type the fees field when he was trying to adjust the fees.Usually I noticed gambling companies do not care about fees. They have fixed fees set for withdrawals and sometimes it's too high than the required fees for a block.",

Sometimes the senders think that setting way higher fees then the recommend fees increases the transaction speed to way higher levels and if they want urgent transaction then 2x to 4x the fees to increase the speed of transactions.Another theory regarding those transactions can be that the sender has set the fee unintentionally and executed the transaction. Such people are so confused and busy in their lives that it's sometimes hard from them to focus on things properly. Once the transaction fees is set and executed then they can't undo the transaction.",

Someone by mistake, someone in a hurry indicated an overestimated value, as a result we see those x15-x56. Perhaps someone, in the hope that this will speed up the transaction, put up a big commission. It seems to me that the reason also lies in the lack of relevant knowledge among people. Many newcomers, tritely, may not know that commissions can be chosen and use the default settings set in bitcoin wallets.If you monitor https://mempool.space/, you can find a lot of transactions with overpaid commissions.You can use similar websites to select logically transaction fees - http://bitcoinfees.earn.com/",

For me, the high exchange fees for bitcoin withdrawals with actually low transaction fees make it very expensive, slow and unwanted process to use bitcoin for frequent transactions. Things are manageable when you use your own wallet but sometimes when I expect to receive one confirmation in 20-30 minutes, someone comes out of nowhere and starts to send transactions with 2000 sat/vB, raising fees for everyone and then I receive bitcoins lately.Yesterday I was checking transactions in mined blocks and I don't know what to think but people really pay high fees for no reason. You'll often see two type of people who pay the highest transaction fees: One are those who spend more than one bitcoin and another part are the ones who spend more in fees than in transaction.",
