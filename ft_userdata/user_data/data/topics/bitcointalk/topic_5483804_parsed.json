No matter what the receiver of said contribution says to defend themselves the perceived influence is unavoidable.Bitcoin needs to remain decentralized and the way that this is accomplished is making it easy for nodes to decide which version of Core they would like to run.  The problem with this is that most nodes have no idea that it is their responsibility to keep Bitcoin decentralized.  They install the next update blindly.  This puts control in the hands a few developers and if they are funded by anyone there will be perceived favoritism.  Said another way, it becomes a pay to play game like our government has become.In my opinion Bitcoin development should be strictly volunteer.  Let's not allow the most potentially transformative idea in a generation to be co-opted by anyone.",

Also funders are not stupid. They don't expect bitcoin to be somehow more centralized or controlled by their funding.Some funders absolutely want to control the direction of Bitcoin.  To start, Banks and governments will fight to prevent its use as a currency or they will co-opt it to more completely control the movement of money.This community should do everything it can to develop Bitcoin for it's intended purpose - a \"purely peer-to-peer electronic form of cash\".A diverse group of node operators, or better yet, everyone who uses Bitcoin as \"electronic cash\" should have a say in how Bitcoin is changed.The internet is an edge network and Bitcoin was designed to take advantage of that by pushing the decisions out to the nodes.  In a perfect world most people who transact in Bitcoin would have their own node and have a say in its development.If you want the people and institutions with lots of money to dictate Bitcoin's future then by all means allow the core developers to accept donations from them.",

Out of curiosity, I asked a question about what they would want to benefit from such a statement. But I was made to understand that there is little to nothing that they can influence on bitcoin, as the majority of any change on the network is being done by voting, and if the majority doesn't support any decision, then it's going nowhere. So if there is anyone who wants to make a generous donation to the network, let them do it, as the funds will go a long way towards the development team.",
