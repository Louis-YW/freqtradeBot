  "content": "I was looking at gambling statistics for my country the other day. People in Greece lost 22.5 billion EUR only in 2021, and 29 billion in 2022 and that was only on licensed establishments.That's around 10% of Greece's GDP wasted away towards offshore companies... This is a very hard issue to deal with and to think that it happens at such a scale even with the licensed casinos is unthinkable. Essentially governments sell a casino license once and then these casinos are given free reign on how to advertise, how to be promoted, what claims to make... No limits to how much they can earn. But governments sure as hell are there to profit whenever a gambler wins anything, heavily taxing big winnings... What makes me even angrier is that these licensed casinos do very little to offer gamblers resources to play responsibly, and do nothing to educate gamblers about house edge. Also, none of their games run on provably fair algorithms. And yet the government does very little to regulate them after having sold them a license... And Greece isn't a rich country by any means. Many families are facing hardship, unemployment is high, youth emigration is rising etc... Things don't look particularly good for the economy in general. What do you think about this issue where people gamble too much in countries where the vast majority of the population isn't well off? Should governments step in and restrict casinos more perhaps?",

The problem is that people in most of these countries see gambling as a way to make money to help themselves in their difficult situation. What the government can do is to improve the state of the economy for these people so that their financial status can improve so they stop gambling to make money, and then the government can try to restrict gambling, not a total ban, so it does not spread and ravage the entire population old and young. In these countries, the government can also start campaigns and sensitization exercises so these people know that gambling should not be to make money but should be for fun.",

Well at some point,  alani123 you may have thrown this too far as far as gambling addictions/losses and its resultant effect on individuals,  and also making a separation between rich countries and poor countries' involvement in gambling,  but just you to know that,  the resultant effect of gambling addictions or loses is a general phenomenon and even the level of gambling involvement is also generalized and should not be regionally segregated from one country to the next. But the bottom line is that,  whether you are from a 1st world country or a third world country you shouldn't take gambling as a means to earn a living and you should avoid any possible addictions because gambling can ruin your life,  so be it st to take it for what it is and that is for fun and nothing more than that.",

Somewhat i do agree on what you have said  that it all still boils down into someones decision because whether you do living in a country neither rich or poor,it would be still always depending or about with your finances. If you are really that trying out to make yourself or having that mindset on doing gambling just to makeyourself rich then thats where things turns out to be shit later on.",

It is beyond the control of every casino and government on how much gambler will spend on their platform.  Casino have dedicated page for explaining about gambling responsibly and self-exclusion.  Aside from that I believe government also advertise about gambling responsibly and they even make plans and programs to spread information about the bad effect of gambling addiction.  Some countries even forbid the use of credit cards in gambling.",

I was also wondering why it has to be about country and not individual.  Even though gambling behaviour depends entirely on the individual, environment can play a part. By environment, country qualifies to be. To be specific, countries like Kosovo seems and US seems more inclined to gambling than many Asian countries like Saudi Arabia and UAE.  So, I think the post have some points. Countries that seems to be friendly with gambling with lots of casinos all over the streets will surely have more gambling addicts than those where gambling is almost done in secret.

If peer groups can influence people this much as regards to gambling, imagine what friendly government policies can do.",

It rare to see a country that totally banned gambling even if there’s a chance for them to make profit out of it.Knowing the economy of Greece, I’m sure they can’t afford yet to ban gambling. The addiction of many to gambling is increasing and most of them came from a poor family, this is the sad reality and we can’t do anything about this aside from being a responsible gambling in your own. We have to be more cautious, and gamble only what we can afford to lose, also don’t depend too much in gambling because there is no guaranteed profit here.",

My point is that if someone is advertising a casino, and they keep researching the numbers of things like how much money is being spent in the casinos and when they discover that the numbers are very high, they complainSo what's the point of someone also playing and advertising a casino? people are of legal age, they know that there are things they should do and others they shouldn't do, so it's not the job of people like us to worry about how many people are addicted to gambling, how much money they spend on gambling. bad luck. The task of someone who is promoting a company is to speak well of the things that company is offering as long as everything is legal. It's up to people to do research and then make decisions on their own. I particularly see a lot of people playing in my country, the game is legal here and the government wastes no time in advertising for people to stop playing, because the law allows games and the law also determines that people over 18 years of age age are adultsare responsible for themselves, because let's see things this way: if in a country they say that in total 200 million dollars were gambled, for example, that means that the government received money from taxes, that means that the casino created jobs, that means that the casino also promoted tourism in the case of physical casinos, this also means that some people left with profits, even if it was a small number of people who made a profit, it was still a lot. because the profit from these people could make them people who do business, create jobs and pay taxes. In other words, the casino is also doing a lot of good things and you should also start talking about these good things that casinos do",
