That's a simple way of courting hypocrisy. Sadly, let me shock you, I look out for negative or critical reviews on any site or app I want to use more than I consider the positive views. I know for certain that nothing is ever perfect for everyone. There are obviously going to be a few who will have dissecting views on the same issue. I want to also read those dissecting views to factor in any challenge I'm likely going to have using that particular stuff. My advice – ask for honest reviews.",

      "body": "Quick reminder: Know that your competitors also pay people to give bad reviews on your products on trust pilot. Its better to give a free review of your products to some high ranked members to use and share on autopilot what they think, good or bad, about your product. Therefore, if you are looking out for only good reviews it can't be achievable in the shady internet market of today. Good luck with sales.",

I know that reviews are essential for your business, but it’s better for you to get real, genuine and honest organic ones from existing customers instead. Plus it’s no good if all of the ratings you get are 5 out of 5 or so without a mix of neutral or negative honest reviews. Competitors would feel that these ratings and reviews are just fake and incentivized, so it would likely going to affect your reputation as a business or service provider. Just saying.",

      "body": "From my points of view it's very bad seeking for a position review of your site is likely to be evil, you are trying to buy what is not your credibility, I will advise you to seek only genuine review from people who has any bad experience or if there is something to adjust or amendment from your site instead of paying for it.Okay let say what would be your benefits if people gave you good feedback and at last users encountered bad situations with your site what could be the outcome at then?This is why you need a natural review instead of paying for it. So I don't advised anyone to involve their selves in such activities.I think you are not worthy to be trusted both your site for paying to review your site, I have seen many sites that asked for genuine review instead of paying for it.",
