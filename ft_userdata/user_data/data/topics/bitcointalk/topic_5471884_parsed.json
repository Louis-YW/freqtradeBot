  "content": "Note for the moderator, since there is no one cyber-security Board i put this topic here because i believe that this tool can be used to backup seeds, passwords, passphrases, privatekeys and other secretsHello everyone, I want to share with you one simple tool to store passwords securely.https://www.passwordstore.org/If you don’t know it, password store is an open source project written in bash that uses GPG to store passwords encrypted with your GPG private key, that means that only you will be able to decrypt them.I like this tool because it is a command line tool, i can use it on Linux, Windows (WSL) and Android (Termux) . It can be synchronized between devices with a git, so that means you can have a unique password repository in all your devices. You only need to have the same GPG private key between them.QuoteYou can edit the password store using ordinary unix shell commands alongside the pass command. There are no funky file formats or new paradigms to learn. There is bash completion so that you can simply hit tab to fill in names and commands, as well as completion for zsh and fish available in the completion folder. The very active community has produced many impressive clients and GUIs for other platforms as well as extensions for pass itself.So it’s a simple a bash tool  to organize password stored in individual files encrypted with GPGPassword store already have some years:Initial release: September 4, 2012; 11 years agoGnuPG also have more years:Initial release: 7 September 1999; 24 years agoWith those years in the market most common bugs should be already fixed and almost all security flags also were already catchedI am using this tools to manage my passwords and other secrets like seeds and private keys, maybe some of you will point to keepass or some other private solution like 1Password, but i like this because its originally a command line tool  and I can use it on all my devices, Linux, windows and android.Obviously it needs to have its precautions, like backing up the GPG private key securely and other things all depending on how paranoid you are with all those things.",

But the encryption of your key in GPG is better than regular mangers of password. but without proper encryption of your key with strong passphrase, then just any one can have access to the stored passwords. also the best place to store your key is offline, which is the best form of any storage",

Or if your house is on fire?As a bitcoin wallet may contain a lot of money, so nothing can go wrong. If you lose some passwords,  you can recover most of them in some way.",

And the debate is really good Memorizing seedphrase can be seen as a bad idea. What if you get into an accident, or what if you get memory loss as you age? As for me, I have multiple backups of my seeds, both online and offline. Two of them are stored on my airgapped device, and two are on my personal note. I don't know if that's enough. I have seen many cases where people faced hardware failures, software bugs, and other issues that caused them to lose their funds. I had one question, though, how are your heirs instructed? You can do one thing. You can lock your assets for a fixed amount of time. It can only be accessed after the lock period has ended. You may want to try this. Even if your heirs get their hands on private keys, they'll have to wait.",

And actually i alreay tested for me its good, but its a little complicated for my friends i teach them how to use a wallet like electrum and sparrow but i don't want to confuse them.I think the topic is getting a bit off track, Somebody had used password store? I think that i can made some video of how to use it. Also i thing that i can open a bounty for this tools to anyone who found some vulnerability to it. I don't have much but I can allow some sats for it.What do you think?",

I don't have much but I can allow some sats for it.What do you think?Yes, I somehow may have gone off topic. By Murphy's law, did you mean \"what is supposed to happen will always happen\"?To be honest, I don't trust third-party apps to store my seed phrases. I just don't want to rely on them too much. I do know it's open source, secure, and tested by many users, but still, I get a strange feeling about using it. That's why I prefer offline backups the most. No technology, no internet connection, only raw sees phrases. Of course, my offline backup won't be lying on any office desk. I can ensure that it will be in the safest place in my house. Even if my house burns down or is destroyed by a natural calamity, it will hold.Yes, it would be great if you made a video guide of how to use these kind of password manager.",

Most of them use the same password for every site.I agree that this tools is not for everyone, if someone dislike CLI tools they can use another GUI solutions that is OK.I just like this tools because i can sync between devices with git command and since the data is encrypted i just need to be careful to backup tha data and protect my GPG KEY",
