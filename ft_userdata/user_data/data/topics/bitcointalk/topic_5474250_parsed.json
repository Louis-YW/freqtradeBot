Will bitcoin market go on crash mood because last time was coronavirus. What are your thoughts? I think that could be the reason of crash. The outbreak of corona virus which started in December 2019 and lasted all throughout 2020 didn't have much effect to the decline on the price of Bitcoin, and likewise do I also strongly believe that this Hamas and Isreal fight which started on 7th October 2023, after Hamas terrorist group killed over 1200 Israeli citizens will still not have zero effect on the price of Bitcoin, because if it would have, we could have started seeing it's effect today, but however the opposite seems to be the cause as Bitcoin have increased in value +10,000 since this Hamas and Isreal war started till this very moments. That is, the Hamas and Isreal war started on 7 October 2023, and the price of Bitcoin on 7 October 2023 was $27,500 per BTC, while today the price of Bitcoin is currently $37,500, which is approximately a $10k increase in value.",

Will bitcoin market go on crash mood because last time was coronavirus. What are your thoughts? I think that could be the reason of crash. In 2020, the price of Bitcoin increased rapidly in 2021, despite some impact due to the coronavirus. So I think wars and pandemics don't affect Bitcoin that much. Israel and Palestine are not only held within their countries but the economic impact is felt throughout the world. However, the price of Bitcoin does not stop there, it is very challenging for the price of Bitcoin to rise above $10,000 in the current situation. Because last month the price of bitcoin was below 30 thousand but this month the price of bitcoin touched up to 37 thousand. So none of these pandemics and wars have had much of an impact on Bitcoin.",

When COVID-19 was declared asa pandemic we saw a sudden surge in Bitcoin price we may see they same result but we cannot be certain. War is a complete different situation than the pandemic. A lot of fiat is spent in a war and it does affect the countries participating in that war economically. Bitcoin is not a country specific currency it is a global currency and therefore I feel we won't see much happening in the cryptocurrency market.",

Will bitcoin market go on crash mood because last time was coronavirus. What are your thoughts? I think that could be the reason of the crash. I don't know how you concluded that there is a high chance of the war escalating to other countries. I know that many countries are gunning for peace and I don't think anyone has the intention to join the war openly. The war in Ukraine affected the global economy because of the increase in the price of crude, gas, grains, and other essential commodities.  This harmed the global economy and bitcoin price was also affected because just like every bitcoin is connected to the global financial system. But if the war spreads to other parts of the Middle East it will lead to the disruption of the sale and transportation of oil and gas which lead to a shortage in supply. Limited supply will lead to an increase in the cost of electricity and many economies will face inflation and other negative consequences. I don't think the impact of this situation will be as bad as that of COVID-19 because nations can always seek alternatives for oil and supply but the pandemic led to the total shutdown of the global economy. I don't believe that Bitcoin will crash, the right language should be a decline or drop in price and the currency has the tradition of recovering after some time.",

I think that could be the reason of crash. Wars are always bad for human and economics as well as politics. They always have very long lasting effects on related nations, locations and local people. If a war  is big like an area war, a geopolitical war, its effects will be very big, not only restricted locally but expanded to globally.Bitcoin has a sharp rally from its bottom and I expect to see its correction anytime with any reason. The war between Israel and Hamas will cause more issues in the Middle East and global so if Bitcoin market makers use it as reason to dump the market, I will not surprise.",
