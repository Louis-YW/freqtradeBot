So it can be preferred for our crypto assets however the security also depends on how we keep the keys safe with us.",

What is the best way right now to secure your coins? Using hardware wallets has always meant that you have some level of trust in the manufacturer. Which, in the case of some of them, turned out to be unjustified. To trust or not to trust, after the incident with Ledger (several incidents)? The question is somewhat rhetorical. The unreliability of one company is not a reason to distrust all others. But still, questions arise: can you trust wallet manufacturers at all? In my opinion, none of them can be trusted 100%. Therefore, the storage of bitcoin on the wallet of only one manufacturer in real life is considered unacceptable.Probably one of the acceptable solutions is multi-signature wallets that include 2-3 devices from different manufacturers (it doesn’t matter if it’s airapped or not. I wouldn’t trust 100% even the vaunted passport from foundation) + electrum (you should not use native apps from HW device manufacturers).In matters of the safety and security of your assets, it is not superfluous to be a little paranoid. It is better to play it safe a few times than to sob over the lost money later.",

If, for example, I set up a 2-of-3 between phone, daily computer, and airgapped computer, the airgapped computer adds absolutely nothing since the compromise of two hot wallets (phone and daily computer) is sufficient to steal my coins.You need to ensure you cannot reach your threshold number of keys without at least one airgapped wallet. Your 2-of-2 example works. Another example with some redundancy would be a 2-of-3 between daily computer, airgapped computer, and the third seed phrase only on paper as an emergency back up.Quote from: tread93 on July 07, 2023, 02:26:05 AMCan someone please point me in the direction of a good air gapped wallet strategy?Here are the basics:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on June 27, 2023, 06:01:52 PMTwo devices.

A perfect example of how not to run a company.Back to the data leak. Whether we agree on it or not, such hacking incidents happen. Companies from all industries have suffered minor and major hacking incidents. The forum we today write on was hacked in the past. No one questions Bitcointalk today or considers theymos and the admins incompetent for what happened. Obviously, the forum's main business model was never to protect sensitive data, Ledger's is.

You are surely referring to the private keys and seeds in the part of your post that I bolded. Here is the difference. The personal information you submit to them when you buy Ledger hardware wallet is stored online on their servers. That's why it can be hacked and obtained. Your private keys and seeds are stored locally on the device you hold in your hand (let's forget about Ledger Recover for a moment). Thus, there is nothing to hack from Ledger's database.
