  "content": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-us-government-largest-bitcoin-hodlers-5b-in-btc-reportQuoteThe United States government has become one of the largest Bitcoin BTC $28,368 holders, with over 200,000 BTC worth more than $5 billion despite selling a few thousand BTC worth millions earlier this year.According to a data analysis based on public filings, crypto firm 21.co estimated that the U.S. government still holds 194,188 BTC, estimated to be worth $5.3 billion. The firm noted in its analysis that these are “lower-bound estimations of the U.S. government holdings based on publicly available information.”So, based on the news, all the Bitcoins they have now come from seizures of illegal activities involving certain individuals or companies. This includes funds from hacked accounts, especially linked to the Bitfinex hack and Silk Road.There's still more Bitcoin in the balance, as mentioned in the news, so it's likely the government will schedule another auction or maybe just sell it to an exchange once they get the necessary approvals from the relevant government department. There's no fixed time for when they'll do this, but it might have an impact on the market. However, since similar situations have occurred in the past, people might adjust and not see it as a major sell-off. If it does affect the market, it might be a short-term thing.What's really interesting is that massive Bitcoin auction back in 2014, specifically. As stated below.Quote The most notable government auction dates back to 2014, when billionaire Tim Draper bought 30,000 BTC from U.S. government auctions in 2014.So, according to this  article from July 2, 2014, Tim Draper made a significant purchase. I'm curious about how much he's made with Bitcoin's current price, so I made a simple computation. If we consider the price back then, around $600 per Bitcoin, and use data from CoinMarketCap:In July 2014: $600 x 30,000 BTC = $18,000,000In October 2023: $28,000 x 30,000 BTC = $840,000,000Based on these numbers, it's safe to say he made a huge amount of money from that purchase, potentially even hitting the $1 billion mark if he sold during the last bull run when Bitcoin hit $60,000.",

However, since similar situations have occurred in the past, people might adjust and not see it as a major sell-off. If it does affect the market, it might be a short-term thing.The government always publishes its intention to auction seized coins and people are given the opportunity to bid. The last sale by the US government happened sometime in July this year when about $300 million worth of Bitcoin was moved from two marked government wallets. The price was affected slightly (0.8%) and Bitcoin recovered in a few days.Quote from: DapanasFruit on October 18, 2023, 02:16:11 AMI am not surprised to know that the USA government is actually a big holder of Bitcoin and they are actually taken from different personalities and organization who got caught by the law doing illegal acts or business.

The government is also hodling to make profit from Bitcoin. If not they would have sold the seizures a long time ago. I suspect that they will wait till the bull run before another trench will be sold so that the price will increase. It might also be that the reason why Nobuaki Kobayashi, the Mt Gox trustee postponed the deadline of the base repayment to victims was because they also want to make more gains.",

Yeah, it might have looked like a foolish move back then because people hadn't experienced the bull run yet. He could have cashed in during the 2016 bull run when it hit $16k per piece, which I think was the all-time high at that time.But with this coin, it's anyone's guess. As long as there's no associated address, we can't keep tabs on it. Tim's a billionaire, though, so he probably knows what he's up to. Maybe he sold some to recover his capital and make a little profit, or perhaps he's still holding on to that colossal 30k stash.Quote from: adaseb on October 18, 2023, 04:18:57 AMLet’s just hope the US Government won’t start dumping the rest of those coins in the near future.

Remember that the bitcoins they have likely stem from illegal activities, so their inclination would probably be to sell them once there are no claims and if the court orders it, those assets will become state income. If the US government had a Bitcoin investment program, they'd likely make it public knowledge. After all, the money they manage primarily comes from taxes, so keeping it secret is unconstitutional.Regarding the seizure of Bitcoin, I don't think it will be auctioned. The market has changed significantly since 2014, with a much larger trading volume, making exchanges very liquid.As we can see on CoinMarketCap, Binance has a daily trading volume of over $6 billion, while the U.S. holds only $5 billion. They could handle it, but it might cause an instant dip and short-term panic. So, they probably won't do that since it would harm the crypto market they've already regulated. I believe it will be sold on a schedule, gradually rather than all at once.https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/",

The only thing is they need a much smaller space than Fort Knox to store large amounts. I think it’s fine that they are selling Bitcoin. At least we will have good auction and true investor would go buy it and hodl it even more likely. I hate to say but government treasury is not the place where we should expect Bitcoin getting hodl. There is more concrete reason behind this; government hodling it and selling in the future when BTC price is very high could dilute the market quickly. I mean today’s 5 billion could be worth more than 10-15 billion (assuming) and this will disturb the liquidity and resistance. It’s far better this goes in the wallet of private investors who would just sell small chunks now and then thus keeping the ecosystem clean.
