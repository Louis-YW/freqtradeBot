  "content": "Hello everyone, I had like to ask you a question that How often Do you talk about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies with your friends and relatives?It is something I have been thinking lately. When I think of sharing my excitement about crypto with people I care about. I often wonder about two things:1. Is Bitcoin Risky?: One major concern that holds me back is the perceived risk of Bitcoin. What if people invest and end up losing their hard-earned money? How do you approach this aspect when talking about crypto?2. Beating Inflation and Earning Profits: On the other hand, I also see the potential for people to beat inflation and make decent profits from cryptocurrencies. So, should we consider discussing the financial benefits as well?Have you had similar hesitations or successful conversations about crypto's potential risks and rewards with your friends and Relatives? Share your thoughts!",

      "body": "One common question I face, is that bitcoin does not exist in real unlike physical money. I try to explain that bitcoin can be acquired by spending physical money similar to what the barter system has been at one time. It is minted solving a math problem by the miners, but these things boggles the minds of non-techy people - how is that even possible is the next question I face.Clearly we are ill-equipped to answer such questions. Lets make this thread a place where we can discuss about common problems and logical fallacies that we are facing when trying to spread the knowledge of crypto.",

What if people invest and end up losing their hard-earned money? How do you approach this aspect when talking about crypto?Let me get straight to your questions without much ado.Yes, Bitcoin is risky. But, you may first ask them that what doesn't consist of risks? Be it BSE, NSE, Gold purchase, or even a real estate. Nothing here is guaranteed, and Bitcoin being risky is because it comes from a highly different asset class, but it holds enough acquaintance among people and can easily be traded, even easier than stocks. Hassle-free. Show them the returns people have got, then talk to them about the mining aspect and then tell them about the current upcoming halving event and explain it to them. I'm sure they'll understand and invest something into BTC. One most important thing here, ask them to invest only what they can afford to lose. Quote2. Beating Inflation and Earning Profits: On the other hand, I also see the potential for people to beat inflation and make decent profits from cryptocurrencies. So, should we consider discussing the financial benefits as well?Definitely. It's better to keep both the sides in front of them, so it'll be easier for them to decide whether to go for it or not. There's nothing bad in telling everything to them, so that it becomes transparent to them and they get clear about this asset class.",

My relatives are safe with their FDs, they ask sometimes about advise and want to investment in crypto, but I do not suggest them, I'd usually say, \"whatever you invest, consider it already lost\", they don't go further. I'm not that confident in myself with investments that I'd suggest others. Much of my successes are due to luck, I try not to consider myself responsible for them.",

What if people invest and end up losing their hard-earned money? How do you approach this aspect when talking about crypto?Any investment comes with a risk you cannot only point out that the risk factor only exists in Bitcoin investment. The solution to counter the risk factor is to inform the individual to whom you introduced Bitcoin, to invest what he/she can afford to lose. Like other investments, you won't become rich after investing in Bitcoin instantly. Bitcoin is not a quick rich scheme it is a technology based on cryptography and can used only when the internet is available. Always keep in mind that It would take time and would require a lot of patience to gain a high return on the investment in Bitcoin.  Quote from: cafter on October 22, 2023, 02:15:17 PM2. Beating Inflation and Earning Profits: On the other hand, I also see the potential for people to beat inflation and make decent profits from cryptocurrencies. I am not sure about cryptocurrencies but one thing that makes Bitcoin unique is its ability to be inflation resistant. The simple reason is that it has a limited supply, ensuring that its value will remain steady over time. Earning high profits cannot be guaranteed yet it can be achieved if anyone follows a systematic plan of investment in Bitcoin.",

What if people invest and end up losing their hard-earned money? How do you approach this aspect when talking about crypto?Please do not encourage them to invest in Bitcoin if they have no knowledge or very little knowledge about Bitcoin. Let them learn first about Bitcoin. It's like the stock market but better than the stock market in some ways. You can try to explain to them from your knowledge but don't force them to convince them to invest in it. If they understand, you will notice they will ask you how to invest. Always give them the warning that there are risk of losing their money as well if you can't hold it for the long term. Because if you do not give them a warning, they may blame you later. Whenever I talk to my friends about Bitcoin, I tell them it's a long process. If you expect that it will make you rich overnight, don't invest in it. You are not at a loss if you hold it. That is an unrealized loss. If you sell it, you have to sell in loss. Unless you still have the same amount you bought a month ago.",

Average people do not research after they get any suggestions. They see how it sounds, and if a suggestion seems good, they will take it without thinking about the possible negative impact. It happens especially in India. Also, Indians are master (Especially west bengals) to blame others for the mistake they made.",

My focus is to introduce Bitcoin to those within my circle or family members who know about it but have a few questions about it. Our media has already done a lot of negative publicity for a few years now about Bitcoin. As of now, they have started talking about some benefits of Bitcoin after the new tax law was introduced by the government. My understanding is that everyone in the present generation is aware of Bitcoin and its benefits. Those who question it are our Uncles and Aunts, that is why it is better to leave them.",

Think of it this way, if you are the one accumulating bitcoin and not your friends a time will come when they will also need to buy but have no sellers available. Then you can dump on them for a huge price. Its like a hidden wet dream of many bitcoin users, which may not actually happen but is always possible.",

You can end up damaging interpersonal relations if you pressurize them, which is absolutely meaningless to do anyway. They may have a different mindset and an opinion that you might not agree on and you have to respect that because they are respecting yours.QuoteMixing relations and finance will always go wrong in my assumption so I won't put myself in such position. I believe that financial decisions, especially investments, should be made based on the individual goals, risk tolerance, and understanding. Risk appetite is not the same for everyone and knowledge lacking might contribute to that. That can be countered by teaching and allowing them to take the first initiative as they gradually see the buzzwords on media more and more.",

The great example can be Warren Buffett , is rich and know as most successful investor in this world, still he is not accepting bitcoin as real asset. So people are ignorant about all over the world.I can tell why old school people from India behave like that because they used to the most conservative mindset because they passed the difficult era's like 1960's, 70's ,80's and so. And bitcoin is exact opposite of their investment principles because it's highly volatile asset so its understandable that new generation are adopting to it than elders.",
