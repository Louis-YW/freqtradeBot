Nah, I don't think so, he will just have to rub this though to him.",

It is possible of course that he has done no crime but maybe he didn't send them the correct paperworks or something else.

Bitcoin isn't exactly a solution to this problem because of its volatility. In the future when bitcoin replaces the USD yes it will be the ultimate solution but not now. People will have to obey banks a bit longer. Even bankers (like Peter Schiff) don't like banks as you've seen in the OP.",

Whoever leaves their Bitcoin in any custodial shit/crap, will end up like this guy and many others. In the end, it all goes down to centralization and regulations. Having him complain of never making profits and putting up a lot of cost to meet compliance is just him pointing out the ills to the centralized system and the more reason for him to dive into cryptos. I guess this is going to be difficult even for him as an anti-crypto and the immediate ridicule he would come by for not being true to his words in the past but the truth is, you cod still own bitcoin while watching on the sideline. Although for individuals like him, its likely going to be required that he declares any holding publicly for checks by the government and ensure proper taxation on it. Well, its the music he had put up with for so long, let him dance to it.",

When I say \"the right way\", I mean all those who do it the completely wrong way by using crypto exchanges as a place to store their cryptocurrencies. Is there any difference between someone who keeps fiat in a bank and someone who keeps Bitcoin in a custodial service? When I read that someone is excited because he bought Bitcoin and finally got rid of fiat, and gave that same Bitcoin to someone else for safekeeping - then I know that this person does not understand at all how wrong he is.",

So the best way is just to store our money in crypto, we can have full privacy and we can access it anytime we want. When your account is even suspected for violation, they could freeze it pending investigation, and even if you will be able to get your money if proven you don't commit any crime, still that's a hasle on your part. @OP, I think the post is a bit misleading, it's not the account but the bank itself was closed. here's the full article. https://cointelegraph.com/news/peter-schiff-s-bank-closure-strengthens-bitcoin-case-for-financial-freedomQuoteProminent economist Peter Schiff, who is well-known in the community for his anti-crypto sentiments, had his bank shut down by Puerto Rico regulators.",
