The specific time schedule is as follows:Time of opening deposit: Mar. 29th 2024 7:00(UTC)Time of opening trading: Mar. 29th 2024 9:00(UTC)Time of opening withdrawal: Mar. 29th 2024 9:00(UTC)Trading pair: RXD/USDT(Click to Trade),  RXD/BTC(Click to Trade)Project name: Radiant Blockchain (RXD)Official website(Click to View)Blockchain explorer(Click to View)Token Introduction:The Radiant Blockchain is the best of Bitcoin and Ethereum combined to create a revolutionary capability for crosschain marketplaces and onchain digital assets. Radiant’s future-proofed atomicals-ready design and Turing-Complete Layer 1 enables digital assets to move seamlessly on/off chain with perfect immutability. Its hybrid UTXO/account-based structure enables the capabilities and advantages of both designs. Radiant is expanding through a decentralized community and its growth accelerates as the community grows.Radiant’s hybrid platform prominently features novel and one-of-kind Induction Proofs that resolve the scalability problems of other chains. The unique Induction Proofs enable instant verification of ledger balances directly from transaction outputs to facilitate near-zero fees, as well as securing and instantly transmitting 0-conf transactions at a rate of 4,000 TXs/sec. Thus, Radiant benefits from instant transaction validation, while also featuring a stable 5-min blocktime and scalable block sizes of up to 256 Mb. Radiant’s unique combination of technology and Induction Proofs gives Radiant an unrivaled ability to store and send digital assets, and to offer supercharged smart contracts for the users of Radiant and other blockchains.https://support.digifinex.com/hc/en-us/articles/30380994539033",
