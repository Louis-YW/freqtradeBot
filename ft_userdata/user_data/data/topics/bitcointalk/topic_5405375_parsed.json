In short, it is a race that needs time to be an unknown variable, something that does not happen when it is used to pay bills and provide food that needs fixed expenses.So Answer is Yes & No depend on time",

I've known a lot of people that were into trading but they too ended up stopping or at the very least stopped depending from it as its main source of revenue. I can say many of them were good traders at that time because they made a lot of money from it. But why they stopped? Obviously they lost later on, just like me. Few years ago, someone taught me a new strategy in forex. He was sharing his positions and trades where he earned thousands of dollars. But just last year, I was informed that he was struggling financially with many unpaid debts and his business nearing bankruptcy.    The only people I knew that until now are still trading are the kind of long term traders. They're holding their positions for weeks and months. And they are mostly in the stock market where volatility is not that high. And they have their own jobs and businesses as their main source of income. I usually do not trust paid coaches and mentors. People that called themselves traders but are busy conducting their own paid seminars. They are gurus that read too many books and known too many strategies. I reckon these strategies and learnings won't work all the time.",

What we saw in the last years is an abnormality, the usual return of the stock market would be like 7-8% yearly. And the most elite of the elite traders could maybe double this return, but not forever. It’s common knowledge that it is really hard to even outperform the market and it takes many years to even build a good portfolio that you can live from.If he has 100.000 invested(which most can’t afford fast), an average return of 7.000€ yearly wouldn’t be that high and not worth the risk(as only income), he can survive with this, but it’s much more efficient to build a career out of actual work and invest at the same time. This maybe changes with 1-2 million invested, then it would be like 70k a year. Bitcoiners are used to much higher gains, but these kind of returns are insanity in traditional investments, we should really appreciate it more.So my advice is, he shouldn’t risk everything for trading. If he wanna make trading a living he should maybe try to look for jobs in this field. Technical analysis is not that effective, people put way too much emphasis on it, and forget the basics of investment. Its easy to loose focus there. His best bet is to work and invest at the same time. Just living from investments is a privilege big capital holders have and then there’s so many factors outside of technical analysis that he isnt prepared for, that could make him loose everything. The best traders have insider knowledge/ technology that he will never access to outside these circles, this is really a battle against sharks.Theres a huge hype on social media by coaches and all the other bs, that make it way too complicated and make more money from selling dreams/ talking and not actual trading. The reality is boring, a good/ fun job and consistently investing in something undervalued like Bitcoin by simply dcaing, will probably outperform any trading a regular person can do, and be much less stressful at the same time.If he wants to trade he can do it while having a stable income and prove that he can live from it, there’s no need to give up everything for trading before reaching this level. If he isnt better than billion dollar companies with many employees yet, he will also not outperform the market.",

There is a big difference between trading and gambling. When you trade with a strategy, the probability of success increase. Since the probability of success is not equal to 1 in trading, some people regard it as gambling. However, if you monitor the market, do your analysis with expert advisory  coupled with good technical indicators/ oscillators, you will discover that trading is not gambling. Since it is not gambling, then getting the right tools to trade and making research, learning and adapting to trends and volatility of the market is worth learning. For beginners, it is advisable to learn with just one currency pair. Then when you get use to it, you could shift to others. Trading is worth learning.",

For me, this works with a wait strategy, I wait in stablecoins most of the time and only buy on straits. In this case, very often I make a profit, it seems clear to me, so it works for me.

I don't see anything wrong with the decision of your brother since knows the risk, and he's pretty devoted in trading. All I can advise is to see his trading portfolio if how many he has earning on trading these past few months and if it worth the time and effort. But I highly suggest to have a stable job and consider trading as a side hustle since there's a great risk on trading and it's hard to depend on trading when it comes to income flow. I've been a trader for a couple of years now and I'm going-in and out in trading depending on market situation, Profits were really inconsistent but the profit should be enough for a living. Of course this will depends on the trading skills of your brother.",
