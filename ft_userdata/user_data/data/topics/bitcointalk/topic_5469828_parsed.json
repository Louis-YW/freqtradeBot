I also don't understand why so many people like to compare these two assets when no one forces us to choose just one of them. Why don't we choose both and diversify our assets? Or choose according to each person's needs. OP, if bitcoin is truly better than gold, why do thousands of billionaires, millionaires, rich people and all governments accumulate and hold instead of bitcoin? We can compare, but let's be realistic because both have their own advantages and disadvantages.",

      "body": "That is a weird comparison in your title. Gold is by nature physical and if you turn it into digital, it stops being gold and becomes IOUs which can not even be compared with bitcoin. Similarly Bitcoin is designed to be digital and if you convert that to physical (some have tried in the past), it also stops being Bitcoin and becomes IOUs which again can not even be compared with gold. So if you want to compare, the comparison should be between Bitcoin and Gold (not digital gold). And in that comparison both of them are good for different purposes and each have its own advantages and disadvantages.For example unlike gold, bitcoin is used as a currency but at the same time bitcoin price is still volatile whereas gold is more stable in comparison.",

Remember expectations leads to disappointment and bitcoin will always break your heart if you keep predicting price.If you can own both gold and bitcoin, that's perfect, go for them rather than competing them.",

      "body": "Both of them are great stores of value with just little advantages they poses over each other. If one is rich and easily doesn’t want a very volatile asset then they will settle for gold. As for bitcoin I so much admire it because it doesn’t need much amount to get invested into even a 10$ purchase can be done and also it is easily accessible than physical gold which is not just sold anyhow but bitcoin can be bought from the comfort of your home through exchanges. The risk is bitcoin can easily be lost with just a misplaced seed phrase or compromised wallet which cannot be done to Physical gold. Also Gold itself seems hard to save because the more you have it, the larger the place needed to store it, and this will only expose one to potential thieves. But one can have million of bitcoin store in just a small hardware wallet without it raising an eyebrow except the owner discuss its content with people",

Bitcoin has its good side, and so is Gold, it all depends on the investor to choose the one to invest in the two of them or better still distribute the money in both.Still, the anonymity/privacy and the ability to make more money in Bitcoin for Hodlers are the only advantages I see in it over Gold. But for others ranging from age, feasibility, asset backing, reliability, dependability, market capitalization and others, Gold has it.I hope we just continue to invest in our choice or both and stop comparing.",

The knowledge of the internet is increasing and every thing physical is having virtual version. People talk about gold because of store of value, how long it has existed, even as old as life based on its formation. Bitcoin also has that same quality but only existed in a short time. So the question is at what form are gold paid to those who don't understand bitcoin? Also virtual I guess. So I believe bitcoin will be far more valued than Gold because it has the virtual digital marketing that will far more embrace more people. However, the major challenge bitcoin has is adoption and that is its original decentralised nature.",

Can it be used in any form of business, no choice of business, as long as it is accepted as one of the option payments?

Basically both are good assets when looking at investment, it's like someone forcing you to choose between your left eye and your right eye to see which eye is better (the economy will have many eyes different ) . It can be speculated that the future of digitalization will explode in everything in life, and choosing Bitcoin or Gold has its own benefits and risks.

Bitcoin, sometimes called digital gold, has unique properties that set it apart from physical gold. Gold is a tangible asset that can be purchased, and its price tends to be less volatile compared to Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin's price is more volatile due to its limited supply of approximately 21 million coins. Both are considered stores of value, and your choice to invest in either depends on your personal preferences. However, I suggest editing the title because gold is not a digital asset, whereas Bitcoin is, and it can be referred to as digital gold. It seems op didn't take his time to read through his link and maybe if he did, he could have made adjustments to the title to better match the topic.",

From development, military, medical, electronics and even beauty, everything involves the use of gold.But since this is only limited to digital gold, I agree with the OP. But still both are the best choices compared to other choices in digital assets.And more clearly, physical Gold is the best in the physical world and Bitcoin is the best in the digital world.

If you want to compare bitcoin, then look for investments that have digital properties, and if you want to compare gold, then look for investments that have other physical properties. that would probably be fairer.However, in this case, I would probably be inclined to choose gold. that's because gold is an investment that is not affected by inflation and has been proven to last from year to year, while bitcoin is a new type of investment that is not hundreds of years old. It's just that, I'm more inclined to use bitcoin for now, and haven't focused on gold. I will probably focus on gold when I have successfully utilized bitcoin, as well as gaining financial freedom.",

However, the price of Bitcoin is very low at the moment due to which the price of gold is currently high, but we expect that Bitcoin will outperform the price of gold. As we have a bull market ahead, Bitcoin will double the price of gold when it becomes ATH again. Moreover, there are many stories of Bitcoin being double the price of gold because Bitcoin is a digital currency. This digital currency cannot be controlled by anyone and has a fixed supply, which is why the demand for Bitcoin will increase as its popularity increases. But the value of gold will not catch up with Bitcoin because gold has been a natural resource since ancient times. But people are currently more psyched about cryptocurrencies than gold, and investing in Bitcoin can make more money than gold.
