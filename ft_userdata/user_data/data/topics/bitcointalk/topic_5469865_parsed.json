  "content": "Hello, everyoneI have a problem with my application, and regarding to that I'm quite new to btc related development, I hope you can help me to figure out the right solution.So basically, I have a payment system API, wtitten in Nest.js which works with bcoin node implemenation (https://github.com/bcoin-org/bcoin)The node stores one master wallet and many account bind to it. The balance of wallet is splitted among accounts.The main problem is: When I need to send a bit large amount of BTC, the inputs quantity can reach 400-500, with the correspondinghigh transaction feeHow to decrease commision of such transactions? I've researched this topic and found the possible solution - make psbt's with my accounts, finalize all inputs, extract and broadcast the transaction with 1 computed input instead of 400-500, some kind of payjoin or coinjoin.But I discovered that bcoin doesn't support psbt bip174 standard and the whole implementation is no longer maintained. I was very disappointed.The one man from bitcoinjs-lib (https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bitcoinjs-lib) told me that I can try to use their lib to manage psbt's, and bcoin to fetch accounts, but it seems that nobody have done this kind of a fusion.Â Does anybody worked with bcoin this way? How can I deal with this problem? Please, other solutions or any help are very appreciated. Thank youUPD Some people proposed to use this CLI (https://github.com/payjoin/rust-payjoin) but I'm not sure about it, beacuse looks like it uses psbt's as well. How does deal with my node? And if this solution is suitable, how to implement it within Nest.js application?",

You should read that topic.One way or another, having 400 inputs will create a large transaction. If you can get away with 1.1 sat/vbyte, it's not that bad, so you'll have to time your transaction a bit.",

If it gets dropped, raise the fee a bit. If it doesn't get dropped and doesn't confirm, use CPFP. Or just go for 2.1 sat/vbyte now, it's still less than 1 mBTC for 400 inputs.",

Experimenting with this on testnet first might help.I do not know if this is pertaining to Electrum or SPV wallets, but the size of the transaction must not be more than 100 kilobytes or its corresponding vsizes in nested or native segwit.Quote from: LoyceV on October 10, 2023, 11:25:46 AMIf it doesn't get dropped and doesn't confirm, use CPFP.This is the reason it is good to use a wallet that supports RBF, because with it you can pump the fee, instead of spending more fee on CPFP.Edit: 400 inputs can be in one transaction. The size is not up to 100000 while the vsizes will be smaller, 27244 vbytes for native segwit.",

However, for transactions with many inputs, the minimum increase to use RBF will be much more than it costs to slightly increase the fee by using CPFP.",

Consolidating is still recommended when the time is right, when it's certain that it'll get confirmed even with a very low fee rate.So that if you ever need to spend while the average fee rate is too high, you wouldn't have to use hundreds of inputs but the single consolidated \"confirmed\" UTXO.Consolidating right when you need to send is the problem,since spending its \"unconfirmed\" unspent transaction output will just bundle the child transaction with it like I explained in the previous post.",
