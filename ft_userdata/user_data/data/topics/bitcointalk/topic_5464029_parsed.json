Thanks.I am only following Kashi Raza as he is very active and as us he only talks about Bitcoin. I am have no clue about others that you have mentioned. On X.com I am following Elon Musk and CZ as they both are know for influencing the crypto market. On reddit I am following r/Bitcoin, r/cryptocurrency and r/Bitcoin India. At the moment Bitcoin India is not what it used to be a year back. So think before you join that subreddit.",

Thanks for your suggestion! I was not aware of this subreddit and just like our forum I think checking Reddit would be a good idea. I am following Elon Musk too but would now follow CZ on X. Looking for Indian influencers if you can recommend me more than I would be grateful.",

If this channel is still available on YouTube then do share it's link here. I would love to explore and learn about trading through it.",

I used to follow cryptokanoon on Twitter at that time and then later subscribed to his YouTube channel. I have never seen him promoting any project as he is only into Bitcoin. In recent times on his new channel he has been organizing live chat to discuss about Web3. As it doesn't interest me I generally avoid those shows. I still watch his exclusive content as it is only about Bitcoin and it's future.",

Or better stick ones you understand and skip their shit promotions, clickbaits and hype.Hey! Thanks for sharing the channel, not many videos still every one of them looks good. If this guy had either used English or had added subtitles in English then his reach would have been very high. I first asked YouTube to generate English subtitles for the first video on this list. Eventually understood it was worse than I downloaded the first video. Used an AI to generate to download the script, and used Google Translate to convert it into English. Watched the whole video while reading the translated script. It took some effort but it is worth it.Quote from: libert19 on August 24, 2023, 05:46:41 AM[1] https://twitter.com/ThatNaimishI am aware of this guy and I feel he is not fully into crypto, once in a while he gives good insight on the cryptocurrency news. He is more of a news aggregator influencer based in Dubai.",

Most importantly he shares the strategy that he follows. Most of the influencers do not do that instead they share something from the internet. Though i do not follow his portfolio management stratgey but i do like his entry and exit strategy.",
