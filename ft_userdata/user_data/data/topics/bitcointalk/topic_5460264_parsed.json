The same goes for hardware wallets that are affected by this, Hardware wallets is generating offline mnemonic seeds like Ledger they have their own Quality of randomness to generate unique mnemonic seed and they also encrypted with passphrase and unique derivation path.About older versions of Electrum, they do support BIP39 but Electrum does not generate seed with BIP39 it only generate seed phrase using BIP32. You can only import BIP39 to Electrum if you enable the extended key BIP39 while importing seed.",

Can someone point me to such a list online?The only \"low entropy mnemonic hack\" I have heard of is this one: Crypto flaws in Blockchain Android app sent bitcoins to the wrong address. In a nutshell, Blockchain.info's android version of Bitcoin wallet had a very \"sophisticated\" way of private key generation: it contacted random.org website to obtain a pseudorandom number that was further used as a part of entropy. Sometimes, it was the only supplier of random data, sometimes it used an uncrypted HTTP connection to exchange data, which naturally led to many people losing their Bitcoin.",

This tweet explains that the affected seed phrases were generated using insecure Javascript PRNGs.No good wallet should be using Javascript. Electrum and Sparrow certainly don't. I'm not aware of any hardware wallet which uses Javascript. Notably, any web based generator such as bitaddress or iancoleman are built on Javascript and should be avoided for the purposes of key generation.Quote from: witcher_sense on July 19, 2023, 06:22:09 AMSometimes, it was the only supplier of random data, sometimes it used an uncrypted HTTP connection to exchange data, which naturally led to many people losing their Bitcoin.It's actually worse than that. It tried to connect via HTTP, but random.org only allowed HTTPS, so it returned an error page. Blockchain.com then incorrectly tried to use this error page as a source of entropy, resulting in multiple users generating the exact same entropy and therefore the exact same address.",

Though not directly involved in the generation of address, using low entropy of nonces when signing signatures can result in the private key being derived from the signature with relative ease. A notable incident was with the Android Bitcoin wallet as well.Most wallets gathers multiple sources of entropy when generating randomness, and for the nonce required when signing signature, it is by and large an non-issue given how a lot of wallets have transitioned to deterministic nonce.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 19, 2023, 06:58:36 AMNo good wallet should be using Javascript.

You would probably have to look through the source code and see how they implement it and if its done according to standard. Note that this only ensures that your nonce will be unique for every signature but it by no means guarantee the security of your wallet. In fact, you already have to ensure that the entropy used for your seed/address is sufficient before even thinking about this.",

A quick way to determine if a wallet is not using deterministic signing is to sign a transaction twice and see if the hash changes. If it did, the wallet is not using RFC6979 but if it didn't you still have to check the code to make sure.Message signing should also work since the process is the same.",

Entropy in seed generation of the wallets is a concerning topic that I haven't thought about too much so far. Regarding tokens and random shitcoins, I still don't see many options that are working well and open-source. I guess sticking to Trezor or similar is the only way to go right now?A follow-up thought, if the entropy created by a wallet is in some way skewed - I guess it's still very hard to find out in what way exactly it is skewed and then create an algo based on that info to take advantage to narrow down the actual seed-scope. Also it greatly depends on how many bits are lost if it will fall into a range that can be exploited or not.",

But yeah, if you want to buy random shitcoins, then chances are any wallets supporting said shitcoins are going to be similarly shit. Multi-coin hardware wallets are your best bet, but I wouldn't recommend either Ledger or Trezor given recent events from both companies. I have no idea which other hardware wallets are reputable and also support shitcoins.Quote from: Kryptowerk on July 20, 2023, 12:50:35 PMI guess it's still very hard to find out in what way exactly it is skewed and then create an algo based on that info to take advantage to narrow down the actual seed-scope.Well, it depends. In the case OP is discussing here, that is exactly what happened and multiple users had their funds stolen. If the RNG is weak but not weak enough to be compromised, we likely never hear of it.",
