The software will do its own job. The new version of Electrum has different arrangement from the old version on mobile phone (Android Version), There are only two options at the bottom of the wallet, received and send. So if you are sending make sure you copy the text correctly and paste it in the file box. I don't also think there is an extension on the version 4.4.5.0. I just crossed check the wallet and I didn't see such. But let hear from other users of the wallet. And if they can find it out.",

Electrum uses a different encoding for the QR code data (IIRC), which compressed your transaction quite significantly. That is a limitation of how much data a QR code can contain and it is not Electrum's call. Most transaction would fit in that QR code unless it is excessively big.",

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?You have a singed transaction saved on a file and now you want to broadcast it using the mobile version of electrum. Am I getting you correctly?If so, open the file using text editor application, copy the transaction to your clipboard. In the mobile application, tap on \"Send\", then \"Paste\" and after that \"broadcast\" button. Note that you can also export the transaction as a QR code and scan it with your mobile.",
