Hopefully as the trust in centralized establishments drop we have more people moving towards full custody and act as their own banks and put more emphasis on their privacy, which would reduce the segregation of privacy websites like bitcoin mixers, if Chipmixer could be taken down, then any of such platform could come under similar attack.Be your own bank!- Jay -",

It is all up to you and your private keys, which is pretty rad if you ask me.However, as much as we would love to ditch the traditional banking system altogether, the reality is that it is not exactly practical for most of us. Sure, using Bitcoin for some transactions and investments is awesome, but we still need banks for things like getting our regular paychecks, mortgages, loans, and other financial services. Plus, there is the fact that not everyone is comfortable managing their own money. Some people prefer to leave that to the experts, and that is totally fine too, imo.But, for those of us who want to take control of our finances, Bitcoin and cold storage is definitely a great option. Just gotta make sure we do it right and keep our private keys safe and secure.",

To be in total control of your funds, you need to be your own bank and don't think that anyone can be a good bank better than your noncustodial wallet.

A reminder that with your bitcoin in a cold storage, you can be your own bank.Having your money in the bank and allowing someone else to hold it for you are kind of the same thing, but they are to some degree different. Most people run to the bank to be safe, not just because they want to keep their money with a financial institution or someone who can hold it for them. But they believe the banking sector is safer than having your money stockpiled in someone else's hands. The reason being that banking sectors are legal and fund saving is among their primary purposes, and as such, they can't tempt customers with their money apart from their own if the law isn't against them. I believe this and a few other reasons are the major reasons people trust the banking system.Quote from: Solosanz on March 17, 2023, 08:45:54 AMI don't want to defend banks, but SVB and Credit Suisse's customer can claim his money back since there's an insurance company can backup the banking bankruptcy isn't? Yes, this is also another reason why customers believe their money is always safe in the hands of the bank, but insurance companies don't pay all insurance claims; there is only a certain percentage that they can pay to reduce the amount of loss that the bank incurred. This insurance policy can't even, at some point, pay off 50â80% of the affected customers. The customer is always the victim, which is why the investors, to some point, always get back their investment.",
