Now I need to create some portfolio pieces to showcase my skills and experience in this area.Therefore, if you are planning to launch your project related to DeFi, NFT or Web 3.0, I can do branding for you completely free of charge. The only conditions are minimal revisions, complete freedom, and an undefined timeframe for completing the work.You can check out some of my designs here:https://i.postimg.cc/MHX1vFfc/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/cdvD15ms/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/GhHj2HvM/image.pnghttps://i.postimg.cc/VmDTktPF/image.png",

But what's the catch? Why are you doing this for free?For example if i wanted your services, i wouldn't obviously \"hire\" you as you are not taking any money, but what would you require from me if i wanted to order branding from you?",

Also branding is a number of things, are you doing facebook and other social media covers? Just still pictures or gif type animations? Are you doing vector or bitmap graphics? Can you use blender and other 3d softwares or is everything make in 2d looking like 3d?Logos, concepts, business cards? What are your limits? What will you do and what won't you do?Would you sign us to have full copyright ownership of the files you provide or is this more of like anon hobby design?I might have few microcap projects but i would just like to know more.",

However due to the nature of the work I see that some fields are being gradually replaced by scientific and technological developments, I appreciate the kindness you expressed, but there are indeed ways to build Today's brand is extremely beautiful and professional. Suggest to OP, should use AI to be more creative in improving product quality.",

I will advise you to look towards joining some of these low-cap projects and offer to be their graphic designer, they will pay you will their tokens because they don't have money to pay, and if the tokens pump or do well it is a win-win situation for everyone involved. Now that ZKsync is attracting a lot of developers I would advise you to look into this direction and look for good teams. Wishing you the best",
