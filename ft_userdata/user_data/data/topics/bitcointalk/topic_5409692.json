If that happens, you risk your own Paypal account too, because \"f&f\" is only meant to be used with people you trust.",

The same reasons, I think .... - reversible.There's nothing unfortunate about that.  PayPal has been anti freedom since day one, the fees are ridiculous, and there're little protections for sellers.  It's the worst payment processor for businesses, and only results in consumers paying higher prices for the privilege of using PayPal.And, it's reversable for months.Quote from: DaveF on August 27, 2022, 05:56:18 PMEliminating the risk part, the other issue with PayPal now for US people is the taxes.PayPal is now forced to issue tax forms if you receive more then $600 a year in total.
