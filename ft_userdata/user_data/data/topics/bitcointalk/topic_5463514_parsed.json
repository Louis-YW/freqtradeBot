I will be glad to invest 75% of it into bitcoins, the halving is coming, and it is my full intentions to want to take full advantage of it. Having that kind of free money at this point when many people are aggressively investing spare income into bitcoin will really help me skip all that and position myself well for the opportunity that the halving will come with to make profit. As for the other 25%, 20% will go into real estate, and the remaining 5% will be for my pleasure to spend on liabilities.",

Don't be naive, do you really think that those who supposedly deal with climate protection are really doing it? This is a group of incompetent people who found a way to live luxuriously from donations, while at the same time they did absolutely nothing to save this planet. After all, the greens from Greenpeace are even fighting against Bitcoin, if you missed it by any chance.If I were you, I would invest in a store with homemade ice cream, the demand will be increasing anyway because the temperatures are rising - and you won't have to buy ice cream either",

I don't imagine because such imagination will weak my will power and reduce my self-discipline. I'm quite sure that such type of money won't come in someone's hand without any effort and those who are thinking that something like that can happens then they are still in their dreaming state and when they wake up they will see nothing. Instead of imagining I'll do my best to earn that $50k and then again I will invest 75% of it into Bitcoin and other 25% for my physical needs. I won't waste even a cent for vacations.",

I had only received when I woke up 1000$ dollar scam coupon in my wallet every timeÂ   . I still have hope that I will receive more than 50000$ one day from a single airdrop and I hope that airdrop I will forget and then suddenly show in my wallet. Firstly, I considered that Airdrops were not given dollars but when I received an airdrop from the Arbitrum I thought airdrop could give you a thousand dollars. When we work for it then it is by our heart and we engage in many Mainnet projects. I will do business with these dollars, firstly I will invest these dollars in bitcoin then when I earn more from them I will start a business like some restaurant, etc.",
