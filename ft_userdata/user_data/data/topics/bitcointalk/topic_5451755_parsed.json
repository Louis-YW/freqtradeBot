  "content": "The job market has become extremely competitive in the past few years, while the increasing cost of living and low wages are forcing people to move abroad for a chance at a better future. Personally, I believe the economic conditions in Greece have been deteriorating; groceries, rent, and fuel have skyrocketed while the available income keeps shrinking. People with degrees are struggling to find jobs in their field that pay above the minimum wage and offer benefits such as paid vacation and humane working conditions.Moving abroad isn't an easy decision; there are several factors to take into account, with the most important one being the language barrier. I only speak English; moving anywhere apart from the USA and UK would be a huge challenge because I'd have to learn a new language from scratch. Moreover, you'd have to take into account the increasing living costs of Germany compared to Greece, which means that you must have saved enough money until you manage to get settled in one place.I'm really in a dilemma about what would be best for me. I'll be out in the job market in a few months after I finish with my mandatory military enlistment, and I'm unsure of what challenges and opportunities I'm going to face. I don't want to spend my life living from paycheck to paycheck. It's a good thing that I also have Bitcoin; otherwise, I'd be doomed. There's still something to believe in.So far, in my opinion, the best option for work seems to be online, especially if it has flexible hours and a working schedule. You can work from wherever and whenever you want, provided you get the job done. Digital nomads have been increasing over the past few years, and it seems like a perfect opportunity that provides work-life balance. I believe that it's something that would suit my personal needs. I want to travel and explore as many destinations as possible, so working a regular 9-5 job with 20 vacation days per year isn't going to cut it.So yes, would you consider moving abroad for a better future? Would you try to find a way to stay in your country, either through online work or by accessing all possible opportunities?",

The people in those \"cheaper to live\" country are most likely struggling themselves. It might be cheaper for you, but not for them. The wage you will be earning in those country won't be enough for you to pay and cover everything. You will be struggling just like them. The best option is to find an online or a  remote job that pays well and then you can move around any country without worrying about money.",

      "body": "The answer to this question is dependent upon the country of an individual and the economic situation in their country as well. Definitely, before one decides to travels abroad, have they considered the taxation and also the cost of living over there compared to your own country? You know, some people travel abroad thinking they are going to get a better future, but when they get there, it sometimes turns out to not be what they expected . You might get a well-paying job, but after paying tax on almost every penny you spend, you might not even be left with much money. I know the economic growth in some countries is bad and there are a bunch of unemployed youths, so most people who also succeed in moving abroad may succeed while some may not. Personal for myself, I don't see any reason to move out of my country; I am doing very well in my career, and if possible, I only have the dream to extend my business to some foreign countries by God's grace.",

In any case though, if my kids at an early age wanted to try and given the chance to work abroad? then why not? at least they will have the experience to be alone and take care of themselves and how to live alone. For sure it will be a big challenge for them, just like when I also went to during my younger years and survived and then go back home again and compare and decide what's best for them.",

So many are forced to decide to go abroad as workers. Many of my childhood friends have moved abroad to earn a living and their life abroad is not that easy either. When I talk to them sometimes, I share their troubles.  If people's income increased along with the increase in the price of daily necessities then it would not be so difficult for everyone to live. The current job situation is that the prices of daily necessities have increased but no one's salary has increased.  For those of us who are connected with online profession this is very easy but for those who are not involved with online income it will be very difficult and hard to convince them that it is possible to earn from online.",

I have an acquaintance of mine who works online at an IT company in Germany; he's being paid way less than he would be paid in Germany, but his salary is at least three times the average wage in Greece.From my point of view, this scenario is the best of both worlds.",

And by cost, I do not just mean the financial, I mean the emotional, mental and psychological cost. Moving far away from family to start a new life and try to build and form friendship, trying to adapt to new work routine and work culture in another culture. Sometimes the idea of moving sounds fun to me while at other times, it is just depressing. However, If I get a high paying online job, I would only consider traveling abroad for vacation and holidays and not to stay.",

But it is difficult to change the place of residence. I thought I'd have a lot more to live with as the cost here is still quite affordable even though the average income may only cover a few weeks. There are many things that must be considered, starting from adjusting to the habits of new people who are clearly different cultures and that is not easy, especially when it comes to the family that we have to invite too. Anyone would prefer to stick around and try their best, for me personally birthplace is a very attached thing.Apart from all that, back again to each other. If you feel ready for something new, my advice is that it is better not to decide to settle in another country but try to give it a chance to stay longer. It could be a condition that makes you confused only at a glance, so as not to leave regrets later. No matter how good the country is out there, the homeland is still the most beautiful place, even with all its complexities.",

I can travel for vacation even the very long ones, but I will not consider moving there just because I have the thought that I will have better opportunities. If I have a job in that country that allows me to visit and work and then return back to my country to spend time with family on my work break, that will be good too and something I can do. Moving to another country just because they have better opportunities is not a conclusion that you will easily get those opportunities, you have to put yourself out there and that can be a difficult thing for a foreigner to do.",
