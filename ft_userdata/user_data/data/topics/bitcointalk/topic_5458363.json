I don't know if I am correct that some investors especially new ones doesn't know about it (my guess is because they doesn't have good knowledge about investing yet) because they are new and guidance from experts would be great for them. If you are a young investors then it would be helpful and much easier for experts to know of your exit plan is good or not.",

Dollar Cost Averaging on selling is my plan.Simplifying every thing for me gives me lesser stress. After all, that plan is working both on buying, and on selling.How? Just put a target selling price where you are contented enough to sell all or a percentage of your holdings once it reaches that price. For me, my initial selling prices are $70,000, $85,000, and $100,000 for Bitcoin. I think I'll be contented enough to sell my holdings once it reaches that price. Of course I will keep some Bitcoins as well for long term, but once the bull run starts, I will be patiently waiting for that price to be reached the I will sell.I know we have different strategies when it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, but I have other plans that's why I plan to sell it during the bull run a few years from now (maybe). I still didn't use that plan that I shared, but I know that it will work for me because after all, when it comes to selling, as long as you're good with the profits that you have then there's nothing wrong with it.",

Technical analysis is needed as the main weapon that can help investors understand chart analysis and quantitative trading indicators, price movements and trading volumes need to be used to measure market momentum and asset price volatility so that they can quickly make decisions when entry signals and exit signals appear. You can change long-term investment strategies into short-term after understanding chart analysis, when the profit you get meets the desired needs, you can safely exit at any time, then you can enter again when the market drops.",

So the profit ratio will be more. All you need is a better understanding of the market so the exit plan now is a dumb move to bear the pain so exit plan mostly are case sensitive.",

When buying cryptocurrency your gonna need to always set your target, I mean if you're just going to buy/invest in it and then just let it rest for years you're probably going to earn at some point but you don't utilize the cycle of the market and maximize your profit on your trading. Also, it wasn't easy to see your investment drop at some point, so it always best thing to take profit every time you're going to have the opportunity, you could have some predictions thinking that it might reach a certain price but always remember to set your price and know which to take profit because getting greedy could just make you lose money in the end. The best thing to do is just to buy every time you have the opportunity or something like dollar cost average is a good start.There was no point on investing if you're not going to sell in the end if you just want to HODL your investment forever that would not make sense, unless your already have a lot of money that could sustain you or buy whatever you want, your just investing for the future of your sons or family.",

That means you just buy a token or coin at certain level hold it for a while and sell either its 2x 3x 10x or more. Depends on your level of apetite. This is quite risky, especially if you are a newbie however, a medium tier risk taker could gain a lot as long as you arent greedy or willing to risk some of your money. Dont be so confident, it could also weigh a loss on your end but thats on you to take in.",

Why should they do it? To multiply competitors? All information that relates to earnings, profits and benefits, no one will ever disclose. Therefore, working schemes always remain hidden from prying ears. This applies not only to investing, but also to various professional subtleties. No self-respecting specialist will reveal the specifics and nuances of his profession to others, because this is primarily a source of his income. This is possible only in relation to the heirs.So, dear friend, you will have to study, search, try strategies for the next bull run and gain your own experience. There is another point. There are no universal strategies of behavior either, and therefore, working schemes for some will be completely useless for others. Look for your path.Those tips that will be voiced to you will be of a general nature and will not contain really valuable information.",

This is another means to help young investors like us.What are your exit plan and what exit plan have you used that work well for you.There are different types of exit plans. Some might attach their investment to a particular project. Maybe someone might be investing because he wants to buy a house. Immediately the price of the coin gets to the price that can enable him to buy the property, he would sell it without considering how high it will go in the future. Another strategy could be that the investor will wait for the completion of an investment circle. An example is the four years halving period of Bitcoin. One can buy and expect to sell at the end of a circle. Investors can also choose to exit the market based on returns. One can target a particular profit margin and sell off immediately it gets to the price. Such investors don't care if the price goes high or down after selling. My plan is a hybrid of the three exit plans. I have attached a project to my investment, If need be I will gladly wait for the halving season and if it gets to a certain price before the halving period, I might consider selling.",

It is a refined version of my exit plan. I had always decided that immediately there is a new ATH, I'll exit the market and wait for another cycle. But I recieved an advice from the trading board which suggested that I shouldn't exit the market immediately there is ATH.This is because the market may keep trending upwards and I will simply die in regrets. The adviser said I should exit the market in percentages, let's say at 70k I withdrawal 30%, and 80k, I withdraw 50% and then I can exit finally at 100k.This is exactly what you have said here.",

Because if you're looking at the market and you're very optimistic that you're one of the many that shall benefit on it in the long run, you won't think of an exit plan but maybe for many bitcoin holders, a $500k-$1M worth of Bitcoin is the exit plan and that's when many are going to sell bunch of their Bitcoins. But as of now, there's really no exit plan. Take profits when you're ready and happy but do not forget to accumulate when you see some good entry prices and you've got money to spend.",

We are a product of our environment, we are surrounded by sin so our mindset is leaning towards sin. I do agree that a lot of people don't have an exit plan, trading is addictive especially if you're winning so going out of the game seems kind of irrational that you don't think about it anymore and then you start experiencing losses that you don't know what to do anymore because you didn't think about any exit strategy.",
