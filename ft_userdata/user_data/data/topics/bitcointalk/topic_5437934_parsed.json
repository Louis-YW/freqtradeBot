  "content": "We all know that El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR) have already adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. Out of these two El Salvador has shown significant improvement in their economy. They recently shared with the world that they have paid back $800m sovereign debt. Every mainstream media outlets controlled or financed by the big financial institution were against them when they adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender. Till last year almost every mainstream media outlet had predicted that they would default on their $800m sovereign debt but that did not happen and now many other countries that are presently going through an economic crisis would be interested follow on their footpath. Do you then think that other countries would adopt Bitcoin? If yes, then which country would likely do it this year? As for me, I think this small country Tonga islands might adopt Bitcoin. They have already shown interest in Bitcoin as they would like to mine it using the green energy which BTW, they have in abundance and another reason is that the population in Tonga is not that big for large energy consumption. They are interested in training and providing Bitcoin mining equipment to every resident in their country where the population is just 106,858.  Please do share the reason and the sources you have gathered while replying to this topic.

Last year, their senate gave it a chance to be regulated; however, their president vetoed it, sending it back to their legislature. In addition, in December of the previous year, it failed to obtain the necessary votes in a potential second effort. Anyhow, there were only short of five votes in the voting. Therefore, it is possible that new additional pushes will occur this year. Regardless, Latin America and any other smaller nations from different continents could become the new countries to adopt bitcoin as a legal tender.https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/12/06/paraguay-votes-down-crypto-regulatory-bill-in-a-blow-to-crypto-mining-industry/",

Out of these two El Salvador has shown significant improvement in their economy. They recently shared with the world that they have paid back $800m sovereign debt. Every mainstream media outlets controlled or financed by the big financial institution were against them when they adopted Bitcoin as a legal tender.What does the fact that Bitcoin is legal tender in El Salvador have to do with the alleged improvement of their economy? As far as I know, that country has not sold a single Bitcoin, and still continues to buy them - while at the same time statistics show that only 21% of people used Bitcoin during 2022.Maybe some things will be clearer to you if you read the following information :Quote from: DdmrDdmr on January 20, 2023, 12:13:39 PMThe UCA (university institute of public opinion) has just released a survey where Salvadorians evaluate 2022. The survey was carried out against 1.273 people, conducting personal interviews in random houses in accordance to sought quotas by type of area (rural, urban), department (state), sex and age. It sounds conceptually correct from my point of view. The survey includes a specific set of questions on bitcoin, reflected in the first link provided below between pages 42 and 53, and summarized in the second link’s infographic. The data seems to allow us to derive that:-   Salvadorians believe, in their majority (81,7%), that their family economic situation has not improved thanks to bitcoin being legal tender. There is also a decrease in those that perceive an improvement, going down from 9,9% in 2021 to 5,7% in 2022.-   Only 5,1% considers the general population to be the main (emphasis on main) beneficiary of bitcoin becoming legal tender, whilst over 60% point to the rich/foreign investors/government-president as those being the main beneficiaries.-   74% (*) have not used bitcoin during 2022 (there’s also another 5% that have never used it). 21% declare having used it in 2022. Out of these users, 31,2% have only used it once, 33,8% between 2 and 4 times, and 35% 5 or more times.(*) I guess that there are a lot of people that benefited from the initial 30$ in bitcoin for downloading the Chivo wallet, and that therefore are considered ex-users (thus not engrossing the \"never used it\" segment).I don't consider 21% of people declaring to have used bitcoin during 2022 a failure, though is we go for those that have used it more than once, the figure drops to 14,5%. Nevertheless, taking into account that it is legal tender there, the heavy user segment is pretty low, meaning that there is still a large gap to cover in terms of practical recurrent usage. The stat lacks a historical perspective of the evolution of the frequency of usage, which is something I hope they keep and compare vs 2023 data next year. See (in Spanish, but with charts):https://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/PPT-Ev-Anio-2022.pdfhttps://uca.edu.sv/iudop/wp-content/uploads/Opinion-publica-sobre-el-bitcoin-en-el-anio-2022.pdf  Quote from: elevates on February 03, 2023, 01:57:54 PMAs for me, I think this small country Tonga islands might adopt Bitcoin.

Even if his wishes come true, it won't even be news that will mean anything - because Bitcoin as a legal tender does not mean much.",

The two experiments do not achieve the expected success to this day. Or this can be explained by the fact that the adoption of Bitcoin cannot succeed in countries with weak economies. This is in addition to the Ftx disaster, which forced many countries that showed enthusiasm for crypto to reconsider all future plans related to crypto regulation.In the same concept, there are expectations that some African countries will announce the legalization of Bitcoin as a recognized currency. The governor of the Central Bank of Morocco had announced that the bank had completed the preparation of a draft law to legalize cryptocurrencies, and that the project had been discussed with international parties such as the World Bank. The project is currently being presented to financial institutions in Morocco for consideration and to propose appropriate amendments before issuing the final version of it. There is no clear date set, but the project is expected to be launched at the beginning of next summer.",

The risks of price fluctuations could be lower than potential benefit in the scenario that BTC becomes a world's reserve currency, which is unlikely but not impossible, or when it just massively appreciate in value. But for that to happen, there would have to be some sort of an international, trusted fund acting as custodian, as having public officials responsible for keeping private keys doesn't sound like a good idea.",

It’s more on centralizing crypto exchange rather than using Bitcoin as legal tender they will need to construct a law that will allow Bitcoin to be use as currency to pay for goods while they are just aiming right now for an Exchange. This can’t be categorized as step towards Bitcoin as legal tender and Indonesia is still not showing a sign for this bold move. Indonesia is not a small country like El Salvador. I doubt that they will do this kind of bold move instantly this year.",

I don't see any of the major economies to just make Bitcoin legal tender without any accompanying laws or regulations. So I would say it is not just all about seeing \"Bitcoin becoming legal tender\" in isolation. Smaller economies might have a reason to take a gamble, like a real gamble when actually Bitcoin could make them rich at some point. That doesn't apply to the larger economies. If you take the example of Tonga, their GDP was less than 500 million USD in 2021. Due to a massive bet on Bitcoin they could actually exceed their annual GDP during a decent Bitcoin bull run. In such countries the goals concerning Bitcoin are usually completely different from those of well established economies. The well established economies want surveillance and control. Worse established economies might consider Bitcoin a good bet at this point from a wealth perspective. Very difficult to tell who owns what, who knows what, who wants what and who might already be planning something big. If I was the US government, wouldn't it be smart to first amass a ton of Bitcoin and then at some point in time declare it legal tender? That would certainly have a massive impact on the price.Many things to consider and certainly an interesting question to think about.",

However, we don't know yet how much support these initiatives have locally. The side who speaks against crypto adoption might be still more influent, especially after El Salvador adopted the measure, but saw bitcoin melting down, while the country continued acquiring more and more bitcoins. So far El Salvador is in loss on their btc investments and will be only able to recover it once btc returns to the 40,000$'s price range.",
