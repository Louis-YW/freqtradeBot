How could they buy this much bitcoin?I will suggest to you to first read about the first bitcoin transaction made, then go as well to making research about the first exchange to ever exist, information about all these are there online, you don't need to worry yourself about trying to ask questions as if you're in an exam hall, every information needed can be fetched from just a single search, make use of the forum search engine and discover more about this.",

And also the OP has made more than one topic related to this, so it becomes ambiguous, why did he do that, isn't it better to ask in one post only.",

I would go back if possible. PIts sarcasm post and don't take it seriously for sure @Ambatman know that its impossible to go back from the past. There's no technology has been invented yet to make it happen.But for sure many people would like that idea to happen since looking at the price way back 2009 and now we can see that every holder that manage to hold their Bitcoin became if not Multi Millionaires they became Billionaires with what Bitcoin achieve now.Guess nothing will happen if OP will always think about the past and better he should buy Bitcoin now and hold it for more years or until he retires then see what will happen to it if he experience the same with OG's on Bitcoin.",

How could they buy this much bitcoin?If you want to rewind the time to 2009, this question is irrelevant now, but just for the record way back in 2009 not many believed that Bitcoin would reach this current price so many may not have taken it seriously even though they had the opportunity to buy at that time, $1000 is not too much money for some at that time so some will risk while others will just speculate. Just like new developments and assets that are getting developed that cost less than Bitcoin in 2009 at the current time, some will take advantage to buy and wait for a decade to see what becomes of their little investment while others will just trash the opportunity.",
