  "content": "I have been doing trading and investing for a while with my long experience, I have discovered secrets and tricks. trading is like driving a car with slippery road conditions where panic and human instincts will make you to act wrong ways.How to act if you have entered a position, i.e. accidentally bought from the top, my instructions: 1. if you see that the price is starting to fall and you are already at a loss, sell 80-90% of the coin immediately with this action, you will have money reserves, if the remaining 10%-20% falls, you will be able to buy it again with your 80-90% money reserves. (It work like magic - allmost) 2.start buying with 1%-2% of your total money allocated for this operation, just make daily purchases of 1%-2% for this coin even if the coin is in an uptrend.I know that people sell all their coins quickly out of fear and panic when they see that there is a big loss but this is wrong you only have to sell 80%-90% and the rest you can already control with your money reserves it is like driving a car where you you must not panic but control the situation with a cool head by acting correctly with the steering wheel and gas pedal following what you have been told or the same as self-defense where you have to not follow your emotions but act with a cool head according to the instructions in order to achieve maximum control over the situation.For me, there is no difficult situation when trading the spot market, because using the technique I described, it is not possible for the situation to get out of control.",

Why not just jump to step 2 from the start instead?A price drop doesn't always signal the start of a prolonged downtrend, it can mean the price is retesting at varying times (mostly only a short time) then bouncing. With this condition, you don't have much opportunity to buy lower than the last SL price.",

I understand that many want to just move wildly and get rich overnight and they need money quickly, but I do not have any advice for those people.If you have a few thousand dollars and want to make a hundred grand, I have absolutely no suggestions on how to do that, if I had even remotely any idea how that can be done, I would be retired in some Maldives or Bahama type of place in a luxury hotel sipping my margarita, but that ain't me. I can however suggest how you can retire easier than you should, and that is exactly the method, keep buying small by small constantly and keep doing that until you retire, you will have enough money to retire happily.",

Not using all of your bankroll right away is a smart idea too but choosing the right assets is also equally important. I never had any chance with shitcoins. When they go up they make lots of money but when they go down, then suddenly you don't want to buy it because it is a shitcoin. That's why trading established coins like btc, eth, ltc, doge etc is a way better idea. When these go down, you buy more because you know that they will make a comeback sooner or  later.",

(It work like magic - allmost)I disagree with this approach. If you have already lost 90% of the value of your asset, then lose it completely. It is true that it may seem smart to exit even by 10%, but from the beginning, do not invest in an asset that you are skeptical about, or at least withdraw from the first 10%, but since you waited until price has dropped by more than 50%, so time is already running late.Quote from: Parklane777 on December 14, 2023, 12:44:22 PM 2.start buying with 1%-2% of your total money allocated for this operation, just make daily purchases of 1%-2% for this coin even if the coin is in an uptrend.If you believe in the asset, this is the ideal time to buy.
