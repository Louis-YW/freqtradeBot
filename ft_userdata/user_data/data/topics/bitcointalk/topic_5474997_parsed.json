Back when I totally made posts on smartphone for like 1 month I faced this issue so many times and got frustrated.I am making this post on my smartphone and still afraid to lose it, to solve this I mostly try to preview it so it can be saved in draft, there are many other options available too like using some other text editors to write posts more efficiently even there are a text editor where you can make lists or make table and when you will hit the bbcode feature on those editors, they will convert the whole tags used in your text into bbcode like for list it will use list tag. But I don't used to them so I avoid them",

If you click on preview, what you have written is saved, and if you accidentally click on the back arrow, then click on the forward arrow and the text is as it is.Click on preview and all what you have that you want to post would be saved in a draft, yes and that is good. But I have seen it on a forum before that what you want to post will still just be there if anything happened to your device, as you open the browser back, you will see you post there.But I have used a browser on Android for this forum before, if you close the browse and you open it again or you power off your phone, you will see what you were typing, it will not clear away. But upgrade on the browser removed this feature. On Edge browser on the Windows 11 that I am using, if I do not clear the browser or remove what I am about to post or writing as I do not click on preview, edge browser will let me see what I was about to post before I close the browser or power off the computer. So if I mistakenly close the browser, all I need to do is to open it back and see what I want to post without clicking on preview.But if I want to remove the link to what I am posting, I can click on preview.On the present Android and Edge desktop browser that I am using, if I hit back arrow, I will only have to hit the forward arrow to see what I am posting again and continue. I do not like Duckduckgo for not having this.",

This works for me I don't know if others uses this same browser as I does.

But upgrade on the browser removed this feature. Yeah it often depends on the kinda browser one is using as there some mobile browser like the Chrome browser, Opera browser and some others that when you accidentally use the backward keys while still typing but if you use the forward keys it will display what you're typing again so it basically depends on your browser. In a case of poor network or maybe your network becomes unavailable while typing, it is advisable to copy what you are typing before refreshing the page otherwise you will lose the whole content of what you're typing, and in a case whereby you are done typing and you hit the post button and the network goes of what you need do is keep refreshing the page rather than using the backward key as you may also lose the whole content of what you typed.",

From there I will copy it to my device clipboard. I can do that on both my phone or laptop. The only mistake is when I mistakenly remove the whole link from my browser, but preview can help during the time like that.",

So I just do it now intentionally, I tried to compose a text message and then simply clicked the back button, and when I clicked the forward button, the message was still there. Maybe it was the reload/ refresh button that OP accidentally clicked?I tried this as well on my Android device, Chrome browser and I didn't encounter losing the post, it only happens when I reload the page.",

This function is old with some sites too and it's not about BTT being old per se but the lack of a plan for such a function itself. The forum has tried for itself and I believe they are taking time sometimes to update some functions on it. But it needs more than that, the forum that will compete with the recent technology is deserving of the Bitcoin status as it is now.Also about this issue of yours, I believe that it varies per browser and you might want to update your browser too. I use Chrome to surf Bitcointalk and when I mistakingly click on the back button and later click on the forward button, it retains my typed work. This also goes to when I mistakingly closed the browser or shut my laptop entirely. I always get back my typed work in these cases with my updated browser.The only exception to this is when I refresh the page.",
