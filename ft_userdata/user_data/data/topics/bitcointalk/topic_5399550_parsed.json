It's a good marketing strategy for them if that is the case. It's still up to the developers if they want to take that offer. My guess is that most of them will continue to build on Luna. They are just waiting the result of the voting and the implementation of the revival plans.",

I guess basically that's quite easy to migrate this but that depends on the project owner itself. There will always be a hope for the project that built in the terra network. Betting to stick into the popular blockchain such as BSC. These projects can still get huge demand as well.",

It is not easy to be said.LUNA can be hard-forked and separated to 2 chains: LUNA Classic and LUNA (new one) but to develop and rebuild the two ecosystems won't be easy. Especially the market is in bear trend. People are fearful and have less energy to work. If they look at projects that are in troubles, legal issues, they will choose to do easy thing, just keep watching, and staying outside.",

So whats the problem to spend 5 min to create new token on bsc and let anyone to swap 1:1 via bridge? Reliable blockchain with big userbase is always a better place to find investors.",

I think they can choose more sensible replacement such as eth, avax or bsc network as Ive seen such privilege and opportunity to rebuild what was ruined on Luna. Its gonna be a hard task for them but hopefully these affected projects choose a scalable one that can handle massive transaction and remains its usability without paying a lot of fees",

No matter how hard the developers would keep up with it, there's really no hope at all. The reviving plans, won't work so do the other projects that want to try to help it won't also work.And if I'm a developer, I'll stay away from Luna network and will choose a better one that has a better reputation and can handle its own problem properly, SOL did that and it didn't make that much noise when they've got an issue.",

The problem is they will need to invest heavily in those contracts and transferring of data, patching the projects with chain and putting the previous tokenomics with new one is tedious work. I mean for these previous devs it would be better to start from scratch with same ideas rather than doing those things above.",

In the event of failure, the best alternative network would be Binance BSC, because it has become very popular and has high features, and it would be good for these projects to move there.",

Because as we know a great deal of the developers that create coins do so only for the money and they have no idea of how to accomplish something like this.",

I understand LUNA was indeed a good project at the time, unfortunately what they developed in their DeFi became their biggest weakness which resulted in the destruction of their ecosystem and it was completely irreversible. I hope that in their new version of LUNA, they can fix their mistakes especially in the DeFi ecosystem part.",
