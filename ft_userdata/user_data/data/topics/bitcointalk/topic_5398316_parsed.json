  "content": "Ever since I read about Wasabi’s and zkSNACKs’ newest partnership with blockchain analysis companies, I wanted to find out more about what is considered tainted in the eyes of centralized exchanges. So, I asked them about it. Of course, I didn’t expect much, but I got even less than what I thought I would. Nevertheless, I decided to create this thread and share the little bits of information I found out after contacting some of the best-rated exchanges (spot trading) according to CoinMarketCap.   I pretended to be a gambler and professional poker player searching for an exchange to buy and trade coins. The message I sent to the CEXs was this one:QuoteHello, I am a professional poker player and sports gambler interested in Bitcoin. Over the years, I have had a great deal of success with crypto gambling, which has earned me good profits.  I regularly invest in new coins and tokens and would love to register an account with your exchange. However, I prefer to stay anonymous when buying and selling my coins because of my profession and activities.  I am worried about going through KYC, but my biggest worry is that I keep hearing people talk about blockchain “taint” and “tainted” bitcoin. Apparently, some cryptocurrency exchanges block funds that originate from known crypto casinos and sportsbooks. They consider those coins “tainted” or “dirty”, so they confiscate them or freeze them, preventing the users from accessing them or using them on their platform.  I obviously don’t want that to happen to me, that’s why I am informing you about my activities beforehand. I don’t want to go through KYC. I don’t want my Bitcoin to be considered dirty and tainted.  What can you tell me about how you analyze Bitcoin transactions and decide whether or not they are tainted? For example, can Bitcoin originating from gambling and sports be deposited and traded on your exchange without being subjected to seizures, account limitations, etc.? Am I, as a gambler, welcome on your site? Thanks!And here are some of the answers I received.#1 BinanceI contacted Binance via live chat. Their response contained nothing of substance, and the agent didn’t even try to answer my questions. He was only advertising how wonderful the exchange is and tried to speak about it and promote it the best way he could. Absolutely useless for this purpose.#2 FTXI reached out via email, but there was no response. I then contacted one of their Telegram moderators in their English Telegram group to hear what they had to say. There was nothing useful besides generic messages about how exchanges don’t block coins deposited from casinos and only block funds from certain flagged addresses. He couldn’t comment on anything related to taint.#3 Coinbase    I sent them an email and received an automated reply that they would be in touch as soon as possible. After a few hours, I got a reply saying that I should contact them from the email account associated with my Coinbase account. After that, there was no further communication with them.#4 Kraken They didn’t answer my questions. Instead, they said they have to verify my identity and that their compliance with KYC and AML regulations requires them to continuously fight fraud, money laundering, etc. #5 KuCoin    No valuable information was obtained from KuCoin either. All they said was that I could trade crypto and withdraw up to 1 BTC daily without going through KYC. No info about taint whatsoever. #6 Huobi Global    I got no reply to the email I sent.#7 Gemini    Gemini was the first exchange that said something meaningful. If the coins originate from gambling, they can’t be deposited and used on Gemini. They analyze their customers' transactions to ensure they don’t come from casinos and sportsbooks because if they do, the accounts will be closed according to their support. Attempts to “conceal” the origin is not allowed. That probably means moving them around a bit between your own addresses or maybe mixing them.#8 Bitfinex    The Bitfinex support rep informed me that no KYC is needed to trade on the platform. But the coins can’t be deposited from restricted territories. #9 Gate.io    After I sent them my mail, I was told that my inquiry was forwarded to a specialist of theirs who will answer me in due time. But unfortunately, that has still not happened.#10 Binance.US    Binance.US answered similarly to Gemini. I was told that transferring money from a gambling platform into a Binance.US account is prohibited. #11 Coincheck  Coincheck is a Japanese crypto exchange. Their answer explained that people younger than 20, older than 75, and those who don’t live in Japan can’t register on Coincheck. Additionally, they can’t comment on their regulations publicly. #12 bitFlyer  I didn’t receive any reply to the message I sent to this exchange.#13 Bitstamp  No reply from Bitstamp either after contacting their support.#14 Bithumb  Bithumb is for Korean traders, and I didn’t find a suitable way to contact them.#15 OKX  Their chat support is a bot suggesting different segments from their FAQ. Unfortunately, I Couldn’t get in touch with a real person. #16 Crypto.com  I spoke with their live chat support, who said that the exchange doesn’t have a policy on tainted coins. Upon asking a second time if the site will block deposits originating from gambling sites, mixers etc., I was told to wait until they receive clarification from the relevant department. A bit later, I was told that such information couldn’t be provided.#17 Bybit  Bybit sent a reply with some information from their TOS. It’s about them having the right to terminate, suspend, or limit exchange accounts of customers when they think it is needed. No details about how they handle taint. Conclusion  I wish I had more information, but sadly that’s it. Did I expect to get some detailed info on taint algorithms? No. But I was hoping I would gather some more details. At least, we found out that Binance.US and Gemini don’t allow their users to deposit coins with a gambling background.",

      "body": "I respect your effort to create this thread.I did research of those centralized exchanges and gambling sources problem, but I don't find any discussion except this one Bovada to Coinbase (the other discussion already old). Gambling source is one of illicit sources by Chainalysis, so if gambling is prohibited in your jurisdiction and you haven't KYC your account, your funds will be frozen and they will demand KYC.Quote from: https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/crypto-money-laundering-2019/Please note: Risky services include P2P exchanges, mixing services, high risk exchanges, and gambling sites. Illicit services include ransomware addresses, sanctioned entities, darknet markets, and addresses associated with scams and stolen funds.Don't get me wrong, if they give full explanation of tainted coins that can lead a further investigation on client's account, they like giving away a trick how to abuse their exchange. That's why most of them didn't response to you and some only give short answer. To be honest I don't believe what does Gemini said above (they will close your account), I have been this forum for few years and most centralized services which mention they will close your account if you broke etc etc, but they will ask your KYC first, then close your account.Some people tricking centralized exchanges by don't directly send your coins from casino, but they send it to their own wallet first, so:Casino --> Wallet --> ExchangeIf the exchanges hired poor analysis companies, I think this can be solution since they're only look from the address come from, not search more deeply. However the another solution is you shouldn't use centralized exchange to prevent of this problem.",

Ask them about some specifics about their Privacy Policy or TOS, and they wont know how to handle it. There are other departments within the company that handle the real stuff, but they reveal their methods only to government agencies and law enforcement, not to regular folks who come knocking.",

The response of the other party was, “Submit any papers, we cannot communicate with governments to verify their authenticity,” in other words, they are forced to ask users about identity verification.

I guess it's about how you do it and how much time has passed between those transactions. Let's assume you wanted to transfer $500 worth of Bitcoin from a casino to a CEX and you want to hide the origin of the coins by sending them to one of your wallets first, there are different ways to do it.Withdraw more than you intend to deposit to your own private wallet days/weeks before sending to the CEX. If the two transactions (from the casino to your wallet and from your wallet to the CEX) confirm in a short period of time one after the other (one block between them for example) it might be obvious that it's the same person initiating them. So it's better to wait. It also doesn't look good if the CEX can see that $500 left a casino, landed in some 3rd-party wallet, and then the same amount minus the fees was immediately transferred to the CEX.   Quote from: Despairo on May 14, 2022, 03:53:51 AMAnyway I think \"conceal\" origin is really complicated since any coins that we get isn't 100% free from high illicit sources.

I think in that particular case, you would have to prove to the support that you are not the one who gambled with those coins, you just purchased them from an alleged gambler. You might be required to show proof where and how you purchased them for them to unfreeze your account or allow you to withdraw the \"problematic\" funds.",

If they think your photo are blurred, you need to go back from the previous step and it's time consuming. While in DEX you don't need to wait the centralized party, all depends on you, if you followed correctly the step, few hours your account already done and you can start to buy Bitcoin.If you ever did P2P trade on any P2P (custodial or non custodial), then you're completely much understand how it's work. I can vouch Bisq since it's the fully 100% DEX, the next is hodlhodl and localcryptos (not DEX but P2P no KYC). The cons of Bisq is they need small amount Bitcoin before trade for their security deposit, this would be a problem for pure newbie which doesn't have any Bitcoin yet. While the cons of both holdhold and localcryptos we need to create an account, this isn't good for anyone who really had privacy concern. Their services can save our data sent to them from our connections.There are some guides of those P2P platforms.1. https://docs.bisq.network/getting-started.html2. https://bitcoiner.guide/hodlhodl/3. https://localcryptos.com/#how-to-trade",

And given you can use payment processors such as Cash App, Zelle, Western Union, etc., you can trade peer to peer with people anywhere in the world.Trading peer to peer is obviously different than using a centralized exchange, but I wouldn't argue it is any more complicated per se. And it obviously comes with significant advantages over centralized exchanges which makes it all worth it.Quote from: Pmalek on May 15, 2022, 06:42:44 AMThe exchange wouldn't know that the coins have changed hands here.This is one of the reasons why I argue that taint is completely meaningless. As soon as coins are involved in a transaction - any transaction - then they could have changed hands in a perfectly legal transaction such as the purchase of some goods from a vendor or a peer to peer trade. At that point, claiming that the coins are still tainted is just plain wrong. If we applied this same nonsense to fiat, then every cent in your bank account could be seized on grounds that someone else somewhere once used it at some point for something shady, even if you earned it in a completely legal way, such as from your employer.",

If the exchange has good reason to believe that you are depositing money from certain prohibited sources (as outlined in their agreement with you), they will reject the deposit and/or close your account. The threshold for the above is likely proprietary information and is subject to change. Also, if they gain possession of certain information they would not normally use, they will likely use said information if it is reliable.",

At most exchanges cryptocurrency deposits are fully automated.Therefore the funds will be credited to your exchange account even if they are tainted.It is more likely that the account will get frozen after the deposit or they will at least ask youto prove that you obtained the cryptocurrency from a legitimate source.",
