Even i find it hard to believe that someone will forget about an asset worth over a million dollar. i don't know what kind of hardship you went through but i believe when someone is going through financial hardship that's when their brain becomes aware of what they own. Or you suffer a memory loss withing that period that prevent you from remembering. Whatever was the situation i wish you success in your quest if actually you are truthful.",

Too hard to move on if you're hoping but if the buyer isn't anymore as well in this forum who recovered that wallet.dat file on his own then your chance of getting it is slim. Price of Bitcoin has gone parabolic and I doubt if the buyer will return it on you again, 90% chance you won't get it.",

If I were you, avoid dealing with these people and their shenanigans. Most likely like around 99% these kinds of deals would result to a scam.Again, these kinds of deals should be avoided at once. I highly recommend that you report this website in the forum so that people would be notified at once. There is always that slight possibility that someone would fall into this trap.",
