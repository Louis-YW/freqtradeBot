      "body": "You are right in feeling the way that you feel, however this is just the system in power at play. FTX was able to grow as large as it did, influenced by much more than just SBF, also by powerful figures surrounding him. The ultimate goal? Maybe not to rob all of the people within FTX, but to manipulate the market and majorly capitalize from it. Imagine the gains that were made by those who knew that FTX was pumping up the market, and imagine the gains that they made from shorting it all while knowing that FTX had such a large hold over the space? Additionally, imagine how many investors and traders who understood the market was overbought, thus shorting it, got liquidated...similarly, imagine those who believed in the market, had a margin position, and got liquidated?The losses add up so much more than just FTX, the market manipulation would have destroyed way more than the ~$50b that FTX lost/mishandled or whatever they say happened. It's just a penny in the water against how much wealth was concentrated back to the people surrounding SBF that were in the know.And yet, no news about this. Just a spotlight on the face, and not spotlight on the ripple effect...but unfortunately, that's life. Those who had lost had to have had the risk of losing it all considered, no matter how unfair the circumstances were that caused the loss. There will always be bad actors, and it's not always those without power or money.",

There isn't a metric to gauge any of this happening.We are just people who enjoy development and economic progress. We are not the main actor in economic sustainability, both nationally and globally. We do not have businesses that play an active role in the economy and trade which can affect the economy as a whole. We are just a society that depends on a company to continue to have income to survive, so the steps and decisions taken by economic and trade leaders greatly affect us and will have an impact on our economic and financial stability. Because we are not the people who can regulate an economic system, but we are only people who are victims of an economic system.And it's impossible for us to get out of this situation well. In making a decision, of course there are risks and challenges that we have to face. It could be that the risks and challenges will be greater than we previously thought. But even so, we must not be discouraged and continue to do our best to get out of this situation.And today's quote; \"if you fall, then keep trying until no one else can bring you down\"",

Meanwhile, if we talk about the pandemic broadly, it is clear that almost all elements of society feel this way, whether crypto users or not. What I mean is the Covid 19 pandemic, so when it comes to the collapse of FTX, that's only 1% of the losses of many people in this world.Returning to the focus of the FTX case, which is like tangled threads that are connected to each other. The SBF pours funds into political campaigns, so it is not surprising that criminal proceedings reach large amounts. Some of us have started to know when the SBF girlfriend was caught and unlocked all the puzzles behind the market crash. Both of them deliberately manipulated it in quite a cunning way, even on the first day FTX plan was implemented neatly. So that SBF is able to disburse large funds into political channels to anticipate bad things.",

Not sure if the economy has recovered after almost 3 years but in my country, a lot of people lost their jobs and some people took advantage of the situation and profited. In my case, I just do work from home since it's not allowed to go outside, so I could handle my time by doing work as well as doing investments in the crypto industry, which is a benefit for me. After the lockdown where people are trying to go back to their jobs and recover, the government is trying to announce another variant of viruses, but people have been vaccinated and don't want to go back to lockdown due to they don't have a source of income, I think this is is actually fishy that they are trying to bring back that situation so for sure they are benefiting or what can we say they are trying to\"rug pulled\" once again, cause they have the power to manipulate the market.",

There isn't a metric to gauge any of this happening.Just being able to get through it, I am very grateful. Let alone getting out safely and unscathed. Just getting out of this situation seems very difficult. The current economy and trade with all its challenges and problems is full of uncertainties.

Therefore, I invite all of you to be part of the people who control the system, not to be part of the people who are victims of an inhumane economic system.
