So i think the article is only to hype the price, unless there is a recent announcement/post (on X) of Elon regarding his own and his companies' bitcoin holdings, i can say nothing's new. Most people here know he sold most of Tesla's btc's holdings wayback 2022.",

Although I didn't find the latest information about Tesla and SpaceX ownership that holds $1.30 billion worth of Bitcoin. I still believe that Tesla and SpaceX owned by Elon Musk hold $1.30 billion worth of Bitcoin because they are rich people and geniuses, they believe that Bitcoin can provide huge profits.",

He is the CEO of these companies but he doesn't own all bitcoins of these two companies. You misunderstood the news or expressed your opinion inaccurately.Some information but Bitcointreasuries.net it has only 18,000 bitcoins totally but I think Arkham Intelligence with on chain analysis and real time update has more accurate data.https://bitcointreasuries.net/entities/spacexhttps://bitcointreasuries.net/entities/teslaQuoteThis large Bitcoin stash indicates Elon Musk's bullish position on Bitcoin.It is true and Elon Musk shown his bullish opinion on Bitcoin since the last bull run in 2019 or 2020.",

I wouldn't be surprised that Elon musk is have 2x of the aforementioned amount because already we know him to be richest and he is also a bitcoin and altcoin lover, he can influence the market for his personal gain or interest.",
