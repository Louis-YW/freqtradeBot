Almost all if not all casinos offer some affiliate commission as long as your affiliates keep playing there,they cannot give you commissions just because you referred someone who just registers there and never gamble a cent,once your affiliates start playing most of the reputable casinos pay to people like you hefty commissions like 25-50% depending on what kind of games your affiliates play.Since you have the tools as you say just go ahead and find the people to join these referral links for the casinos and as I said they pay hefty commissions so if you are a truly good marketer you can make a lot of money by this venture.",

What type of   advice can you give a dude like me? Promoting casinos and referring gamblers is one of the best ways to make money especially if you referred whales or players who upgrade to VIP but the competition is very stiff, high rollers usually sign up to affiliates who offer them a percentage of their income but if you're good at it the best way is to first compile the most trusted casinos in the industry, don't think of just making money refer people to reputable casinos, so you'll not be blamed by gamblers for referring them to scam casinos.I've seen review sites still promoting known scam casinos because of the high payout they are getting as a promoter.",

What type of   advice can you give a dude like me? If you have ways to reach people who like to gamble then promoting some casinos (or all of them) and earning from affiliate/referral commissions (there's a difference in numbers as well) sounds like a great plan! Check some affiliate programs on the forum, and simply by typing \"affiliate\" in search you will see many threads about it... I guess it would be good for you to check some of them, I am sure you will find something useful.",

What type of   advice can you give a dude like me? First of all, show what you are trying to offer;proofs of how good you are as an affiliate. Nothing will happen if you'll just say you are good and demanding something already. There are referrral bonuses in new gambling sites but I think you are looking for something such as a package deal from the gambling platform. If that so, you should create a profile for them to contact you wherein your works are there and more of a resume for them to look or use as a reference. If you are looking for high paying projects for such service, atleast make them to look after you.Quote from: klidex on February 01, 2023, 10:11:42 AMQuote from: Crypt0Gore on February 01, 2023, 08:17:18 AMI started earning money online before crypto through affiliate marketing and other, I still have my tools and I feel like taking the next step to crypto and online casino, I am looking for list of online casinos that pays people for referring other people even if they have to make deposits first, what is important to me is finding the highest paying ones as I have ways of promoting that I believe will not fail me or waste my time, also is there anyone into this type of side income thing?

Project managers are an example of marketing affiliates. Also, it has many forms and the only point is for more people to know that certain project or to boost its popularity to target audiences.So yeah, there would be projects to pay but that would depend to OP whether projects will make a deal with him.",

What type of   advice can you give a dude like me? Are you not interested in the ethical side of the issue and is it only important for you that affiliate marketing is highly paid? But what about scam casinos that cheat and steal from their customers? Are you ready to promote them? I doubt that casinos with a good reputation will allocate large funds for affiliate marketing. They are doing well as it is. But scam projects are ready to spend money on this in order to attract new victims.The advice I can give is: only cooperate with worthy platforms, even if their payouts are lower. You would also not want to be among the victims of scam casinos.",

As far as I know, in this forum there are lots of gambling sites that want to make high payments for their users who win legally, as long as they are not manipulated or multi-accounts in the game and win.If you want to become a partner of a well-known gambling site, you need to get to know the parties/owners of the online casino closely, to make you their reference/partner, of course you have certain requirements before you are made their agent.For this reason, if you want to promote a particular online casino, you need to complete a number of requirements provided by online casinos, to gain the trust of them and also the trust of other users, so that users don't get the wrong about you being an official agent or agenti llegal.However, if you want to start references to online casinos that are here, @Maus0728 has shown a list of the best casinos here, from now on you can communicate with them, I hope you can be chosen to be a partner of one of the online casinos here, good luck.",
