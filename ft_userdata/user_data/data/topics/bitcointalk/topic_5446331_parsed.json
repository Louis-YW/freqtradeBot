This is about scam that just use gambling to phishing someone wallet and not a related at all on gambling discussion or casino that scam user.Besides bumping a transaction that requires to connect the wallet on the link OP provided is very shady at all.

With these methods I am sure they make way more money then they invest. Unfortunately all these new people in the space falls the victim for it.

A good warning my friend, you have helped many people from this thread, always prioritize security for beginners and newcomers because of course they are the main targets of these scammers, always warn to be careful when connecting wallets to dangerous sites and always make sure the casino the official and already well-known in this forum is also trusted.",

I warned others, my reply got removed and thread has been closed. Although I couldn't read the text in your image, but I came across a scam accusation thread about the guy in your post and I guess that's the reason for that accusation thread. The fact that the thread was made to be self-moderated is a red flag and connecting to a website provided by a random online stranger is a mistake that rookie makes, or if you ever want to connect your wallet to a site you know nothing about then create a new wallet address and use it. I'll have to search for the post on archive so that I can take note of the casino's link so that I can avoid been scammed or phished with it. Btw, thank you for this awareness.",

But if the site is too suspicious, new registered domain, newly made site without any good reputation, no reviews in the internet, using or connecting your main wallet to it is the most stupid thing a person can do, that's why being knowledgeable is the only way to avoid them.This is a very familiar scam in the crypto world but maybe relatively new in the gambling casinos. Usually the scammer will give you information about any airdrop or free money / tokens and ask you to connect your wallet. Once your wallet is connected, they will get hold of all your funds and your wallet will be emptied.Similarly, many scam web 3.0 casinos may appear recently, and they will again ask you to connect your wallet. As soon as you connect it, the hackers will withdraw all your funds in it.SolutionSo the question arises what the solution for this is and how we will know if it is a scam web 3.0 casino or not?Well, as a precautionary measure, do not connect our main wallet (which has funds) with these casinos. Make a new wallet, deposit only a few dollars with which you want to play, and connect that wallet with casino. In this case, even if the casino scams, you will only lose very little amount.",

This kind of scam has really been for years now from airdrops which will requires users to make such connection before the  carry out their promised withdrawal which never happens, onces one authorize it's wallet to the site, about 1-2 times confirmation everything is gone back then what was targeted is that exact network native token.. I don't really know what length this programmers have gone to now.",
