  "content": "When I first read Bitcoin's whitepaper, it immediately impressed upon me that Satoshi created a currency that does not intend to replace cash nor even serve as its alternative. I'm referring to cold cash. Satoshi's invention is an electronic system. Nowadays, however, you can easily notice how the emphasis on \"electronic\" is omitted. When you search Bitcoin, for example, Wikipedia would define it as a \"protocol which implements a highly available, public, and decentralized ledger.\"[1] Bitcoin.org would have it as an \"open source P2P money.\" Clicking on it would further define Bitcoin as \"an innovative payment network and a new kind of money.\"[2] Furthermore, Investopedia would define Bitcoin as \"a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity, thus removing the need for third-party involvement in financial transactions.\"[3]So, aside from the whitepaper, you can seldom encounter a definition which gives emphasis on \"electronic.\" But Satoshi clearly designed it with \"online payments\" in mind. What was taken into primary consideration was E-commerce.[4]Is it, therefore, somehow a misplaced appreciation of Bitcoin when many are ecstatic every time it is accepted as a payment for a glass of lemonade or a piece of banana? My interpretation is that Satoshi believed that the cash system is a good system and that such kind of system should also exist online. Until then, there wasn't such a thing. E-commerce transactions were only possible with the participation of financial institutions as necessary third parties.

Yes, bitcoin was created as a mode of payment online, that's why it's called electronic payment like a credit card.  But the role of bitcoin does not end there, bitcoin also provides an opportunity for any people who believe in it that they can make a profit through buying it in the exchange and do trade activity, In addition, bitcoin can also be used via P2P for sending to different parts of the country around the world, the speed of the transaction is here and there is no hassle.  So whatever Satoshi's reason for creating Bitcoin is, it doesn't matter to me because the important thing is that it helps my financial needs and even the majority of people around the world.",

It's simply an Electronic(not Internet) cash system. It's a very versatile financial system with currency that could be used like physically cash, online etc, as long as it's used in fraud-proof manner. I don't think Satoshi will be so dumb to restrict it to only online usage considering how centralized the internet can be. And private keys are flexible enough for offline use... A satoshi with evil agenda wouldn't have allowed this. And satoshi must have considerd the fact that for Bitcoin to thrive/succeed it has to operate as an independent system parallel to the centralized system, and that will mean a network of people coming together as a Nation Independent of the centralized system. This fact is actually inevitable else Bitcoin won't be Bitcoin... or it will be conquered and Centralized",

The above simple emphasis on the subject matter is enough to rest the confusion that may arise from your understanding of bitcoin and electronic cash. Satoshi's intentions as expressed in the white paper have been strictly followed,  but the big question is. Is Bitcoin really used for online payments, or it is being held as a speculative asset? The answer is, Bitcoin is nowadays seen and taken as a valuable investment more than it is an electronic cash.",

Now I dont need to mention the history of these and to where and when they date back because we have already studied it in the basic history lessons. Now, if bitcoin is in implementation then it has to wait for very long until it gets placed into hearts of every person on the earth. Besides it is a choice and not the legally adopted one. Let's just give it time and future will tell us what it is worth!There were bars of gold, there were coin of gold, yet today we use it as choice for our trades. We have sculpted it's value into jewels and perfect store value and that is how it is known today. In similar way, bitcoin has just started it's journey.

The use of hard cash is peer to peer. Nothing whatsoever in between. There's nothing to solve there, and so Bitcoin is not made for it. Bitcoin is superfluous there. The cash system is good enough that it has to be replicated online.The problem with inflation is not a problem of the cash system per se. It's more of a problem of the current monetary and economic systems. Printing too much money doesn't mean the cash system is bad.",

So,  he developed this technology to provide people with an alternative option... when this corrupt partnership between governments and Banks failed.

But it is precisely something similar that many bitcoin-enthusiasts want to see. First of all, do you see the transition of payments in e-commerce to btc? Then need to add btc as an alternative payment method. Big companies will not go for it right away, but small ones can easily. And when a lot of small companies offer their customers the opportunity to pay with bitcoin, this will be a serious step that can push big businesses to do the same. In fact, we can talk not only about companies, but even about individuals. No wonder it's p2p.Your point of view allowed me to look at this problem from a different angle. I didn't really like the idea of people offering some local goods or services for btc, but I couldn't figure out why. Now I see that it's a hassle to pay with btc for a chocolate bar when it can be done with cash. Only a very impressive discount or other bonus can encourage people to pay with it. Whereas in e-commerce, bitcoin fits perfectly and can be bought and sold anywhere in the world.",
