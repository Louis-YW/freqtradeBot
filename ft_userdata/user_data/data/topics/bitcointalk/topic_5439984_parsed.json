The Estimated Market cap of 755,111.3 ETH is the sum of the price of all individual assets from the collection, not just one NFT. An NFT's price generally varies, but the average price for one NFT from that collection is around 75.9 ETH.",

      "body": "Each NFTs prices vary and are subjective.According to https://coinmarketcap.com/nft/collections/, BAYC average price is currently at 75.54 ETH, which is mean that is the average of the prices of all BAYC NFTs. You can take a look over https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub, to see all of the listed prices.The CMC methodology to calculate market capitalization as follows.Code:Let (C) be the last known reference price of Bitcoin from CoinMarketCap in USD.Let (S) be the current circulating supply of Bitcoin.Let (D) be the derived market capitalization for Bitcoin.For this example, let (C) = 10,000 USD / 1 BTC and let (S) = 17,000,000 BTC.D = C * SD = 10,000 USD / 1 BTC * 17,000,000 BTC = 170,000,000,000 USDAlthough it doesn't clearly tell it applies to NFT and estimated data, we might assume it also can be used for NFT data.So the formula can be calculated as 75.54 (avg price) * 9998 (total assets/NFTs) = 775.244,92 ETH",
