I have been around awhile and from my experience in managing signature campaigns I would advise you not to consider launching 1 unless you plan on running it for a few months. Companies that launch any sort of \"test\" campaign that lasts a week or 2 are just wasting money. You will not get great traffic unless you consider long term promotions. Don't buy into any speech from a manager telling you different, they're just looking to get a paycheck. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1704638.0 Here is a list of some of the companies I have worked with. You'll notice lots of casino clients. I manage pretty much anything you can think of. Review campaigns, Signature campaigns, Twitter, Facebook, and even offer community manager services. Feel free to drop me a pm or contact me directly on telegram @yahoo62278. I'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.",

I will keep following the topic for any suggestion and we progress.Yap, there are a quite few very good managers, you won't go wrong with any of them.when you have already negotiated a possible engagement, you should insist on getting a potential analysis and proposal on the type of campaign and the way it is run. also, consult the manager about your actual budget for promotion here, I think that a short-term signature campaign has almost no significant effect. especially in the gambling industry, where the competition is huge.",
