I can boldly tell that this step taken by them would definitely yield positive results in the nearest future and I must say this that come bull run next year, they are aiming for a huge amount of profit as a return for their consistency in the investment on Bitcoin.",

Which makes BTC more adoptable and trustable. By seeing these kind of news somehow other organizations also approach to invest thier funds in BTC. These things makes hight demand of btc which also cause increase in price. This news also relates to bull run for next year because when any know millioner or billioner personalities admit these kind of statement officially that makes positive cahnges in market.",

Let's forget for a moment the positive impacts on bitcoins whenever Microstrategy buys Bitcoin and think for a moment to think overall for the community if this is bad for one entity to hold so much Bitcoin. I looked through the company's profile and found out that their shareholders are mostly big investment companies. Well for worth is worth, their stock price would keep increasing that way, they can get more money to buy more Bitcoins.",

Their buying of bitcoin has become familiar to us and I think no one will see this as a good sign to buy in. But I also don't consider this a good sign every time large institutions buy the majority of bitcoin, this will boost the popularity of bitcoin but this will make bitcoin increasingly concentrated among the wealthy. The fact that large institutions buy and accumulate the majority of bitcoin is both beneficial and harmful.",

We all know the adoption of BTC is increasing day by day.I don't quite see the conclusion you're drawing, it's neither a big milestone in what MSTR is doing which has been doing DCA Bitcoin for a while now nor do I see that supposedly helping adoption. When we talk about adoption we talk about more and more people using Bitcoin and this is the same billionaire buying Bitcoin through his company as he usually does.Quote from: Beerwizzard on September 25, 2023, 01:53:59 PMJust reminding that these news should not be considered as a buying signal.

They've bought another 5,445 Bitcoin for a total amount of $147.3 million. I wouldn't be shocked if they add more before the bull run; they've expressed a strong interest in this project and are working hard to complete it in order to increase their earnings later.",

But here I see something a little different, Because the more Bitcoin adoption these whales have, the more they can try to manipulate the market.Perhaps the adoption of Bitcoin by such a large organization may increase interest in adoption among the public, but this is how I see it. I don't think large scale Bitcoin adoption will only be good for these big institutions, but instead I think large scale people adopting Bitcoin will be a plus point for Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry.",

We don't know for sure what MSTR's intention is to just buy and hold (in the sense of investment), or whether MSTR make it buy and hold so that later they will also adopt BTC and its technology into their company (here adopting means accepting blockchain and BTC innovation and then implementing it in the system company). Of course these two directions will have different impacts on the value of BTC in the future.We also need to be aware that this action taken by MSTR could also backfire if BTC experiences a sharp price decline which could affect MSTR's liquidity.",

For the positives, this can cause a lot of buzz in the market and probably investors can follow his footsteps and purchase which might lead to an upward movement in price of Bitcoin. As a major player in the Bitcoin world, his influence could help quell FUD. And for the negative? There's no way the need for market manipulation won't come into play as he has purchased a total of 158,245BTC. Saylor has the belief that buying one Bitcoin gives the holder an ownership of 1/21,000,000 of all the money in the network and while some might say he's making such a statement from an investor angle, I feel if there's a way to hold Bitcoin for a select elite, he'd do it.",
