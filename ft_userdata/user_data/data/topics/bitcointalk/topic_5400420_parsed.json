If Satoshi is a single person, what about the gender? is it a he or she?Another question is, how do you also address other objects like names in the forum with a pronoun when you don't even know who you are conversating with, You could offend a lady by calling her bro, there is gender in all profiles but for sake of privacy, many don't use it. How do you address other members without calling their names multiple times?",

Just who knows who Satoshi is in the very first place. Base on his activities in this forum, the account is not managed by a group and no one knows if he or she is.Just call the person \"Satoshi\".Quote from: Cookdata on May 27, 2022, 03:19:30 PMAnother question is, how do you also address other objects like names in the forum with a pronoun when you don't even know who you are conversating with, You could offend a lady by calling her bro, there is gender in all profiles but for sake of privacy, many don't use it.

It fits perfectly when you are unsure of the gender of the person you are referring to, be it Satoshi or any other member on the forum. If I was discussing about Satoshi in a reply, I would start of by mentioning the name somewhere in the beginning of the text and then use \"they\" or \"them\" subsequently. For example;\"Satoshi created a revolutionary technology in Bitcoin, and they did so by combining finance with the blockchain tech, making it possible for them to come up with Bitcoin as it is known today\".If you are certain of the gender, it's easier to just insert the appropriate one and would be much more understandable to non native English speakers.",

As you rightly said, whether the person(s) involved is not more than one, \"they\" is an appropriate word to use. Therefore, in the case of Satoshi which you feel might be a group of people, \"they\" is perfect to replace Satoshi as a pronoun.But, speaking about myself, I am so much convinced that Satoshi is not a woman. I have read some of his works and his charisma is obviously a man. Talking about if they are one or more does not really matter because, if it were to be a company, even if they were hundred people, they are moving with the brand name Satoshi and should be seen as an entity. In the present world were you need to ask someone you even see which gender to address he/she with, because a man has the freedom to choose if he wants to be addressed as a \"he\" or a \"she\". But in Satoshi case, I'm not bothered because he is even no where to get upset or not, so I address HIM as HE.",

The only way anyone would be justified being vexed on that would be if they actually chose a gender in their profile and then they're addressed differently, gender wise. In that case that means we would've to be visiting profiles to know what sex there's there before replying to a post if the need of placing a pronoun on it arises. I'm sure no one wants that type of stress. Again, some may even have chosen a gender that's not what they're. I've seen a couple of members whose profiles bear ages that aren't justifiably a reality. People want privacy and that's why I don't bother knowing beyond what is obvious about users. Any user who wants you to know their gender will instantly tell you when it's wrongly used. If they don't, don't bother your head over it. I think the major reason a lot of users refer to Satoshi as a he could be from the fact of the nature of patriarchy. We tend to easily believe male dominate every major field of endeavour in life.On the use of the right pronoun for anyone you aren't sure of their sex, I tend to play it safe with \"they\".",

That's close to 15 years in retardation, right? Well, back to the issue at hand and on the point of correctness; I was given to understand that the reason \"it\" is used for inanimate objects. It's because they don't have any language. It can also be used for humans when they're less than the age of having a language and this is why people like to refer to foetus and toddlers below six months as \"it\". Otherwise, grammar scholars will tell you that it's inappropriate to use it for humans in general. There's nothing in the actual sense that someone doesn't have a particular gender they can be identified with. Even a hermaphrodite does have a dominating sex organ.",
