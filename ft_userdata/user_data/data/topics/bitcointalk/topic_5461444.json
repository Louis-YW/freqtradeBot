Avoid bad coin like TRON. You are making a baseless argument and after posting this, Trx price will remain the same from today and the next days to come except if bitcoin price fall which is normal general thing to expect in the crypto market, and I think some few months back, Justin Sun has step down as the CEO of Tron, it is now under the order of another person when he assume one potical appointment, but he is still part of the foundational Tron ecosystem, as such you should expect less from him.When Ethereum was launched, there were some people and investors back then that were making comparism with the bitcoin and today bitcoin has proven to be a unique blockchain and so does Ethereum and Tron, they are two seperate entities. If they have been fraudalent chain as you said, people might have use it because I think it is one of the most use blockchain for USDT transactions because of the cheap fees, so take a breath and rest.",

Avoid bad coin like TRON. None of these points you mentioned makes TRON a scam. I know at least one use case where TRON beats ETH and it is withdrawing USDT from binance. TRON has the lowest USDT withdrawal fees on binance where the other projects rip you off. I am not really a fan of TRON and I don't hold any but that doesn't mean it is completely shit. Some people like me benefit from TRON's low fees. If ETH wants to be the king again, Vitaliq should find a way to lower them network fees.",

What I think is that he has successfully integrated it with USDT through the TRC20 protocol which is also now one of the most used network for Tether. As for the TRC20, I like it because of when you trade and you want a cheaper fee then you have the option to use it. But the tron itself, I don't hold it.",

So I don't see any cogent reason why people should stay away from tron trx in general. Maybe this is could be a personal beef or a hatred towards the ceo and the project team.

Look you are entitled to your opinion, but one thing is that you do not like Tron and another completely different thing is for Tron to be a bad coin, however while none of your points proves that Tron is a bad coin the second one has to be the worst out of the four, so what if Justin Sun released Tron because of a rivalry with Vitalik, even if this was true some of the greatest products or services have been released for this reason alone, have you ever heard of Lamborghinis, more commonly known as Lambos here? The company was started because Ferruccio Lamborghini felt insulted when Enzo Ferrari decided to ignore his advice regarding his cars, and he decided to show him that he was right about them, without that rivalry we will not have lambos, which I think would be a really sad outcome.",
