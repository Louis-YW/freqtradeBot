Just with the information that CPI dropped from 7.1% to 6.5%, people believe that bitcoin can increase in price is naive. Bitcoin price doesn't just depend on CPI, it takes a lot of reasons to get the bull season back at this point.",

Perhaps it will only be seen with a flash crash before 2024 bull run.Now it is difficult to say where the price will go next, it is clear that the level of 21k has certain difficulties for further upward movement, but it is quite possible that before falling again there will be a deceptive upward movement.For now, it's worth taking a short break and seeing what happens next. I also expect that we will return to lower levels before fully entering the bull market phase.Selling now to make a small profit can be too risky if we assume that the price will not fall, but will continue to rise. This is unlikely, but it cannot be ruled out, now it is better to wait a bit and see what happens next.",

Then why do you always move signature reward funds to other wallet. I would believe that you send all your funds through mixer to cover tracks  Nevertheless I share your vision of holding till Bitcoin hits a million. It will be stupid to hold Bitcoin all that time and sell at soon as the showed a tiny growth. A million or nothing. (Or a hundred if a have hundreds of Bitcoin )",

      "body": "To take advantage of this moment, of course, I sold some and took profits, because some bitcoin purchases when the price drops to 16k I target sales at $ 20k and above. Making a few sales makes a profit and holds the rest of the Bitcoin for the long term. This aims to get capital to buy at a lower price when the price starts to correct again if it suddenly drops back towards $ 16k, but maybe it's still difficult for now if it's not accompanied by some FUD manipulated by whales.Right now it's possible that the whales took a lot of profit when the bull market started in 2023, and remember that the Chinese New Year holiday is almost here, the whales are taking profits for their holiday on the Chinese New Year.If you have sold for $ 21k then enjoy the benefits and monitor first.Bitcoin Monthly Returns Until 2022bitcoin returns 2023 whether the pattern will be the same or will it increase, we'll just have to wait",

Those who are selling too fast with the excuse that they are already seeing profits in the near future are people who have no patience and are still doubtful of more increases in Bitcoin.

I personally still really hope for a bigger increase from this month and absolutely do not expect a drop to the lowest price again. Because I don't trade with Bitcoin even though I trade with other cryptocurrencies. So I'm not expecting another downturn in Bitcoin especially this year",
