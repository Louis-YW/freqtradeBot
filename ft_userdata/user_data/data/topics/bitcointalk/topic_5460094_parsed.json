  "content": "In Brazil, a pilot project of the central bank digital real is being tested.Source code - https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding.The presented architecture of the project, which, presumably, will be amended and changed - https://github.com/bacen/pilotord-kit-onboarding/blob/main/arquitetura.md.This news would not have been anything particularly remarkable (the news about the testing of CBDC comes from various countries) if Pedro Magalhães had not reverse-engineered the source code of the digital real placed by the central bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brazil’s digital real). Here's what was found there:Tweet about it. Curious options, right?\"Many in the cryptocurrency community have raised concerns that a CBDC has the potential to infringe on their financial freedom and encroach on their privacy.\" - This wording sounds in the  article (from cointelegraph.com). To which, I can say that it is necessary to express not concern, but “sound the alarm”, because after such surprises in the CBDC source code, it will definitely be impossible to talk about any financial freedom and confidentiality.As usual, all this is served under a plausible pretext: \"Fabio Araujo, an economist at the Brazilian central bank, explained that the digital real has the potential to halt bank runs and looks to provide entrepreneurs with a more safe and reliable environment to innovate.\" (taken from the same source)What do you think, is CBDC being developed for the benefit of people or will it be directed against them? After this article, the scales, in my opinion, swung even more towards the total regulation of the financial life of people.Information taken from:  \"Brazil’s CBDC pilot contains code that can freeze or reduce funds, dev claims\".",

      "body": "It all still narrows down to the centralization of CBDC, the controller could be evil/good and do whatever they like with your supposed assets. I called it supposed assets because you might think you have them, but once it's not your key, it's not your asset, so you are technically not the owner and can lose rights to it just like a dream. The CBDC arrangement is just like the old ways that Bitcoin came to tackle, that's why no one should mistake a truly decentralized crypto like Bitcoin for something like CBDC which is just like fiat and may not offer anything beyond that.Many would say CBDC would give room for more transparency and regulation, but have you ever thought if this so-called regulation is fair? This expose is another good one to prove that your CBDC assets are not safe for anyone.",

Besides, Fiat or National Currency like the CBDC would have to be in accordance with existing national laws that guide the modern financial system. Such laws cannot guarantee users privacy or prevent accounts freezing, as long as centralization is concerned. So, users should not expect their fundamental rights not to be violated by Central Bank, governments or others.",

I think this is nothing new for them and people are used to it.The only point I think is positive is how private banks will deal with these currencies. Governments will have the ability to control and track all activities on the CBDC currency network, and this is certainly not in the interest of banks that have long benefited from creating accounts for their customers with script numbers in exchange for taking their money under the pretext of saving or investing it.",

For one, such as what has happened in the past with criminals holding massive amounts of wealth, their money and assets were pooled into the national treasury instead to amp the taxpayer's money and basically promise to fund projects that will better the common person's life. Of course we know where the money goes but it's one of the possibilities wherein the government can seize control of your money, be it fiat or CBDC. I can't really think of any other reason or way a government could take control of your funds and money other than as a result of criminal liability. But for the record, CBDCs aren't absolved of this and just like their paper money counterpart, they can be controlled too.",

But still, answer to your query is yes. CBDC mean centralization and you better know what happens in centralization.They only wanted to implement finance with blockchain technology so that they could look cool maybe because everyone as you already said started to promote CBDC which is not in favor of crypto. They could stop transactions any time because our transaction will go through them like will be processed by some central entities so that they could figure out any illegal activity and could stop the whole transaction and capture the guy.",

Another thing is whether or when these features will be used, and the level of laziness of the people to accept them. I am quite pessimistic in that sense. I think that CBDCs are going to be accepted and used by a large majority of the population from the start and that abusive uses will be accepted as just punishments against bad citizens without further ado. The powers that be are not stupid and are not going to implement the abusive measures from the start, they will simply wait until they have a considerable level of adoption and start punishing as they find appropriate.",

While the government has control over the supply of it, with CBDCs it's easier for them to really have those accounts have more balance and there's no need for the third-party confirmation which is what we have in the real world through the banks. There are strict protocols that the banks have and that's what is making it for CBDC easier. It just sounds interesting to hear out that there's CBDCs but, I am not optimistic about it unless it touches the Bitcoin market and adds some fuel to its market cap.",

They offer a convenient, safe and efficient digital version of our national currency for transactions. But, there are also disadvantages you know. CBDCs are easy to track, compromising privacy and anonymity. Plus, they are also vulnerable to cyber attacks, and this is primarily the result of increased surveillance and potential loss of privacy. To solve this problem, we need clear regulation, public engagement, and a focus on individual rights and financial stability both in Brazil, and wherever it may apply.",

And this means that almost always this money will be under the control of the bank.Those who want to use money with their card without dealing with cash can already do it without any problems. But CBDC will be the forced use of digital currencies, as governments plan to completely withdraw cash from circulation.I do not believe that it is possible to do this in the near future, most likely CBDC will exist for some time in parallel with cash, because all segments of the population will not be able to adapt to the new reality equally quickly.",
