The possibility of bitcoin hitting $100k or hitting a new ATH in 2023 is very unlikely, usually bitcoin will only hit a new ATH after each halving event, so predicting bitcoin reaching ATH in 2024-2025 will be much more feasible than predicting next year. It's all speculation and no one knows exactly when it might happen but I can only say for sure it will happen in the future. But buying bitcoin now is absolutely the right thing to do, bitcoin price is already a lot cheaper than its peak, the perfect time to buy bitcoin is now.",

I am not a person for that kind of debate, but I got the point too. The more BTC spreads worldwide, the more possibility it will pump up. The world didn't have Covid19 in 2017. What miracle happened in 2017, then? On Jan 12, 2017, BTC touched the lowest price of that year which was $755. On Dec 14, 2017, BTC touched another ATH, $20,089.

But from my time of research Bitcoin has fallen and also rose in the time past without any major global crisis though it is one of the major enhances and determinants of Bitcoin price movement.In response to the OP and in affirmation that now is the best time to buy Bitcoin though there is no wrong time to buying Bitcoin as all time is the right time but you must have to bear in mind of making profit which involves buying at a certain price and expecting to sell at an increased or higher price from the bought price.",

I am sure that OP will not be able to explain the reasons for his optimistic views on the next year, since these are just his personal optimistic expectations without any arguments. OP would like 2023 to be profitable for his investment in btc, but expectations and reality are usually very different.If we talk about the perfect time to invest in bitcoin, then this is voiced millions of times: the best time is now.
