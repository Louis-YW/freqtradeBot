  "content": "Hi guys,I just stumbled across this paper (https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.1054.9020&rep=rep1&type=pdf), which talks about huge vulnerabilities encountered when running a Bitcoin node over Tor.QuoteIn this paper we show that combining Tor and Bitcoin creates a new attack vector. A low-resource attacker can gain full control of information flows between all users who chose to use Bitcoin over Tor. In particular the attacker can link together user’s transactions regardless of pseudonyms used, control which Bitcoin blocks and transactions are relayed to user and can delay or discard user’s transactions and blocks. Moreover, we show how an attacker can fingerprint users and then recognize them and learn their IP addresses when they decide to connect to the Bitcoin network directly.What do you guys think?I'm tossing up whether to continue using Tor or switch back to clearnet.",

      "body": "I think we fall into the trap that Tor automatically makes everything better, when it doesn't. Basically, when ever you add another layer to your security, there's the potential problem of introducing a new layer of attack. For example, there's some real concerns about privacy when it comes to Tor. That's been well documented, and actually made it to mainstream tv shows, but we still automatically assume Tor is safe. The real question is your threat model though. Since, running Tor also removes some of the problems of running it without Tor. It would probably take too long to go through everything that could potentially be compromised from doing one or the other. So, it's really up to the user themselves to decide what's better from a individual perspective.",

Unfortunately I'm not super tech savvy and so I imagine these will be beyond my ability to integrate.No you don't need to run two nodes.By default, when you start Bitcoin Core, it tries to connect via IPV4, IPV6, and if you configured a Tor proxy (which you seemed to have done already), by Tor as well. There is no special configuration that you need to make to make your node attack-proof. You're only theoretically at risk if you have onlynet=tor in your config file or command line.",

If the target were 0100 and you accept 0101 because it has the same number of starting zeros that is invalid hash and the block is rejected.",
