I read some information on Vance yesterday after he was chosen and appointed as a partner of Trump in the President Election campaign. What I really noticed is Vance is a very young man, he was born in 1984.With demographics of Bitcoiners, majority belongs to the young, middle aged people. Vance is not surprising Bitcoiner if we take into account his age.About 20% of Bitcoiners have age in 35 to 44 https://coin.dance/stats#demographicshttps://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/10/majority-of-americans-arent-confident-in-the-safety-and-reliability-of-cryptocurrency/QuoteAs was true in past surveys, younger men are more likely to use cryptocurrency compared with men 50 and older and women of any age. For example, 41% of men ages 18 to 29 say they have ever invested in, traded or used cryptocurrency, compared with 16% of women in the same age range.",

There are also several big name Republicans involved in Bitcoin and the Mining Industry, like Ted Cruz for example.Thank you, OP for pointing out this fact about the vice president nominee JD Vance. With this choice, Donald Trump has further shown his seriousness about promoting crypto-friendly policies if elected president. Politicians cannot be trusted but at least this is a candidate who has firmly opposed anti-crypto laws in the Senate and has openly criticized SEC's policy mandating banks to report crypto as liabilities on their financial books. He is young and owns Bitcoin, I am beginning to see Trump's sincerity regarding his pro-crypto stance. It is also possible that this move is to gain financial support and attract young voters, only time will tell.",

If it's both him and VP, the USA might change its policies and become more crypto-friendly. However, I still hope that when people eligible to vote in these elections choose who to vote for, their main priority won't be crypto stance. Presidency comes with a lot more than that, and even if someone is very pro-Bitcoin, it is still important to ensure that one's views generally align with the Republicans and with Trump's vision specifically.",

And surely, the idea is brilliant, but Trump will always be Trump, he is deceptive and self-serving and I only hope he will be able to do anything positive in the crypto world during his tenure as his lousiness may only be noise.Because from the beginning to the end of his administration (if he wins again), he can't have all his ways even if he wishes to, he is not going to manipulate all the people working with him, including the SEC, many US people have their own beliefs and integrity, otherwise, they resign. Not to mention many other manifestos that must pass Congress. He is not the sole decide in everything.",
