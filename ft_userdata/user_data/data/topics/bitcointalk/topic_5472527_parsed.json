Sorry mate, that won't be possible unless you have a good reason why you want to change your username or are going to pay a donation of 50btc.Quote from: mprep on July 21, 2014, 05:27:51 PMQ: I want to change my forum username. What should I do?A: You can either donate 50 BTC to become a VIP or PM theymos asking to change your username (although he rarely accepts such requests nowadays).If you really don't like your current username, and want to change it so badly I would advice you to just create a new account. aside from that I don't think theymos will grant you such request.",

One thing I deduced is, if it is concerning you running a forum business or about a company reputation then it gets change easily and also you might find it difficult to get a change if the new requested name has Almost a similar name already existing on the forum. For newbie, they don’t just stand a chance base on this facts",

Change username or display name is not easy and you only can get that change if you are a VIP member (with 50 BTC donation) that you are not or you get acceptance from theymos.To convince theymos changing your username or display name, you must have very solid reason like something is dangerous for your privacy, dox, etc. He barely accepts request from forum members to do that.only moderators, Donators, and VIP members can change their names automaticallyTheymos only changes username to Anonymous on requestHow to destroy your account? Change email to random, password & log outYou can not change your username. If your account is new, create a new account, abandon your current account.How to edit my username?",

If I can remember correctly, people that asked theymos to change their name, theymos changed it last year December for many of them.I'm aware that a lot of members have changed their names here on the forum, and some more than once's a member like Cryptovator; if not up to three times now, they all got approved. When I said it wouldn't be approved, I was referring to the OP, not even giving him high hopes. This is because many people have complained that their request was not fulfilled and their name was not able to be changed. These people were newbies and others who had not yet built a reputation on the forum. Secondly, they did not give a tangible reason for why the name needed to be changed. I doubt an account that has zero merit and a newbie rank will be in a hurry to ask for a name change, and I don't see it standing any chance of getting that request approved. That's why I never give the OP high hopes of applying; creating another account with the OP's desired username is just the best option I can see for the Op; there is no harm in trying, so he can still give it a try too and see what comes out of the result.",
