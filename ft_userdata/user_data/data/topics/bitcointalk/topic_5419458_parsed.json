How do you think online casinos and sports betting platforms are adjusting to manage the situation?Business wise, I think everyone is doing good, at least those who are established already. Specially during the pandemic, everyone is just at home in the last couple of years so they are raking big money I assumed. Unlike the traditional and land base casinos who are force to go offline for months even years because of covid-19. So there could be growth in online as players around the world continue to gamble using fiat and crypto based platforms. And you can also observed that there are casinos that pop up during 2020 that still manages to stay in the game.",

      "body": "A lot of countries still have strong employment statistics iirc.Gambling sites probably do like most gaming or online sites and have measures that manage resources depending on load. If you've only got 4 people playing live blackjack, you don't need more than a 3 or 5 dealers on standby ready to go live if they're needed.A lot of companies using games like slots don't need to run as many servers and can send some into standby mode at low load times (most machines from hibernation can take a few seconds to come live again). For the owner of the company it's up to them whether they need to extend cash reserves by expanding their company, audience or taking some other job to ensure they can remain afloat. I think creditors of previously profitible businesses are easy to find if you can prove you were once profitible and it's only the economic downturn that's made your business no longer financially stable/sustainable. I don't think sports betting costs much to keep going either as many sites can outsource for statistics (such as paying for data from a company covering it live). The only main issue I'd see with sports betting is if few enough people bet that it becomes something that creates too much loss but they can normally adjust their odds or the way they're calculated to counteract this.",

They can provide some bonues to entice peers and possible players on their platforms but that's just about it. They're doing great in terms of raking in profits and getting all the attention that they needed in order to attract new customers. Perhaps they'd only fall off if they fall short on what they previously promised to offer their players and if the service no longer feels like they want the money of their players.",

How do you think online casinos and sports betting platforms are adjusting to manage the situation?Online casinos is one business that is no much affected by the current economic crisis. Even during the pandemic when all other businesses were closed, the online gambling platform still continued its operations without much difficulty. Though the number of players and gamblers may reduce but the situation was very much better as compared to other businesses which were closed.Quote from: Jating on November 04, 2022, 08:31:03 PMDoes casino really have high maintenance as compare to land base?

And even if they will replace them, it's very easy to find someone, the way I see it.Being online means that you do not have to buy the building or pay the rent. You are saved with maintenance costs and no matter what is the on the ground situation, your business will never suffer. Secondly, even if people have little money, they will try to spend it on gambling and betting, as for most people gambling has become a need.",

There are still games being played around the world that is being covered by casino, so it is still running for him. As for the number of people, yes possible that they are a only a few of them but in rotation and probably working at their home to do support task, so very low cost maintenance for the casino themselves.",

Demographics with high income margins where disposable income will not be significantly affected by rising food or fuel costs.A second more desperate move would be to shutter physical brick and mortar locations to cut lease costs and focus more on internet business.Lake Mead drying up in Vegas could force casinos there to seek to establish a new US city or state as the de facto gambling headquarters in the country.But if we're being honest profit margins for many casinos are so large that they will not necessarily need to adjust or change their business to maintain profitability as the global gambling industry is expected to grow, or at a bare minimum, sustain itself.",

If not, they should be fine. If you're asking about covid, the bans have been lifted so they should be fine, unless if they are in China because there are crazy things going on in that country. According to recent news they were making employees live in factories because they were afraid of letting them go home and potentially spreading covid and now more and more workers break out of their quarantine and run home. A casino surely can't function in such climate. If you're asking about war in Ukraine, casinos are probably not doing so good in the war zone.",

At times the failure of gambling platforms happen at the initial days when they weren't able to support with a good funding. Someone winning a bumper will affect its payout and end the service. These days we don't see much of such situation. Everything is developed in a perfect manner to avoid security issues and bugs that ruin the platform and end the service.",

Not that it's an impossibility for some big online casinos to lay off employees in the near future though. I also don't think casinos would have a big problem with regards to developing, most online casinos grew pretty well during the pandemic and that should've been enough time for them to build a solid foundation to at least weather through the current situation. The biggest layoff I know about casinos was physical ones, and that was back at the start of Covid. There's also some recent news about possible layoffs from Macau casinos, but that's the most I know.",

In recent months, there have been some signature campaigns that have ceased or have been put on hold, but there have also been some new ones, and if we look at the budgets they are managing, they must be making good profits and getting good ROI.I mentioned this in another thread:Quote from: Don Pedro Dinero on November 02, 2022, 04:25:41 AMThis makes me wonder how much money the casinos must make. If they fill the 100 users let's put a modest average of 50 USD a week, that would be 20,000 a month, just in advertising, and obviously the casino generates a much higher figure in net profit.The livecasino.io in which I participate fills the escrow every month with about 10,000 USD. Obviously it is profitable for the casinos, otherwise they wouldn't do it. And even in the current bear market and with inflation, new casino campaigns have not stopped coming out. Although some of them have stopped or ended. But it seems that even with the crisis there is always money for vices moving.(Translated from Spanish).",

Then for those casinos that are struggling, I think they have to take the risk of putting up a promotion or some way to get their casino out there so they could get the best value out of their budget and at the same time slowly reduce their losses.",
