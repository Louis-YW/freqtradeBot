      "body": "I have already done a survey on this issue, and what I discovered is that all this issue comes from the cost of fuel because many farmers that farm are complaining that the amount of fertiliser is very high and the cost of transportation from their various locations to the city is very high, so if they don’t increase the amount of product they sell, they will end up losing money and might not farm again. I even visited some near-by villages, and some farmers told me that they just farm what they can profit from, and most maize farmers didn’t farm maize this year because of the high cost of fertiliser, so with this, I can say Nigeria is getting to something else. All I can say it let work hard and pray",

I'm asking because I'm not sure if 1k is enough to feed me because baba, me I dy chop well in the morning and I make sure everything set. Let's look at it this way bro.A loaf of bread soft one fit cost you ₦800, milk tin now na ₦500, you buy milo or any other beverage to add as ₦200, that's like ₦1500. If you come say you wan fry egg join, na more than ₦2,000 you dy spend be that. Na average wetin you fit chop as naija be this because I know no wetin you wan do with ₦1,000, e no go do except you wan dy drink akamu in the morning.  Now back to the matter, brother man, the truth or this matter na fuel subsidy removal na why everything don cost like this. Any sales that involves transportation has increase the price of their products and it's a normal thing in economy that when basic price of things are increase without alternative, other price of goods and services will also increases because they need to adjust their financial support to meet the current state of the economy. If price of rice was ₦1,000 and then the price jumped to ₦3,000, expect every other price of things to increased because the sellers need rice, they will also adjust their price so they can e able to buy and eat too while maintaining their business.There is nothing in this country that does not need transportation and as long say the price of fuel they up, we go dy buy things high but if they are able to stablise the USD at the current price that it's been sold, things will be stabilized for a while because we depends on refined fuel from outside the country and if dollar price continues to go up, then every price of goods will increaeas well.",

I dey always dey scared to even discuss this kind of matter because I no fit even imagine how I dey take cope on top this economy again. Na why person suppose dey thank God fof the level wey we don reach so far. For basically being alive.The way e difficult to get money now for the country, e be like person wey wan climb mountain everest with him bare hands and feet. On top of this money and job unemployment, things con dey skyrocket and none wan come down. Even dollar and fuel just dey rise they go at their peaks.The question be say, how poor man wan take survive like this, when to eat better food on an average now reach ₦1,000 naira per meal. And an equivalent of ₦3,000 per 3 square meal.With the figures wey dey above, make we take laborer wey dey do strong work for instance. As a laborer you need eat food make u get energy do work. How much be your payment for 1 day wey you work? For this side of the country e no pass ₦2,500 per day. Now make we say, the laborer wan drink tea and bread for breakfast which takes like ₦500. Small lunch come be like ₦800 and dinner like ₦800 too. That na total of ₦2,100 out of the ₦2,500 wey him collect with ₦400 as the change wey remain.Abeg, when this person wan buy clothes to wear, buy other person needs, pay house rent con even send small back home?You see, this and more na the reason why people dey sleep under bridge and na why many people dey hostile to each other.",

Everyone is just trying to survive it is no longer about how well you are doing. because even housing is becoming ridiculously costly, because despair is terrible and leads to a slew of unpleasant outcomes, both mentally and physically.",

It is really annoying to witness the current skyrocketing and instability in the price of things in Nigeria, when you go to the market today to buy something, if you go the next day you find out that the price has dramatically increased, that's insane.Our bad politicians contributed to this harsh situation in the country due to their selfishness and is affecting everyone, forgetting that both the poor, middle class, and rich go to the same market.",

Where you dey get dat statistics from say dem dey pay average Nigeria #150k abi u dun forget say our minimum wage na #30k and no need to dey convert am to dollars, na we we dey hear so we understand ourselves. Na local board be dis and everything need dey local. Wetin me I know na say the average Nigeria salary na #50 +/- and I dey putt together all the official and jobs wey dem dey pay #70k, #80k, #90k etc and unofficial jobs wey dem dey pay less. The big jobs self go hard before dem pay you reach $100k and dat's if you see the job oh because wetin I know na say job no dey the country and now all this filling station attendant, super market attendant and other small small private companies jobs na him dey and those people dem no dey pay dem pass #60k.",

And we dey farm dey produce rice and garri, even most raw materials wey them dey use to make process food we get am, how come everything cost like this. Watin we go say be the cause of this one now. E Don vex me all person money now dey go for food. Abeg make una contribute for this matter I know say e dey vex all of us This 700 - 1000 naira to use chop breakfast na only if now one person wants to take the breakfast, and you no go chop belle full so that the 700 or 1000 naira go do you for the breakfast.In my view, flooding and the high cost of fuel are the costs while some things do cost for this country. For instance, if flood happens as e happened last year, e go make people way get farms in those areas where flood enters to harvest their produce when e never matured and sell it at a low price, when those people way flood no effect go harvest their farm produce to sell for market, them go sell their farm produce at a very high price because say e dy limited for that periodThe high cost of fuel follow keeps our country like this, we know say anywhere way transportation cost standard of living goes dy high too. Even to visit  person from this country na war if you reason money way you go spend for transportation you go just say make you relax o. Before to go buy garri from village come city to sell go cost you small money for transportation but now to buy garri from village come city na war because only the money way drivers go take from the garri way you carry go almost come out the money way you used to buy the garri half. Na this thing cost if them done dy successfully bring garri  come city them go sell one custard 1700 naira to get gain for their business. Na all these tins I talk above na in me see dy cost why food items dy cost for this country so.",
