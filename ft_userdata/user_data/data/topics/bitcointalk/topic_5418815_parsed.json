  "content": "Quote from: JollyGood on October 28, 2022, 07:23:14 PMQuote from: FatFork on October 15, 2022, 09:35:09 AMQuote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 15, 2022, 07:55:36 AMI am going to distrust you exactly for the reason of your strong urge of leaving feedback. There are no other reason. You are possibly a good fella in the community.I don't think this is the best way to use your custom Trust list. \"You should exclude users who leave inaccurate feedback.\" [reference] , but I guess that's your prerogative and you can do whatever you want with your trust list as far as I'm concerned. Although I'm not entirely sure what I did to step on your toes, I don't really care. You did nothing and you did not step on his toes. He is an attention-seeking troll as you probably know from other threads where he and his buddies were defending the indefensible while spouting nonsense about me and other members that challenged them. For what it is worth, him distrusting you is meaningless because the troll himself is untrustworthy.Quote from: Ratimov on October 16, 2022, 05:20:08 PMFatFork, I support your neutral tag, thanks for bringing this to your attention.  In this case, this is a clear abuse of the merit system, and in 2018, red tags were left for such cases immediately, so the neutral tag, written without any insults, it really is the place to be. But arguing with those who have double standards in the use of trust system, in my opinion, is pointless. You are right, it is a clear abuse of the merit system and it most probably should be addressed and noted.As for those that have double standards in the trust system (such as the troll following FatFork around), you are absolutely correct, it is pointless to either debate, engage with or argue because they are not worth giving any attention to. Speaking of which, I found this feedback that was left for you somewhat laughable because it is ridiculous and should never have been left but when they are driven by revenge the trolls and attention-seekers do weird things:I noticed several times JollyGood wants to devalue everyone with his words who do not support his feedback abuse. This is one of the example from many. You are seeing he is talking to FatFork (in a discussion which was already dead) and deliberately choosing words which are troll, untrustworthy, spouting nonsense. He is doing it to justify his feedback leaving habit. The neutral I left for Ratimov was also found interesting by him as if it was supposed to be a negative.The words he deliver towards the people he does not like, on his negative feedback he left for others at-least shows that he is disrespectful and feels happy when insulting the people he does not like. He also does not have the ability to admit his own mistakes. Obviously have egocentric issues. All these concludes me JollyGood may need to seek professional advice for his mental health. He do things out of overzealousness and obsession. Recently I am seeing he is leaving neutral feedback to others for low quality posts and as he is taking it as a matter in his own hand. He could just report the low value posts to the moderator and could have a personal note for himself using a plugin created by TryNinja. His attitude is, he always wants to devalue others either it's with a negative feedback or neutral feedback (seems a new strategy for him because others are started to talk against the negatives recently*) or even in a dead conversation.*https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5418565.0https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5417940.0",

He could just report the low value posts to the moderator and could have a personal note for himself using a plugin created by TryNinja. All of the other points before this aside, leaving a neutral feedback for a shitposter is acceptable and in some cases desirable.  By putting into words on a member's trust page just how bad of a poster he/she is, you're (hopefully) warning campaign and bounty managers that they won't be a good prospect.I've left those kinds of feedbacks plenty of times, and if you look on my trust page and see what I've left for people in the years 2016-2017 there will probably be zillions of neutrals related to post quality.I think JollyGood is willing to listen to advice and change his habits. I'd like to see him remove all of those feedbacks that have nothing to do with anything forum-related.  Neutrals are another story, though.  If you ask others, they'd probably tell you that a neutral is the way to put a note on a member's profile.  Not a big deal.",

All of those neutrals IMO are fine looking at the examples you posted. I look at tags when filling a campaign, red or neutral, to determine if I want to give a user a spot.

      "body": "I don't see anything controversial about the neutral feedbacks from JollyGood. Maybe it's because some spammers are quick to overreact when being caught and making a lot of drama. Spam is still a problem and the Gambling section is prone to it. Neutral feedback is certainly helpful in some sort to \"warn\" spammers and make campaign managers aware of low quality posters. Spam and shitposting has to be discouraged. And shitposters should be aware that complaining too much after being caught could result in much more troble (ending on a blacklist / more neutral trusts or even possibly a negative trust from JollyGood). That's some sort of deterrence to avoid shitposting, see the post from DaveF.  Of course, when submitting a neutral feedback, we should also provide a meaningful reference link to prove our feedback. And the recent case is a good example how the spammer admitted his mistake and the issue has been settled.",

I'm just trying to make a little contribution regarding neutral trust that has been given, I have nothing against jollygood or other members giving neutral trust, but my suggestion is that if a user is being tagged as a shit poster, remember that we all joined the forum as newbie, and over time, our posts quality have gotten better as a result of learning more about bitcon and cryptocurrency in general, am sure nobody will want to wake up every day to keep on seeing that their account has been tagged for the mistake made when they just joined the forum, so I'm only trying to make a suggestion, but am sure not everyone will agree with me, or let me say it won't really make sense to everyone. I think it will be nice if we all go through our trust feedback after few months or even after one year just to check people that have been tagged as shit posters if there is improvement in their post quality and if you are satisfied with their post quality, I think the neutral trust should be removed and if there is not improvement in post quality, then the neutral trust should remain. This is just a suggestion which am sure not everyone have time for that, but have seen some accounts which have been tagged as shit poster since 2020, but if you check their post quality now, it has really improved but the neutral trust still remain, am sure nobody will be happy seeing that kind of review on their profile.",

Of course, OP can't be on their ignore list  Yes, really his feedback is a little sharper, seems to have less than zero tolerance for any hint of abuse. It is also obvious that he has made many mistakes and overreacted through negative tags. I have actually seen several cases where JG changed the feedback after a suggestion, which in a way is the positive side of the whole thing. (for example, this was not the case for Lauda). now it's more a question for JollyGood himself, why did it happen that he often has to revise his feedback?maybe he could review all his feedback once more and possibly change it to neutral, purely to prevent any new dramas. but I believe it is too much work.As for the influence of such tags on participation in signature campaigns, I don't think it's a big minus. most serious managers know how to \"read\" this kind of feedback.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 30, 2022, 11:12:39 AMRecently I am seeing he is leaving neutral feedback to others for low quality posts and as he is taking it as a matter in his own hand.
