  "content": "Hello everyone! I am new to this forum so apologies if I missed some rules. I would like to talk about our new project launch, RTK Direct, and take your input/feedback on the project as a whole. What is GNSS?Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) refers to a constellation of satellites providing signals from space that transmit positioning and timing data to GNSS receivers. The receivers then use this data to determine location.SourceWhat is proof of coverage?RTK depends on what we call is proof of coverage. The more hotspots that we have in our network, the more coverage we can provide to our clients. The clients use this GNSS coverage for their business use, for example farming, land surveying, building, automotive industry, and any other domain that uses GPS coverage for millimeter-precise measurements. These clients pay the RTK network for this consumption, and this payment is then used to top-up the RTK liquidity for our community. Worth a readWhy join RTK Direct? We invite you, the crypto community, to help us expand our network and easily earn passive income without doing much. Any user can join the network and buy a GNSS hotspot, then deploy this hotspot anywhere at home, office, or whenever you have stable power. After deploying the hotspots, you can connect that hotspot to our world wide network and start earning RTK tokens in real-time. You mint RTK token on-demand, whenever you want to withdraw, you are free to do so, and most importantly, you can stake RTK tokens to earn APR over time as well. It is an easy and safe way to earn passive income as our network is constantly growing and there is a high demand for this kind of coverage.
