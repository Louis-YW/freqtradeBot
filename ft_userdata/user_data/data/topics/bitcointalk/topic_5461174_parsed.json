I did a search on \"digiruf\" and I got no result but as for the former name \"capital investment hub\" I found out that it is an online forex broker. If indeed you're referring to an online broker or anything related to an investment you have to explain more and if possible add more links.As you can see in from the post above mine, without proper information everyone will take your post to be a completely different thing. So do well to edit your post and add more details or just add it as a new reply that is if you ever return to this thread again.",

You friend definitely might have boarded the wrong flight. Did she not do her own research before engaging with them? Because from experience, it is normal that trust pilot review should be able to have details about the organisation or possibly other review sites as well should have peoples response about them but if it happens that nothing is being said about them then you should not need anybody to tell you the truth about them. Note that they are scammers and lastly going to regulatory body wouldn't help because there is no way they can do anything about it when it happens you too have no idea where the scammers and there is no trace about them.",

If they fed your lady friend a bunch of bullshit to get her to (fake) invest with them, what makes you think they are actually headquartered where they say they are or based in USA at all?

Based on https://www.wikifx.com/en/dealer/2831798801.html, they aren't licensed or regulated, and investors should better stay away.",
