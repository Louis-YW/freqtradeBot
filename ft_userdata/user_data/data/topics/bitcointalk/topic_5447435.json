  "content": "No one knows for sure when the next halving will occur, but experts predict it will happen in April 2024. Bitcoin hit an all-time high or what we commonly know as the all-time Hay at $69,045. Many experts do not hesitate to share their predictions for the future of Bitcoin with halvings which will help reduce the speed of adding new Bitcoins and keep BTC circulating to avoid true inflation.What is the effect of the Bitcoin halving on the price of Bitcoin, is the growth of Bitcoin also affected, then does our previous Bitcoin trading strategy have to change too? this time we will discuss one of the most important events in the world of crypto Bitcoin halving, there are many other factors that affect the price of Bitcoin, one of which is not the least of the many people who took part in analyzing the price of Bitcoin after the halving occurred. Talking about halving, what is the definition of Bitcoin halving according to investopedia [1] every 210,000 blocks in the mine or roughly every 4 years the block reward that will be given to Bitcoin miners for processing transactions will be cut in half. Well, this event is called a halving because it halves the new Bitcoin that is released into circulation. And This is Bitcoin (BTC)'s way of forcing synthetic price inflation until all the Bitcoins are released.What about the impact, What is the impact of Bitcoin on the economy also there is the Bitcoin algorithm also indicates it will happen after a certain number of blocks are created, no one knows for sure when the next halving will happen. But experts predict the next halving will occur in April 2024. Richard Bikers of Information Technology advises investors to be careful with the next Bitcoin halving. With less mining, prices tend to stabilize. David burger CEO of the trading platform said that the most important thing investors should think about is the growth of the network as a whole. Is it true that business prices will increase during halvings What makes halvings happen What about Bitcoin investment safety. so according to the usual action, the price of Bitcoin always experiences a significant increase after a halving event. Judging from the 3 previous halving events, significant price increases usually start after 6 to 12 months prior to the event, Bitcoin prices tend to rise.because investors expect self-esteem after the halving but in fact whether the price increase will always occur after the halving event. actually it's still not certain because seeing the conditions that occur after the halving are not necessarily the same. When talking about history, the history of Bitcoin halving Since it was first carried out in 2012 and then again in 2016 and 2020. The first Bitcoin halving occurred when the reward for mining 1 block was reduced from 50 to 25 bitcoins (BTC) and according to cointelegraph[2] coin of the year 2016 which has an incentive reduction event to 12.5 Bitcoin (BTC) on each block mined and on May 11, 2020. each new block mined only generates 6.25 BTC hence the next Bitcoin halving is expected in 2024. system expected will continue until around 2140. Bitcoin price BTC was trading around $12 when the first halving occurred on 28 November 2012 after that 1 year later Bitcoin increased to almost $1000, the second halving occurred on 9 July 2016 and Bitcoin price fell to $870 but managed to rise again until touch $2550 . in July 2017 Bitcoin hit an all-time high or what we commonly know as the all-time Hay at $19700 in December 2017.cointelegraph.comin May 2020, the Bitcoin price traded at $8,787 and exploded in the following months as the volatility of the Bitcoin halving continued to increase as it got closer and Investors could benefit from rising or falling prices by trading during the volatility. volatility measures the strength of daily price fluctuations and calculations usually use periods of 30 60 and 365 days to analyze historical data increased volatility occurs because there is significant uncertainty around halvings, apart from the positive impact, there is no constant demand to buy Bitcoins due to the reduction in supply caused by halvings does not immediately give visible results. So what about Bitcoin price predictions after the halving, Anthony Scaramucci [3] calls 2023 a year of recovery for Bitcoin and predicts that Bitcoin price is likely to trade between $50,000 to $100,000 in 2 to 3 years right after the halving event.Sorry and please correct if there is inaccurate information and data, I just want to share what I know now.

How much do you think Bitcoin Price Next Year Will Be $100K?After all what you've said is basically can fundamentally support, however I don't see how your assumptions about the bitcoin price could be, so can I get your opinion on the next bitcoin price as well instead of just asking for opinions?Halving is basically an event that will always occur in a 4-year cycle, this moment is expected to affect the price even though several other factors have significantly made the price reach its highest point. Increased adoption, involved of some big investors and FOMO are some of the things that have made the demand for bitcoin rise. $100K is a possible target after the halving, but let's see how bitcoin journey in the years leading up to the halving.",

The halving will drive more interest in bitcoin especially for anyone expecting returns, so in itself the impact on the price can be expected to be positive.I can expect the price to reach $100k in the long term regardless if it is affected by the halving or something, but this will definitely need ongoing process and support.",

In any case, I think that is the minimum barrier to cross.

Meanwhile, to explain what halving is, you have explained it in detail according to the source you used and it is very clear for common knowledge for some people.But if there is a question whether the halving will go according to the year that people often say, then the answer is also very clear with several previous halvings. Anyone can expect $100k-$200k, but not sure when it will happen, the highest price of bitcoin in the previous halving almost touched $100k and it is likely that the next halving will pass that price.",

But we all know that it didn't happen right. I would agree that this is just a prediction, a wild educated guess that everyone can make, and that there are no experts here. However, it seems that there are a lot of factors that might contribute to the price hitting that $100k or more, right now we have the banking crisis and maybe there will be next big banks that are going to fall maybe next year that might fuel individuals, not just wealthy investors buy a simply average joe like you and me that will go and put our money into bitcoin because we don't want to lose it's value.And if there is something that I've learn here, just continue to accumulate as little as you can and HODL on it till the next bull run. If we touch $100k then good, congrats, profits coming our way. If not, we still have our Bitcoin, and you can decide when to sell it.",

But we don't know what would be the ATH price of BTC during that time, perhaps it would be $100k or more if we compare the previous ATH price.I think whales are the ones responsible of pumping the price of Bitcoin and if there's a FOMO most people wouldn't make that huge pump in the market. It's the institutional investors and whales are making the market to pump up.All we have to do is wait or buy if there's a dip and most people will definitely choose to invest during the FOMO which is kind of frustrating to think although it's their decision that made that way.

If you look at the historic trajectory of BTC it's clear that its growth has been consistent and the value rises with growth. This is due in part to the fact that it is in limited supply. Moreover, I believe we are headed for serious inflation in the coming year and I feel that BTC is a great way to store value. On the other hand, it is also clear that there have always been corrections and that is where we are today. My prediction is that adoption will continue to increase globally and utility for the blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general will drive BTC to new heights for the foreseeable future. However, there may be some turbulence along the way but I'm a long hold on BTC so that doesn't concern me.",
