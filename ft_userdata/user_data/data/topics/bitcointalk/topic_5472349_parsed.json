      "body": "I am not sure whether \"haunt\" is the proper way to describe what I feel when comes to my worst losses or negative experiences in online casinos. There are moments which are simply better to be forgotten, but I have not had the chance to move on from them.In my case, if there is anything haunting to highlight, it would be the first time I lost a significant amount while rolling dices, it is not much, but it was significant when compared to the whole amount I had managed to win but I did not care to withdraw on time. When it happened I really felt the need to chase that loss, but realized it would have only made things worse, so I did not.I also recall one occasion which I spent several afternoons using a faucet and ended up losing it all pretty quickly to the in-built casino of the faucet, it was not so traumatic, though.",

      "body": "I think it will be when you've just won a good amount and you try to gain more and eventually lose everything this is a betting moment that nobody wants to experience and I experienced it myself, I won 5 times of my bankroll and I thought I'm having a good run so I try to pursue and extend my luck but I eventually lose everything.This is every gambler's nightmare, winning and then losing everything. The most important, when you win a big amount, is to withdraw first and just retain the amount to keep the urge to play and stop yourself from depositing, although it is the hardest part but is something that you need to do to avoid regretting later.",

      "body": "Following the bet picks of the users in the forum and all 3 bets lost. Then I thought it was just one incident that may not happen next so I once again followed their picks 2 out of 3 is lost. That's when I decided it's not a sustainable way to make money, right then I'm just sticking to the sport I know more. Still haunts me because I did think through it. All I did was just go into my account and click. Even when its just a small amount, it could have paid my bill for a month.",

When my card is 20 and the dealer open card is 6 that later on turns to 21 after too many low card.  Place a huge side bet while the new player sit beside me get the max win on side instead of me because I switch sit.  Auto spin a 1mbtc bet on a volatile slot games.",
