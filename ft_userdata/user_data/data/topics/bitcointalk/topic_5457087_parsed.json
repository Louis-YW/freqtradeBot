  "content": "cttoDate: September 16Venue: TBDSo, it's officially announced earlier that Jermall Charlo will move up in weight to challenge Canelo Alvarez which i think is the best fight for Canelo this year as a rematch with Bivol is too risky and yet he has nothing to gain if it will be in the SMW division.What do you think of this fight guys, still cherry picking or Charlo will give Canelo a run for his money?https://www.insidesport.in/canelo-alvarez-vs-jermall-charlo-boxing-clash-confirmed-for-september-16-ppv-service-and-more-info-revealed/",

We can judge for ourselves, of course.",

Charlo never fought in other division too, so this will become his first time to fight in the other weight division. Canelo is really get a lot privilege, the venue might happen on Mexico. This is definitely cherry pick, Canelo will beat Charlo in easy.",

Both has enough power to knockout their opponents but I guess I'd go with Canelo on this one. It is not really a handicap on not being able to fight in the fmring for a year or more but alvarez has just edge with experience. Age on the other hand could be a factor but Canelo has provem himself countless times. A bias to alvarez in polls would be obvious but it will just be decided once the bell rings. It is either Charlo's hunger or Alvarez' pride, given the 'beef' which was heaten up recently.",

It may just be as hoping for a fluke. Canelo is looking forward to a rematch against Bivol of course he will be looking for someone that could be easy to bring down and he is not wasting time,e he wants it next year. Although Charlo is one of the best, the division is Canelo's domain.For Charlo to really challenge in a manner where he has to get loaded is like taking a fall for Canelo money.",

Alvarez is the cash cow, and just like Manny Pacquiao during his height, everyone wanted to fight him because it's a sweepstakes. And maybe this is what the camp of Charlo is thinking for sure.I do agree, the Charlo brothers is known for trash talking, but I don't think that Canelo will back down from trash talking. He has improved his English a lot, and if I'm Charlo, I wouldn't go that fire and awake the fire in Canelo. Don't trash talk him as it might back fire on him, like in the Caleb Plant.",

But I do agree that Canelo will be a huge favorite again in this fight. Could be like the Ryder fight as per odds. But in any case, I don't see this fight as hype though, I mean Canelo could be still be the cash cow, but fighting a boxer who has been on almost retiring and very inactive for many years? what gives? Why Canelo camp chooses Jermall Charlo when they can have Bivol or Benavidez? Is this just one of those cherry pick fight for Alvarez? Or this is going to be the norm for him as he is now on a decline?",

This is definitely cherry pick, Canelo will beat Charlo in easy.Yes, we've seen that in the last couple of fights of Canelo, they are indeed cherry picking their opponents now. Charlo's best weight division is middleweight, 160 lbs and he was a champion. So his body need to adjust to the needed weight and I'm expecting that in the weigh-in, he might be below the required weight of 168 lbs. Although he can claim that he can easily make the weight because he don't have to diet or something. But still though, there is a lot of adjustment carrying that extra weight that your body is not accustomed too. Plus the speed and the power itself, it might not be enough to upset Canelo and he might just walk through Charlo's power here.",

In terms of height yeah, all the advantage is with Charlo, but as far as weight goes, it will still be Canelo and this is his weight as he remains the undisputed champion at 168 lbs.And it's obvious that Charlo has been looking at 160 lbs, he can't go down to 154 lbs because his twin brother is at that weight class. So he has been calling Canelo out for years but Canelo doesn't respond until Alvarez started to do cherry pick fights after his hand surgery.",

But we'll see though.",
