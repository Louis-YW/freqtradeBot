This site looks interesting, I’ve been following the Esports recently since I’m a player too, and having this site can help me think if I’m going to place a bet or not. Any chance to add other crypto as an option? I also suggest to have a marketing campaign here which can boost this site.",

I hope that this casino's forum account will remain active in this forum to reply when a gambler have problems or issues about the casino. Copper membership is bought but I didn't find it attractive compared to other casinos that are also newly launched in this forum. As what I have read in some posts/replies where there's NO KYC but request anyway is a bit misleading in my opinion. No one would want that or like that kind of casino where they will know about this casino where NO KYC is needed but will request anyway depends on the situation.",

That's what people should do when gambling in a casino or in a gambling site and yet there are still people who doesn't read ToS, terms and conditions, privacy and policy in the casino or in sportsbook where those people will create a scam accusation thread complaining about the casino. In the end, it's their own making why it happened to them because of not reading the casino's ToS. I'm sure you have seen one of those thread.",
