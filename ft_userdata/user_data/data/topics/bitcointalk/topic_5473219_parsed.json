  "content": "It is amazing how opportunities are unceasing in Web3. I've found that, leveraging on launchpad projects is a good way to scale up one's portfolio.Just recently, I teamed up with a few friends for the $T2T2 Launchpad event on Bitget, we followed up, committed the amount of $BGB and followed every other prompt as required.Today, the project was launched by Bitget, peaking about 800% which is a whopping 8X from launch price, I sold at a good price and I've made good profits.The most interesting part of my participation is that, the performance of $T2T2 has served as a wake-up call for me to hold $BGB and participate in subsequent launchpad projects.Please do share your experience(s) with launchpad projects so we can learn from another.",

The point is that this is just another altcoin type of a project and so there is never a guarantee for making some money. There will always be risks so doing our due diligence can be so important...and praying for luck is equally a critical element so you can be selecting the right one project and be there at the right time and then dispose of the token when it is peaking.",

Thanks for the hearty congratulations buddy. Well, so sorry about your past Launchpad experiences. As a part of my research methodology, before I invest in launchpad projects, I often look at the pedigree of such launchpad's projects. Bitget launchpad have good pedigree, having launched the likes of $TYPE and $HALO. These tokens went further to do really well. Luck and doing diligent research works a good factor too. I'll advise you do thorough research before committing funds anywhere.",

I've read your post and sentiment about SocialFi as well as friend tech, well I must say your perspective is alright. Well, I personally feel SocialFi will thrive. We now live in a world where social interactions are on the rise. However, I must say Bitget doesn't go on a frolic of its own listing altcoins or shitcoins. I've found that the platform lists tokens which it's research team deem suitable. With respect to shitcoins, there's an innovation zone which serves as an incubation stage for certain meme projects before they're duly listed. Every exchange takes part in marketing and advertising, the key thing to be done by any investor should be due diligence and thorough research before investing.",

My advice is that one sticks to centralised exchanges for those launchpad project opportunities. Yess, buddy. I wholly agree. Sticking to exchanges with a proven track record should be upheld. How can this be done? It can be done simply by carrying out diligent research. Twas after my research on Bitget that I found out it had launched other solid protocols like $TYPE and $HALO that went further to do good percentages. This further instilled my confidence to participate in $T2T2. Research is indeed all in this space.",

I get your view point buddy, but with the recent Bitcoin surge, I feel like this is the ideal time to jump on launchpad projects with potential. With the halving coming next year, investing in solid assets could be really profitable. I'll keep an eye on projects still launching on Bitget though, I'll do my own research while I'm at it.",

      "body": "While everyone is agreeing and participating in launchpads, I ask everyone to take heed because launchpad projects are usually very very volatile. If it can go up by 800%, it can go down by the same percentage. I once jumped on a binance launchpad and I lost so much money. And funny enough is that the price of these launchpad projects jump in seconds. One second it’s $1 the next second it’s $20 or vice versa. Just be very careful, I think binance shows a little message that even warns investors on the high volatility nature if a token price is changing too much in a short time.",
