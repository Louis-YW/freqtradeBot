      "body": "It depends on the cost of electricity that you are using, if the cost is high, do not just go into bitcoin mining. But if electricity is cheap in your country, you can make further research if it is profitable.You will need to buy mining equipments like application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). They are costly but would worth it. Bitcoin mining might not be profitable, but you can hold the coins mined and wait for the price to increase is good so that you can sell at high price too, but making sure that at least, you earn profitable amount after you join a mining pool.Bitcoin mining is profitable, but you have to calculate the electricity you will spend on miners and other mining equipments before you should start buying and setting up mining equipments. If you do not make right calculation, you could end up losing.The loss can be from the cost of running mining equipments to be more than the reward given you from the mining pool you joined. The reward is based on the hashrates your miners are adding up in the total mining hashrates the pool is producing.",

Again, feel free to show your specs , after all that is what the OP was asking for, how to be profitable mining BTC PoW coin.Otherwise, I shall consider you making a profit from BTC PoW mining , a fantasy.  If you ever run a business,you totaled up your input costs and compared against income earned.Are you saying you have never done this with your BTC PoW mining?If you have not, you don't have an accurate calculation of a profit or a loss.If you made so little , you never paid taxes, then you are just wasting money on a hobby.Which their is nothing wrong with that , except you need to admit it is a hobby and not a business you can survive off of. Usually the only way a small miner can make a profit, 1.  Steal the ASICS2.  Steal the Electricity3.  Don't Pay their Taxes.*None of which is worth the jail time when caught.*The Big Miners survive by getting dumb VC money to fund their operations.",

For small miners with very few number of mining machines the profit is much dependent over the market as well as the electricity charges.During the bear market I experienced it is quite easy to buy one ethereum, but for the same through mining is truly difficult.

Maybe a more accurate description, is You can make money mining BTC PoW, if your Mum and Dad cover the majority of your input costs.However if you have to cover the normal inputs costs on your own to mine BTC PoW, you'll never earn a profit, once input costs are factored in.  * Personally never seen an ASIC that was worth a shit after 8 months.*",

Specifically for Bitcoin mining, to be able to make a decent ROI and profit, you would need to compete with the hashpower delivered by the biggest pools in this world. For that you would need a comparable mining facility that includes not just ASICs but also electricity, cooling methods, maintainance and manpower. Not to mention an open plot to run all these.So if you can afford all that you could go for mining.
