To a larger extent Africa has not done much to move out and present to the world the natural sweet flavour from Africa. If you looking at other third world countries, they are now in strong competition with technological countries because they have got the purpose of leadership. Ghana got independence in 1957, Nigeria in 1960 , these countries are 67 and 63 years old respectively but they have not done much for themselves. Malaysia had independence in 1957 and Singapore in 1965 but you can't compare both economics in terms of export and exportation speaks volume about where the country is moving its economy to.",

Lot of their natural resources were stolen using cheap labor and exporting them out of the country.I am convinced that if African countries do not unite, they will be shifted to the burden of global crises, as usual. Africa is a land full of bounties, and the greed of the major powers will not stop to continue draining its resources. Because of this, the colonial powers were and still are seeking to keep Africa as a land of wars and conflicts.With regard to climate change, Africa cannot be excluded from the equation, even if it is the least affected. But the big countries will count on Africa to support the affected areas with subsidized goods and materials. Proposals may appear to transfer people from the affected countries to African countries, especially since they can be incubators.",

Liberia used to be a colony, but wanted to be independent, so it made its own constitution with the help of the US, which later lead to a military coup, like in many other African countries where the law is made by those who take power and manage to hold it by force. The country \"liberated\" itself completely from foreigners, becoming the poorest in Africa. A country where people were working like slaves for less than a dollar a day. Not joking here, look it up, the minimum wage is currently around 0.7 USD per day. If I recall correctly, they even tried to invite foreigners back to start businesses there but nobody wanted to risk it, after the last time where some of them were killed defending their land from the militants.",

Serious colonialism in some African nations made them believe that they cannot think on their own, many of these nations are still suffering from this mentality, that is why they are always copying the actions of similar institutions in the country of their colonial masters.

It was not possible for them to preserve their interests after ending direct colonization of Africa except by employing agents for them in those countries who are professional in politics and contribute to the further impoverishment of their countries.The clearest example is in countries that managed to get rid of corrupt rulers and embarked on the development process.

All this so that all good things remain deported to colonial countries such as Britain and France.",

Africans have spent centuries killing each other and blame all their ills on the white man. Look at south africa or zimbabwae for an example and see what happens when they do finally manage to take back control from their oppressors. The economies disintegrate and the infrastructure crumbles all the while the loot all around them at the same time blaming the whites man for their ills when it all falls apart and there is nothing more to break or steal that the white man has built in the first place. If black Africans hate whites so much then why do they go to europe and why do they always steer politically in the direction of communists and dictators when given power? Imagine if the EFF took power in South africa for example what further looting and killing would take place against the white minority who built all the infrastructure and wealth there further destroying its economic existence? Africa needs to become civilized before it can become developed so any future developments can be sustainable. Imagine building a great company in Africa for it to be seized by some communists at the next election and your white CEO being dragged out into the street burned alive with tyres around them by an angry communist mob who some demagogue told them was their enemy while same demagogue communist thug drives off in his capitalist mercedes benz to his beach front mansion to plot how to loot it all over again once he gets enough savages to believe how the white jew or christian man is satan while at the same time they cast satanic voodoo spells on him? The masses are so dangerously ignorant they are ripe for exploitation by a demagogue once the economy falls to pieces after the looting.Did you know that a white student in a south african university has to get far more points/grades than a black student to earn the same degree and that a company has by law to have more blacks in positions in their companies along with government and public services. South africa is technically a black COMMUNIST aparteid regime.",
