Specifically for this auction I will allow the winner to choose which coins and how many they want to be funded. Not all of the coins need to be funded. But any coins that aren't prefunded before shipping will be marked BUYER FUNDED on the holograms. Should the winner choose to pre-fund the coins before I ship them, they will accept the risks involved with shipping funded coins through USPS registered mail. The coins will be valued at the price paid plus the bitcoin that is loaded on to them (if they are pre-funded by the winner). Winner agrees to hold LEALANA, LLC. and myself innocent of any losses while in transit (in the small event the coin goes missing/stolen while in transit).Any customs/VAT taxes or fees that are placed on the package while going through customs for international customers are the responsibility of the buyer/winner to pay.Please bid in the following formats: \"I bid 0.03 BTC\" Should bids come in at the last minute I will allow for the auction to extended by 5 minute increments between bids. Once the 5 minutes is up and no bidding is done after the deadline specified ABOVE, the auction will end. To be clear on the precision of the auction times in 5 minute increments we are talking about the actual MINUTE and not the seconds that are posted on the forum timestamp.Payment address:[will be provided upon auction end to winner via PGP signed message]Payment is due within 24 hours from the time the auction ends. Should the winner not honor their bid and not provide payment in that 24 period the next highest bidder will be required to honor their bid. By bidding in this auction thread you agree to this stipulation. In other words, please make sure you are able to honor your bid(s) in a timely manner before you bid.I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO INVALIDATE A BID FROM NEWBIE USERS. USUALLY THIS WILL BE THE CASE IF I HAVE NEVER DONE BUSINESS WITH YOU BEFORE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY.",
