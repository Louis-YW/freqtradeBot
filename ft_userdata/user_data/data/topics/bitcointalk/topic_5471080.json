Go through this thread:  AI Spam Report Reference Thread  and when you’re done come back and tell me how you feel about those posts in that thread.Most of the time, those using AI don’t know anything about the topic so when an answer is generated for them by an AI they instantly just copy it and paste it here without actually verifying it, and that’s why it’s easy to filter them out from a thread because most of their replies are always Off-topic.",

In some of your threads you were opposing the merit system of the forum and now you are suggesting AI written posts. There is a thread by Nutildah where users report all those posts that are created by AI text generators. The forum is for real humans not for bots and if AI writes the posts for users then they aren't doing anything and that approach will increase spamming on forum. AI generated posts  are going to be no less than a miracle for the account farmers as they will be able to make 100's of posts per day with the help of AI text generators and most of the posts in a thread will be very similar because AI text generators can only share the information that they were trained with. The signature campaigns are managed by humans whom we call campaigns managers and in most of the managers dislike AI generated text and especially Royse gives rewards to the ones who report those participants in a campaign that use AI to generate text. The AI generated texts are highly disliked by the members of the forum and I recommend you to avoid those AI text generators at any cost.",

Yes, AI can be used for taking suggestions on topics, to search and research certain content, or to improve word choice, but it shouldn't be used as a post writing tool. Your words should be your own. Not some AI generated words.Unfortunately, I don't agree with you here. I'll tell you the exact reason. Suppose you wrote a topic about trading using AI. Now suppose I have zero knowledge of trading, and I ask a question. Will you be able to answer the question? Of course not; you know nothing about what you wrote because you didn't even write that. Then what's the point? Where are the answers?",

      "body": "One thing to remember is that we are in a discussion forum. And discussion forums are used not only to convey information but also to solve problems and create solutions. Discussions feel more lively by involving emotions in them. Meanwhile, AI doesn't even have emotions when they write. They are just like search engines that collect existing data. But they don't provide new solutions. They just put together solutions that already exist. And they copied it and modified it a little bit. Which is sometimes full of mistakes. AI is too rigid. Current AI is still not AI like in the film, which already has artificial intelligence capable of making logical solutions faster than humans. Well that's only in the movies. In fact, the current AI still only feels like a more sophisticated version of a search engine.Example, a novel is very enjoyable to read because it contains empathy, emotion and all the feelings that the author pours into the story he creates in the novel. So that when we read it, we can even be immersed in the same feelings felt by the author of the story.Try asking AI to make a story, for example, only 10 pages. I'm sure we won't even want to finish 1 page. Because they can't write something that contains emotional elements. Their writing is neither lively nor emotionally appealing. So what's so good about writing with AI?For me, AI is currently only useful in assisting in gathering existing information.",
