Moreover, it makes the business grow very strong and tall amongst it rivals making more profits for the owner as the case maybe. It also leads to expansion and further business development if the profits are properly integrated back into the business system in good fate.When it comes to bitcoin and other related Crypto currencies, same is applicable. Taking profit is not a bad thing more especially when you are holding for a short time or you are a trader. As the market is generally known to be volatile, it is advisable to take profit while you can when the market is Green and possibly buy back when it is red and down below the previous. This is the simple logic;Buy when the market is down to get much volume and sell when the market is up to get much profit.",

My reason for asking this question is because I understand that on any online investment's, the more your capital the more your profits.The step taken by your parents are the traditional method of limiting risk and avoiding loss. This method is also not bad when you invested a certain amount into an investment, eventually every trader takes off some funds to after profit to use to cater for one or two things and it is best that it is the capital, if from the initial start you are not investing with an amount you are comfortable with it. This capital can be used for something else either diversifying your investment portfolio or for emergency. In the world of bitcoin trading it is even better to have this method although some people prefer to accumulate more but accumulating more as the profit also grows has its risk. So it is better to take some off it. With bitcoin it is even much easier since there’s the bull and bear period which one could take profit off during the bull period and reinvest when the market is down. It all bows down to how you really want it, if you feel you don’t need the capital then you can just leave it off because the bigger the capital the more profit is accumulated. But beware of the volatility of bitcoin",

Do you know if you do that you will be left with worthless token??If is to say is bitcoin then I will tell you to reinvest again but for altcoin I won't encourage you to do that. Whenever you invested and make profits from altcoin don't think of reinvest in that same token again rather target another good coin and invest instead of the previous one.",

I'll give you a fine example, there is a two people who sow a seed of fruit. One is the guy who have rich mindset and the other is the guy who have poor mindset. Both of the tree grows and it bears a single fruit, the poor get the fruit and cut the tree down while the rich did not yet get the fruit and after few months the seed that the rich sow is now full of a lot of fruits while the poor doesn't have a tree anymore and he is confused why it is like that. In the real world, if you start an business; you cannot just get the profits because there's no way that you can scale your business if you keep getting it. The most important thing is that we should keep reinvesting our profits for us to make more money.I'm a trader and I only withdraw once in a year, meaning that my trading capital is keep increasing throughout the year and I never cheated even once. In this way my capital easily grow because I did not withdraw any of my profits. This kind of strategy is not only effective in trading but it is also effective in any type of business. Just keep planting and planting and you will reap what you sow. If you plant a lot of seeds, then expect that you will receive a lot of fruits (profits and gains).",

You can use your profit to trade or invest again. If you do this, you will have to lose very big two or three times to again touch your initial capital or lose it.If you don't do that safe method and use all money (initial capital + profit) to trade or invest again, you might lose them all after one failed trade or investment.",

And that theory of the more capital one has is the more Profit will the person make is a wrong philosophy. One can have $500,000 in his/her business yet the person can still make a little profits. There are different factors you have to consider to make Profit in a business and not only the big capital. The number one thing for you to consider is the environment of the business. Is the environment conducive? Then the population of the location. How many people are living in the area? These are some of the questions you have to ask nd answer before going into any business. Then coming to the area of removing the capital and reinvesting the profit is a good area. But we all know the uses of the profit from an investment. The profit is for the necessary needs in the society in you life. But if you decided to reinvest them that all for you. And that means you have an alternative means of meeting up the human necessary needs.",

Reinvesting is never a bad idea after someone have taken it capital from what it have earn at end of the business or investment. From what you have said the more the capital the more someone will profit from from online business is true but it is not applicable to only online business but almost business.in crypto industry it is always advisable to always take profit after someone was able to meet him /her profit target.",

You will not earn more profit compared to your potential profit if you still use your capital. But if you are asking earning more profit in a sense that you will increase your current profit then yes if you can still make a good trade. Earning more profit depends on the result of your trades and not capital reliant.

And in as much as you still have funds in your trading account whether profit or capital, you still stand the chance of making more profit or lose on any trade you make. But moreover, having a whole $3000 profit from a $1000 investment means that's a whole 300% increase, of which I doubt if Bitcoin will likely go that high anytime soon, unless in a long-term, risky altcoin investment or forex trading.

Remember, online investments, whether it's in Bitcoin, stocks, staking, and so forth, do not guarantee profits. However, every investment has the potential to bring about profits if you're adept at managing the risks involved.Having a large capital is pointless if you lack knowledge in investing. It'll be extremely challenging for you to decide on investments if you're solely relying on luck, so what's the difference between this and gambling?In investing, there are various aspects that investors should be aware of. The approach is not to increase your capital size, as it can be dangerous if you keep investing in only one place. At the very least, you should manage your risk by diversifying your assets into multiple investment channels. This way, the risk you're exposed to will be minimized, making it safer for you to navigate.",

As you describe it above, cryptocurrency doesn't operate in the manner you suggest. Making money with cryptocurrencies, especially when you invest in bitcoin, almost never comes easily. It depends on how the market is acting at the moment. It is impossible to triple your investment in a short period of time unless there is a market distortion or perhaps during the bull run season.

Utilizing the profit into another investment would atleast allow an investor to just push things. Let us put it this way, you've invested to 1 btc, and made profit making it 2. Then you decided to just pullback1btc into your wallet while diversifying the other into different coins. If ever the market would crash for any possible reason, and if its value will  be zero, you still won't lose any amount technically, because the amount you have lost is the profit. It will just be giving you negative feeling since you will still be aware that you've lost 1btc and your asset should have been 2, if you chose taking away the profit than to reuse it into other investment. This is a matter ofmaking sure you have lost nothing in a worse case scenario.",
