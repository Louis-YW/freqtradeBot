No, there is no tax to buy or hold cryptocurrencies in Canada. However, if you decide to sell your cryptocurrency holdings, a tax basis may arise.QuoteThe CRA generally treats cryptocurrency like a commodity for purposes of the Income Tax Act. Any income from transactions involving cryptocurrency is generally treated as business income or as a capital gain, depending on the circumstances.source: https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/compliance/digital-currency/cryptocurrency-guide.htmlQuote from: NinjaBitcoiner on January 31, 2023, 03:08:01 PMCan the canada government ask for source of those BTC and how they are earned?Yes. The government can request information about the source of your BTC, but only if it has been informed of your cryptocurrency holdings or after the sale.",

For instance, if you purchased BTC at $10,000 per coin, then sold it for $20,000 per coin after moving to Canada, you would be obligated to report the capital gains tax on the difference between the purchase and sale prices, according to Canadian tax regulations. In other words, the change of residence is irrelevant.But, as I mentioned another thread, if you're unsure about whether you need to file a tax return, it's best to seek advice from a knowledgeable tax expert.",

For example, in the country where you live, the tax is 10%. In the country where you are moving, the tax is 15%. The tax office may require 5% tax from you.Another point is the time when you cease to be a tax resident of the first country and become a tax resident of the second country.",

I don't think it make sense to give tax on money which you are bringing to Canada. Also, this will discourage the immigrants to bring their money in Canada and of course no county wants that, so by common sense you should not be advised to pay tax on this amount. Same should go for cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.",

Many Russians now live in various countries of the world, and even in the USA many private exchangers have appeared. The minimum amount is 10,000 dollars, the commission when exchanging for cash is 1%. If you pay in cash, then it cannot be tracked. If you do not make expensive purchases. I am not against taxes, but first you need to get used to the country, and then solve tax issues.",

Who should be trusted: someone else's opinion or the opinion of a financial lawyer?Each service has a cost, in the case of the amount of $ 230,000, it is easier to legalize in Canada than in other countries. But I'm not a lawyer",

Any money earned in Canada would be taxed though but you would have to contact a accountant if you wanted specific answers on btc taxation in Canada. the place of earning it is not a question here but rather where he withdraw the money and convert it to fiat which in his case was Canada. The tax office will definitely ask for an income report for the capital that he transfers to his Bank account. Asking a tax expert in Canada is the best thing to do to avoid conflict since everything on his bank account should be explained and money coming from an outside source is considered as profit if you move to Canada before this money is sent to his account. He might be committing tax evasion in case he failed to fully understand the taxation law.",
