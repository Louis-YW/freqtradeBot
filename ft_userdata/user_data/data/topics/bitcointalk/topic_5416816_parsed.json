I am building a website https://easyinvest.one/ and its getting closer to be done.I would love some ideas and tips if you have any so I can improve the website.Feel free to say anything. I love criticism and take it to heart and develop the site. But if you're going to be rude and mean, you don't need to write. I don't have time for that kind of nonsense.",

You offer 30% profit which is impossible in the long term (longer than two months).If you can make 30% profit, why do you need other people and their money? you will very easily increase your capital and make a profit without having to share it with someone.QuoteWe offer a guaranteed investment over two months where your profit is 30% on your investment.",
