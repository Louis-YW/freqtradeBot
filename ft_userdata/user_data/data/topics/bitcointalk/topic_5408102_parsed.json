That amazon is going to shut down its cloud service has nothing to do with what is usually said about saving your seeds offline.Amazon is going to stop providing a service and if you store things in that cloud, you will have to find another service if you want to continue storing them in a cloud. Saving things in a cloud has its advantages and should always be done with information that is not too sensitive, as mentioned above.But saving your seeds offline is often said because from the moment you have them online, there is a risk that they will be stolen by hackers, and for that it doesn't matter if Amazon Drive stops its service on Dec. 31, 2023.",

That is more than ample time for someone to make arrangements to store their backups elsewhere if they chose to store their backups online. With that being said, there are plenty of reasons to not store your backups in the cloud or online, such as the potential for the service provider having a security breach, your account being hacked via various means, or your account password being reset via phishing. Even if your private keys are encrypted, an adversary would have an unlimited number of attempts to decrypt your private keys, until you become aware of the breach and move your coin.",

Basically, you have an idea on how to keep those things confidential despite being not recommended in doing so. I've known people that have been doing that but of course, not for their keys but for some important login details and information which eases them from their tasks and businesses. It could be done for crypto-related stuff but if you're also aware of those breaches that have happened, you'll never do this when you're aware that a hacker might find and crack it. As for Amazon, the point is actually good, what if the cloud storage you're using suddenly collapsed or announces an immediate closure but for someone who understands the importance of keeping your keys safely through the manual way of writing it down, this is out of choice.",

This Amazon situation is the best case scenario you see in these type of situations where the service provider decides to pull the plug.   Quote from: Fivestar4everMVPYou are exactly wrong in your subject, that Amazon is shutting down their service has nothing to do with why peeps shouldn't store their seed or private keys online.It's one of the reasons. Just highlighting that you can't trust online cloud storage providers at all. As well, not all of them are as nice as Amazon. As o_e_l_e_o pointed out.To say nothing of how shady cloud storage providers can just close your account and delete all your files without your permission and not have to explain why. it happens.QuoteThe reason why it is said never to store your seed or private keys online is due to how easy it might be to get hacked...That's one of the reasons.But back to this Amazon situation. There will most likely be people that don't migrate their data away from Amazon Drive for a variety of reasons. One of them being they never knew the service was shutting down. Yes, isn't that hard to believe? But its' true.",

Even if I used a truly random password of 500+ characters along with a hardware key 2FA, I would still never store anything valuable on the cloud (i.e. someone else's computer). You have absolutely no idea how good their security is, if your data is transferred securely, stored securely, how many times it is copied, in how many servers all around the world it is stored, where these servers are, who can access these servers digitally, who can access these servers physically, and so on. Even if your account is not hacked there are a million ways that your data could be stolen or lost.",

Again, think of cloud storage as someone else's computer. If you say to them \"Delete this file\" and they say \"Ok, I've deleted it\", you have absolutely no proof whatsoever that the data is actually deleted. And even if it is deleted, it probably isn't properly shredded and could be recovered. And even if it is shredded, it is probably backed up on more than one other server somewhere and could still be accessed.Instead, you should consider whatever seed phrases or private keys you had stored online permanently compromised. Create some brand new wallets with the seed phrases backed up only via non-electronic means (i.e. pen and paper), and then transfer all your coins out of your old wallets in to these new ones.",

According to the news, currently they only use email to notify their customer. I expect most people only open their email when they need to register or recover their online account, unless their job regularly use email. Additionally, it's likely their email buried with lots of promotional content unless they opt out from it manually.Which is why in these types of situations there are going to be people with Amazon Drive accounts that lose their data. Say they went on a 2 year vacation when they come back, their data is gone! Maybe Jeff Bezos has a backup for them but no guarantee.",
