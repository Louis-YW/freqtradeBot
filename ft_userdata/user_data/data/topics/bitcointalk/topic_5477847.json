And if I want to find out any topic nor board, I normally use Google Search Engine to get the job done. Because in most cases the forum search bar didn't give me the actual results I needed. Though this your method is also directing me straight to the board you want to visit but will be double navigation because once login with meta.bitcointalk.org, you can't go back to another board unless you click the main menu (home page) button. Therefore I will prefer login with normal website and navigate to any angle.",

I also did a quick search on it too but I found something that kinda relate to it. Quote You can setup SMF with your new domain and update SMF using 'Repair Settings' to fix any paths and urls.For the old domain you can add a 301 permanent redirect to the new domain, search engine's will see the permanent redirect and update all your search results, it should have a very minimal impact on your search engine rankings.So if someone goes to http://www.olddomain.com/forum/thread/1/ they would be redirected to http://www.newdomain.com/forum/thread/1/Search engines are intelligent enough these days to handle these type of instructions.Best sourceThe bold area shows it could be possible for subdomain too but it will require the admin to do a whole lot of job to fix it.",

It's all about adding certain records as part of DNS settings. You will get the same result if you enter meta.bitcointalk.org (or even bitcointalk.org/meta) or https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=24.0 in your browser. It's just that this solution with the subdomains that franky1 suggests is much simpler for humans.This does not mean that a subdomain should be created individually for each topic.",

But your idea to make subdomains isn't good for SEO, maybe the goal was to make it look pretty and it would be easy to implement, they only have to create the subdomain and add the next index.htmlCode:<html>   <head>     <script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>     <script>     $(function(){      $(\"#divId\").load(\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=1.0\");     });    </script>   </head>   <body>      <div id=\"divId\" style=\"display:none;\"></div>  </body> </html>But i don't find sense on doing it, the plan B would be to split the forum, and make each subdomain run each branch, but that would be a bad idea because you will have to run a copy of the software on each branch, so, doesn't sound as a good change at all.",
