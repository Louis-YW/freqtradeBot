  "content": "With Celer's messaging bridge full integration with Oasis' Sapphire Runtime network, now it is apparent the possibility to connect 2 different networks, and enable the benefits of one into another. This crypto breakthrough brings a broad collection of new use-cases to the table. And in the context of Privacy. Integrating celer's bridge with Sapphire, the first confidential EVM in the industry, allows for other EVM blockchains to be able to connect directly with Sapphire, for dApps to be able to leverage confidential smart contracts and provide new use cases for their users in their home chain, without ever having to leave it.* Harry Roberts made a very detailed workshop to understand how the Oasis Privacy Layer works, and how to built two linked smart contracts, one in the home chain, and one in Sapphire:https://youtu.be/gD-_cgV3Nz4?si=H3FkF4RpgRJHuIRP* One of the primary use cases for the OPL is to provide DAOs over other EVM chains with confidential voting, to that case Oasis Engineer Matev≈æ explains step by step how it works and how to use the resources to build the ballot smart contracts:https://youtu.be/b8otmchybhM?si=aiqZB54eqQjT1s8e* And for last and not least, in the process of building there is need to check direct on-chain data from the network. The Oasis Indexer Nexus allows this, here you can check events, transactions and details from an account, on both its Oasis and Ethereum addresses. This tutorial provided by Oasis Engineer Xi teaches about the use cases of the Oasis Nexus Indexer:https://youtu.be/qcdZxSRFNu0?si=zOsHDkbTRo-ld-NLIf you are interested in more documentation, you can go to Oasis Docs for the OPL and check out examples for confidential Smart Contracts like the Secret Ballot Contract for DAOs as shown in the video: https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/opl/There is still a chance to participate in the Privacy4Web3 Hackathon or being part of a group. Hope you find inspiration and motivation to create something incredible that changes the entire crypto ecosystem, good luck.https://p4w3.devpost.com/",
