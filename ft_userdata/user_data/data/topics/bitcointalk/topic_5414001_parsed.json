Same here. I received an email telling a deposit was successful in my Kraken account. I have not used my Kraken account for 4 years. Its impossible that someone will send some coins to it. But I wouldn't try to recover my password either as I don't wanna use the exchange anymore. If it turns out to be true then it will just stay there until I will login into it.Its why I ignored to notification because it could be another scam. I wonder if someone received it as well and found they really got some coins. Free coins still is good.",

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?You just have to be careful, because nobody will ever give you a penny satoshi of Bitcoin for free. Because it's slightly impossible to send Bitcoin to the wrong address with just an alteration of a single letter. That's if I'm not making a mistake but I stand to be corrected. However, if I was to be in your shoe, the best thing I'll do is be patient till after 7 days, and if nobody then failed to indicate to have made a transfer, then the BTC automatically becomes yours, because since you run a writing service, an anonymous fellow or previous client may have decided to show you love today as a result of the quality of your service. But please be aware of scams and phishing sites for security reasons.",

At the end of the day, you are using a centralized exchange and if the money was erroneously credited to your account, then it's a matter of time before the exchange team realize the error and revert the transactions. You don't want to fall in trouble for spending money that was not yours and above all, we all as human should have some integrity. One should be honest even when he is anonymous or is not being watched.",

Sometimes I get notifications that I have received a deposit for services I do not have an account with. Most likely, this is a phishing attempt.Quote from: Newchanka on September 18, 2022, 04:13:21 PMI was surprised when I checked my email yesterday and saw a deposit alert for my exchange wallet.

If you were in my shoes, what would you do?Notwithstanding the phishing issue, you should improve your practices regarding handling crypto. 1 - Most exchanges will expect you to deposit coin from an address you personally control, and that you will not have a third party deposit coin to your exchange account on your behalf. You should not have your customers deposit coin directly to your exchange account.2 - Based on your post, it appears you have a single deposit address that you have given to many customers to pay you. Assuming the unlikely event that you have actually received a deposit, you have no real way of knowing who has actually paid you. If you have given this address to two customers, either (or both) of your customers could be watching the address for transactions and could claim they have just paid you. You should not give the same address to multiple people for them to send you money.3 - It is really best to go a step further than 2, and to give a new address for each transaction you are due to receive. In other words, don't reuse addresses.",

QuoteIf you were in my shoes, what would you do?You can withdraw the fund from the exchange to your non-custodial wallet and after that, you might contact the CS of that exchange and ask where the funds come from and you'll return it once it's confirmed the real owner via the sender's address. Yes, possible this happen and it could be a coincidence.  Copy-pasting and send without checking the right address.",

Have them sign the coin address/verify.2. Have them take a photo of the shipping address, if they are sending from a wallet or exchange.If they can prove, of course the coin is theirs, if not just leave it in your wallet, maybe it's your windfall.Notes:If the coin/token you received is worthless and has no value it's probably phishing, don't connect your wallet to their contract address, it could drain your balance.",

The staff is getting beer & pizza on you tonight. If the OP has not been contacted at this point, I would treat it as the same think, a donation. Assuming it's not for a life altering amount of money, then I would sit on the funds for a while before spending them. No, they are not obligated to give it back, but it's still the right thing to do.*Also keep in mind, 'life altering amounts' vary from person to person. So there is that too.-Dave",
