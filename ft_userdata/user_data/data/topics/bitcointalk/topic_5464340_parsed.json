Check if you see any withdrawal. If you see a pending withdrawal that hasn't been processed yet, check if there's any message saying why it has not been processed and if there's no message, you should ask their support.",

Did the service (block.fi) give you a transaction ID after your withdrawal has been processed? The OP mentioned thousands of dollars in BTC. But also mentioned that he withdrew all BTC. Kinda confusing. According to the second image, likely the BTC is still not yet withdrawn successfully on Blockfi. But the reason I do not know.",
