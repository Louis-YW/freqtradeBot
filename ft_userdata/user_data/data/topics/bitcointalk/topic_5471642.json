I hope this HODL journey will be awesome for all of us.",

But let's not forget that it's been nearly a year since the bottom, although the price hit $30k or somewhat above it on multiple occasions since April 2023. I'm just saying that perhaps it'll take another year for Bitcoin to go above $70k, it's a very realistic timeline. So people need to be patient about it and not expect this to be a start of a very swift bull run. The price can continue going up and down.",

I hope this HODL journey will be awesome for all of us.Exactly there are many traders or investors that are even given talks that people that are willing to buy should wait for a little time and we could see a dip. Yeah I don’t want to carried away with all this uprising and say that a dip wouldn’t come, but it will be just too risky to sit out and wait for it. When it is coming isn’t known, with the ETF coming with its own FOMO, a price less than $30k doesn’t seem like something we will see just yet. From the chart above by Oshosondy, if bitcoin follows same pattern or trend which it’s most like to follow and nothing like a bad news hits us, EFT gets approved with the hype around it, many people accumulating in time for halving, then $45k could even be the support or resistance level before halving even occurs. My tip is don’t wait for any dip but accumulate and accumulate, the DCA method is the best to safe you that stress of waiting.",

In my opinion, I think we will see $45k even before the halving. Bitcoin is heavily influenced by news such as the rumours of ETF approvals. So, a lot of people are already aware that ETF and halving will lead to a bull run. So what I think market is doing is to find equilibrium before the halving; the possible places that will be is at $37k and $45k. Quote from: retreat on October 25, 2023, 04:58:27 PM But even so, the increase in the price of Bitcoin does not stop and HODLing for a long period of time seems worth it.The need to hodl cannot be overemphasised. That is the sure way to make good gains in Bitcoin. Those who bought earlier part of the year and held till date are already in huge profit by now.",

Will see how this reaction happens in the future expecting it to be sooner or the same thing where November after the halving rally has actually arrived.",

It's as if Bitcoin is getting worse every day. The data supports that the best investment is made during the bear period.Btc sees resistance in the 35 thousand dollars band. If we exceed here, I think we will easily see 40 thousand dollars and above until the Etf approval. The strong expectation that Etf will be finalized will take us back to the old bullish times with the halving of Bitcoin. However, I think we will see ATH and above in the last quarter of 2024.

Bitcoin is undoubtedly an asset which will always bounce back post bear run and many can make such predictions but what matters theost is the trust and inder of community on Bitcoin which has to be upscaled.",

Maybe the market will still be going sideways until the halvening, but I certainly don't see any way it can go on a long downtrend again. I wouldn't even be surprised if it would turn quite bullish now, because everyone has high hopes for the halvening and its better to invest early for max profit.",

These things tend to happen when we come from a bull market that cools off and starts to fall. These types of fraudulent schemes hold up well in bull markets, where new money keeps coming in and they start to suffer when the fall begins.

It's uncertain how substantial the impact will be, but it's likely to set the market in motion, possibly resulting in a minor bloodbath or even a severe bearish trend.Nevertheless, I maintain a bit of confidence that BTC won't drop back to the $20k-$30k range, even in the face of an SEC rejection. There are other proposals in the pipeline that could keep BTC stable and perhaps even bullish until January 2024.",
