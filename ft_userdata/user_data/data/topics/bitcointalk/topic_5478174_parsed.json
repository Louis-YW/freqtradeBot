Website to introduce detailed information about this cryptocurrency.2. Blockchain browser3. A desktop wallet (preferably one that can mine directly using the wallet and computer. There are many high-quality users in China who are not technical and want to participate in such a project, but they do not know how to build a mining pool and do not know how to mine. mine)4. White paperI want to develop such a cryptocurrency and bring it to China to promote it so that more people can participate. After all, many Chinese people have missed the opportunity to buy Bitcoin at low prices or mine Bitcoin for free.In China, there are very few opportunities to participate in cryptocurrency private sales. Most people can only buy them on exchanges. If there is a cryptocurrency that can be mined for free, I believe it will be popular.In China, 99% of users do not believe in projects made by Chinese people, and there are too many cases of being defrauded by their own people.As long as it is a project run by non-Chinese people, it has high credibility and the enthusiasm of users to participate is also very high.I have some money, but not much, and some investment ability. I also hope to bring it to China to make money.I hope all seniors can give me some advice, thank you very much.I also hope I have a technical partner if the project is successful.I don’t know if I can put my email address. If I can, please let me know. I will actively communicate with you and work with you. I can solve the money issue.I don't speak English. I use translation software. If there are any mistakes, I hope you can forgive me.",

If you succeed in solving it better than Bitcoin, there will inevitably be a demand for your currency, but unfortunately there are thousands of cryptocurrencies.You are very familiar with China’s crypto market. You are right. Trading and mining cryptocurrencies are not allowed in China. However, many users are also participating in the crypto market. China’s financial management authorities have always imposed restrictions. .The altcoin I need is purely hype and cannot solve actual problems. It is just to allow users to obtain this altcoin for free or at low cost. Users only need to pay a very low electricity bill to participate in mining.As for the future value of this altcoin, it will be left to the users to decide. If the number of users of this altcoin reaches 10,000-100,000 or more, I believe the value will be very high.In China, free mining of altcoins is a very worthwhile thing to do. Most users do not look at the immediate value and do not want to miss an opportunity to become rich.As long as there is an opportunity to participate in mining, it will attract a lot of users to participate, and dozens to millions of users will come in to mine altcoins.Moreover, these people are all users with spending power, and they will continue to preach and invite new users.",
