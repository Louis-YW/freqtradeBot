That, of course, doesn't mean that this time around we'll have the opposite situation, as the bear market may well continue into the next year. But it's indeed a good reminder that the media make terrible mistakes when it comes to predicting the price of Bitcoin, and that price predictions aren't scientific in nature. There's no science-backed way of making such predictions, and thus anyone is as good as anyone else in this matter.",

It will not hurt to play safe but following news is really the dumbest thing to do specially on trading. I couldn't have said it better myself. I've also noticed this pattern in news coverage. When the market is bullish, excessively optimistic predictions keep popping up, and the exact opposite thing happens during bearish periods. News and predictions mostly follow market trends, just like you said. I don't see any valid reason to take them into account. I don't even bother reading any kind of analysis or news anymore. That keeps my mind at peace. Although Bitcoin has taken a hit due to the FTX fall, it's perfectly normal since the cryptocurrency world has taken a solid hit with it being one of the largest exchanges worldwide.",

If you're super optimistic outlook or very bleak portrayal of the market, prepare for the opposite to happen or wait for the sideways. I remember there is a site that collect news articles on this topic but I can no longer find it. Twitter is the main echo chamber these days, if that website is truly gone maybe we won't see such an accurate contra indicator in the future. Of course, at the end of the day it is just a prediction, it may or may not come true.",

When we read articles here and there, it’s up to us to separate the wheat from the chaff, contrast the information we’re interested in, and formulate our own assessment. It is true that, for those who casually take a peek at the media these days, they may be getting the impression that bitcoin is dead due to the amount of pseudo-apocalyptic articles around, just as a casual peek a year ago made us apparently make it to the moon and beyond (through bitcoin) without a shadow of doubt.",

That is when we don’t get to see articles about how bitcoin has gone up 0,x% today, which are pointless.It's the story of every industry. Every company basically expects you to do better than previous years, in terms of revenue. So, everyone is expecting more money, and it's never sustainable. A lot of journalists as an example start their careers off very well, they don't just post for the sake of it, and they don't make stuff out. Yet, with time the motives for covering stories changes, it's not to tell you truth or keep the world in the know, instead it's all about money. You're absolutely spot on, that it's about generating enough articles that they're meeting their quota. This results in plenty of stories that just don't cover anything new, and they're just reiterating the same bloody story that they've already covered. Plus, negative news sells. Positive news, doesn't so much. Drama is literally the money maker, and that's why you see these headlines which are basically taking something bad, and turning it into the end of the world. Bitcoin has been subject to this for years, I stopped following the news years ago. The only time I read the news related to Bitcoin is through this forum. Any other news I only read big the bigger stuff like the Ukrainian war etc. If we all did this, we'd probably live happier lives.",

No matter how feel-good or positive these predictions are, you can't deny the fact that we are still being battered by lots of sell orders due to the FTX fiasco that occurred very recently.
