It amazes me how many people actually still mine there  I have seen many similar stories and any pool after the accusation speaks of software errors. The share of the pool is 30% now and 43,000 dollars worth of coins are mined per day. The pool has to freeze $90,000 worth of nex coins for a quick payout to the miners, and the pool won't cheat because it's afraid of more scandals.",
