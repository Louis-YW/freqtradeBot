  "content": "GM Crypto Fam - was going over the Friday newsletters, and came across this interesting topic about DeFi benefiting from CeFiâ€™s eroded trust.I mean, it is obvious by now that SBF exploited customer funds, so where can we put our digital assets without them being obscurely abused? Given that the proper DeFi platform is self-regulated, and is hosted on a public blockchain, all transactions are visible, etc.Do you also believe that DeFi is the solution to the current problem, or is there something else on your mind?Source: https://app.getresponse.com/view.html?x=a62b&m=BI4aTG&mc=lE&s=BtgXWnG&u=QcLhh&z=EhEgsn&",
