  "content": "Looks like SBF is at it again and basically trying to lure investors into investing into FTX. He is looking to raise +$6B or so. I think he is trying to sell some FTX bonds which are paying 10% per year for 3 years and then converted into common stock.Now I realise that Bitfinex did something similar when they got hacked back in 2015. They raised I think $1B very quickly. And their valuation is much lower back then than FTX today. However they got hacked... SBF committed fraud.They seem to generate $10-20B in volume daily and $1B in revenue per year. Seems like a profitable company however.... will anyone actually invest billions after what he did? Will people actually still trade on FTX after all this mess?I give this 10% chance of succeeding....",

He posted some interview earlier saying he is raising funds but then the FTX Official posted saying that SBF is no longer in charge and not to pay attention to him anymore.So I am really confused what he is trying to do.",

How could they trust FTX? there financial status are really in bad shape where they have huge money needed to compensate to their millions of users. For sure investors most likely taking suicide for there money if they push this plan because let say even if they could raise funds from those private individual to pay there users the question there is are those people will go back to the platform to use their exchange? I think not they already get out with the problem and how could they came back on the platform where give them huge stress due to financial issues?",

I thought investors are smarter than that? and assuming that SBF has plans to raise funds, who are going to be lured on his scam? I mean scheme? And if there is something that history will teach us in crypto, it's that once your reputation has been damage here, its' going to be very difficult to come back.Quote from: jossiel on November 16, 2022, 11:47:09 PMThose that have the funds and can afford to lose it for the second time around would take the gamble.

FTX Exchange is a huge exchange, I believe it is the second biggest exchange after Binance and as you can see, their trading volume is huge too, so what if they continue to operate and continue to earn money by trading fees and other exchange-related operations?On the other side, FTX did something terrible, suspected that they used customer's fund, so the issue here is different from Bitfinex before which I believe it's very difficult to regain trust of people again.",

As far as I know, the resignation is in his favor because if FTX does not raise capital to restore business, FTX will officially go bankrupt at that time as the CEO of FTX, he will not be able to start a new company or participate in any other projects. This is why he resigned shortly after FTX filed for bankruptcy, but if they can really successfully raise capital to get back in business, he will definitely return as CEO.",

Double kill not only for FTX but also for those who still trusted him and fell to this \"raising fund\" shit again.Hype? There is no hype with this one. The only thing that this has is lack of trust because of what happened. I don't know if it's only me, but we are in a crazy world of crypto where there are still people who are trusting the project regardless of what happened to them in the past. Just look at LUNA. We expected it to crumble and fall down after what happened to them but still, there are investors who are willing to give them a second chance thus, they are still operating though thru a different project already. I will not be surprised though if there are still some investors who will try and help SBF with his +$6B fund raising and I will not call them stupid or whatever others want to call to them since they still trust him regardless of what happened. I'm just a bit confused why he is the one that is organizing it though he already resigned as the CEO of FTX.",
