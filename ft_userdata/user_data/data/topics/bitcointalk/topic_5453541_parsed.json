It was designed to allow easy backup if I'm not wrong, so personal data (where wallets or other apps store their data) will definitely get exposed, which is why using a password to encrypt the data should be mandatory even if you don't buy it from random strangers. Btw, this is my first time hearing about people buying IDs to download an app instead of looking for an IPA or using other apps to save time and trouble. Didn't expect people to be that daring.",

Mobile devices should be considered as one of their hot wallets and should never be used to store all or majority of their cryptocurrency.",

But without iCloud or Google Clouds, those OS manufacturers make many other vulnerabilities possible. Apple ID is a personal account that can access Apple Store, Online Stores related to Apple, iMassage and many other things including iCloud on your Apple devices. With this, it is saying that Apple ID is connected to Apple users apps and crypto wallet apps are included. I do not know Apple users can be easily hacked this way. We should know that any thing you are doing on Apple products is not safe as you have the Apple ID.",

      "body": "Agree with this news because my friend asks me to help him create an Apple ID but is not easy to create an account on Apple before because it asks for I think debit/credit card if I remember correctly unlike years ago when steve jobs still alive you can easily make Apple ID without them.However, instead of creating a new account, I give him my own account since I switch to Android due to more supported games/apps but I notice he can able to recover old data from my previous iPhone like contacts and data of some apps. Luckily I don't use it for Bitcoin because all my wallet before is on my old Laptop.I can still see that there still many Apple users can't able to make Apple IDs which is why many phone technicians are selling Apple accounts or iCloud.",

      "body": "Suppose the user owning the Apple ID being sold applies 2FA to the Account security settings. In that case, other users who want to access the Apple ID certainly require verification from different devices that have been registered there.But when someone deliberately makes an Apple ID without 2FA and sells it, I think the person who bought it is stupid. Because, after all the information he uses with the Apple ID, it is also very likely that the seller still keeps a copy to enter into the account he sells.How is it different from buying, for example, a wallet.dat file from someone else who admits that the password is lost, so he can't open the wallet?Quote from: Sokolik4 on October 30, 2018, 08:35:18 PMSaya akan menjual 4 wallet.dat yang berbeda dari Bitcoin Core dengan kata sandi yang hilang. -snip-Translation: I will sell four different wallet.dat from Bitcoin Core with lost passwords. -snip-",

Apple ID is an Apple users identity, thus using someone else's ID is like using their identity, and selling your personal Apple ID is like giving your identity over to someone else, it could definitely land someone in trouble. The person might get enough data/info about your for identity theft, thus you might get yourself arrested for a crime you didn't commit, but was committed with your info.",

Years ago when I was on apple, it wasn't difficult to create, those are the years of iPhone 4. With the evolution of iPhone, it ought to be easier to create new IDs. Could it be that people are avoiding signing in with credit cards or what, could it be because of criminals or what new features has Apple.Well, I do not know much since I have fallen in love with Android (Samsung) over a decade now.Then key phrases shouldn't he stored in the cloud or phone.",
