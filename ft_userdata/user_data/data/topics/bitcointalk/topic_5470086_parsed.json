Owning a virtual property is not the same as owning a real one. It's just like NFTs (through the form of digital art, items, etc.). It may be all hype that will eventually fade away into oblivion.

I don't even understand why would people buy such scam and priced these scam things worth decent amounts of money? The price is always decreasing from time to the time. No reason to buy this kind of product. NFT is all pure hype and everything in NFT related to the scam. It's a new way to scam people yet stupid people keep buy that shitty land which made me feel curious about that. NFT is a hell no for people who has a normal sense. DIgital real estate will not have future. Once the game will disappear and land will be also following it as well. This is reality.",

Thank you very much. It has no future, everything in crypto apart from Bitcoin and Ethereum is a hype, we have seen how prices soar when the hype of NFTs, Memecoins, Metaverse, P2E, M2E to AI works.Is all this long-lasting and sustainable now? The answer is no, so be wise in choosing something, there's no harm in buying digital properties, but buy at the right time, LOL.2 images of land prices attached by @X-ray I think have interpreted your question, mate @Abiky.",

Or maybe I'm wrong?I don't think this expression is wrong because when I try to understand the form of digital real estate, it is just an updated condition of NFT but the scheme is the same.This kind of hype will definitely continue to happen but the problem remains that this kind of hype will not last long. Even though they are promoting digital real estate, eventually there will be a new and better form and the project will be abandoned and the pattern remains the same with endless hype.I like what you're saying because basically real estate and digital real estate will never be the same even if you claim it's ours but in the future it might be worthless unlike real estate where it's physically somewhere.",

It depends on the kind of digital real estate we are talking about, there are some MMORPGs out there which allows you to have a piece of land and you can build what you want there, and since the number of those lots were limited they increased in value as the video game became more popular and you could sell them for real currency for a very high value, however when it comes to the NFT variation or something similar, I do not see any future to those digital properties and people should stay away from them.",

The NFT market is increasingly quiet and what used to be very hyped with fantasy prices, is now abandoned and prices have even dropped a lot. What to expect when buying Digital Real Estate but not owning the original. It's better to buy the original and manage it, it's better.",

Heck the price bumps might just be the devs themselves buying their \"property\" so that they can boost the price up, which is what happens to most projects anyway. It probably wouldn't be far off till we see digital names being sold (jesus christ). Happens in games all the time but crypto devs are just a step bit too late most of the time with all their \"innovative\" ideas.",

What I mean by that is that he actually has ownership of the real estate and can use it offline. Maybe there are some people who think that this is a good investment and maybe they can take advantage of it, but for investments like this, I tend to choose to invest for real.",

If we say that digital real estate is in limited supply (which is something that cannot be proven) and there is an increasing demand for it, it cannot be used for purposes that are not related to speculation and investment. Therefore, real real estate is the best. Because ownership of the property is legally protected, subject to tax, and can be transferred, while the digital property may not have the same protection that real estate offers you.Is it reasonable for me to pay a million dollars for a digital property?",

Thank you very much. Cant vouch for that as many users got burned having land on axie way back some have multiple million amount but now its worth -99% of that or lets just say unreal value since no one is buying. Cant say for some other virtual land with continous development maybe there are different opinions for this and it will really depend on the usage of that. But if its me, the real estate is the best when its come to investment cause its tangible and have real and back value. Unlike digital that works like nft which liquidity depends on buyers demand.",
