In the next 5 years, not much will really change for Bitcoin, things will be pretty similar to how they are now. However, in 10 years, more countries might realize why making Bitcoin an official currency is a good idea, allowing their people to use it. Looking ahead 20 years, Bitcoin's price is expected to go up significantly, possibly staying above the $100k range. During this time and beyond, many folks might prefer using Bitcoin as a way to store value and cross-border payments method, because it would become a more valuable asset, and people wouldn't be keen on selling it.Quote from: Plaguedeath on December 31, 2023, 04:06:49 AMIn the next 5 years, mixers will be declared as illegal tool regardless it's legit or scam.In the next 10 years, the government will crackdown No KYC P2P and DEX, forcing every sites to ask KYC.In the next 20 years, most of coins are identifiable; the government and CEX know which person owns which address and how much the coins he have.I totally agree with you mate. Mixers used to be a way to amp up Bitcoin's privacy, but lately, they've kind of turned into a hub for shady activities. With all these new mixers popping up, a good chunk of them might be set up by criminals trying to cover their tracks. So, in the next 5-10 years, mixers might just fade away and be labeled as illegal.And about KYC, that's already happening. Think about it – how many non-KYC exchanges do we have now compared to before? Not as many. Many of these no-KYC platforms are facing pressure from government bodies, making them adopt KYC or lose access to services. It looks like privacy might take a hit, and we could end up losing some key Bitcoin features soon.",

      "body": "5 years:5 years not much changed. Bitcoin accepted a bit more in the finance world, probably by then major nations will have figured out regulations for the industry. But even with greater public and finance participation in bitcoin ownership it'll still be seen as a fringe thing and most people still won't know what it is or will have negative views about it from misinformation.10 years:10 years I think we'll be in the early stages of bitcoin being normalized. I think it'll be seen as a more normal investment than it is today, more accepted as something that normal people own. Probably be pretty normal for big corporations to own some bitcoin on the books, and probably be pretty normalized in the finance world, sorta similar to owning the stock of a major company. By now I think the common belief that bitcoin was a bubble that burst (which resets and repeats in people's minds every four years) will start going away and people will start accepting that Bitcoin isn't disappearing and it was a bubble that burst. And while I think actually daily usage of bitcoin to buy stuff will still be quite low I think the option will start being there. I could see major retailers having a pay with bitcoin option by this point, I just don't expect it to be a big draw for consumers by this time.20 years:20 years from now bitcoin will likely be over a million dollars, having cemented its place as the most valuable single asset in the world, above gold's value. This will help further normalize it as something that isn't going to go away and is a regular part of the financial world. I'd expect by this point saving or investing with bitcoin will be completely normalized. No one will bat an eye when someone says the own bitcoin or bitcoin is their savings.I think buying things with bitcoin will start becoming somewhat common by this point as well. LN or other L2 payment solutions as well as custodied services provided by companies will be what the average person uses for bitcoin transactions. It'll just be one more regular payment option alongside stuff like apple pay, google play, credit/debit card, paypal, etc, taking up a small amount of daily transactions among the part of the population that owns bitcoin. By this point El Salvador and MicroStrategy will have gone down in history as the pioneering nation and company that adopted Bitcoin way before any other nation or company was smart enough to do it, and by this time it'll be widely accepted those have both been huge success stories and specifically El Salvador leading the way for nations will have led to numerous other nations by the point having added some Bitcoin to their national holdings. Maybe even some economically major nations like the US will have started holding some Bitcoin by this point.I think maybe by this point also the uninformed stigma of bitcoin mining will also have dissipated as mining has settled into the highly efficient role of operating at power plants to use excess clean power while strengthening the energy industry, as well as stranded clean power. People will finally have gotten over the idea that bitcoin using energy is bad and accept it the way they already accept energy use for any other thing.One interesting speculation would be if the bitcoin ecosystem by this point will have evolved beyond savings and payments and if there is a wider array of applications tied to bitcoin, whether that is through \"Web 5\" or smart contracts build on L2/L3, or whatever. But I won't speculate on that possibility here.",

      "body": "The main roadblock in Bitcoin's way is the centralized system and the regulatory authorities because they want Bitcoin to be in their control and the ones who use Bitcoin for transactions should be monitored by them. This is the roadblock which's going to be a huge burden for the ones who want to use Bitcoin because of it's decentralized model and the privacy in mind but it's hard to evade this thing even in current dates when Bitcoin isn't regulated or centralized yet, and I hope it will somehow find a way to go through this roadblock if they don't suppress the community who believes in decentralization and privacy.Another roadblock in Bitcoin's way of getting more success is the problem of ordinals that has been on the network for quite a time now. The ordinals are causing huge network congestion and due to that the fees of Bitcoin transactions are growing each hour. The developers are working to find a solution for the ordinals but they haven't got any success yet, however in future they may find a way to stop those ordinals and make Bitcoin network less congested again.I would say that if those roadblocks won't stop Bitcoin from its growth then in 10 years we may see Bitcoin as a way of payment for all online stores like PayPal and it may work better than PayPal in most cases. In 20 years I believe most of the nations would accept Bitcoin as a way of payment and may implement it as reserve currency or allow it to be used as a secondary currency to their main fiat currency. I'm sure most of the countries may consider it as a reserve currency rather than a way of payment in 20 years. Who knows by then Bitcoin may no longer be as decentralized as it is in today's date and time.",

The one that comes close In having both qualities is monero, in fact monero seems to be almost more decentralized than bitcoin and what happens to its emergence?
