  "content": "Are there any best practices to handle reorganisations, from the point of a merchant accepting BCT for web purchases?Also, could it be that some kind forum member could point me to some statistics of historical reorganisations, showing f.x. empirical frequency of orphaned blocks, preferrably cathegorised on #confirmations, and perhaps even with a time axis, in case there's a trend? Maybe there already exists some reliable likelihood estimator, as a function of #confirmations?I apologise if this is posted in the wrong place. The Trading sub seemed a bit non-technical.",

For both the link and the sentiment.Am I reading the link right, or have I smoked too much?Not a single block rejected for four (4) years?Take a look here: https://forkmonitor.info/feeds/stale_candidates/btc.rssWhat I posted earlier were orphans, this link is for what happens when 2 pools find a block at just about the same time and it becomes a race to see who wins.Either way it's the same for the people transacting.Both blocks have your transaction = no changeOne block (winner) has it the looser does not = no changeOne block (looser) has it the winner does not = that TX will be in the next block (give or take depending on space) slightly longer wait.In the end, transactions do not just disappear.-Dave",

How do existing payment systems handle the situation when a transaction in a previously confirmed block actually disappears (perhaps because of a malicious actor trying to double spend)?Once again it depends on the payment system and what you are doing.Some examples :With coinex after 1 conformation I can trade on their platform with the funds, but I can't withdraw anything I traded for or the original coin until 6 confirms.With Bitrefill if I DO NOT use RBF and a high enough fee it's either 1 confirm or at times 0 if it's for a small enough card since I have been using their system for a while.For larger amounts it's 1 confirm with no RBF and high enough fee. BUT, we are talking about $10 to $50 gift cards, not sure if that is going to change for a $1000 amazon card for a new user.shoppy.gg is usually 2 or 3 confirms. If you are going to be gaming the network to doublespend the time and effort involved are going to be a lot more then a few dollars.-Dave",
