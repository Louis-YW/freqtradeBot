  "content": "Hit 2 210x Plinko balls for $5 each and was only paid one. Watched the balls fall into each 210x... The game itself recorded it, but still wasnt paid. Messaged support and they asked for a video of it... cmon now. Then they said they would be right back with an answer. 8 hours later a new person messages me from support and says \"We have checked with our colleague and only 1 is shown\".... I literally watched it hit lol, and the game had it in the history.... Their history on the bottom didnt show it. Support pretty much avoiding me at all costs now.

Your best choice is to avoid them for your own discretion, or you can try your luck again, but this time with cautious and record every game you will make.",

      "body": "OP can you prove this beyond reasonable doubt that rollbit scammed you because what you uploaded here is nothing much to convince me that you got scammed by the mentioned casino and come to talk of it, i have not heard any complaint before from any member here that they got scammed by this casino. To the best of my knowledge, this casino is currently running a signature campaign so you see why it would be very difficult to believe your complaint without proves beyond reasonable doubt. If you will they really scammed you then i would advise you make proofs here then go to their announcement board to make post this thread link so their representative could be here to clear their name from this .",

Plinko is a provably fair game and you can check how the pf system works and how to verify the results from here: https://rollbit.com/plinko/provably-fairOP, follow Kirito89's suggestion: get the server seed and client seed of that round and see if you will get the 210 multiplier twice. It's all you need to prove you really hit that multiplier twice and have a valid scam accusation. If not, then it's just a glitch.",

And they gave me the seeds for my bets to verify... And today, about 5 days later when I went to go try and verify it, I realized they have given me the seed but not the \"Next server seed hash\" that I would need to complete the formula... I obviously didnt know that I needed it at the time... but they certainly did; but yet chose to leave that out. Just messaged them and support said \"We'll pass this to the team to see if we can provide these also for you\"Dont know why they wouldnt have provided them in the first place if they know its needed for the formula.I will attatch what theyve given me so far which they said is the \"Server seed\" under the section 'Round ID'... still waiting on the Next server seed Hash. https://postimg.cc/bDbDQ6K1",

If you or anyone could help me with understanding where to input what I would appreciate it This is the formula theyve given me...         https://postimg.cc/56v934d2And this is the seed to the 230x I got paid for (b0ec60c7a0de7749bd0c004df27bd758)Im just not sure where to input anything... Ive never dealt with any coding so this is another language to me... Ridiculous that they make it so difficult to verify a bet as opposed to other sites like Stake the results already ran for you. I also asked support what data I needed to input and they replied: \"The user seed should be the only required input. The server secret is already included in the example code\"",
