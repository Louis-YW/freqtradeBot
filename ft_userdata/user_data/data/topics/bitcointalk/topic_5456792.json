This topic is perfect for Beginners & Helps if you want to find help with your question. I'm not personally involved in BRC-20 trading but Ordinals Wallet and Sparrow Wallet are the 2 wallets that are being used by my friends that buy shit staff on Bitcoin ordinals. Do your own research and you can refer to this article https://www.makeuseof.com/best-bitcoin-ordinal-compatible-wallets/ for more wallet choices.",

      "body": "You can get  a Ledger or Trezor wallet or any other reliable hardware wallets, these help keep your tokens safely  reducing the risk of them being compromised by hackers. Hardware wallets typically require authentication codes or passphrase to access your tokens and provide an extra layer of security. You can use software wallets that are specifically designed for BRC-20 tokens. Examples of popular BSC-compatible wallets include MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Binance Chain Wallet. These wallets allow you to securely store and control your BRC-20 tokens on your device It is worthy of note that you shouldn't keep large amounts of cryptocurrency on exchanges or platforms unless you intend to actively trade with them. Exchanges are vulnerable to hacks, and in the event of a security breach, your funds could be at risk.You can actually learn more about BRC-20 tokens and related topics by visiting the official Binance website at https://www.binance.com And others at...https://www.coingecko.comhttps://coinmarketcap.comCheck the above sites for more about BRC-20",

They are useless and will lose their trading volume, market price with time. Meme tokens can be easily minted and consequently they can die easily too.You are thinking that if you store your BRC-20 tokens in non custodial wallets, you will not lose those tokens. It is true if you keep your wallets safely from hacks but the story does not end here.You have those tokens but how about their values? Will those BRC-20 tokens have good values after a few more months or years? Think of the future of those projects which I believe don't worthy anything.",

Do some research and educate yourself before responding.the THEORY is just that THEORY, in practice it proves nothing hence why it remains THEORYto prove something to no longer be just a theory you have to look at data outside of the scope of the theory to see if the end result still matches the theory. you also have to retest the theory in a different scenario to see if the theory still  fits the results (yep ordinals already has a counting error and many other things that debunk the theory)when you append a meme/json as meta data at the end of a tx.. guess what it has no association with any input or output. its not part of the txdata that forms the TXIDthe decision/proof/immutable lock pairing of junk to output is not in the blockdata.. its done at flimsy GUI decision of a project managers explorer(a decision he can change anytime he wants)EGbc1pNuttyMcDumDum 0.0002 -> bc1pNuttyvictimA 0.00019600bc1pNuttyMcDimWhit 0.0002      bc1pNuttyvictimb 0.00019600signed NuttyMcDumDumsigned NuttyMcDimWhitmeme/jsondata: elephantthat elephant has not made any decision of if it belonged to victim A or B, nor if its part of dumdum or dimwhit.. if you look at the block data. heck its not even signed into the form of the txdata that forms the TXID nor appended to the end of an output. thus has no associationalsoif say dimwhit has a special rare sat from block 750,001 reward meaning  (if we follow the theory) if you count sats victim B has it as its in position 20001 of the spending amount (first sat of second input)..however if you look at BITCOIN ECONOMICSthe FEE is deducted first and the remainder is then spent, by assigning the remainder to destinationsby which 800 sats are removed first from a spend. meaning the 'first sat of dimwit' is in position19201 not 20001 which puts it into victim A (thus changes the destination theory)if say DumDum had a first sat. then that first sat goes straight back to the pool as part of the fee thats first deducted from the inputs. where the remainder 801th-39200th sat then goes to the destinations.. but with all that explained about first sat stuff.. the metadata meme junk appended to the end of a transaction has not chosen a output or what relevant sat is relevant to attach to. for instancethere are less than 800k rare sats (you only get 1 rare sat per block and block height is under 800k) and so with over 12million inscriptions.. hardly any are following the \"rare sat\" theoryhere is another conundrum for youwhat if dimWhits utxo was a first sat of block 750,001 but dumdum was a first sat of block 730,000where by dumdum has a rarer sat because its the first sat of 19m circulationyea.. the junk data does not have any linkage or decision or connection to which 'sat' it appends to.. and the ordinals explorer can change which it chooses to DISPLAY in the explorer. a true proof of transfer should contain the logic within the transaction data, not sat outside the txdata which forms the TXID, also the logic should not be changed after confirmation(yet ordinals theory can change).the logic should be in the blockdata not some GUI that can change any time it likes.. EG next year they decide 'last sat' is important because all first sats end up going to fee's (once they realise bitcoin economics) thus changing the explorers 'theory' ends up changing GUI representation(without immutable proof) to a different output. thus proving a break in all logic, theory, trust",
