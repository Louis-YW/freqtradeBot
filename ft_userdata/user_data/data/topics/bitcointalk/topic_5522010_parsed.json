It's interesting that in Syria within few days the opposition have taken control over the whole country. With so many conflicts going on, the global economy will defiantly suffer and many will find Bitcoin as safe heaven for there capital because of degrading value of fiat. Unless these conflicts cease to exist and global economy finds stability, the Bitcoin will rule.",

I think the sentimental cycle that people have for bitcoin is also one for the reasons the bull market will stop but later continue after bear market. If we should predict the time, that would be in 2026. But with the way bitcoin is right now, I do not know if that will happen or not, but I think bitcoin holders and traders know about this and they may prefer to sell some of their coins and going for short position respectively at the time.",

During my experience learning about Bitcoin, bad news and market saturation are the main factors where the market will go. So far, we have seen, in this cycle period there is a lot of good news that continues to encourage speculation and prices to rise. So I don't see any bad news that caused Bitcoin to crash. It's just that I see some reasonable saturation for the market but market confidence is pushing back the price of Bitcoin to continue to rise. This condition is like a cycle, there is bad news that lowers market confidence and good news that makes the market excited.  IMO",

In other words price has to go way higher than this in a much shorter period for it to be considered a bubble. For example back in 2017 price went from below $1000 to $20000 and mot importantly it went from $10k to $20k in less than a month which created a bubble which then led to the long bear market.Right now we are just getting out of \"slum\" and starting the bull run. Price has to reach something like $1 million to be a bubble and pop and lead to bear market",

Fundamental analysis is very important as a crypto investor or trader and many experience investors have utilize this in know what could happen in the market in the next couples of hours. It is good we understand the news aspect of cryptocurrency so that we are not going to be taking decisions blindly when we ought to be making lots of money as crypto enthusiastic. There are some kind of news that could make the price of Bitcoin to drop which is going to have huge effects on the general crypto market. People would be panicked to sell when they hear of war news or strict regulations on some kind of cryptocurrency assets.",

Indeed, the US and the statements from Trump play a big role in driving up the price of bitcoin. However, they could also easily cause it to drop if their approach has a negative impact. Like if they pass laws that are against the will of the majority and negatively impact the crypto market, it would likely drag prices down as investors rush to sell.But even if the US continues to support crypto, that does not mean that the price of bitcoin will never fall anymore. I believe in the natural market cycle—after every bull season, a bearish season will come next. In fact, we have been experiencing this already.",

The start of any major sale of bitcoin, causing a drop in price by 10-20%, will certainly cause a stop in the bull run. The reasons may be anything and it is not fundamentally important.I have suspicions that the bull run has not really started yet, since the bitcoin's price at one moment has suddenly jerked, and then continues to hang around at the same level. Have the bulls made a false start?",

If you look at the history of previous cycles, you will see only one scenario being used over and over again. Like bitcoin, we can't predict, we will never know what news will make the bull market stop and turn into a bear market.

You asked a question though but honestly for now, there is no atmosphere of anything that will stop the current bull run except in the future if one of the largest exchanges crashes or institutional investors begins a massive selling of their bitcoins if not the only thing that can happen will be for the price to DIP and bounce back after sometimes because a lot of investors now have faith in bitcoin more than any other digital currency and since there is a global rising interest in bitcoin now, anything that will lead to a decline in the current bull trend may as well affect the global economy. Even if US makes laws that will go against bitcoin, the price will only DIP and experience growth again in the future. Inasmuch as there are some regulatory framework by the United States SEC and other regulatory body, i don't think the United Sates of America will want to makes laws against bitcoin, besides they still hold the highest bitcoins among countries in the world so it's not as if any other country has more bitcoins than them. However, bitcoin is still valued in the dollars which has been the currency of the US so everything about bitcoin is still to their own advantage.",

After some big exchange hacks, collapses like Mt.Gox, FTX, Bitcoin market has been continuing its operation and its growth is rapidly parabolic.Nobody here is talking about Bitcoin \"stopping\". If BTC retreated to $1000 right now, it wouldn't be \"stopped\". FTX caused a dip in Bitcoin that lasted quite a while, and I would argue that there would be a \"fool me twice\" sort of effect if there was another major failure like that. Bitcoin has absolutely no intrinsic value, so it will always necessarily be very volatile in its price--and thus very sensitive to bad market news (in South Korea last week it briefly fell to $40k when they had political unrest for instance).Today, Bitcoin's price is propped up by a much broader group of investors, many of whom are smaller consumer investors who are much more skittish. QuoteIf a collapse, bankruptcy of a single centralized exchange can destroy Bitcoin market, it isn't a strong market and no longer attractive for investors.Again, nobody here is talking about \"destroying\" anything, but certainly a major market scare could drag BTC down by 90% and keep it that way for five years or more. That will \"destroy\" a lot of people's retirement savings, but Bitcoin itself as a technical platform will be totally fine.QuoteQuoteA US recession would also do it: all of those crypto bros needing to cash in their bags to pay their bills after they lost their jobs?

I get that if you are an \"OG bitcoiner\", you have no use for all of these n00bs that don't know the philosophy behind Bitcoin, but guess what: if these n00bs leave, then then Bitcoin loses 90% of its market value because their money leaves too.",

That actually might stop bitcoin, specially if such a catastrophic crash to such a low price becomes prolonged. Bitcoin's mining industry has grown and it has grown based on its price. When price has been above $60k for a long time, the hashrate grows based on that profit.If it crashes, the profit crashes therefore miners stop.Miners stopping means hashrate drops significantly and that puts bitcoin in danger of 51% attacks.Quote(in South Korea last week it briefly fell to $40k when they had political unrest for instance).On which exchange because I am curious to see why the traders missed such a massive opportunity for making a massive profit using arbitrage.
