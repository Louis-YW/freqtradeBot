  "content": "Earlier this year, I made a WTB post looking for a low serial number Satori. I respect Satoris for being one of the original mainstream small funded btc collectibles, but always wanted one that stood apart and was unique.  While bitflyers are very unique and limited Satoris, the few I have seen have serial numbers in the 21k range. During my WTB, I received zero offers or pictures of a low serial Satori. So, my simple question is: What is the lowest serial Satori you've seen?  I have seen the Satori pic of serial 000001. I believe it was from their website or from google. What I am wondering is one you have actually laid eyes on or from a private pic.  I will not be of much help, as I think the lowest I've seen is not very low at all... maybe 15k. Not low enough that I considered it anything special. Bonus points if you have a picture or own it. Thanks!!PM-ICT",
