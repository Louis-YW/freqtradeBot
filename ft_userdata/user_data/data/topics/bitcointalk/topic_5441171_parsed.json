Some DEXs need to get a hold of your funds because it needs to if you're trading futures/etc. On the other hand, with spot market trading like Uniswap, you don't necessarily need to deposit.But yea, the \"decentralized\" definition in contrast to DEXs is a slippery slope â€” it's going to depend on how you look at it. A far more better description is \"non-custodial\".",

I don't even think that funds were lost in the first place as I have never heard of any claims from customers regarding defi FTX products. But that doesn't mean defi can't go bankrupt, it can be caused by liquidity matters , smart contract vulnerabilities, or other factors.",

You can pretty much do this with a CEX where you deposit funds, buy the token you want, and then withdraw into your cold storage. But I am talking about how exactly do the ones where you are actively trading, paying funding rates every 8 hours or so. How exactly are those decentralized since you send the funds to them.

How does it work when you are in an active trade.Are you referring on the spot live trade or leverage trading? Most dex/defi doesnt have feature of centralIed exchange but some improve a lot in the future. Its working based on your active trade engaged in the dapp. Most defi dex cant have a set order sell but mostly automatic swap trade when in used. Its real time so if you loss when you are trying to swap tokens vice versa to some tokens it would only execute based on your activity deed. But some leverage trading can even set now stop loss or any feature on a dex platform to avoid much bigger loss.",

I'm not sure what constitutes decentralized and centralized login either, but almost all \"DeFi\" platforms use more or less similar login models. CMIIW.It was mentioned above, so I suggest you read it more. I also agree that using the term \"non-custodial\" is better since most of the time we're just talking about whether we still have control over our funds or not. Many exchanges use the term \"decentralized\" loosely and it is unclear what line they are referring to. At one point I've seen an exchange use it to describe the nature of their servers being hosted in multiple countries, but their cold wallets are controlled just by four people.",
