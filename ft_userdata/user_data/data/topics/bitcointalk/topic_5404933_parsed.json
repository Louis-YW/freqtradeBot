Bisq don't offer great rates but they're a good choice for not having to do any kyc.I've heard of non kyc exchanges (like relai.ch/relai.appo) but don't have any experience with them so I'm not sure of their safety/reputation.You could also say you want to trade on the currency exchange board here and ask if someone wants to deal with you (via online payments like PayPal).Also I think the payment processor revolut can handle crypto to fiat transfers so it might be one to check.",

Though this mode may be risky, I highly recommend using an escrow to utilize the transaction to make it relatively safe and secured at the same time.If abovementioned procedure fails, then I suggest creating an account in your respective local exchanges. Though KYC documents are needed, you can still create an account but you are faced with certain deposit/withdrawal limitations.",

I think they can also help you convert to other anonymous coins before transferring the payment to you. For example, a highly anonymous coin like Moreno, it is a completely anonymous coin if you don't want your information online. Try talking to them.",

If I remember correctly, Kucoin centralized exchange that you could try, it does not require KYC like Binance, Huobi, or FTX exchange.But there will be certain limitations for non-KYC users and I also don't know if your country has any restrictions on Kucoin or not.You can visit and refer to:: https://www.kucoin.comhttps://www.kucoin.com/support/360015102254-About-KYC-Verification",

Well this is already an illegal use  and it's not a good suggestion nor here or elsewhere. I will never made an attempt like this because I can just risk to have my account frozen or the get some complaint with legal departments of these sites. Plus a counterfeit document is expensive and not easy to find (for sure who can provide it is not the best people for a deal).... Bad idea  definetely a bad idea!@OP you can always exchange your crypto in a p2p / local market / local rates. Isn't easy and there is some risk when you meet stranger but I think you can find some valid options...",

I dont want to go into risky deals each timeYou can try and do some deals here at bitcointalk. There are some services and P2P trading available at Currency Exchange Board and in case you don’t want to risk any deals, you can ask for an Escrow to make no scam will happen during the trade. Escrow service requires minimal fee but there some trusted users here that will provide that for free.How this helps you on doing P2P deals.",
