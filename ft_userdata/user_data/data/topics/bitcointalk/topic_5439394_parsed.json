It would be beneficial for both you and crypto, you will get some quality traffic and there will be some more new people who will be able to learn more about cryptocurrency through your blog posts. If you are going to start a blog from scratch, make sure you niche it down so that your target traffic already has some bit of knowledge about cryptocurrency.",

By sharing information about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and how they can be used for investment, you can help educate people, particularly those in rural areas, about the growing crypto space and its potential for the future. However, it's important to remember that cryptocurrency is still a relatively new and complex field, and it's important to be accurate and responsible in your information sharing, so as not to misinform or mislead your followers.",

Little knowledge is dangerous to everyone, those that have less experience yet they think of themselves as influencers, they'll be accountable for what they do.I agree, these influencer should be held accountable if ever they mislead people into investing in a Ponzi or scam company that uses Bitcoin to bait investors.Quote from: livingfree on February 10, 2023, 10:36:46 PMIt's not about the influence that they bring but it's about the responsibility that they have.

But I'm sure others have learned from those mistakes of sharing some information that hasn't verified yet.People are greedy, so if some advertisement where one can gain huge income or profit, whether it is too good to be true or not, people will jump in without thinking any possibility of being scammed.  But regardless of that, people who posted this kind of bait should be accountable and be punished as an accomplice if something bad happen to the money of the investors since for sure they get a share of profit from this victims.Anyway, sharing Bitcoin in our personal blog is a great way of introducing people to Bitcoin so we should be responsible enough to make it informative and factual.",

People see that not a lot of people around them use Bitcoin so they don't have a lot of interest in it. They don't see incentive to use Bitcoin because there's no huge discounts offered by their favorite sellers if they use Bitcoin. And they know that Bitcoin has a potential to crash very fast, and this fear is bigger than the hope of increasing the value during bull market.",

You said well OP but do you think the rural people can be able to scale through the process involved in getting aquatinted with bitcoin just by reading? Do you think they are much flexible in learning by reading  as fast as you do?   Bitcoin has come a long way to this point and I do not think it is a new thing anymore but what I think can be done is talking to mini traders, freelancers, etc to start the adoption of bitcoin in their various quarters so as to speed up the daily transaction of bitcoin  globally. When that is done,  I think more vendors would start adopting the bitcoin to their payment schedule for potential customers that are bitcoin inclined.",

On the other hand what are the possibilities that people won't see this as a means of you defrauding them. Sometimes when people see adverts or posts of crypto on socials, they tend to just ignore because to them, it's just a scam. How sure are you, that you can convince the public that you are not scamming them but trying to help. To me it's a good idea ooo but it would be a waste of your time because most people won't actually give ears to such posts.But if it's what you wish to do then there's no problem trying. There a first time for everything. You can as well give a reasonable Description and important facts, like the prices and other related issues concerning bitcoins. Then take proper analysis on the views and replies you get from each post. So you would have an idea on what your viewers are most interested in the Bitcoin world...",

But don't expect something big though, I mean it's just your little help for the world to know what it is and the benefits.Let the imagination of your audience play and maybe they will invest, maybe not.At least you do your part spreading the world and that is good already.

Bitcoin is already a famous word that is being searched around the globe. With the ever increasing YouTube Channels, Mass Media News, various Government inceptions into bitcoin use case, it is already getting publicized around the globe. Imagine the current situation when any country is producing their Budget for the Financial year, they will have considered the Bitcoin and how they can either use it by taxing it or may be even make it illegal tender for that particular nation. Either way crypto currencies as whole getting published naturally. It's like the thing of tomorrow which everyone wants to have and have their attention towards it. You are just mentioning about the blogs here but if you know what I have mentioned up here then bitcoin's publicity is at its peak. Nobody needs to force write about the blog. All the popular blog sites already have content associated with the bitcoin. Meanwhile, it's now next big thing to have news about the bitcoin and it's current moves in the NEWS articles. At least 2 out 5 articles would be about blockchain, crypto, or bitcoin targeted itself. With the merchants who are using bitcoin as payment method, they are having mouth to mouth publicity with their bill boards, for example \"bitcoin accepted here\". Definitely bitcoin is on right path when it comes to it's marketing.",
