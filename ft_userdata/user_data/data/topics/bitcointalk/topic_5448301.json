I have a few bitcoins that I have purchased and stored somewhere, which I gift to myself as birthday gifts and have decided to hold onto for so long that I don't even know when I will ever decide to sell them off, maybe after my first child is born, or when bitcoin will actually turn $100-$300k.Â ðŸ˜‰One thing about day trading is knowing the right time to buy and the right time to sell, because you might have some volume of BTC and when you see a higher price, you might be tempted to sell with the hope of buying back when the price drops, but you might end up seeing it hit an all-time high.Â So just trade with a strategy that favors you; what favors me might not be what will work for you.",

I used to trade... to be honest, I used to trade alcoins in the ICO era, then invest in altcoins for longer term, mainly ETH and Cardano, then I became more of a bitcoin maximalist. Now I'm a hodler. I don't trade anymore. I have some of the altcoins that I used to trade in 2019 but I got rid of most of it and turned it into bitcoin. I don't use many resources or tools to stay updated. This forum is usually enough, but I read some outlets or watch youtube channels like the daily hodl from time to time.I think that holding is much better if you don't have time to monitor the price. If you're unemployed, by all means, turn to trading. If you have a job, don't undermine it by staying up at night watching bitcoin charts.",

Bitcoin is usually held by me for the long term, moreover Bitcoin is a currency that you will not get good profits if you hold it short term. Holding Bitcoin for the time being for three to four years can yield fairly good results. But the whole year 2022 was the best time to invest in Bitcoin. Because 2022 was full of bloody events and the Bitcoin market was below $16,000.Those who invested in Bitcoin at that time and decided to hold it for a long time now have the opportunity to double their profits. Moreover, in the coming halving years, if Bitcoin surpasses the highest market in 2021, then unimaginable profits will come to those who invest and store it at the present time.",

Holding is the easiest way to do in minimizing the risk. Like if you buy Bitcoin during the bear season, hold and wait for the next bull run - you are actually eliminating stress in your mind.

But if you multiply the earnings you can get by holding or trading I can say its the same so, but you just need to be consistent then not to be so greedy to take more challenge in the market to assure you can gain.
