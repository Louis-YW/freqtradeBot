  "content": "Hey! We provide full-stack blockchain development services including smart contract development and consulting for both public and private blockchain.A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties that is stored on a blockchain, such as Ethereum or EOS. Every such contract has a predefined set of rules and conditions and is automatically executed when those conditions are met. These contracts are guaranteed by the consensus of the whole blockchain network. They cannot be altered by anyone unless the whole network approves of the change. This makes smart contracts one of the safest and most powerful tools for creating agreements between different parties. Hereâ€™s how your business can benefit from smart contract development.https://qcontract.org/?id=24",
