Because of the awareness, more people will use their products and services in a way they will also make profit. If not profitable, the company will stop the campaign. If the company noticed profit, the campaign will continue.Quote from: Kelward on August 23, 2023, 12:11:18 AMLastly weda dem products de promote bitcoin?What they care more about is how they can benefit their customers and make more money from their customers.",

Okay, how signature campaign dey carry make money be say when they launch campaign here, they create an awareness to a large number of audience wey dey always come visit this site every day, and likewise when a project run a Facebook, Twitter & Instagram bounty campaign, they end up creating awareness across all those social media, whereby for those who love what the casino or project offer, they end up giving it a try, and if they love it, they promote/recommend it to others.QuoteLastly weda dem products de promote bitcoin?Yes, because since the forum itself is all about Bitcoin, whichever project or casino advertised is expected to target the same Bitcoin users.QuoteAbeg if dis na forbidden question, our ogas dem fit to lock di thread.

This audience now would be the market target for the business to strive on for profit making. Here onboard this platform, one of the major reasons for this campaign is forÂ  reliability in the sense that members would prefer projects running campaign here ie they feel they are safeÂ  doing or dealing with such project as their presence is recognised here andÂ  another thing is that the number of daily engagements here is very much enough to attract traffic to any of the signature campaign. Do not forget that most people here are not just here for fun but for business. Some doÂ  daily routine check for casinos, and other projects to invest in and also some do research for others too.Lastly, the talk of payment for advertising here, yes they do pay for avatar and signature space to members selected for the campaign purpose. So that is why you see campaign managers put up advert and do take time to select members carefully to do the task and after that, based on the mode of agreement between the both parties, the campaign manager pays accordingly depending on the terms and conditions of engagement.",

Signature campaign as said has been already answered by users above but if you must know, they are only seeking for them to get a wider exposure and audience and, also keep in mind that those projects never rely on a particular site to run their adverts. For example, there was a day I was watching football and I noticed stake.com was printed into their clothes they wore.. that's to say that they are not only limited to Bitcointalk but are also running their ads elsewhere but Bitcointalk is a community that focuses on bitcoin related discussion and they want to maintain their stayed over here without just ending in an unwanted way since they knows the importance of here. But nevertheless, reduce your focus from that aspect and seek on how to increase in level and advance your wisdom bank.",

Bitcointalk na one forum for cryptocurrency minners and investors, Â you no fit read or research about bitcoin and u no visit this forum.

Never underrate this forum for advertisement, Â once a company name appear here you go sell and make more profits. The money them they pay for campaign here na change to those company and if the forum no they benefit them, you for no they see company coming for signature advert. As them they benefit well na e make them still dey come this forum. To meÂ  forumÂ  advertisement cheap than TV and radio advert, if you know how much them they pay for 1min advert on TV and radio and yet most of those TVs and radio no get viewer reach bitcointalk, so company they benefit well here.",
