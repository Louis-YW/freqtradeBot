  "content": "A 60 megawatt electric power facilities has been launch by ECOS in Armenia to boost bitcoin mining energy and power demand and supply, from their official statement, they are providing miners with an affordable solution in tackling against the energy supply needed in bitcoin mining and also providing a suitable and tax free atmosphere for the next 25 years, free economic zone, and a condusive environment for mining which can accommodate about 20,000 mining rig equipments for set up with an extendable power supply to about 200megawatt.QuoteArmenia patronizes the blockchain/mining sector and has allowed the creation of FEZ with unique conditions such as 0% income tax and 0% VAT, 0% import and export duties, 0% property and real estate taxes for the next 25 years, which allows our partners to receive maximum revenue on capital.https://bitcoinist.com/a-new-country-for-bitcoin-mining-officially-opens-its-doors/amp/Amidst energy challenge from different angles especially the government, bitcoin miners have suffered a great number of oppositions and obstacles claiming it environmental harm inwhich is not what the real state is, there have been several moves as well to go green in tackling this through the use of  renewable energy sources which is the only lapses i see from the ECOS data center, they would have go green instead of using the centralized source of power from the government, we can't phantom the future repercussions of this action to what it may later turn to, but i think this will be a first rescue on challenging minners.",

      "body": "QuoteAlso, we have to mention ECOS end-to-end service: The company takes full care and responsibility for the purchase of mining equipment from Bitmain, on behalf of our clients or simply helps to move from other data-centers to ECOS, the company’s employees test, install and maintain equipment 24/7 and you can watch and control your assets directly from the mobile app.Yeah, reminds me of this:The risk of NOT actually owning your mining hardware.Compas customers lost a ton of money when sanctions kicked in and the company forcefully liquidated their miners, what could go wrong in a country that has just been in a war with its neighbor?Quote from: SFR10 on August 01, 2022, 07:30:27 AMNot sure why on their website, they've said it's \"free energy\", but this is what I found from another article.Not just free but:QuoteECOS data center receives an additional 60 MW of clean, affordable and stable electricity from high-voltage networks, which makes it possible to claim almost 100% up-time electricity.This combined with the fact that Armenia imports all the gas and oil needed to run those, and I wonder why anyone should be surprised if in one or two months the cost of your colocation is double the income from mining.When a company shows you this nice income model, somehow putting the price at 90 000 (but you can't set it lower than 43k, lol) , then some alarm bells should start bringing for anyone.",
