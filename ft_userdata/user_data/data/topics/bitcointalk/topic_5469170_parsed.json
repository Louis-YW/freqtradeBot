So if you have noticed such delay in getting results when it comes to balance, you should know that it is one after the other so I no think that should not be any problem. It can only be a problem when there are discrepancies in the balance result on your dashboard while having a view of be them. But however, it is nice you have brought up this concern so they could take note of it.",

And what does that happened if the plinko tab close then open again? I encounter this issue before on Bgaming plinko but it just resume my previous game while my is still on pending.This discovery is indeed nice find if the game will automatically finish when tab close while the automatic game is still running.",

The rolls can be calculated fast for tons of bets, but is in the user's hands to change that result/luck by changing the user seed before the rolls. For that, we only need to open the Fair options on the plinko game and input a new user seed. And this is a nice feature because all the users who are paranoid and think the rolls are pre-selected but they always have the option to choose their own client seed. And that will alter the result from the run.Some users prefer to keep the seed because this way they feel they are getting closer to that x999 after a long losing strake, but from my point of view, is not about the seed, is about luck, and any seed could get that big multiplier in the next shot.",

Removing the process just turns it into animationless RNG predictorAlso i know ways of making it even faster (im not sure about stake tho) but at some casinos there are some tricks lol (testing purposes only ofc)",

This is the thing i do like on playing plinko on Stakeon which you could really be able to drop off 100 plinko balls in one go but i dont really expect that much on hitting up those xxx though but basing up on the oddsthen its something that really entertains me.Also in this case in this regard then it wont really be that a boggling thing i should say. Animation lags behind and results been instantly made once you domake press of that drop button.",

If that big hit comes, I wasn't lucky with Plinko in my last plays, but I enjoyed playing it anyway. So this trick is for people who wish to speed things up just for the sake of wagering, I don't see why else would anyone use it.",

Take online roulette, for exmple. There is no actual wheel or ball in the digital roulette and there is no \"physics\" that will determine the outcome. Instead, it is all about fancy computer programming like random number generators and provably fair algorithms. Those cool animations you see with the wheel and ball spinning are just for the show; they do not change a thing about the final outcome. The same goes for plinko and other games.",

Like for example is this particular casino game that has to deal with colors and numbers although I can't recall the name because it's been long I actually played there but I can remember vividly the experience of actually placing a bet on two different tabs on different outcome of color balls but before the games started the balance of my winning was updated and the loss also updated.",

That's an important aspect, allowing users to change their client seed provides a sense of agency and control, even though the outcomes are ultimately based on randomness. This is how provably fair systems work, and it is a way to ensure that the games are fair and that the casino cannot cheat.  Players should be aware of how the games work, but they should also be able to enjoy the experience without worrying about being cheated. Luck ultimately plays a significant role in these games, regardless of the seed.",
