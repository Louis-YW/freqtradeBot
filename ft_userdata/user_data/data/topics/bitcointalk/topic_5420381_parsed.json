I know the economic situation is dire and we have just experienced the crash caused by FTX but this is not the end, be greedy while others are scared. If you are looking for a place to escape the crisis then bitcoin is the perfect choice for you. Do not be afraid and believe in what we have been pursuing for so long. Bull season is not too far away.",
