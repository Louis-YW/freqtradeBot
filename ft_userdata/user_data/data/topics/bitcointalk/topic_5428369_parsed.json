  "content": "As predicted earlier already, Ripple will inevitably fail. I'm surprised how bad Ripple has performed and even my bearish prediction from 2 years ago was too bullish: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1381669.msg55906628#msg55906628Even my MORE bearish prediction from 1 years ago was too bullish: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1381669.msg57953990#msg57953990So let's make a recap. Once again, I want to apology and make my next prediction even more bearish because right now it is very clear: Ripple has lost! When Ripple challenged Ethereum some years ago for second place and succeded for a short time, Ripple fanboys were very bullish but as I warned, it was only for a short time. Quickly, Ripple lost its position against Ethereum again and some time later it lost against Binance Coin and USDT. It also lost a position against USDC but won a position against Cardano, which is no surprise because Cardano development is very slow and Cardano a very outdated coin. But even winning a position against weak Cardano resulted in NO GAIN for Ripple because Ripple is a shitcoin. Ripple is simply a centralized SCAM. RIPPLE XRP is SCREWED! Whye Ethereum is reprimanded by SEC it will come much worse for XRP: Ripple will be forgotten and replaced by new coins! Ripple had always a huge exposure because it was highly ranked at Coinmarketcap and people bought it directly after BTC and ETH. Ripple fraud marketing by bot advertising to deceive people worked very well until it was EXPOSED. But now it is inevitable for Ripple to lose more importance every day! New, decentralized and fast coins are rising and Ripple will be losing positions over time. It will be embarassing to watch for alle Rippletards, so better get out ASAP! For everyone still holding XRP: Better get out ASAP. XRP is a scam coin and will go down like a sinking ship! Maybe con man Garlingcrook will get arrested and his money will be spent for human rights or to help Ukraine.  It would be nice.",

(....)Ripple (XRP) is already fishy since the beginning. Especially before, when I start to get introduced to cryptocurrency, as I do some research and there are already a lot of altcoins that is fishy but still existed. The best example is Ripple (XRP).So yeah, Ripple is a red flag for me already, especially since there are a lot of new altcoins popping up that are much better than Ripple (XRP).",

      "body": "Ripple is facing huge whale movements ahead of their decision on Ripple vs SEC. According to the data furnished by the crypto whale monitoring carrier, the most current transaction came about on December 12 – a withdrawal of 38,893,182 (38.89M) XRP worth $14.4M by an unnamed whale. XRP whales have flipped huge amounts of cryptocurrency for the reason that information unfold. It is no joke that if Ripple were to lose its case against the SEC, it would seriously cripple the whole sector. The previous ripple price prediction by coinpedia stated it may hover among $0.7 to $0.95 by the give up of the year 2022 but it looks this may not be the case for XRP prices now. As the decision attracts closer,  we can anticipate a direct effect on the XRP prices.News source - https://coinpedia.org/price-prediction/xrp-ripple-price-prediction/We have to wait and watch untill we declare Ripple XRP as a failed coin.",

      "body": "https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-ripple-poised-to-settle-with-sec-this-week-crypto-twitter-weighs-inMeanwhile, crypto attorney Jeremy Hogan, a partner at Hogan & Hogan, says there are several possible outcomes. In a Dec. 10 YouTube video, Hogan told his 157,000 subscribers that he thought there was roughly a 50% chance that Ripple wins, but a “110.6% chance of something happening shortly.”The lawyer predicted that if Ripple wins, the most likely reason would be “it had no legal obligation to purchasers of XRP after the sale occurred, no post sale obligations, in other words there can be no investment contract without an investment contract.”“The evidence is clear in the Ripple case that there is no ongoing legal relationship between Ripple and XRP purchasers. There’s just none, and the SEC has failed to address that problem,” he added.However, he also backed an earlier Nov. 4 prediction by defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor James Filan that the case will be decided on or before March 31, 2023, calling it a “proclamation from a legal God.”",

It is already too late and the damage has been done.Coinmarketcap (before binance) knew what ripple was and they didn’t care. For years it stayed at #2 position and don’t tell me it is because xrp deserved that position. They simply did what SBF did. Bribed the right guys. Lucky for them, their CEO is smarter than SBF so XRP haven’t collapsed, yet.",

LOLNo you are wrong. I reject Ripple for a very long time, check my post history! I have been calling out Ripple shitcoin again and again. Even against Ripple shill veterans like Branko (who's a Putin ass licker as well) and MemberBerries, a Ripple shill. See my post history. I have never bought Ripple because I'm doing research before buying a coin. And when we do a good research, we can spot very quickly, how Ripple is a SCAM!",
