  "content": "QuoteTwo old videos of Terra creator Do Kwon discussing the controversial 'Kill Switch' have emerged on Twitter. In the videos, Do Kwon has mentioned something called \"Protocol Armageddon,\" and he described it as a \"Kill Switch.\" He indicated that the project team may \"pull the trigger and we're gone in 24 hours.\"\"We burn all our assets, we cut all our ties, and it's (Terra) nothing,\" he continues.In the old recovered video from 2021 regarding the 'Kill Switch' and 'Protocol Armageddon,' Do Kwon said the following:\"We have sort of a… something called Protocol Armageddon at the company. So what Protocol Armageddon is, is that it's a Kill Switch. So whenever we feel like we're no longer in a position to be able to best serve the community, we pull the trigger and in 24-hours we're gone. We burn all of our assets, we cut all of our ties, and it's nothing. So that's just in case things move a little bit faster than we're anticipating.\"Source.Moreover, he then tweet this accusation:It's interesting to follow FatManTerra's update on the Terra-Luna fiasco. I'm not saying it's legit since it came from an anon twitter account, but it's great for curiousity and entertaiment purpose. I do feel that Do Kwon will end up in prison tho. What do you think? Is this really a premeditated/planned crime?Remember, the blockchain purpose is to have an immutable data record. I guess people already deviate too far from the core principle.",

I guess people already deviate too far from the core principle.I hope no one imitates what Do Kwon is doing right now, it will seriously damage the reputation of the crypto name in the future if he takes it easy with this issue. Many people will be afraid of crypto investing. there are many crypto dramas that have been missed, almost the same even though the nominal money laundering is different, still this is not something to be imitated",

Instead of trying to recover. What they will go down as will not be a scam, many people will call it a scam without realizing what happened because for many people everything they lose money on is a scam.It could be a casino they gamble and lose and will call it a scam, it could be an exchange that gets hacked for real and it will be a scam, it could be anything and they will consider it a scam. Reality is, Luna is a terribly managed bad project they invested and lost money, that's it, no complex story behind it.",

The rumor says they will first migrate to Terra/Luna v2 (start fresh), and do the kill switch on Terra/Luna v1. This way all shady txs on Terra/Luna 1 can be deleted without triggering more chaos in the community.",
