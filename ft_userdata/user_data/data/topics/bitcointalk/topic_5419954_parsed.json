Your assistance will be appreciated because I need to make revisions to the lists. Thank you.pmprefsignprefsThis issue about the Ignore user options page had been going back years as far as I know. Though it opens without problem, there are problems with it when adding users in bulk.Recently, I added every user on my distrust list (~trust exclusion) and on top that maybe a few others both to my \"Ignore user preferences\" and to my \"Personal Message Options\" for not receiving PMs. The problem now is the pages do not load at all when clicking the link.Please can admin take steps to fix the issue. Here is what Cloudflare say about error 524 about it being a server related issue.I want to revise my Ignore User List list and the Personal Message Options list, at the moment I cannot add or remove any users. Both pages take a very long time before being directed to Cloudflare with the error 524 notice.====",

If it does you might want to send that as a pm to an admin, they're normally pretty fast at isolating those and fixing them but I think it's harder if you don't have one due to the number of visitors the forum has.I can send a Ray ID but they can easily replicate the issue themselves by adding large numbers of users to their Ignore User list.Quote from: jackg on November 08, 2022, 02:44:40 PMIt also looks like it could be due to bitcointalk's server taking too long to respond to cloudlfare. Yes that is definitely what it looks like, the server is taking too long to respond and timing out.According the Cloudflare link, the issue is because it is timing out most probably because of server resources but I find that hard to believe as the server can carry a phenomenal amounts of load. It could be a misconfiguration issue somewhere but I am sure they will look in to it and work out what is doing it.Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 08, 2022, 03:05:58 PMI have \"only\" 471 users in my ignore list and it took quite a lot until it loaded up. I feared it'll timeout.If your list is significantly bigger (and I expect so), it could timeout (or give Cloudflare error?). Did it take a significant time before the error?Yes that is what seems to be happening, the Cloudflare error page takes a long time to load after the Ignore Preferences page link is clicked. You are right my list was significantly bigger than the 471 you added.If I remember correctly, while the list was empty the page loaded without issues. When I added a maximum of maybe 7-10 members in one go, it accepted them and loaded fine too allowing me to add and remove further. When I added the full list to the Ignore User Options to stop receiving PMs from those I wanted to add, I think it consisted of over 1700 users in go. Quote from: NeuroticFish on November 08, 2022, 03:05:58 PMI see others have also complained too that they get bad gateway and cannot update their list.Thank you for the link, I most probably had not noticed the thread. I will read up to see what others are saying.",

I thought about it yesterday but opted against sending a PM to theymos because I can only imagine how full his inbox must be on a daily basis, that was why I wanted to attract the attention of admin who would probably have better success than me in putting the request forward to theymos.I am not sure if theymos saw the thread or if he was alerted to it by admin but the issue was dealt with in around just 1 hour of asking and I received a PM from theymos advising me that the two \"prefs\" lists were cleared, I am very grateful for that.As this Cloudflare time-out issue has been known about for several years, I am locking the thread now.Quote from: Lucius on December 05, 2022, 10:54:22 AMQuote from: JollyGood on December 04, 2022, 11:20:59 PMPlease can someone from admin ask theymos if it is possible to access the database ...We only have two admins, and one of them is theymos, so...
