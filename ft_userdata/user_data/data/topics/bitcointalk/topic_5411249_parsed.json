  "content": "QuotePer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are man-made hazardous chemicals that are spread globally in the atmosphere and as a result they can be found in the rainwater and snow in even the most remote locations on Earth. During the last 20 years, guideline values for PFAS in drinking water, surface waters and soils have decreased dramatically due to new insights into their toxicity. As a result, the levels in environmental media are now ubiquitously above guideline levels.A perspective article by researchers from Stockholm University and ETH Zurich that is published today in Environmental Science & Technology suggests that PFAS define a new planetary boundary for novel entities that has been exceeded.“There has been an astounding decline in guideline values for PFAS in drinking water in the last 20 years. For example, the drinking water guideline value for one well known substance in the PFAS class, namely the cancer-causing perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has declined by 37.5 million times in the U.S.” said Ian Cousins, the lead author of the study and professor at the Department of Environmental Science, Stockholm University. “Based on the latest U.S. guidelines for PFOA in drinking  water, rainwater everywhere would be judged unsafe to drink. Although in the industrial world we don’t often drink rainwater, many people around the world expect it to be safe to drink and it supplies many of our drinking water sources,” Cousins continue.The Stockholm University team have conducted laboratory and field work on the atmospheric presence and transport of PFAS for the past decade. They have noted that the levels of some harmful PFAS in the atmosphere are not declining notably despite their phase out by the major manufacturer, 3M, already two decades ago. PFAS are known to be highly persistent, but their continued presence in the atmosphere is also due to their properties and natural processes that continually cycle PFAS back to the atmosphere from the surface environment. One important natural cycling process for PFAS is the transport from seawater to marine air by sea spray aerosols, which is another active research area for the Stockholm University team. “The extreme persistence and continual global cycling of certain PFAS will lead to the continued exceedance of the above-mentioned guidelines,” said Professor Martin Scheringer, a co-author of the study based at ETH Zurich in Switzerland and RECETOX, Masaryk University in the Czech Republic. “So now, due to the global spread of PFAS, environmental media everywhere will exceed environmental quality guidelines designed to protect human health and we can do very little to reduce the PFAS contamination. In other words, it makes sense to define a planetary boundary specifically for PFAS and, as we conclude in the paper, this boundary has now been exceeded,” said Scheringer.PFAS are harmful to health and the environmentPFAS is a collective name for per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances or highly fluorinated substances that have a similar chemical structure. All PFAS are either extremely persistent in the environment or break down into extremely persistent PFAS, which has earned them the nickname “forever chemicals.” PFAS have been associated with a wide range of serious health harms, including cancer, learning and behavioral problems in children, infertility and pregnancy complications, increased cholesterol, and immune system problems. Dr. Jane Muncke, Managing Director of the Food Packaging Forum Foundation in Zürich, Switzerland, and not involved in the work, points out: “It cannot be that some few benefit economically while polluting the drinking water for millions of others, and causing serious health problems. The vast amounts that it will cost to reduce PFAS in drinking water to levels that are safe based on current scientific understanding need to be paid by the industry producing and using these toxic chemicals. The time to act is now.”https://www.su.se/english/news/it-s-raining-pfas-even-in-antarctica-and-on-the-tibetan-plateau-rainwater-is-unsafe-to-drink-1.620735....These are interesting claims. I live in an area that lacks access to municipal tap water. There definitely is a high percentage of people in my county who subsist on rainwater. Which is filtered to varying degrees. Although I am certain that some do not filter it at all. The concept of rainwater being unsafe to drink is eye opening to say the least. I wonder how much exposure is necessary for a noticeable negative health trend to emerge. Can't say that I've noticed an uptick of cancer cases in the area, which is good news. But this type of information is concerning. Considering that this trend apparently goes back decades. Can we say with accuracy that rainwater today is more or less contaminated than rainwater in past years. Does this also affect animals in the wild. Hopefully the danger is exaggerated. Although if the issue were to materialize in earnest. It would likely hit the poor who are unable to filter their water the hardest. I would guess there are crypto intiatives in place which advocate for clean water. What type of approach could be useful for cleaning messes like this up?",

      "body": "Afaik pfoa and pfas are both forma of plastic (or predominantly used as plastic).Considering it was only a matter of time before plastic polluted everywhere, this was bound to happen at some point.I don't think anything short of mass international filtration of these substances or producing things (like bacteria) that can naturally digest them and thrive of them will make much of a difference to people's chances of getting back to strong health and not damaging ecosystems (especially areas like bogland that have to remain inhabited to facilitate some carbon capture).A lot of pollutants are soon to be incentivised for consumers to return them and for producers to dispose of the waste they produce properly too - hopefully this will see some effect over time on the current issues of plastic pollution but it'll take quite a long time to resolve/leave.",

What type of approach could be useful for cleaning messes like this up? A combination of geography and activity can create problems as you mention and you have well illustrated what efforts should be made to obtain clean drinking water on the Tibetan Plateau, or in Antarctica. That's why it's important to understand the entire landscape and if I'm not mistaken there are many humanitarian agencies that have been doing to clean up rainwater for drinking.The best we can hope for is micro-initiatives, such as the one planned for the Tibetan plateau, which aim to fix at least some of the problems. After all, it's nearly impossible to clean up a mess of this magnitude on a large scale at an affordable price—that's not very realistic.",
