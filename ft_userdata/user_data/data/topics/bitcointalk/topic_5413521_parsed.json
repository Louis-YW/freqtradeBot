For traders, they are not much concerned about bear or bull market, they trade in the direction favoured to make profit in short time period. But it can be other way, in a way losses would result instead of profit.",

I will call this a sideways moment which makes the price not moves too much. But we can wait for the next few hours and hopefully, the price will move drastically, whether the price will go down or go up. It is better not to do anything except wait for the market so we know what we need to do because this situation can trap us into buying on the wrong side.",

I pretty much feel happy we didn't get lower and, even more, we're already back over 20k.Of course, I also hope the bear market will end \"any time now\", but that might still take some weeks.",

However, long-term holders did not ask this question, they preferred to hold in a long run and wait until the new all-time high will come.",

After that Bitcoin has another 50% drop to under $4k in March 2020. I expect to see a same one from $20k to $11k or $13k. In market psychology, it makes sense to wash out all weak hands.It could occur or not occur but if you are investing into Bitcoin, with a good mind, long term, any price from $20k to $15k is very good to buy in already.

The bear market is still very much ongoing. Going up to 21k or going down to 19k, doesn't change the bull or bear cycle. This is just normal price movement. So no, I can't see any short or long break from any market. Bitcoin is currently going through the bear cycle and this kind of price movement is very much common. For bitcoin, 10 -15% daily movement of price is normal.",

Bearish is still ongoing while a positive trend is expected to be seen for price recovery. I don't know when but I have to remain optimistic to expect it soon.The best option right now about the market is to buy if you can afford it, I agree with this suggestion as bitcoin prices are still very low compared to last year's ATH. -71% currently can be considered an opportunity for anyone looking to accumulate bitcoins, but of course it has to be done for the amount of funds that can afford to lose.",

The bear season continues because most of the coins are still having a hard time to surge again and increase their price. However, there’s no need to worry about this since we are buying bitcoin for long term investment. Even if it takes 3-5 years of hodling, I guess that’s fine as long as you only invest with your extra money, and definitely the profits will be x10 from the price that we bought it.",
