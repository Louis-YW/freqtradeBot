That happens when, in a given 2 week Activity period, you make less than 14 post (therefore less than 14 Activity points), but at least 1 valid post in that timeframe. You potentially claim some of these automatically by posting more than 14 posts on a given future Activity period. It’s explained with further detail here.For example, going over your  posting history (scroll to bottom chart), un July you made 2 posts within a given Activity window. That would leave you 12 Activity points claimable in the future by posting more than 14 posts in another Activity window (now for example) … Nevertheless, those two posts were deleted, meaning that the Activity window for them does not have any posts, and therefore the Activity algorithm does not let you claim those (up to) 12 Activity points I was on about before.",

But every beginning is difficult and everyone needs to adapt, so I hope that the number of deleted posts will not increase along with activity.Quote from: Despairo on October 04, 2022, 01:15:29 PMSooner or later you can become a high rank member, don't need to think the activity and merit.Maybe the OP will think that I'm one of those who \"will roast him\", but if profit becomes the main motive, the path to a higher rank will not be easy at all.",
