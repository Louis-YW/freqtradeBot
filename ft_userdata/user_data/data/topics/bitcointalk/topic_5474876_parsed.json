  "content": "News update, it's been announced that the crypto exchange, Bittrex Global will be shutting down all it's operations soon. The exchange which gave no reason for it's sudden decision has advised all it's customers to complete all transactions within the exchange before Dec 4, of which after the dead line customers will only be able to place withdrawals. I would also advise anyone who uses this exchange to store, to withdraw all their funds to a non custodial wallet before this dead line,  avoiding loss of funds.QuoteCrypto exchange Bittrex Global is winding down operations just months after its U.S. arm was shut down, according to a Monday announcement.Trading on the platform will stop Dec. 4, and the company urged customers to complete \"all necessary transactions\" by then, after which only withdrawals will be available. The exchange, which is regulated in Lichtenstein and Bermuda, did not give a reason for the decision.The shutdown follows Bittrex.US' May filing for bankruptcy in Delaware after it and Bittrex Global were sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for allegedly operating a national securities exchange without the right approvals. Bittrex Global CEO Oliver Linch had told CoinDesk that it would fight the SEC charges \"vigorously.\" Bittrex.US shuttered operations in April, and in August reached a $24 million settlement with the SEC.\"It is with great regret that we announce that Bittrex Global has decided to wind down its operations. This decision was not made lightly, and we understand the inconvenience it may have on our valued customers,\" the company said.https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/11/21/crypto-exchange-bittrex-global-to-shut-down/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=rss&utm_campaign=headlines",

      "body": "Oh no, Bittrex Global is closing down? That hits home for me because it was my first cryptocurrency exchange too. I made a lot of money and lost a lot of it. And also lost many manyThis ending is shocking, but its not the end of everything. Its a wake-up call for crypto fans like us. This has happened before; the trades come and go. What stays, though? Our ability to bounce back and change. Its crucial to move funds to a non-custodial wallet - safety first, folks",

Is it good for the USA and their citizens? I see it is not good, but harmful.",

Considering that previously there was a topic that informed about this (Bittrex Closed), I think it would be wise to lock this topic too.",
