      "body": "Hello my friend, I apologize for the delay in my response, but I appreciate your interest in our project. Your question is fair and very common in the community, so I'm happy to provide some clarity.Firstly, it's important to align the concepts of our project. ARMOC is a Utility Token, not a cryptocurrency or security token. Our token provides its holders with a series of benefits in the acquisition of products and services from Armoring Products and its network of partners, offering up to 30% discounts. The value of ARMOC lies in its usefulness and use within the armored vehicle industry.AMORC has a limit on the issuance of its Token, with only 3,000,000,000 ARMOC available. After the sales period, no more tokens will be issued. This means that, in addition to the benefits I have already explained, the token represents an appreciation of value for those who acquire it and intend to buy an armored vehicle (whether civil, police force, or military).As soon as the buyer purchases the ARMOC, it is immediately released in the buyer's wallet, who can use it immediately with Armoring Products and its network of partners. Alternatively, the buyer may hold onto it and, after the public sales period, make the offer to any interested party via P2P, DEX, or an exchange in which the ARMOC will be listed in the future. Note that here we are not talking about a promise of a project that will be developed, unlike other projects in the community. Instead, we are talking about acquiring a token to use in real products and services that are already available for sale.ARMOC has come to revolutionize the sector of the armored vehicle industry, which is a sector in full growth and moves billions of dollars. To understand its value, it's important to know this sector and follow every movement that Armoring Products and its network of partners have been carrying out over the years. I would like to invite you and anyone else with doubts to read our White Paper, watch the videos on YouTube, and the recent posts on Twitter, where our CEO Mauricio Junot is participating in IDEX 2023 in Abu Dhabi, an important event in the armored vehicle sector, doing business and closing partnerships to further increase the network of Armoring Products participants.White paper => https://armoc.armoringproducts.net/assets/ARMOC_WP_EN.pdfYoutube => https://www.youtube.com/@armoringcoinTwitter => Tweeting directly from Abu Dhabi, at IDEX 2023 where our CEO speaks about ARMOC, its importance, and relevance to the armored vehicle sector, revolutionizing the civil, police, and military sectors:https://twitter.com/ArmoringCoin/status/1629122400917782528?s=20https://twitter.com/ArmoringCoin/status/1629001449597243395?s=20https://twitter.com/ArmoringCoin/status/1629106152528117760?s=20I hope this has clarified things for you. ARMOC is a unique opportunity to participate in an exciting and growing industry, so don't miss out.BRs,Armoring Coinhttps://armoc.armoringproducts.net/",
