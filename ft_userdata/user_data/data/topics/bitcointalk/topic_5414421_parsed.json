And +525 American Odds = 6.25× in decimal odds. You would get this information immediately if you asked it to the support agent of the bookie at where you have seen it. You may use this tool to convert and see the American odds into decimal and fractional odds: https://www.covers.com/tools/odds-converterI hope you got the desired answer. Kindly lock this thread.",

      "body": "For -700, it means you are to bet 700 in order to win $100. For +700, you can bet $100 to win 700. We are just used to the format in crypto bookies but its the same thing. Nothing like that in crypto afaik so if you are here to stay in crypto you can forget that format and get used to the bookmarkers here. Floyd has a fight again?",
