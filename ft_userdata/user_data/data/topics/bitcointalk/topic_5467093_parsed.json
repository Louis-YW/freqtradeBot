Though it will take time before it will fade away. And when it will finally give way, bitcoin will become the King of all the currencies in the world. One thing that normally make me not to go to the bank again is the hike of the Tfare. Where I was paying #100 is now #300 and where I was paying #200 now is #500 so going out and coming back home, I spend more than 2k, that is why I don't like to go out unless I am going out for an important things. And another thing that made me to stop going to bank is the quantity of cash they gave out, when I would pay that big amount of money as TP only for them to gave me 20k, omen that thing pains me to the bones. I just thank the online banking system.",

I visit bank every 4 years to renew my ATM card as all my transactions are being done online. Thanks to modern way of banking too like the microfinance banks. At least with the establishment of these online banks it has made it easy for us to perform series of transactions without going to the bank to stand in queues. And moreover their are transactions that requires urgency like maybe when a loved one is being hospitalized. And you know anything concerning a persons health requires urgent treatment and attention so imagine a situation where you need to go to the bank to withdraw or transfer money before the patient will be attended to. So you can see how these online banking have aided us so much because you can actually perform transactions immediately with a phone theirby making monetary transactions easier and more convenient for us. Furthermore, online banking has also reduced criminal activities because sometimes going to the bank always is very risky because some criminals will start monitoring your movement whenever you go to the bank and again since alot of persons now focus on online banking, criminals have find it difficult to rob people because most people doesn't go about with money in their pocket again. Imagine during the naira redesign, if not for mobile and internet banking the masses would have experienced more severe suffering but they didn't experience much heat because people where performing transactions via their phones and other online medium of transactions. So for me there's absolutely no need going to the bank anymore.",

These days, people prefer using the POS vendors than going to the bank for transaction. At your convenience,  you can transfer huge amount of money from your microfinance bank app if you have scaled through the KYC process that grants you such privilege.

If there is any area that I like about the past government is the cashless policy but the way they bring wasn't friendly at all, I will never forget frustrations I experienced during and after that election time.I like how things have change in the banking industry, there was this time Nigerian Commercial banks think they are gods, the untouchable because there was no alternatives then but today, with your ₦200, you can have your thousands of naira instead of walking or drinking Kilometers away to go and use their machines that will even swallow your card at the end or during the transaction. Nigeria Bank ATM don swallow your card before, the experience are not funny one and I love the innovation how it changed the banking sector.As it is right now, there is even more competition among the micro finance banks, Kuda was one of the first micro finance banks in nigeria, then Opay follow when their transportation idea died and since the launch of their opay POS, they have become one of the fastest growing bank in Nigeria, Palmpay is good because of their loan but moni point is now fighting to have more customers, they just launched their mobile app on app store and play store to get more customers.
