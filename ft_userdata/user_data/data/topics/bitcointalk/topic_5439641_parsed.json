  "content": "If I were to do this, and say collaborate with someone who can generate the keys to place on the back of a silver pour would anyone be interested? Maybe loaded with .001 BTC. Can anyone recommend a good partner for key generation who would be interested in partnering up? I will post a pic later of the design. Would do a limited mintage of 10 on these most likely (possibly increase the mintage if there is more interest) with a reasonable price point. I have been pouring silver for 6 years Â Interested members: Hookzup1, Markzellers, Frank AlpenCoin, Humble Bitcoiners, sweeteye, 2stout, 1 for myself, possibly one for Mopar, and I will keep this list open to any other members and update the mintage accordingly on this first run based on interest.",

Will have to chat with him on this. And thanks! I will take note of your interest. This would require 32 or 33 ounces I believe (some silver gets burned in the smelting process). I will make a list and come up with pricing and post some pics of a prototype to garner more interest! I would make the prototypes and ask for payments up front most likely to pay for the silver needed etc. could be a fun project!",

I put you down as well as all others interested so far. Looks like we have 6 total! I will be keeping #1 so looks like we will have 3 more spots left for any takers. I will be placing the order for some smelting silver to go ahead and get started and will post a pic of the prototype very soon. I will need to reach out to Mopar to see if he is interested in doing the keys on this, i'm sure he will want one if so I may need to reserve a spot for him just in case- based on demand I may up the mintage on these, we will see. Once I have an idea how much the holos will cost w/ key generation and loading & also taking into account the time and effort needed to make all of these I will come up with the price point and update the post. Thanks everyone again for your interest. Cheers. TREAD",

      "body": "Just an update. In full transparency this project hasn't been anywhere near the top of my list of to dos/ priorities right now. But it is still ON the list!!! I am going to need to do these things first before I can make this project a reality: 1. I need to hire some graphic design expertise to create a new bitcoin centric design in the form of a vector image file. Vendor/Design TBD. 2. I need to send this vector image file to steel stamp creation company for the physical piece of metal I am going to be slamming my hammer into against these silver 1ozt or 2ozt rounds! Pretty crucial! Vendor is vetted just need to finalize on the design. Vendor Chosen. 3. I am going to need to come up with the actual sales post/ pre order which I will have paid in advance to fund the project. (damn I probably should have made this one #1 haha. Â To be posted. 4. I need to follow up with Mopar (who has agreed to help w/ the key generation / holo ordering) So need to finalize the holo selection / style on that as well and work - still pending/ TBD. 5. Once all of this leg work is done it'll be off to the forge to smelt/ pour silver into rounds, polish, anneal (heat silver w/ torch to soften and immediately stamp), Quench, apply an antique finish (potentially), and then create divot/ hole on the back for the PK / holo covering on the back. Final polishings. Stamping the serial number on the side of the round. I will be conducting this tedious process myself. TBD6. I will also need to then perhaps 3D print a custom casing for this. That means i'll need to make some tweaks to the old 3D printer and find an expert to help design a custom fit case w/ magnets as well. This will be a whole project in itself. 3D print designer expertise TBD7. Stickers- man stickers are just a must have!!!! If you don't have a super awesome cool sticker are you even flipping legit?! lmao. Vendor TBD8. Almost forgot about the COAs. Wow that would have been a shame if I put in all this work and never made these lol. COA design / material and format TBD. (open to any suggestion on what you think looks best). Â 9. Wait and see what happens/ get feedback / contemplate on future designs/ releases! This is pretty much the goal!Thats basically all I can think of that would need to be done in order to provide something of high quality, hand crafted w/ a thoughtful design and coordinated effort on the key generation. The fun touch will be the 3D printed cases (at least that is my vision for now, could change). Let me know if I missed anything! As of right now there is no TBD date on when I can get all of this completed, but here is the update with everything that needs to be done on my end to make it a reality. I am open to all and any feedback, recommendations for designers preferably in US that have experience in coin design graphic design/ perhaps also a recommendation for someone who can help design a custom fit 1 oz and 2oz silver pour 3D printed case. Open to any ideas pertaining to the making of this custom silver smithed crypto series! Its going to be a lot of fun. I just can't wait to bring them to life. Just be patient with me & I will do my best to bring something new and fun for our crypto collectors here on BTALK",

Well that solves that problem as well haha. We can work out all the details, lets plan to meet up at the show! Also, that is going to be so sick! The 2ozer silver poured chunks are definitely some of my favorites, can't wait to see the prototypes for both of these new crypto pours!",
