  "content": "Hey guys!So I am super pumped for B23 Miami! I know that there are a lot of other fun crypto themed events in the Florida area. I'm trying to figure out if there are any others that anyone else is aware of on the East/ West coast - even central FL as well. Is anyone aware of a similar post that has already done all the homework / another website that keeps track of all these events in any given region? Cheers, TREAD",
