Well I won't say much about this but I strongly have this feelings that anyone who belongs here would never lack any information and update about the recent and latest event concerning bitcoin and altcoin at large. The only aspect I think we should guide her more is about the security guard because many people who tends to study more about bitcoin still falls prey for scammers to made away with their heart earned money.Do not be too haste to make gain or profits from your investment because I believe many people are being monitored. Do not send your bitcoin to anyone who wants you to invest in their platform to make additional gain or fast money, lastly also search around here the best wallet to store your bitcoin, btw as a beginner your funds can be temporarily stored on trustwallet and after which you may decide to pull it out from there to another best recommended wallet.Congratulations on your first purchase.",

It might hurt at first, might even be underwhelming for a couple of years but update this thread every now and then and you might find a nice surprise as early as 2025 I'd agree with others to not trust any kind of exchange, including Binance, but since that's likely the easiest way for you to buy, go for it. Meanwhile, familiarise yourself with a Bitcoin wallet (I'd start with Electrum) so you understand a bit more about how to use and keep it safely. When you're comfortable, start taking out your BTC from Binance on a wallet where only you control your private keys.",

Now that you have first-hand experience with possessing a fraction of bitcoin, it would be helpful to be familiar with the fundamentals of the wallet, especially Electrum or Bluewallet. Read their documentation, learn how to interpret the data on a bitcoin transaction, be aware of potential malware and mistakes a beginner might make when performing various transactions, etc.At the end of the day, holding bitcoin over the long haul is a matter of how you can optimally protect your asset by constantly learning and applying what you have learned thru actual testing and holding. You cannot preach what you do not have.",

This does not really look like a Bitcoin discussion, it looks more like a diary entry.

Deciding to start investing in bitcoin is a good choice. and it will be your first step to getting to know crypto, especially bitcoin. After previously you were reprimanded by many members here who said you were not in line with the thread you made about teaching bitcoin, but you didn't invest in bitcoin.Now that you are part of a bitcoin investor, start buying bitcoins on the Binance P2P exchange. But for a good suggestion you can transfer those bitcoins in your personal bitcoin wallet, if you don't have one you can create one in Wallet Electrum and it becomes a recommended Bitcoin wallet, security of your bitcoin assets is now the first thing you should think about.If you intend to hold long-term, feel free to do so and make a purchase gradually because it will be more profitable. Don't panic too much when the price starts to fall, it's a good opportunity to start buying again.",

I believe you must have done a little research on how bitcoin works so as to enable you scale through the processes involved. As you know, bitcoin market is volatile so it is advisable that you buy in fractions and while buying, it is nice you buy with your spare cash which you can afford to loose if it happens that the market is down or any possible hack. Another thing I would advise you to do is to remember the phrase \"not your keys, not your coin\". Leaving your bitcoin in exchange is not advisable as you do not have access to the key so therefore if anything happens to the exchange,your funds are all gone. So in your best interest, move your funds out from exchange to your own private wallet which you have access to the keys. That would ok you do it soonest for your safety.",

I would recommend you use a good wallet to store up your coin as I do not think keeping it in an exchange is safe just like the other previous commenter said. You took a bold steps in purchasing your first ever bitcoin and it is good you did that now and taking advantage of the current market situation. I will say this as I heard you talking about promotion of bitcoin. Have you had knowledge about bitcoin to the fullest? If yes then you can be able to talking to your friends and family about bitcoin but if you have no knowledge then I would say you do a research to know more about bitcoin but I will also say this too do not purchase for any or talk of to manage a account for them as it is very risky to do so or are you ready to take the blame when anything happens?Once more, congratulations for your first purchase.",

Don't make the same mistake I did; be persistent and don't give up if you see things going the wrong way.I agree with your overall point Ultegra134; however, I would clarify that you can be persistent and even assertive with your ongoing investment into bitcoin, but there is no imperative to have to be overly aggressive or to have to try to compete with anyone else in terms of trying to make up for lost time.. in regards to NOT investing earlier.In other words, I think that it is better to consider the whole ONGOING BTC accumulation matter as a kind of way to be as sufficiently aggressive as reasonable, and to make sure that we do not overdo it within our budgets.. so if we can reasonably accommodate $100 per week, then great, but if our budget does not really allow that much, then we have to figure out what is allowable without overly stressing our own budget in terms of cashflow coming in, expenses and our psychology in regards to NOT having too many extra pressures.If we keep buying on a regular basis, it is likely that we are going to see progress with the passage of time, but how much progress will likely vary depending on how aggressive that we are able to be without overdoing it..... We should not end up overdoing it, and then find ourselves with few or no coins because we failed/refused to adequately have our budget (and psychology) in a good place to be able to weather the likely inevitable good times and the bad times.. that can sometimes happen in extreme ways both in terms of time and intensities.Quote from: xSkylarx on February 02, 2023, 05:23:10 PMMost of the people who posted about this here are Nigerian, and I am not shocked that they are one of the countries using bitcoin.

But congratulations on your first purchase, and this is your first step toward owning bitcoin.I am NOT against the idea of starting out by holding BTC on exchanges or with third parties; however, as we likely own more and more bitcoin with the passage of time, it is likely that we are also going to need to learn more with the passage of time too.So we should realize that we don't own shit if our bitcoins are on exchanges, but we do own some kind of voucher or a claim to bitcoin and even exposure to BTC price changes, so sometimes it can take a bit of time for the reality of the difference to sink in, and the more we own, the more likely we have to attempt to protect ourselves by investing into studying free or low cost solutions, versus perhaps graduating up to more expensive solutions (such as a hardware wallet), and no matter how are BTC are held, there are going to be tradeoffs in terms of what the risks might be in terms of managing our passwords to accounts or making sure that we have back ups if we start to graduate to self-custody solutions.. that might even be free... but there is no complete freedom in terms of making sure that we spend some time to learn, and the whole matter of holding our coins ourselves becomes easier once we practice more options.. but we also don't want to overdo the complexity of our back-ups or our passwords in such a way that we end up losing access to our coins because we overly complicated our set up or our security.",
