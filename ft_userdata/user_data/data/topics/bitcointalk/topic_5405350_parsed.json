Since GS is involved I think it's going to be run a bit more like a money hoarding ridiculously high interest & fees business.Someone @ GS did a bunch of math and made some assumptions and came out with a way to fleece more people. It's now more Celcius has GS as a partner. So you might make less and others might pay more but it's safe. All the while since GS does have funds it all looks more secure.I don't think there will be a rug pull, just a slow bleed as people see how much this is costing them and they leave and go someplace else.

Sounds precisely like how many of were trapped in the [insert Southeast Asian government name]coin empire.Pensions are a huge ponzi that has been limiting withdrawals to retirees slowly over the past decades. Government bonds keep raising interest so people feel less bad about cash stuck in schemes, and some actually are convinced to buy into longer, deeper locks. But every time it gets to critical point, some other foreign government invests more (think of this as GS) to share the risk, while money printing slaps on more band aids.No realistic rug pull happening in our lifetimes but everyone bleeds, just a game of who has more blood to let before they pack up and go (literally) or simply live miserably into oblivion or go off grid and return to monke in our vast forests.
