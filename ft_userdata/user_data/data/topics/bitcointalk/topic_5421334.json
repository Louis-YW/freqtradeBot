It should be recognized that this is especially relevant against the backdrop of recent events.Each product has its own buyer, and I would like to believe that there will also be buyers for the products of the Satochip.Let me make a small comment about the post above. (BTClack Friday bump ). It would be more informative to indicate the standard price and the current one, taking into account discounts, under each card. And also, the period of validity of this discount offer.",

I agree that it makes sense mentioning the discounted prices in the thread without requiring interested parties to go and research it themselves on the official shop.

When you are deep in the work, you didn't even look ahead to see what's wrongÂ  Satochip's price is 25â‚¬ (VAT and shipping incl.), the BlackFriday discount gives you -21% on every cards : Satochip (our hardware wallet), Satodime (our Opendime like on steroÃ¯d) and Seedkeeper (our seedphrases storage solution).Meaning you can grab a card for only 19,75â‚¬ shipped. Worth a try, right ?",

My question now is if that can be avoided, since my laptop (HP Probook) has a so-called smart card reader. Do you have any clue if there's any compatibility or is it a completely different thing?Excuse me if my question sounds stupid but I always wondered how that card reader could be used.Photo for reference",

Have a great day.Thank you for your reply. I haven't bought a hardware wallet yet, so it's better late than never. I've tested it with an old debit card, and at least it seems to detect that something with a chip has been inserted. Is there a more valid way to check that the port is working since, as dbkit98 mentioned, most of these have only been collecting dust? Moreover, one more question, in case you know: do I need any specific software to use it on my computer?I don't have NFC though, a smartphone would work just fine I guess?Thanks in advance",

Had an old Thinkpad ans it's working well. Some high-end Dell or Lenovo laptop does have a built-in NFC reader. And it works too.Any generic chip card reader, built-in or not, work fine.",

If you want to be completly sure, you can check and list all the chip card reader present on your laptop using this tool : https://github.com/martinpaljak/GlobalPlatformPro/releasesIt's a small tool that allow you to deal with chip card and card reader.Regarding our product, you will need a software client to interract with the card, like Metamask or Electrum, we provide such software with Satochip integration.And regarding the mobile integration, the card is NFC ready but we dont have a mobile app yet. Meaning you wont be able to use it out of the box with your smartphone today. But pretty sure you will be able to do so later this year.Have a great day.",
