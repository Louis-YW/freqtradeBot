  "content": "So I read a thread on the forum by Ultegra134 that talked about renewable energy and he asked;\"The big question here is, can the world be 100% dependent on renewable energy sources? How can that be achieved and are they sustainable?\"The thing is, according to several studies and experts, it is possible for the world to be 100% dependent on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. However, this would require a major transition of the current energy system, which is mostly based on fossil fuels that are non-renewable and contribute to climate change. Some of the challenges and barriers to achieving this goal are technical, economic, social, and political. For example, renewable energy sources are often variable and intermittent, meaning they depend on natural conditions that are not always predictable or stable. This requires a reliable and flexible grid system that can balance supply and demand, as well as storage technologies that can store excess energy for later use. Another challenge is the cost of renewable energy technologies and infrastructure, which may be higher than fossil fuels in some cases. However, many studies have shown that the benefits of renewable energy outweigh the costs in the long term, as they reduce greenhouse gas emissions, air pollution, health impacts, and dependence on imported fuels. Moreover, renewable energy can create more jobs and stimulate economic growth. A third challenge is the social and political acceptance of renewable energy, which may face resistance from some groups or individuals who have vested interests in the fossil fuel industry or who are skeptical about climate change. To overcome this barrier, public awareness and education campaigns are needed to inform people about the benefits and feasibility of renewable energy, as well as policies and incentives that support its development and deployment. In conclusion, it is possible for the world to be 100% dependent on renewable energy, but it would require a significant transformation of the current energy system and a collective effort from all stakeholders. Some countries and regions have already achieved or are close to achieving this goal, such as Iceland, Brazil, New Zealand’s South Island, Denmark’s Samsø island, and Germany’s Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Schleswig-Holstein regions. These examples show that 100% renewable energy is not only feasible but also desirable for a sustainable future.",

In countries, where the sun intensity is high, solar energy can solve great problems for users.

I don't really understand your point here, what do you mean by the statement of a leader who is 200 years old and a single leader of this planet? What, and how does that make the people of this planet adopt and depend on or move onto renewable energy sources? If you are saying that a single entity could make this happen because the situation and financial situations in different countries are not the same.That's why not every country would spend the amount on adopting renewable sources instead of non--renewable.

And we cannot do that, because that would be stupid. I think you don't really understand the real meaning of renewable sources. These are the sources that are found from natural sources that cost us nothing. Like from sunlight and from air. etc.",
