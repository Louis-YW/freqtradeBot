E-commerce platform My website endfb.com carries the worlds most valuable business model.I was just reading up on google if I can host a Wordpress website somewhere else because the bill is 32€, I mean if I can outsource it that would mean that all my bills get very close to 0€ I am definitely over paying, they even selling that plan right now for half the price , 16€ somewhat okey, may have to pay a head for a year thought.",

For $14 per year you can get a VPS. More work to install Wordpress but cheap to use. I like RackNerd: not bad quality for a low price.Well it’s per month, the auction software is also actually 500€/year that I forgot about… but it’s paid until some winter time and may actually downgrade if it’s not the best on the market.If you say that Wordpress can be hosted on a vps than it would be definitely cool to have no bills to pay for a while.But Wordpress might intentionally block that somehow with their e-commerce/business plans.Right now it’s 32€ / month , 16€ if paid a head for a year if I can quit and export the website, plug-ins,all it’s content and start new website.",

That is maximum financial damage each time ! I don’t have a car, house, apartment, not even a tent.How about finally getting a job? You are begging here for over 1 year now, countless threads.Asked for one yesterday and many many many times before, I am more advanced and skilled than the worlds best ceo, also stronger and better fighter than an Olympic gold medalists.I don’t give a shit about job’s, it’s all free money.If I catch my own fish the entire economy is close to obsolete, it’s nothing ! I already deserve 100 million for what society has done to me",
