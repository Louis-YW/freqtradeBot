It's a deceitful website stealing money.Never heard about that site, but from its name it sounds like a scam site. Everything has been done on that site in a unprofessional way. I would recommend you to stay away from such scams, and always give priority to exchanges with positive reputation. Such scam sites are made to take advantage of those people who aren't not good at technology. Their main targets are those innocent people who would trust scam like this due to their low awareness levels. How did you found that site, were they promoting their sites via advertisement or social media or you found it on search engines?",

Of course, this is a fake address to register their domain. Since the business is to scam people, there is no reason they will register with their original information. But, At least they could use the same address in all three places. So it would look more trustworthy. Anyways, Thanks OP for bringing them here. I think I had never heard of them before. They registered the domain in October 2022. So, it's already six months old. I don't think they will come here.

If they're trying to short the time between register & payment of proof it's a remarkable way to scam.
