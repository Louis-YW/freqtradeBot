      "body": "No one is interested in reading white papers and roadmaps. People would rather invest in altcoins because of the general hype than make a decision based on analyzing white papers and tokenomics. Most people don't even realize what to pay attention to when studying a white paper or tokenomics. It's all just a wall of letters and numbers to them. It's better to get a cue from an Influencer on Twitter than to delve into it all yourself. I notice that the crypto community doesn't care much about such things, just like they don't care much about KYC and giving their personal data for a handful of shitcoins.",

Hardly check what is even inside!Just wondering what is your take on it!Yes, it's often either a colorful pamflet. And before AI texts they used to be generic plagiated texts with some changed words. They are promising roi and all that nonsense, they have moronic tokenimics with unsustainable inflationary tokenomics or burning system that doesn't make sense.And obviously nevest gimmick. Right now it's AI, before that NFT, Farming, De-FI, Metaverse etc... And frankly i am sometimes afraid i am getting some 0day exploits just by opening them. And yeah, \"we are going to have a credit card\". How original.Or a roadmap saying stuff like listing to famous CEX. And it's always some fake volume site where they pay with gazillion tokens for joining, or dump the tokens and do buyin with actual cryptos. Sometimes they are even overly ambitious and claim how they change health care or banking and government types forever. When actually they couldn't be adopted to work in one single ice cream kiosk. And then there are tech papers and difficult white papers. Those i try to understand but team is either bluffing with smoke and mirrors that can be spotted by other coders, or the tech paper is so hard to comprehend that you are not sure that in what level you should even respect it.",

Which gives us the fundamental idea of how the tokens are issued and how they are going to get distributed. From the effort a specific project made for the whitepaper, we do have idea how serious the team is about the project. A well written  and unique whitepaper is what I look for.",

Crypto projects usually main target is their investors to please with their project while most of this investors is non-technical people which doesn’t understand technical terms.Current version of whitepaper is now simplified which even normal people can understand in summary what’s the project all about. I really like the curriculum version and projects usually have a github which is the technical details for those interested on the technical perspective of the project.",

We have tons of scam projects way back in 2017-2018 down to 2020/and up till now,  but if we compared the ratio of the level and extent that scam projects that have gained popularity between now and then,  it clearly shows that we are faced with more scam in the current time compared to when we don't have new hypes like meme coins,  NFTs and the rest. Although,  each period comes with its own unique hype projects/developments that end up putting holes in investors' pockets thereby killing investors' appetite and trust in the general crypto ecosystem.",

If you were to ask me, I would say that, otherwise, investors usually invest based on hype in the crypto market. You are correct there are many projects that have very short whitepapers, maybe just 2-3 pages, and even in those, there is more emphasis on tokenomics rather than detailed information about the project. In fact, most projects tend to replicate each other's content, and only a few are unique or genuinely reliable.",

Hardly check what is even inside!Just wondering what is your take on it!No matter what project it is, its goal would always be to attract more investors into it. Having a whitepaper for a project would build a trust for the community of people interested into a particular project. However, as we all know  only a small percentage of the projects managed to follow their roadmaps and overall vision of a project. This is also why most of the 'old ones' in this market aren't relying in such factor. Demand and popularity are better indicators to tell whether a project is good or not, and whether it is for long term or the other way around. Whitepapers would mean nothing if the token itself won't have a utility.There's no such thing as putting a period that memecoins are not as ideal as with bigger community - tokens.",

In most cases, the whitepaper they have is simply a template used by the majority, with a few keywords changed to match their project. It was a standard that was created to present the project, especially in crypto's case where most projects can be considered as investments, and a lot of people do actually check on it, a matter of understanding it is a separate thing though.",

Scammers took opportunity to it, copy and pasted some of the whitepapers, made some revisions, and put it into their own project until it came to a point where even though you've read a whitepaper that's very good, there's a chance that they will scam you, and I've seen this many times back when ICO's are very popular.Right now in 2023, whitepapers are just a bunch of papers, or a bunch of text that is for me useless. I don't know what are the basis of these investors in which new projects should they invest since I'm more focused on established coins only. Maybe there are some investors who still reads the whitepaper of a particular project, and decide base on it, but if you're a bit conservative when it comes to investing like me, I'd rather lessen my stress, and just invest on established coins.",
