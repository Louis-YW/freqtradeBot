Crypto are not like fiat because they are more volatile, especially the altcoins which are very volatile. There are some platforms that can give APY return, like the exchanges, but they have one disadvantage of not your key not your coin. It is not worth going for, to invest on centralized online places. The only one that I have considered better are the staking using noncustodial wallets, not the ones like decentralized exchanges which can be hacked. Such exploits are common these days than how custodial exchanges are hacked. But staking directly using wallet is good if gotten rightly and staking at the right time. The reward is daily, but bear market can result to losses. If someone can be patient enough, he can go for bitcoin which is safer. Bitcoin requires speculation, it is not what people should just go into, it requires studying about it and knowing the right time to invest and hold your bitcoin on a noncustodial wallet instead which can even be cold wallet.I too will tell people to be careful of those custodial services.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on June 16, 2023, 09:44:09 AMI have ran out of sympathy for people who still have their funds on these centralized scams exchanges and earning platforms. Absolute insanity by this point.When I am talking to some of my friends, they are novice and they do not know much about safety. There are some I introduced to this forum which later found out that what they were doing before was wrong. Ignorance is the cause of many people's mistakes. If not because of the lessons I have learnt on this forum, I may just be like them too.",

The same model was followed by many exchanges and is still active on some exchanges. Some of those exchanges have lost all of their money during the bear market and crash of Terra Luna, and after that the platforms were just fooling the customers by showing them numbers only which had no intrinsic value in real world.With the collapse of Terra Luna a lot of those exchanges have lost a good amount of money and they weren't able to recover the losses. Many of those exchanges were giving huge returns to the ones who were locking and staking their Luna on those platforms. They were confident that with Luna they will help them earn huge returns and the customers were falling into such traps because of their greediness. They were stacking all of their coins on such platforms and were thinking that they will be rich in a year and so on. Those sites kept all of their users in dark when the market crashed when UST was de-pegged and Terra Luna went to $0 in few days. They all were in shock because none of them were expecting something like that to happen, and after the liquidation they did everything to hide their bankruptcy from the users. I don't think that someone who knows economics very well would ever fall into such schemes. The huge returns on stacking are always fake and they are Ponzi type of schemes to loot money from the wallets of the users to their own custodial wallets. I think promoting awareness about such sites is an important thing so that new users might not fall into such traps.",

The majority (or indeed all?) of projects which style themselves as DeFi are not decentralized in the slightest. How can it be decentralized with a centralized third party can disappear with all your coins at any moment? Same as the term \"DEX\". I can count the number of exchanges which could genuinely be referred to as DEX on one hand, but there are hundreds of scam platforms out there advertising themselves as DEXs and enticing people to deposit their coins to buy the latest shiny shitcoin or stake for some obviously unsustainable return.Out of interest, here is a post I made about DeFi three years ago:Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on September 19, 2020, 12:17:48 PMI haven't spent a huge amount of time looking in to DeFi (so perhaps I shouldn't really comment at all), but from what I have seen, it seems to me to be exactly as you claim - unbelievable rewards and gains. Until someone can prove to me otherwise, as far as I am concerned it is essentially going to be the same as the ICO craze. A minority of lucky people will make very good returns, a lot of people will lose everything or almost everything they put in, and in a year or two 99% of the projects/coins/tokens will be dead and forgotten.Seems like I was proven right. NFTs are already well on their way to the same fate, and the craze of bitcoin ordinals seemed to be over within a few weeks.I'm sure it will only be a few months before the next craze of shiny trash comes along to help people rapidly lose their money. I've already seen the term \"Centralized DeFi\" or \"CeDeFi\" make the rounds, which is just outright hilarious.",
