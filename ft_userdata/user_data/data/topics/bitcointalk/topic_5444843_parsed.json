That's why we can still see many people got busted by this scammers because they fall for the classic traps they set to those people.",

      "body": "This scam might look old school but it is still very much rampant and one can easily get caught by them. A week ago I tried selling off coin through binance P2P and something similar happed. The buyer told me i should pick another bank apart from the one I initially include in my payment method. I did and he said he sent the funds that it was the bank network that is poor but I should release the coins. I almost believed the buyer because mobile transfer to some banks is a big problem at the moment in my country. But a friend insisted I hold on to the coin until the funds land in my account. To cut the story short he didn’t actually send the money after I confirmed from my bank and got my coins stuck on binance. After issuing a report to the binance support he sent the funds and it reflected immediately. There’s also the fake transfer option which is use, one might receive an alert but the funds won’t reflect on ones account",

      "body": "This kind of scam has made things complicated for genuine people, a lot of vendors who don't know the details about this scam, don't even trust people who actually sent money to their account. I've met a vendor that argued, he got the transfer notification, but the amount he received and his available balance doesn't tally with his previous bank balance. Personally, he thought it was a fake bank transfer, just because he hears about it, yet he didn't know that such fake transfer doesn't reflect in any way to his bank account. So, it's now both ways people don't trust bank transfers anymore, they keep checking balance to confirm if the money arrived. However, its old school and the recent scam, though has been around, is another version of clipboard attack, attackers now found a way to change the QR code of the merchant you want to send money to and insert their own QR code. It's not rampant, yet like the one that involved changing of address, its very dangerous to cryptocurrency users. The best way to avoid such scam is by filtering the kind of apps you download on your device.",

Whenever am using P2P, I always make sure I check my mobile app whenever I receive money, I don't believe in SMS that I receive, I always check my mobile app to confirm that I received the money and I always make sure I confirm that I received the right amount which am suppose to receive.If you are having money in your account, immediately the buyer pays, you will notice your account balance have been top up, some people don't really calculate the amount they recieve, when selling sometimes the buyer might endup not making full payments and most people won't notice early.",

Only that you haven't experienced it personally.When ever I'm out in any centralized exchange for a P2P, I'm always very careful cus it's actually possible and easier to get scammed than scamming anyone out there since you're selling. They could possibly generate fake payment slips, POF etc... just so they won't get any negative feedback. I quickly switch to my local bank app to confirm any payments before I get my coins released.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

The space is one that has got little trust and more of verification to prove the inevitable.Fake alert these days happens to be very unlikely as, the third party have got no phone number to be linked with but, using apps to configure an alert with the account details from exchange is still possible. To avoid that, always verify. As much as exchanges encourages a swift transaction, theh also expect of you to verify that you got paid and until you do that, its important you dispute trade and know that, you've done no wrong. Just a step in the process.",

People still fall on thus kind of scam due to its simplicity and convenience. Like you mentioned, a random page can sugar-coat words and make it appear that they are genuine. With that kind of trick, at least 1-2 persons fall from it, thereby adding a list to the victims caused by these scams.I do agree with you- with an active group of scam hunters, at least, this forum adds an extra layer of security with these transactions. When it doubt, always search it or ask on the forum if such exchange is genuine or not.",

I am sure with you such good trade partners don't provide Too Good To Be True offers because they know what they're doing and they don't give you hooks to scam you.If you are not greed, you will be able to find good trade partners.In contrast, if you are too greed, you will look for Too Good To Be True offers and will possibly trade with new users with new accounts. They will scam you with faked payment document or use stolen money illegally to scam you. Even that trade is successful and you receive fiat currency for the trade, later you will have troubles with police and banks.",

Newbies are often very subjective and often don't listen to anyone's advice until they lose money. As everyone has said, this type of scam is not too new, but like forums, the market always has hundreds and millions of newbies joining every day, and scammers know it.
