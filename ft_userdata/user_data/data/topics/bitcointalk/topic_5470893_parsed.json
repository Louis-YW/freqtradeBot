I for example, I use not more than 5% of my weekly income to gamble and it can not be more than that.If I win, I stop for the day, even if the amount won is small. If I lose and getting up to my weekly gambling budget, I quit gambling for that day. These are what I have been doing and they have helped me to have a good gambling habit.",

Don't ever consider gambling a source of income or a do-or-die kind of thing because it will lead you straight to becoming addicted to it. Since you said gambling is for fun, always have that part in mind and don't be like the type who puts all their passion on it to the extent that they play it in their workplace. Set a limit for both spending limits, time limits, and location limits, and keep to them. At least you can be able to overcome the temptation of visiting it every now and then.",

Also, there is something that anxiety do to gamblers, you want to put your hands in every game either because you have financial challenges and you think you can solve it with the winnings from gambling and that get you to take higher risk burden on your self, it is definitely a challenge if you over shoot your budget. So play within the limit of the risk of what you can bear.",

Being responsible is easy to implement by following your game plan, which should include how much you're willing to gamble and when you'll stop. A common way to exercise discipline is by sticking to what you can comfortably afford. This means you gamble within your means, using money intended for fun and not for essential needs or emergencies. That's the kind of discipline you need.Additionally, since we're only human, we can sometimes get emotional and make irrational decisions. It's crucial to avoid this from happening, but if it does occur, you should at least learn from the experience and ensure you don't make the same mistake again.",

With a limit in mind, you will know when to stop playing gambling and stop further losses, which is a common problem for many gamblers; they will keep on chasing their losses until they notice that they dig up their own grave. A fine mindset is the partner for setting your limit; with a mindset in mind, you will be aware of your decisions and functionality; without a mindset, it's like you don't have a path or a goal in gambling. I personally refine this concept myself to minimise my losses and keep on playing while enjoying gambling. Gambling is fun for me; it depends on other people, but for me, gambling is also a serious matter. Of course, one of my sources of income side hustles is at least wishing a big jackpot.",

Doing away with greed requires a gambler to maintain their budget while gambling be it when they are winning or losing.Irrespective of the fact that a gambler is winning, once a winning is recorded, it is imperative that the gambler stops and do away with greed because at that point in time, the urge to further continue playing will be there and hence would want to continue playing. Also when a gambler records serial losses back to back, it is good the gambler takes a break and avoid gambling because at that moment the urge to chase loss would be there to recover and that is how gambling addiction begins but it would be nice exercising self restraint which calls for responsible gambling.In all, doing away with greed is very important when it comes to responsible gambling.",

Gambling can be easy as it is while responsible gambling can be a hard task. Which means you are not only gambling limitless, but one should gamble according to its limits. This is why before you start gambling, plan ahead and set your time and money limits. Gambling should not take most of your time and money, otherwise addiction will likely to develop later on. Also, only gamble what you can manage to lose. If you are frequently losing that time you bet, then never keep chasing your losses but learn to take a break. Know when to continuously bet and know when to stop. Lastly, never gamble to make money. Gambling is designed only to entertain us, while making us profitable is just a bonus.",

There are lots of rich people out  there who are addicted gamblers who have work doing and businesses which keeps them busy but still yet they gamble because they have the funds to serve them for any purpose.As you have said budgeting is very vital and crucial as a responsible gambler, one must stay free of gambling addiction if one must see himself as a responsible gambler.",

When we lose, we sometimes think that we can recover all we have lost which is not always the case. Tips 1:: Having a gambling budget and following it judiciously. It is one thing to write down how you intend to finance and organize your gambling life, but it is more important to implement it. Challenge 2: Lack of information about the terms of service: Many gamblers see the ToS as too bulky and ambiguous. This perception scares us from spending time reading and understanding the terms of service.  Many difficulties many gamblers face because they fail to read the operational manual of the gambling platform. Tips 2: The terms of reference are not as difficult to understand as you think. Time invested in reading this document is not a waste of time because it can save you a lot of stress and waste",
