An ignorance user will surely become easily scam if they didn’t check the username of the impersonator carefully since they use tricky username just to imitate the legit admin.

And some time when we check comments on blockchain explorers like etherscan, we will find some people commenting just the same thing as the op described, and just as Hugeblack have said, it is all for nothing but to take away money from unsuspecting victims, it is very important that every coming into crypto know beforehand that money or coins lost is lost, and there is absolutely no one that can help recover such fund, except the person that fund was sent to decides to send it back to where the funds came from.",

The next response might be a thank you message from the person who claimed he lost Bitcoin. He would give testimony of how one of the experts helped him to recover his coins. These scammers can go as far as showing fabricated evidence to prove their case. Many people might become victims because of desperation to recover their coins which will make them become victims of more scams. They will ask for a service charge and end up doing nothing to recover the coin. Even when they recover it, it will become a problem to get your coin because they are already in control of your wallet.I have seen members mostly newbies come up with threads about the loss of Bitcoin to scammers and they usually receive counsel from the community. I remember that the main option is to trace the wallet where the money is kept currently. The money can be frozen if it is in an exchange and the owner could prove that he was scammed.",

I've read so many articles and stuffs online about how people are misled online towards making investments that are not even authentic and at the end before they even realize that these are fake investments opportunities, they might have already lost a fortune.I have this friend who complained to me about sending money to Elon Musk online all in the name of investing in Tesla company and not getting the profit he was promised. And I thought to myself, how can people be this naive about obvious scam shits like this, someone sends you a random message online and tells you he's Elon Musk and don't find that suspicious? Howwwww?Scammers are working hard day and night, looking for new updates and methods to confuse, convince and swindle your money. So in other to be on the safer side, always disregard messages from strangers and random people, NEVER give out your private or personal information to anyone you see online of out there and lastly before you need to carry out a thorough research about any investment opportunity you hear about or have interest in before going to put in your money in there because it might just be another scam posing to be real.Y'all just stay safe out there and protect yourself.",

This is one of the most sophisticated way of luring in victims without actually approaching them directly wherein scammers just do role play to gain trust of victims. We cannot do much on educating them as it has to be taken up privately since government won't support us in this cause because they are against crypto and will use this as an excuse to push for centralization.",

If your funds are stolen there is no way to get it back, because of the transparency of the network you can see the addresses your funds moved into, but you cannot recover it because you don't own the keys, the scammer would usually also use CoinJoin when moving the funds and obscure the tx, so you can't link the input to the output.Centralized exchanges and services can lock people's coins if they get a request from LE, but you have to lose a significant amount of money for your local agency to request a centralized exchange to confiscate funds; and all of that is if the scammer is stupid enough to send the stolen funds into a centralized service.",

Personally, I come across new methods and ways of scamming all the time and I get surprised how these scammers find all these manipulative tricks. The most recent trap, was someone trying to hire me for a job with a very professional way and a well developed website for their fake company.It’s important to remind crypto users that anyone who tries to access your wallet in any way possible or also tries to make you download anything external to your device, is 100% a scam.",

These scams are increasing day by day. Scammers abuse someone in one way or another. It is very sad when I hear the same. I always keep saying that when you ask someone about something or a problem, don't give your personal information to that person because ou don't even know about it. There is an authentic or malicious person who is ready to stab you, and the second is that these scammers are sitting in every place where you will not have any illusion that this scam will happen in this place too, but they are for their own purpose. They appear—that is, they come to serve you back.So the purpose of saying this is to act very smartly and carefully in such matters because these people make you their victim in the same place where you have a weak point of view of your privacy, i.e., you follow this step without faith and research. Do what the scammer has done to deceive.So be careful, guys. Before changing your stance, think carefully about whether it is going to do me good or a trick.",

The least they can do is to gain your trust when you are frustrated or depressed, and if you bite their offer, that's the biggest mistake that you should not have done in your life.By allowing other people to have an access of your private keys, then the risk to lose completely your coins is now very high. There's no way they will help you for free. Scammers will do everything just to succeed on their own mission, and not actually to help us regain what we have lost.",
