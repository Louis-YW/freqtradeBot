  "content": "The use of Crypto is legal in the UK. However, the world governments and agencies intend to proficiently regulate crypto assets not to only give investors transparency, but also to make gains and income from the crypto markets taxes and legal fees. Current data shows crypto ownership rapidly rising yearly. Almost 6.2% of UK adults currently hold cryptocurrency. It is also currently home to 249 high-growth companies developing blockchain-driven software and blockchain services.With its recent regulatory moves, it stands to ensure the need for crypto exchanges to register with the Financial Conduct Authority, FCA, unless they have applied for an e-money license.The Queen is dead, but grift lives forever.Queen Elizabeth’s death has informed the creation of over 40 meme coins on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, and at least an exploitative NFT collection entitled “Queen Elizabeth 69 Years NFT”. The aim of the collection is so as to offer a yearly picture of the Queen’s reign. One of the reasons to doubt the project’s intent include the fact that Queen Elizabeth II reigned for 70 years, not 69. How does the demise of Queen Elizabeth II affect the UK crypto market?

Period.So basically a bunch of shitcoins and scam NFTs were created for a quick cash grab. Some people simply want to make money out of every event. There's a special place in hell for such people. The \"69 years NFT\" seems like a joke. Some people have a dark sense of humor I guess.Most of the non-Anglo-Saxon world doesn't care about the British monarchy or the state of the UK crypto markets.I'm sure that cryptocurrencies have a future in the UK.",

That queen did not interfere in any financial regulations related matter ever so there's no impact on the crypto market or even on the mainstream financial market. UK is one of the strongest economies of the world and one of the biggest users of crypto currency. It will remain as it is unless the new prime minister decides to do something drastically different and unfavorable to cryptos.",

Queen Elizabeth II's death may create uncertainty on the one hand, but the new monarch will bring a sense of continuity that helps business confidence. While the market impact is uncertain, I see two trends - blockchain technology is entering more industries and authorities are understanding its benefits.",

Why would Queen passing away would have absolutely anything to do with crypto, how could those two things remotely ever be considered in the same sentence. In fact, the real question is, how did OP came up with this question? What did made OP consider these two things could somehow be considered to be related to each other one way or another?I believe that it is quite impossible for these two things to be remotely similar in the subject and impact each other. Queen passed away, crypto is still going on without any changes and if UK ever has any changes, it would be for unrelated reason for sure.",

I read somewhere where the phasing out of banknotes and stamps that carries the Queen's face will be a role in England's banking system and circulating currencies so I don't know if that is what resulted in mass crypto usage in England since citizens will be looking out for a better alternative to banknotes at this moment.",

People, under the impression, start investing in these useless tokens, which will very quickly turn into scams. The market starts to be flooded with fraudulent projects at that time. Of course it's not Queen's fault, but that's how this market works, so anything related to Queen's death should be avoided right away, because it's a scam.",

This is an obvious money grab if they intend to sell it.  I would change my mind if they just do NFT of those portraits to showcase the years of reigning of the queen in tribute to her greatness.",

I actually think the death of her Queen, will have even the slightest bit of impact on the surge of crypto. The reason for saying so is due to the fact that it created an opportunity for creators to create NFTs portraying her 70years reign, it will of course be history in the block chain system for a time as this only comes once, having a slight spike in the usage of crypto and almost out-phasing of bank notes. Also, with whatever shit coins that may have been launched, it only stands to prove the authenticity of Bitcoin and how more reliable than the regular traditional bank they are these days.",
