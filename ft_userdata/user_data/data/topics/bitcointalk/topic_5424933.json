Since the Bitcoin network usage is quite low right now, you should only spend a few cents. My last transfer costed me less than 10c.Quote from: udayantha11 on December 01, 2022, 05:21:15 AMi have downloaded exodus wallet , but there are asking 12pharse words. but we only have private key. so what is that differnace?Every Bitcoin address has a private key. If you have the private key, you can spend the coins of that address.Some wallets manage multiple addresses (usually a new address is generated for every transaction you receive, for privacy reasons), so they give you what they call a \"backup seed\", a list of words which represents what takes to generate the same addresses. It's used for backing up your wallet.Seed -> multiple private keys -> each private key -> each address",

But note that you would defeat the purpose of the paper wallet if you import your private key in a device that has been connected to the internet. The purpose of a cold storage is that your private key doesn't connect to the internet at all. Otherwise, your wallet is no longer a cold storage. By the way, why don't you create a HD wallet instead of creating a single private key and a single address?",

You're using cold storage to stay safe from hacks, so you should sign your transaction offline:Quote from: LoyceV on February 19, 2021, 05:35:55 PMQuote from: mojolama on February 19, 2021, 05:12:41 PMI was considering Electrum, only downside is that when creating a wallet, seed creation is exposedOnline:Install Electrum on your PC.Import your address to create a watch-only wallet.Preview the transaction, Copy the unsigned transaction. Put it on a USB stick.Offline and running without hard drive storage:Get a Linux LIVE DVD. Use Knoppix or Tails for instance, or any other distribution that comes with Electrum pre-installed.Unplug your internet cable. Close the curtains. Reboot your computer and start up from that DVD. Don't enter any wireless connection password. Keep it offline.Start Electrum. Import your private key.Copy your unsigned transaction from the USB stick, load it into Electrum.CHECK the transaction in Electrum. Check the fees, check the amount, check all destination addresses (character by character).If all is okay, sign the transaction. Copy it back to your USB stick.Turn off the computer. That wipes the Live LINUX from memory and all traces are gone.Online:Use your normal online Electrum to (check again and) broadcast the transaction.Bonus:After moving all your Bitcoin, and once the transaction confirmed, check if you own Forkcoins.Also: when sweeping paper wallets, you should move the entire balance at once. Or manually set a change address (which could be a new paper wallet).Warning: some of the paper wallet websites from back in the days now produce compromised paper wallets.
