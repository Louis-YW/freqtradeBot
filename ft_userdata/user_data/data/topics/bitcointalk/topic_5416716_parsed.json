  "content": "We all know the play-to-earn concept by now right? If not, a little recap:Play-to-earn is a business model that uses the blockchain technology.Players can play a game and potentially earn cryptocurrency.How does all this work?In play-to-earn games, players can get a hold of potentially valuable in-game assets. That can be anything — from skins or cards to a specific type of cryptocurrency. The more players play, the more assets they are able to collect, as well as make them more valuable. Also tasks or quests can be done to get rewards.In traditional games, these assets are only valuable inside the game in question. However, in play-to-earn games, they have real-world value.At any moment, players can transfer these assets to the real world and sell them for cryptocurrency or real money on their own terms.Moreover, unlike traditional games, these games are decentralized. This means that the developer isn’t able to control everything.I already like to play Axie Infinity for ex, but recently discovered a new concept:Kata Games! Linktree: https://linktr.ee/katagamesThis project is in early Alpha, but I already love the concept!If you already know Pygame, it is a similar style, but play-to-earn and on the blockchain.The concept is a create/play/earn system.Kata Games approach is to make it easy for developers and builders to create Indiegames by providing a single system with all built-in tools.The games are connected in a fun metaverse, and users can easily play the different created games by moving around in this virtual world.Is also a great way to get familiar with the python language, as the toolkit will let you use the basics in an easy way.The token used in game will be build on the Stellar blockchain to start, afterwards it will probably become multichain.Watch this project closely, it's early phase, but might rise fast to become a new platform for gamers.If you want to stay UpToDate about token release, start of beta, how to build your own game, contests for gamers and builders,...Join the Discord server with a nice community of gamers and devs here:https://discord.com/invite/SHdJhcWvQDHappy building all",
