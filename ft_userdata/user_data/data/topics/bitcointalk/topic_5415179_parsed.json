Currently Ferox tokens are on Tron network, and now they plan to release new tokens SRT on BSC network. Later they aim to swap FRX with SRT. All the explanations can be found on Ferox telegram channel https://t.me/FRXalpha. As to Bounty Detectives - indeed there are a lot of question to their work.",

      "body": "what is the essence of your post? did you write this to Bounty Detective and inform them of your knowledge about these projects? I believe you know that it is your choice whether you will participate in this campaign, so feel free if you think there is a high risk of fraud, just ignore it. you are not obliged to participate, and if you don't appreciate your effort, believe me, no one will.also, if you have complaints about the way that the manager runs campaigns, changes conditions and rewards during the duration of the campaign or any inappropriate behaviour, give all the details. maybe he doesn't deserve to be a popular and highly respected manager.there are very few high-ranking members who are participants in bounty campaigns, therefore few are directly familiar with the problems in them.Quotewe should take a step about this. We should not promote this . Pardon me I coundn't add any photo resourses here for my rank .why are you afraid to write from your original account? you are afraid that you will be excluded from scam campaigns because of revenge?",

The Bounty campaign will be managed by Bounty Detective.maybe you have a concern for your fellow bounty hunter comrades. but you can judge for yourself, how the project will you support. if it goes against your ideology, of course, you can out of their campaign.on the bounty board, more and more new bounty manager names. but most bounty hunters don't mind that.",

We should prevent this by not promoiting Scam project.Members on this forum always say 'Cheaters are not in moderation & everyone has free speech'.Meaning, we realize that all of us here are more careful in all our actions and desires, of course @Lauda, ​​@suchmoon and @nutildah have warned bounty hunters in the user/manager profile @BountyDetective, for the actions and behavior taken by him in managing the campaign.As far as I know the campaign manager is not from the Bounty team/management company, they mostly just manage, get paid, regardless of token distribution to participants, I often see campaign managers write like @julerz12 did.QuoteDisclaimer: I am only the Bounty Campaign Manager for this project. I am paid only to manage this bounty campaign. I will not be held responsible should the developers/project team fail to reach their stated goals/obligations to the bounty participants, investors, and everyone else. Join (on this bounty campaign)or Invest (on their ICO/IDO/IEO) at your own risk.I think the average manager does the same thing as @julerz12 did.For that, what happens in the campaign managed by: @BountyDetective, I think is not much different, basically: stop being a participant in the Bounty campaign managed by @BountyDetective, that way you will be calm and more secure.",

In todays market a lot of project get scammed for this not only investors but also hunters get scamming. We should prevent this by not promoiting Scam project. Recently I just saw that Bounty Detective lauched a bounty programme SaratogaThis project is managed by Ferox Advisor  First of all, i am not bothered to go in to FRX token. (That's a scam as well for mainly same reasons as Saratonga).I looked at Saratoga and from the fist look i thought everything looked just unprofessional, but there are some real red flags.Here are some facts from Saratoga:They claim they are paying profits from real NFT backed lands, that require \"no tax or local evil bureaucracy\". This is just absurd. This is not some decentralized bitcoin libertarian dream, they are claiming to build something that's highly centralized with an actual land and agriculture.I asked if they had KYC and where they are aquiring the land and no, there's no kyc (at the moment), and primarily Turkish. KYC is required for something like this in Turkey because AML laws, not to mention that these would be contracts, and those contracts can't be in in form of permissionless tokens as they would need to be reversable.So either they are incompetent and don't know anything about legal framework for any of this, or trust that their investors are ignorant, because greedy idiots is a pretty good target group for scamming. This will most likely going to be a slow rug as they can pretend for a long time that their land wouldn't give profits yet, blame war, blame bureaucracy, weather, pandemic or anything like that and slowly fade away until no one is interested.*Update: They said that \"no KYC for owning the token, for direct land ownership later KYC will be carried out\"First of all, now it's \"land ownership?\" This makes even less sense, contract happens when you buy the token when that token is obviously security. Or the token is completely useless. Which it is tbh.",

      "body": "I think I can say with confidence that at least 8/10 bounty campaigns are scams in one way or the other. I am not talking about those managed by Bounty Detective. I am saying that's how they generally work. The projects can scam you in many ways.- You don't get paid anything at all. - You get paid less than what was agreed. - Not only do you not get paid, buy your identity and personal documents get stolen for who knows what purpose.- You get the promised number of tokens, but they never get listed anywhere for you to sell them.- You get paid, the tokens are listed, but their value has dropped 99.95% by the time they are in your wallet because the team/developers emptied their bags already.- You get paid, the assets are listed, you can trade them, but the exchange that does the trading is untrustworthy. The tokens get frozen, you have to do KYC, or pay enormous withdrawal fees and waste time with their clueless support.Etc., etc.If you don't want to run into these problems, stop participating in bounties. You will earn more money selling newspapers during rush hour, and it's healthier for you because of all the fresh air (unless you live in a polluted area).",

If we pay attention, most of the bounty campaigns carried out by Bounty Detective have a participant limit. is it possible that the OP's alt account always fails when trying to join the Bounty Detective campaign? might as well be blacklisted if Bounty Detective had it. that would frustrate him even more.",
