I'm planning to hold these coins for the next 3 to 5 years because I know that is the best time for me get some profit as well. Have some good coins on your portfolio because it can save you from a bear market, that is for sure.",

As for the Oasis Network, I'm holding back because looking at the future of these coins, they are still evolving over time.",

Crypto.com, Bnb, Cake, Ogn, AdaI'd just wonder about your comment \" holding with regret\". Have you missed the chance to sell them high? Well, these coins aren't on my list either, they don't have potential in the first place but since it was in your wallet now, I think you need to sacrifice them. Sell them as well and replace them with potential coins.If I were you, take your time to buy more on the leading coins like BTC and ETH, or add more to your Solana. That I believe they are worth enough to hold.",

It seems you bought your MANA at the peak price and the price is going down right now, right? That's why you are regretting it not to sell your mana at the peak price and then buy at the dip right now. Only converting all of my tokens in the past into the stable tokens that will save my position during the bearish trend like this. i just used it as reserved funds.",
