So i don't see myself supporting an individual and even share my profits with him.Bitcoin will gradually reach $50k with or without those pretending people. We just have to wait for it and trust the process.",

We can't trust random people to say that you should invest in asset A or B all the time because trading is not gambling. The point is you have to have your own way to get profit although you can also take advantage of other users' predictions to support your analysis.I wouldn't easily trust other people's random predictions, this is never the best advice for people. Of course people would avoid this way of making a profit because no service really predicts market prices accurately and may not be worth considering. But wait, which people are you referring to?",

But even so, i would not support anyone that claims to be more knowledgeable and powerful than us. I prefer to do it on my own so that if i lose, i don't have to blame on it to someone. And whether i lose or make profits in the crypto market, that's part of my experience that will make me a good trader or investor in the making.",

Will you agree if you are asked to support him/her? Well, the question is \"if there is someone who could really do it\"? Because what I certainly know is that nobody has been consecutively doing the closest prediction ever. Remember that the market is known for its unpredicted trend. And if to say someone does, have we ever thought that he could go in public telling people his prediction is right and always right? He/she had rather keep themselves and become rich with that. And I also think that nobody would ever believe him/her.",

I cannot just give you money because you predicted Bitcoin's price to reach $50,000 soon. That's expected. I also don't give you money by simply warning me that the market is going to experience some bear moments soon. That happens all the time. I will only share my profit if it is particular trade calls that you are sharing. For example, you told me to place a bid order at $1,750 - $1,800 for ETH and then a day or two later you also told me to sell it at $2,400 - $2,500 because a correction is due and that it is safe to buy it back at $1,900.
