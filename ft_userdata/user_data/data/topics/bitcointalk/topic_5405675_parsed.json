That is enough to stop bounty hunters to spam there.Nope, they will move to other boards that lead of spammers too e.g. Bitcoin discussion, Beginner & Help and Speculation boards. We all know moderators isn't really strict if the posts isn't really bad or soft-bad, so those spam posts wouldn't get deleted. To stop bounty hunters is ban the bounty section is, there's no more solution except that. But banning bounties board will make forum traffic declined a lot, so stopping bounties isn't a wise idea.",

It's not like we don't have enough signature spam in other parts of the forum already. theymos saw this point, perhaps and decided to implement bump scores in a few boards initially but still being opened to expand it to more boards if necessary.A few months before and after the merit system kick-off, there were debates that if spam endemic can not be handled, all signature should be disabled. So far, it does not happen as merit system works and later gets support from bump score changes.Rules for Serious Discussion and Ivory TowerQuote - No advertising of any kind.Â - Signatures are not displayed.Two new no-signature boardsQuote from: theymos on January 09, 2018, 07:08:39 PM - Serious discussion.
