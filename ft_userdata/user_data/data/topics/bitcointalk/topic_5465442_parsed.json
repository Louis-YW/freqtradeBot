  "content": "A civil and criminal lawsuit against coincodex will be filed on monday in the legal jurisdiction of:Vojkova 63, Ljubljana, Slovenia 1000, SIDefendant: David CernutaSantiago, Region Metropolitana, ChileCLAUDIO ANDRÉS JEREZ CORTEZ, David ČernutaThe civil claims concers the treatment of Marquise Museum's legacy NFT vault token on the platform which has caused the project significant economic damage and the criminal claim concerns clickfraud banner advertisement which are sold on coincodex at very high prices to third party buyers in the cryptocurrency community.Coincodex should provide the full name and home or business address of acting CEO and the same information for the team member who made decision to set Marquise Museum status to \"not trading\" on coincodex.There are screenshots saved and collected from the entire chain of events, 5 years email correspondence between the two parties and backing documentation to assert the market value of this NFT vault and NFT collection. This will be presented before the relevant regional courts with a civil damage claim of $100 000.The claim in the civil suit is based on a  $500 000 fundraising that Marquise Museum is engaged in with third party prospects and the damage caused by coincodex against this project is at least 20% of this sum as the price tracker had historical data since 2018 which proves the vault is the oldest digital image vault in crypto with similar projects from 2017 valued between $10m-$1bn.As a result of the actions by coincodex in august, Marquise Museum has lost a sizeable future economic opportunity to successfully raise capital with third party investors as the price tracking data since 2018 is important to establish the vaults originality and thus economic value from a legacy perspective which is an important factor when raising money for this type of venture.The match making API on waves exchange temporarily experienced technical malfunction on August 29th 2023. As a result of the wiped orderbook the market value of Marquise Museum increased by 1 500 000% from $40 000 to $600m. The technical issue was resolved on waves after a few hours and in the meantime the ranking on Marquise token peaked at 54 on coincodex main site. The high ranking should have converted into thousands of organic referal clicks to the www.MarquiseMuseum.com website but in fact there was no increased clicks during this period which lasted for 1 whole day before coincodex disabled the tracker for marquise museum and thus removed its global ranking slot.All of the analytic data from the event is saved by the museum and will be presented in due process as a criminal claim against coincodex for artificially inflating banner clicks to falsely raise marketing money from third party brokers such as prime xbt and many other smaller crypto advertisers. This data will be distpatched to prime xbt and other major advertising client in coincodex customer list.",
