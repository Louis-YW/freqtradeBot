      "body": "No - sorta...1st: USB-A ports are only rated for continuous current of 750ma although that has been upped to 3.1A for Battery Charging applications, even for BC the connectors are designed with the assumption that the higher current is for a limited time - not 24x7.Can you push more through them? If done with care by making sure that there is air flow over the connectors and you keep an eye on them to catch problems then yes...The ONLY hubs that supported up to 6A from any 1 port was Sidehack's original Gekko hub. They had 3 pairs of ports, each pair fed from a 6A regulator and yes, some folks have pushed then very hard with over 5A from them. Folks also fried connectors by doing that...The latest Gekko hubs now use 1 very large regulator with each port being fed through a 3.2A resettable PTC fuse.In short: If you want to push that much current into a USB device it is far far better to NOT use the USB connector for power and instead directly wire power to the device.",

Currenlty I orderedhttps://bitcoinmerch.com/products/gekkoscience-8-port-usb-hub-2-0 That's the best one available for powering the F's and really the only one that will allow you to run the Compac-F to it's true potential. Do read through the Compac-F thread for details on what folks have done with it.",
