  "content": "https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/husd/right now husd is 17 cent , it is a comedy that an exchange sells its own stable coin to someone else and claim itself not responsible for it.They also closed local offices leaving only last personels for local support while even ftx was opening new local offices.A hack happened and billions valued husd gone then some recover news but they could not stand and sold exchange whole. But we know from poloniex selling a damaged exchange doesnt turn good to its customers.Also justin sun seems involved this new ownership. As a result it seems like they bought for emtying its case. they made a lot of campaign that can affect unexperienced cyrpto customers, that smells bad.After ftx we still can see exploited customers at exchanges in this unregulated sector. Be carefull",

Rather than Houbi going down, IMO it's more likely they burning bridge with Stable Universal (company/team behind HUSD) after partnership on 2019.Quote from: teramit on November 12, 2022, 03:39:51 AMright now husd is 17 cent , it is a comedy that an exchange sells its own stable coin to someone else and claim itself not responsible for it.They also closed local offices leaving only last personels for local support while even ftx was opening new local offices.Could you provide the news source? I did quick search, but only found article about delisting or speculation it'll follow FTX path.[1] https://www.coincarp.com/exchange/announcement/huobipro-104921194018990/[2] https://paxos.com/2019/07/17/stable-universal-partners-with-paxos-and-huobi-to-launch-new-stablecoin-husd/https://tr.linkedin.com/in/alphangogusthis guy was local manager but they fired him with all groupStabil coin is the best way to exploit customers money, people trust it like real usd so alot of money comes to it but then drain and show it like a hack just now sbf is doing same.so you can understand them https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/04/huobi-exchange-users-furious-after-gala-holdings-are-converted-to-meme-token/a lot of fisshy things happening right now can you think binance is delisting busd :/",
