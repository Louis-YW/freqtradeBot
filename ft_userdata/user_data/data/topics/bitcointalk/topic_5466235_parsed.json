  "content": "Find crypto program. Profit: 0.5 â€“ 1% Daily Up to 200%, then repeat. Deposit Min: 20 USD+ via various crypto, also BTC. There are already 9000+ members. At this stage it is not possible to say/investigate that this is SCAM site or not.Can ad the link in this thread, if someone interested ( in reply ).I probably will not post the link, because all forum members think, that this is 100% SCAM site. I did not invest in this site yet, and wait for more reviews from the crypto program members, if this will be SCAM - will be negative reviews in future. So any FURTHER REPLIES ARE NOT NEEDED. THANKS to all members for their view.",

There were even big ponzi schemes who siphoned billions out of many people. It doesn't prove anything op. Moreover, let's also keep in mind how easy it is to inflate/fake numbers. Â In addition, there is no need for reviews when their business model is a text book ponzi scheme.

Or do you have a goal to promote the site? I suspect you have that motive, IMOLogically, no investment is always profitable, even large companies will experience losses because they waste money on massive promotions, they will make a profit in the next few years. One business that does not require large capital and provides many benefits is trading, but I am sure that no one can always make a profit from trading (crypto or stock market). So until now I still consider it 100% a scam",
