  "content": "Please forgive me if this post breaks any rules but man I'm obsessed with this OpenAI Chat bot, all the below answers are from this AI ChatGPT OpenAI.So after playing with this OpenAI ChatGPT I randomly asked some questions about bitcointalk and some of the answers will leave you stunt. Remember, I asked these question without any context, I mean I was asking programming questions and then randomly bring this topic about bitcointalk and oh boy...This is one of the perfect definitions of bitcointalk I have ever read.Quote from: shahzadafzal on December 08, 2022, 11:04:05 AMGood surely its does know about bitcointalk, but can it \"Write a bitcointalk post\"? I ask this smart a** ChatGPT to write me a post for bitcointalk...Quote from: shahzadafzal on December 08, 2022, 11:04:05 AMLook at the answer man... It's bullish on bitcoin and its knowledge about bitcoin is better than many of us. I asked the same question at different times and the answer was always bullish with different wording of course. Ok since this AI knows about bitcointalk, but can it guide newbies on \"how to get merits on bitcointalk forum?\", let's see...Look at the answer below...Is that not enough of an AI? Look at point no.5... No google will bring this up. This is above human level AI. Going to the merit-giveaway campaigns... This AI is not only well aware of what's going on on the forum but also able to read the fundamentals of how it's working, impressed!If you are not impressed yet... wait for it ok, AI tell me \"how trust on bitcointalk works?\"Wow AI says \"high trust score indicates that the user has a history of positive interactions with other members.\".... that's what it is!!Ok you cheeky Mr. AI, i see you know bitcointalk but how about theymos? Do you know what animal this is? No hanky-panky, just tell me \"who's theymos?\"ahhhh so sweet... looks like this AI is written by Satoshi or theymos himself? \"well-known and influential figure\", \"strict moderation\", \"respected figure\".. stop it AI theymos is blushing. Yes, I asked the AI to answer who's Satoshi? and the answer is as boring as you know.. unknow figure, person or group of people who created Bitcoin. Nothing new and all facts and we all know facts are boring so leave it for now. Let me ask this \"what's the future of bitcointalk?\"Competition to bitcointalk is coming guys... Ok last question \"Do bitcointalk need to update its interface?\" please...AI know mobile support is missing, but I think overall answer still support theymos but in the end it says \"update to the forum's interface could be beneficial in the long run.\"Enough I guess, ok give it a try guys ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue - OpenAI Bot",

I don't know if it's that you think it's going to stay at that level of quality or shitpost. No. It's going to get better. The AI writes much better than the average user of the forum, and for me, without getting catastrophic, it will bring leverage. I think that in a few years AI tools will be used to write, in the same way that people use automatic translators to write in the English section of the forum.",

That's certainly a possibility, and I think campaigns like 1xCrap will be thinking about it right now, because for what they want the quality is more than good enough. This debate goes much further. IA midjourney illustrations are also much better than those of the average cartoonist. That to this day, and they just keep getting better and better. They're going to do a lot of less necessary jobs, and others will come out, just as there were no youtubers or influencers 30 years ago. As far as I'm concerned, I've had this debate in poker. When the first bots came out, people made fun, or rather, we made fun, because they were better than the typical recreational player or fish, but they played in a very simple way that we regulars could beat. It's been years now since AIs are better than the best of humans. Is that the end of poker? No, on the contrary, what these tools have done is to give leverage to those who study poker with poker solvers.",

      "body": "Well things are seemingly starting to move pretty fast with the use of the ChatGPT solution, to the point that StackOverflow has temporarily set a policy to ban the use of the tool on their platform. I’ll quote the longish post, which is worth a read in order to see the situations it seems to be causing:QuoteThis is a temporary policy intended to slow down the influx of answers and other content created with ChatGPT. What the final policy will be regarding the use of this and other similar tools is something that will need to be discussed with Stack Overflow staff and, quite likely, here on Meta Stack Overflow.Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers.The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting. Because such answers are so easy to produce, a large number of people are posting a lot of answers. The volume of these answers (thousands) and the fact that the answers often require a detailed read by someone with at least some subject matter expertise in order to determine that the answer is actually bad has effectively swamped our volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure.As such, we need to reduce the volume of these posts and we need to be able to deal with the ones which are posted quickly, which means dealing with users, rather than individual posts. So, for now, the use of ChatGPT to create posts here on Stack Overflow is not permitted. If a user is believed to have used ChatGPT after this temporary policy is posted, sanctions will be imposed to prevent users from continuing to post such content, even if the posts would otherwise be acceptable.While the above text focuses on answers, because that's where we're experiencing the largest volume of such content, the ban applies to all content on Stack Overflow, except each user's profile content (e.g. your \"About me\" text).________________________________________See: https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/421831/temporary-policy-chatgpt-is-banned?cb=1If things build up on Bitcointalk, I’m pretty certain something along the above line may be added here. Although it’s not that trivial to discern the text generated by the AI, from a certain type of average user, patterns, language changes between posts, and the way interaction takes place might be pointers to follow.Edit:Quote<...> Moderators are empowered (at their discretion) to issue immediate suspensions of up to 30 days to users who are copying and pasting GPT content onto the site, with or without prior notice or warning. <...>https://stackoverflow.com/help/gpt-policy",
