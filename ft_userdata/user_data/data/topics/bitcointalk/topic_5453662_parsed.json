      "body": "They can. Did they?First up, miners. Say they magically get to convince all miners to give up their equipment to bankers. Next you get a hard fork of Bitcoin where bankers mine their own BTC and we continue running the still-decentralized version of it. Now let’s talk about buying the supply.Say they will. What next? They’ll just keep their Bitcoin in a single wallet and nobody else ever gets to buy their BTC again? They have to use it. They use it by spending it. The Bitcoin they spend goes to somebody else, so the entire theory of bankers buying all BTC falls short quickly.It’s been how many years since Bitcoin launched? Are we having any issue about supply centralization?Then your magical 3 steps… do we forget that humans also started from the “same supply”? Before fiat, they all had the same resources to use. Give everyone the same starting supply via heartbeats and next step is they start spending their heartbeat-earned coins gambling, on drugs, alcohol, pharmaceutical supplies or restaurants. So more money goes to these parties, less money stays in the accounts of addicts and chronic spenders. Launch this “3-step” system and within 6 months someone will own more than you imagine. Fairness is almost impossible to achieve man.Also worth noting: there have been attempts to create fairness and equality in the history of our world. How’s that worked for the societies who tried it out? Because it seems like the only ways to create actual equality are horrific changes of the society.",

      "body": "Central banks have the authority to influence the economy and monetary policy, but they generally do not have the power to simply buy all the Bitcoin and miners. Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network, and its ownership and mining are spread across various individuals and entities globally. Here are some key points to consider:Decentralized Nature: Bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, meaning it operates on a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. It allows for secure and transparent transactions without relying on intermediaries like central banks. Buying all the Bitcoin would require a massive amount of resources and may not be feasible or practical for central banks.Limited Supply: Bitcoin has a finite supply capped at 21 million coins. Currently, around 18.7 million Bitcoins have been mined, leaving a limited number remaining to be mined. The scarcity of Bitcoin is one of its key features, and attempting to buy all the available coins would likely drive the price up significantly.Market Dynamics: The price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand dynamics in the open market. If a central bank were to engage in significant buying, it could influence the price, but it would also face challenges such as market liquidity, potential regulatory concerns, and the reaction of other market participants.Independence and paybyplatema Freedom: Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, offer individuals the ability to have financial autonomy and control over their assets. They provide an alternative to traditional banking systems and can be used for various purposes, including cross-border transactions, privacy, and protection against inflation.Economic Considerations: Central banks have different objectives, such as price stability, controlling inflation, and promoting economic growth. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, while gaining popularity, are still relatively small in comparison to traditional financial systems. Central banks typically focus on the broader economy and do not view Bitcoin as a direct threat to their monetary policy.It is worth noting that the relationship between central banks and cryptocurrencies is evolving, and some central banks are exploring the potential benefits and risks associated with digital currencies, including central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs aim to provide the benefits of digital transactions while maintaining central bank oversight and control.In summary, central banks generally do not have the ability to buy all the Bitcoin and miners due to its decentralized nature and the limited supply of Bitcoin. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies offer individuals alternative financial options, but they coexist with traditional banking systems rather than serving as replacements. The role of central banks is to manage monetary policy and ensure the stability and functioning of the broader economy.",

They just can't invest into something that's highly volatile and they're not looking at it just the way we're looking at it. There's a huge gap between the bankers and Bitcoin because they've got a separate belief unlike us who truly sees the potential of it no matter what negative feedbacks we're hearing with the \"experts\" telling that it's gonna be something bad for financial matters of an individual. But let's say that if the bankers did this, well, they'll take all the hashrates, most of supply of Bitcoins currently but that doesn't mean they'll take all because there are still some that's not yet mined.",

As I think world bank would have been a better option since it is a financial institution which operates globally same as Bitcoin. But moreover, one thing you just need to understand that central banks are own by nations/countries, of which each nation has it own central banks that are all generally independent on it's  own, and as such, buying the entire Bitcoin and miners can never be possible, since not all these nations agree to the ideology & use of Bitcoin being a decentralized digital global currency whose value fluctuates due to it's volatile nature.Secondly, if the total amount of Bitcoin in circulation (i.e 19.3million+) was to be sold currently at Bitcoin $26,800, that will amount to over $517billion, which is quite a huge sum of money for government to invest in an asset they have no control over it.",

If they start buying coins massively the price will just rise. Some HODLers won't ever sell under a certain (very high) price and at that point they might not sell them all because they'd have more than enough fiat already.Miners? Well, mining is a business. Unless the central banks don't do something like buying a huge lot and then manipulate the price to get miners into bankruptcy (and this will not go with all, and this is illegal to be done), they cannot just \"buy the miners\".Did you actually try to think a little on the possible outcome(s) before asking this question?Quote from: Z390 on May 22, 2023, 03:17:28 PMAnd who says that they aren't doing that already?They can buy some amounts - big or small - but extremely far from \"all\".",

I will be the person if no-one else will...In more realistic terms, there is only around $2m Bitcoin available on exchanges, maybe a bit more via OTC, but this is only around 10% of the currently circulating supply. So in reality, right now there is only upto 10% of Bitcoiners who are willing to sell their Bitcoin at current prices. Sure if price went up 10x or 100x, there would be more, but there will always be a % unwilling to sell if price continues to move upwards. For example around 15% of the current supply  are held by 10 year+ holders, that remain extremely unlikely to sell, as well as almost 30% that have held for 5 years+ that are quite unlikely imo.",
