      "body": "Have not seen a that particular coin from Microsoul in quite awhile! I really cant believe its already 10 years old as well.  As the encyclopedia says...this was his first attempt on making coins and I also do not see the small devil on the coin as well making this even more a collectable from the coins he produced!    Goodluck to the winner! This is nice addition for any collection or microsoul enthusiast!",
