You can purchase a Cooper membership to be able to post photos and some other privileges that your current membership does not allow. At least, you can assign a manager to do this for some money.- Secondly, I browsed the interface of the platform without registering an account, and it caught my attention that there is no indication of the fees that go to the platform for all services. Do I have to register an account and verify it to be able to know the fees?",

If it was registered on 2004 then it might be from any other person who left the domain and then OP bought it.@Op I have tried to check your site and I have faced an issue. When I select the USA dollar it automatically takes me to the Canadian dollar. If the interface can't work for the US dollar then how it is global and what is the use of the US dollar?",

I put the words \"chicksx porn\" in the search engine, and I actually saw some results indicating the use of the concept of chicksx in this field without knowing what exactly it is. Check here.Also, the reviews of the trading platform site on Pilot-trust date back to May 2022, which actually means that the platform was not active more than a year ago. Of course, all reviews are positive. This is a little suspicious, but overall there are no criticisms of it on the rest of the review sites.https://www.trustpilot.com/review/chicksx.com",

I'm part of the advertising team and staff as well.Yeah! I was looking at how to add images because when I created the post, it wasn't letting me. We have a banner with all the information, but I'll look into the membership so we can do that. Appreciate the information! For the fees, we currently have them shown in the first step of the order after you hit exchange now, but yes, you'd have to have an account created to be able to see it",

It's true that you have completed thousands of trades on both LocalMonero and LocalBitcoins, but it's not close to 100k. Not on those two platforms at least based on the trading history. 2652 on LocalMonero and 5000+ on LocalBitcoins. Your profiles are also not 7 years old, they are 5 years old. I guess you racked up those numbers elsewhere. Still, that's an impressive trading history and another reason why fake feedback isn't needed.",
