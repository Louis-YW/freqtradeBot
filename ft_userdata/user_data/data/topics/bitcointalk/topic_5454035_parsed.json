  "content": "What is the truth? There is solid evidence both ways... that Hitler died in Germany, and that Hitler went to Argentina.Were dental records faked and lied about, the ones that show that the corpse in Germany was really Hitler?The many documents in Argentina make that story seem real. But, could they have been faked with a Hitler lookalike?Adolf Hitler old man pic and passport. He came to Argentina and got hidden in Patagoniahttps://helenastales.weebly.com/blogue/adolf-hitler-old-man-pic-and-passport-he-came-to-argentina-and-got-hidden-in-patagoniaCarlos Perciavalle a chilling story: the day he saw Adolf Hitler in Bariloche.??The king of the café-concert turns 82 with the certainty of having seen the German leader and his lover Eva Braun. He was with his great friend China Zorrilla.And he recounted the event this way with his great friend: \"We were having tea with China Zorrilla in the restaurant of a very nice hotel in Bariloche and the waiter told us that since we were very important artists who came from Buenos Aires, the owner of the place wanted to meet us. He told us that he lived next door and out of pure rabble we went to meet him.\". . . . . . . . . . .There are hundreds of FBI documents regarding Hitler, including reports of alleged witnesses to Hitler survival in Argentina.Some pages are heavily redacted, others are not.https://vault.fbi.gov/adolf-hitler/adolf-hitler-part-01-of-04/view...",

It is hard to believe many things these days, but something I know is that there is usually some truth to any rumour. It is not impossible that he faked his suicide and death maybe as a way out of all the crisis that he caused knowing that there was no other way for him to live a free life afterwards.",

Unlikely, but possible in these weird times we are witnessing. Who can we really trust? Who can Putin trust? Who did Hitler trust? There are some not-popular histories that say that Hitler didn't know about a lot of things going on in his Germany. Some say that he didn't even realize that a holocaust was going on, and that the concentration camps were really death camps. His generals hid much of the truth from him... maybe to use him for some kind of scapegoat if they failed in WW2.Consider Julian Assange and Wikileaks. The reason 'they' are persecuting him so badly, is not because of the info that he made known to the public. Rather, it's because of his theme in doing it. His theme was to get the elite to not trust each other, and thereby weaken their strategies, and maybe even bring down their empire.Is that what is happening to Putin? Does he wonder if he can trust, for example, Medvedev? Elon Musk sent him a message telling him not to trust anybody. Did that message weaken his good trust in his loyal people around him, somewhat?",
