      "body": "I totally agree that owning gold or cryptocurrencies may be a better alternative for securing wealth against inflation than holding fiat money, which seems to be losing value. It's crucial to keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrencies also carries some risk. Because the cryptocurrency market is still developing and is not highly regulated, it may be unstable and subject to fraud.Investment diversification is one thing to think about. Spreading your money across several cryptocurrencies and even more conventional assets like stocks or real estate might help lower the chance of loss rather than investing all of your funds in one asset, like bitcoin. The technology behind the various cryptocurrencies you're interested in investing in should also be understood, so conduct your own study. This can aid in your decision-making over the coins you should purchase. DCA top coin, which you mentioned, is a good approach to the current situationAnother thing to bear in mind is that, despite the fact that fiat money may be depreciating, it is still extensively recognized and used in daily transactions. It is thus required for everyday costs even if it may not be the ideal choice for long-term savings. Maintaining fiat money for everyday usage and alternative assets for long-term savings should be balanced. Without fiat money, you cant do anything in the reality, even if it is buying food or basis need.",

      "body": "It is good to go for good coins because some coins are shit coins that if you buy, your asset will be going down. Just like you said it is good to just go for the top ones with the highest marketcap.Bitcoin is better among the coins. Altcoins is like gambling, example is the Luna that is now Lunc, another is FTT, they are higher marketcap coins that investors lost great amount of money.Do not buy at the wrong time too because it will bring losses. DCA in a significant bull market like in 2020/2021 is in wrong time. Buy or DCA after a long bear market.",
