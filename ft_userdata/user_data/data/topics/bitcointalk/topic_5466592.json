      "body": "Well, leaving aside the poor phrasing of the original title, in this particular case it seems that the hack, if it is confirmed to be a hack (as Coinex is still investigating it) is a small part of the reserves they have, and claim:Quotethat users “will receive 100% compensation for any loss due to this breach.\"Something similar also happened recently with the Stake casino case. So yes, there are many reasons not to use a CEX, the main one being privacy, but leaving your funds there is playing with fire because in this case there were only a few funds, but if there are many, the company may have problems to compensate you for the loss. I only see it as understandable to leave them there if they are funds that you trade with but many people leave them there like they leave money in their bank account.",

Keeping funds in a crypto exchange is more riskier than keeping it in a traditional bank. They will always give you reasons why exchanges are important but nothing is as good as having full control over your finances.

I can even say a higher percentage of people are leaving their coins on exchanges, just a small percentage are always storing their coins on a non-custodial wallet. I think some people don't just know the risk of leaving their coins on exchanges, that's why they don't care about sending them out after buying them on exchanges. If a coin is left on an exchange, if anything happens to the exchange, then the coin that is in the exchange will go down with the exchange.

Base on what I understood your entire content is just Warner users to be careful with centralized platforms, they should mind the kind of money they keep with them and how long those money are kept on those centralized sites using the hack of coinex to remind us about the danger of keeping funds in an exchange. Well thank you for the reminder, every with the warning which is being spread across the forum and other places regarding the way and manner user can protect their funds from hack, it still appear that most people are too lazy to take those warnings serious, it’s hard for them to just see their self being in full control over their own wealth, they trust third party to safe keep their funds for them more than they can do it them self.With the amount of hack which we have been reading and hearing about recently, their has always been victims of many kinds, if the hack don’t happen we never we know how much and who actually have their coin stock in an exchange account, is it that those people who do this are not aware of the risk, is is it as a result of them always having an active order? Because if not for a day to day trading and watching of some favorite coins to know when to enter and when not to enter and to save one the fee of withdrawing and depositing all the time when you want to to trade, I don’t see any reason why we should leave our coins in an exchange account.
