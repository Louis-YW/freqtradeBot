I agree. I’m all for 999 silver collectibles but that is an insane amount for what you’re getting. If this was even a super original looking coin or bar id consider it but at the price point they set this coin at I just don’t see any value here.",

Just want to capitalize on the popularity of physical but not make it worth anybody's time. I mean really. Why even load 30 centsExactly that. Design and quality / finish are great. I also very much like to see 2oz of silver. As everybody seems to agree, the 1000 sats funding is a joke. Sure it proves the point, it's now a crypto collectible, but this is not a 0.5g coin, it's over 60gs - I want a value that at least reflects the precious metal value. And yes 200€ for a practically unfunded coin is just too much - that very nice looking box doesn't change that fact.",

(?) but still just involving the one coin? Im not reading it again, lol.   I agree with you. They messed something up. Im more upset with them that they continue to try and capitalize on physical bitcoin but dont want to fully embrace crypto. I feel like they are taking advantage of our live of this hobby. I do think that since they are a big company they could do it right and make it safe. Avoid all the pitfalls that plagued them last time. But for now im steering clear of their products.
