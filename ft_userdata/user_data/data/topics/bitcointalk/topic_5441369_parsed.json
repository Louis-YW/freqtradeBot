  "content": "Well, I wasn't imagining about writing this, but here we are.On February 19, 2023, I deposited a total of $200 into my CoinPayCard account. This was combined with my already existing ~$33 account balance to give me about $233 in account balance.Then, I loaded $220 to my card, and they charged a $10.9 card loading fee for that. My account balance was deducted to $3.something after that. Everything up to this point was normal.What was not normal after that was the balance was never credited on the screen, in my card. I only saw the card balance I had before loading the card (which was $87.2, since then reduced by my spending to $72.1.Now I had been through this scenario two other times, and in those previous two times, the CoinPayCard guy manually fixed it for me, but now it seems that he has disappeared which is not acceptable (considering that now other people are suffering from this problem).I am especially pissed because this was supposed to be reserved for future subscription payments.And this hurts extra hard for me because I had taken the risk to review their service (as I would any cards service as I've done previously) and found no discrepancies initially. Now there are claims that CoinPayCard is being ran by one person, which I would understand as I had ran some things myself before, but to abandon your users like this without even a warning of \"we will be on vacation for x days\" causes a lot of unnecessary trouble.The transaction I used to deposit $200:eff773b76fc1f9464fff222843052ba5203688505af51cab8fc4ada43ff0226eProof that I had $87.2 in my balance prior to this action:The message I sent to Guido asking him to fix the balance in my account:Quote from: NotATether on February 20, 2023, 05:38:09 PMHello, I loaded $220 this afternoon and I still do not see the balance.Hopefully a bug fix is coming on the way, because it's starting to feel a bit tedious to be PMing you to adjust it each time.Best Regards.The account will remain flagged until my balance is made whole again (and of course, that of everyone else's as well). I am very displeased at what you have done to us. You coming with a promising service and you just let things blow up like this is not acceptable.Flag location",

Even though there is no KYC they are not 'anonymous' do you really think a place doing this is going to not reveal their records to the authorities if they show up with a warrant? They know where you shopped and from there it's just another breadcrumb on the trail to you.-Dave",

They know where you shopped and from there it's just another breadcrumb on the trail to you.I think most of us who are doing this are not looking for anonymous cards per se but rather no-KYC debit cards.I imagine that automated KYC verification software excludes thousands of people who otherwise have good IDs just because the software won't recognize them. For example, every wallet and service that's using Jumio for their KYC has a faulty provider because Jumio keeps rejecting all live photos of my (US) passport.e.g. \"Please make sure all four corners of the document are clearly visible and try again.\" (It's in a book form, goddammit, how can you expect to keep it open all the way without using your hands?)So it could be that you actually have the selfie, the ID, the proof of address lined up but the automated KYC software doesn't accept one of them and you get messed up.",

Or rather, it's anonymous... but it's not anonymous.Let me explain: the card issuer (Visa/Mastercard) knows who ordered that card. But if the company that ordered that card offers some gift cards, it may no longer keep a record of who got it.For example, you can go to a supermarket, buy a gift card with cash and then give it to someone else to use. This card, for the person using it, is anonymous. The issuing entity does not know who is using it directly. And you don't know how that person acquired the card.These anonymous credit cards are Visa/Mastercard gift cards, which cannot be recharged.If the card can be recharged, I advise you to be suspicious of this supposed anonymity.",
