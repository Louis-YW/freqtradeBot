Who else have my kind of mindset let discussed welcome to the future Bitcoin holders! It can be too early to judge, It may have been a peaceful 80 hours, there will be some days when the news about bitcoins will not be good and the price will be affected, the news will be everywhere, it will be difficult for you to avoid. The temptation to check the price of bitcoins and the amount you have in your wallet will be there. It is not just about checking the price or not, you have to just discipline yourself that even if you check the price, you will be able to control yourself and defeat the urge to stop HODLing. That is a better mindset for the year for me.",

Who else have my kind of mindset let discussed welcome to the future Bitcoin holders! 2022 was not the year for Bitcoin, it managed to slow down the fall later but selling from the peak of about $48,000 to the bottom of about $15,500 was tough for the coin. And in 2023, I see a coin that will conclude all its activities within the level as well, and if it would make a breakout at all, it's probably going to be on the downside.But for now, the bias is bullish for as long as it would last. By the way, buying and holding from the beginning of this year is a very good deal, it means that you have bought at a low price, and you can safely hold it as long as you want. Nonetheless, if I were you, almost 2 years (1.9 years will be perfect) of holding would do just fine. Who knows what it would do after halving's bullish run?",

Every year is good for Bitcoin, it just depends if you are a beginner who wants to buy as cheap as possible, or if you are someone who bought in the past and wants to sell at a higher price. What is always wrong is to be under the impression that this will be a good year because the beginning is good, although there is a saying that the day is known by how good the morning was Quote from: Ojima-ojo on January 28, 2023, 03:25:18 PMWHAT IS YOU CURRENT BTC MINDSET: 2023 is the year I found my confidence in bitcoin as I have not check the price of Bitcoin for the past 80 hours, since I am now fully into long term holding giving myself, a timeframe of 2-3 years before looking back on the price but what I will do is to accumulate more Bitcoin as chances present itself. Your mindset should have nothing to do with such insignificant things as whether you will look at the price of BTC today once or ten times as if it has anything to do with whether you think Bitcoin is good or bad at some point. If you didn't look at the price in the next 2-3 years to know when is the right time to sell (assuming that's your goal), how would you choose the right moment to take profit? Imagine a situation where you don't look at the price for 3 years, and then you realize that we are in a bear market again",

Although there are not many positive vibes at the moment, Bitcoin has been growing. I believed it to be a whale bull trap. But it appears that the chart is still very powerful. I believe all the chart needs is a single, big piece of good news. Despite the lack of expectations, there haven't been many negative stories lately. If there is no incident, a dump is not expected anytime soon. $22K appears to be the current support level and is being clutched tightly.

Who else have my kind of mindset let discussed welcome to the future Bitcoin holders! It doesn't matter when you start and how much you invest. But it's impossible if you don't know the price movement and decide not to look at it for years. Because you need information and this will obviously refer to the price of Bitcoin, so if you want to start then start by entering the bear market when it arrives.2023 can be said to be the ideal time for beginners to start, but if you look at the next halving, are you ready to hold on? that's what needs to be emphasized. Not everyone succeeds in long-term holding, many fail because of urgent need. And as a long-term investor, things like that need to be considered carefully.",

Who else have my kind of mindset let discussed welcome to the future Bitcoin holders! This is a bit too early to conclude. We are just on the first month of 2023 and it’s normal to experience this kind of rally since the price went down a lot since lost year for multiple consecutive months. You should use a monthly time frame to determine the general overview of crypto market. You will notice that the current month is the first positive strong movement after multiple months of dumping and low volume trading.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on January 28, 2023, 03:25:18 PMWHAT IS YOU CURRENT BTC MINDSET: 2023 is the year I found my confidence in bitcoin as I have not check the price of Bitcoin for the past 80 hours, since I am now fully into long term holding giving myself, a timeframe of 2-3 years before looking back on the price but what I will do is to accumulate more Bitcoin as chances present itself. Who else have my kind of mindset let discussed welcome to the future Bitcoin holders! This same on last year. You can see that Bitcoin manage to have price recovery during February and March after experiencing huge dump from Nov 2021 to January 2022. Price always recover short term after the huge dump then possibly continue to go down further. My strategy is to watch carefully on the price and make sure that I’m not buying on the price that will big time later. I’m currently doing DCA every week but I’m always taking profit too the moment the price moves and gave me a short term gain. I’m currently using x2 to x3 leverage trading to have a decent profit for a minimal move since I’m still convince that this is mega bull run. I will keep doing this short term trade until the price gets to 30K level and above then I will do the power hold.",

Hi brother as for as I am concerned I will say that Bitcoin might cross above 32000 dollars in coming weeks and still there is no guarantee about that. And that is just my speculations. Because in 2023 we are seeing that Inflation rates in USA are very very less and also there have rumors that we might see many more improvements over coming weeks too.

The resistance of BTC seems to continue this year, remember that next year supposedly there is a next halving to the BTC which makes a good result for BTC after another year which are we noticed every time there is a next halving the price. So this year 2023 could be a good step and it is wise if you invest last month but I think until now it is not too late for that.

Avoiding anxiousness as a holder is the best form of mindset and to do that, there must be a total break from the price until the time frame set for the investment is reached.",
