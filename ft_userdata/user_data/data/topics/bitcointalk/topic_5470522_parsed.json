Comparing gold the price is around 0.5% drop per ounce as per the US market rate so I don't think it affected the gold price in any positive way, to be honest.In general, people trust gold more than anything so the psychological mindset of people will assume that gold is always the safest but the actual investors know that holding gold over a certain limit is completely useless.",

It is still not comparable to gold whether we want to accept that as truth or not. But there's nothing wrong with that because gold has been recognized for thousands of years, while many people have never even heard of bitcoin. So I'm not surprised that people are still looking to gold instead of bitcoin these days. And that doesn't mean bitcoin isn't safe or can't be compared to gold, simply because bitcoin needs more time to be recognized and proven. You should not be too hasty.",

If talking about assets that are considered safe havens or stores of value, I would still consider gold to be the most suitable. Bitcoin is still a highly volatile asset so it cannot be called a safe haven or store of value. Look at bitcoin's market capitalization, it hasn't even reached $1 trillion, it's only 1/20th of gold's market capitalization. That means it can be manipulated and dumped at any time, how can it be called a safe haven? As bitcoin's popularity increases, that will certainly change, but for now, bitcoin is just a volatile investment.",

      "body": "Gold price increase taking place during the time of war is common. In simple, gold is much connected with the traditional market whereas bitcoin is not much dependent. Due to the Israel-Hamas conflict, there is geopolitical tension around the world. This have caused demand for gold and the same had increased the price. Even if there happens rise in the price of bitcoin it won't be bullish for the long run. We had experienced similar scenario during the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.Even now the people who had known about bitcoin is low compared to gold. This is why people during these kind of situations prioritise gold and the same leads to the rise in the price. Bitcoin being highly volatile doesn't attract the users who always wants to be on the safer side. Today the market had experienced a massive rise, but this is kind of fluctuation and not the perfect growth.",

Your input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. Debate about gold and bitcoin still occurs in groups supporting these two types of investment assets. Those who support traditional investments such as gold will not trust bitcoin as the best investment asset because the price fluctuates. They do not believe bitcoin to be a hedge asset other than gold.In contrast, bitcoin supporters would believe bitcoin is the best asset in hedging.I might be a believer in both with a positive assessment and I would choose both. If we calculate which one is better, I would say Bitcoin is the best even though gold is also a good investment asset.For me, gold tends to be stable. Meanwhile, bitcoin is the best long-term investment asset.",

Well that's not a far fetched prediction because as of time of writing, Bitcoin price is $27,816.78 so it can happen but let's not get our hopes high yet because it could still drop like it has been doing this past weeks. For the case of gold rising during wartimes? I think it's more stable compared to Bitcoin and acts like insurance for investors. Also, during the time of war, the countries involved will need different items like food, bullets and weapons and since gold is an internationally accepted currency, it's price skyrocket.",

Probably not, but that will come sooner or later. Gold has always been the traditional Store of Value/Safe Haven asset for centuries. We merely can't expect people to trust something new like Bitcoin which has existed only for less than fifteen years, against something that has been in use by human civilization for more than one thousand years. Plus it's the Central Banks that has been buying Gold. Is that suggesting that a large-scale Regional War is coming? Perhaps. But what's coming during a large-scale war is large-scale BRRRRR-Money-Printing. It's going to be VERY GOOD for Bitcoin.",

With the recent news that the SEC won't appeal against Grayscale, more investors are coming in which means the demand also climbing.About the war, I think it's always the gold that will go up because many investors are still trusting this more than Bitcoin. We are not there yet where they will run to Bitcoin when there is economic distress brought by the war. We cannot take away the traditional belief of many people about trusting more the things that they can physically touch than money on the internet and gold is one of the definitions of that. Well, I am not against it. When something really bad does happen, I bet many people will trade their goods for gold rather than Bitcoin especially if there's no internet coverage anywhere.",

Thanks. https://twitter.com/BitcoinMagazine/status/1713915538471076007Regardless of how this happened, there is new news now, if you look at social media, Blackrock has received approval to release their EFT. This is marked by a rapid increase in Bitcoin. For this reason, I don't know if there will be an influence on the war that occurs, but I look at it from the other side, because war interference would be unrealistic for Bitcoin, even though we have seen a lot of fundraising by accepting Bitcoin as an option. Now Ukraine is no longer providing information about the assets they received after getting millions of dollars from donations of Bitcoin and several other altcoins.The increase in gold that occurred could be caused by other factors that we don't know, in the midst of the conflict what is most needed is emergency funds, medical supplies, food, warm clothes, and clean water. To secure assets or as a suggestion for storing value, I think this condition applies in some areas outside of conflict.",

The truth is unconventional, and it's that Bitcoin will rise when \"people\" stop trying to take credit for its rise. This should enable other people know exactly why it's rising and truth will be established.I still find it strange how desperately certain people and even the media try to hide the cause of the increase. Maybe they are trying to cover past lies? Anyway, we always look for the perfect time to get peoples attention to the truth, but even if we choose Saturdays, they will also choose Saturdays to spread some wrong fundamentals (centralized ones especially) or news related to this fundamentals to make things look like they are responsible for causing the price to increase. This is thesame issue we experienced in their world. They behave like very hardened criminals desperate to take credit for everything. What really helps those who deserve the credit are evidence of past records of pasts predictions of the future. Hope you now know who is preventing Bitcoin from rising. It's those trying to take the credit (or give others the credit) for price increase. If they can be stopped, it will rise immediately.One of our countermeasures is to tie the price increase to something they love or cherish, so that if they continue to prevent the price from rising through this behaviors,what they love or cherish will also suffer. We hope to do this morally.",
