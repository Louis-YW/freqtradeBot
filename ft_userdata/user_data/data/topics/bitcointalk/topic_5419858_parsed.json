I then blocked you.I guess getting a high rank here doesn't really mean much because you are blatantly making things up and quite honestly a profile picture that never existed is the best you can come up with? Just mention in your ads you charge 15 percent for a service that should cost 2-4 percent. My profiles and trading history all speak for themselves daily.Hey bro can you check your pm please trying to get a hold of you on other platforms but lost you",
