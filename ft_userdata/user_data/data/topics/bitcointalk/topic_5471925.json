You should choose a wallet that is up to your liking and how to choose good wallet provider. Better choose the wallet that isn't custodial. There is a saying in crypto that goes \"not your keys not your coin\". Try checking the thread called Beginners & Help Encyclopedia. You can find it searching in google and make sure you add Bitcointalk at the end of your search.",

So like with regular money, you can trade your programming services for crypto payments.¬† Though to really cash in, you'd want to build blockchain apps.¬† That means first getting pretty deep into cryptocurrencies and related tech.¬† Could be a big learning curve if it's all new to you!",

I recommend you go through the rules and regulations provided to you above by some reputable members of this forum and also take them seriously. One thing you need to know when it comes to crypto is not to store your Bitcoin in a centralized exchange like Binance because you can wake up one day and find out you do not have access to it. After all, it is not your key and also not your coin, you can store your Bitcoin in a non-custodial wallet that gives only you access to your fund because that is why Bitcoin was designed. Also, don't allow anybody to get access to your seed phrase or private key because if any gets hold of it that person can move your Bitcoin to another wallet",
