If this forum is the only place that those mixers get more exposure and attract more traffic, then it's going to be a little challenge for them since they will be ban from the forum but will not make them to stop. There's a saying that when one door closes, another will open. So, definitely they will find another way to advertise their service.",

Right. Mixers will continue to work as they do now until there is legislation that prohibits them, which between the slowness of the administration and the steps that the laws have to follow to be approved can take years.",

But mixers will be banned, and we are sure about it. However, I cannot convince myself that they will rebrand or change how they use their service because BitcoinTalk censors them.

But then, I don't think there is any other way to mix coins they can switch or change to for them to be given the green light from the government, as well as this forum, anything they do now that utters how they mix coins maybe likely destroy their real purpose, which is to make coins untraceable.",

So noting is secret with mixer since is a technology..if they want to function and last, let them involve for KYC verification, many coins we mix that worth million dollars all are stealing funds and that's while they only look for privacy.",
