In some cases, citizens have the right to attend these meetings. But this Act still empowers the government agency to bar the public from attending these meetings especially when issues like litigation are been discussed.The above Sunshine Act Meeting was not open to the public because the SEC was considering court judgment. So we have to wait for the SEC to announce the resolutions of the meeting.Quote from: hugeblack on November 05, 2023, 11:30:47 AMQuote from: zasad@ on November 03, 2023, 11:25:48 AMTherefore, yesterday there was a slight increase in Bitcoin prices.

Again, there could be huge pressures on the shoulder of SEC right now as the entities that are asking for approval are not just simply entities but they are huge in the financial world with trillions of dollars between this companies so they really weld huge influence even at a government regulars like SEC.@hugeblack - yeah everything is pure speculation right now, but it sometimes fuels this bullish sentiments on the market.

He emphasized that we will not see a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. until there is a crypto exchange that’s compliant with the SEC.I believe Kevin O’Leary is right because the government will always want to ensure that there are regulations that will give it total control over the ETF. Approving what you cannot control is like buying a car that you cannot drive. But I doubt if it will take up to one year and six months for such approval.  There are already existing laws that will help the SEC to control crypto-related business to some extent. The SEC should not expect to have perfect regulatory laws for the ETF because it is new to the US market. More laws will be made after the approval based on new developments. The SEC has also lost some court cases that might force them to do the needful before the time frame predicted by Kevin O’Leary.",

However, uncertainty surrounds the response of SEC officials and the likelihood of approval, given the history of delays and rejections in this area.
