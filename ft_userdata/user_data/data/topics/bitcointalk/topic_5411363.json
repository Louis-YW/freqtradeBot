  "content": "I know that the inflation rate of each country is different and the relative for each country is different. In my country, this inflation continues to rise which causes a lot of influence on the economic stability of many people \"including me\". I think this is very bad because the government did not adjust salaries to the increase in inflation and now it is exacerbated by the discourse of increasing fuel prices.If in the previous 2-3 years $200 - $250 per month was sufficient for an adequate living cost, then the value has continued to increase to $300 - $400 per month in recent months or even higher for the class of rich people. This had an impact on my financial stability where sometimes I had to sell some of the bitcoins I earned from signature campaigns to provide for myself and my family. The value of the currency is increasingly worthless, the value of the currency of goods continues to increase and even the increase becomes uncontrollable.I have to pay the electricity bill 2-3 times more expensive for normal use. I also have to bear more expensive taxes, and many other things that I may not mention. It really doesn't make sense when the government doesn't seem to care because I can tell that the weak are getting oppressed while the strong are getting stronger.If you were in this position, what would you do? Are you sure the savings you have so far can minimize your financial problems from rising inflation?",

If that is not done, then I can expect more famine to occur in your country even if you are a civil servant.The price of basic necessities and food rises periodically, it can happen in a matter of days and the worst thing is that the value is no longer going down but skyrocketing [only term]. Of course, things like this must be handled properly by the government because usually the mafia will play this for profit.Quote from: ShowOff on August 26, 2022, 09:07:45 PMIf you were in this position, what would you do?Looking for a side income, it can be anything as long as I can do it according to my abilities and skills.Quote from: ShowOff on August 26, 2022, 09:07:45 PMAre you sure the savings you have so far can minimize your financial problems from rising inflation?If the government does not adjust and improve the situation, then I think in a few years the savings will run out because of their limited value. Be prepared for a worse impact if you want to build a house because I believe the material value will be very high than before. But rest assured, everything will be resolved soon when the government has good choices and solutions.",

Salaries don't increase and that's why we have to find side hustles that would be designated for some of our expenditures. This will decrease the expense which we're getting from our own salaries.Savings? Well, just a little and I've just deposited like less than 90% of what I've been saving before. But my reasoning is that, it's still a savings no matter how much it's worth.One source of income won't keep up with the inflation.",

Are you sure the savings you have so far can minimize your financial problems from rising inflation?Seeking alternative options is a decent strategy.It is clear that our current lifestyle and way of doing things isn't well suited to high inflation environments. The time is ripe to try new things and devise new alternative ways of doing things. City residents will have a difficult time adjusting due to limited space and residential restrictions. A trend towards rural living could become common due to lower rent, more options and greater living space. Remote working being more widely supported would go some way towards supporting this trend.Greater living space correlates with an easier time installing solar panels or windmills to reduce energy costs. It correlates with an easier time growing food and raising livestock to disconnect from rising food costs.Flex hour jobs such as driving for uber or amazon delivery could become more sought after. To fill working hours or shift to fund a shift towards a more digital nomad lifestyle. Many americans who derive a significant portion of income from the internet are moving abroad to places with lower average cost of living.There are a number of adjustments and changes that can be made to better cope with rising inflation and economic downturn. Its interesting that there isn't more content devoted to those topics.",

Price of goods and services are skyrocketing and the government is refusing to increase wage because they are predicting that it would cause inflation. Although my country is one of the highest producers of crude oil, the price of fuel is still expensive because we import refined fuel.

The main point is to find a way out and have several sources of income instead of just relying on the main source of income.
