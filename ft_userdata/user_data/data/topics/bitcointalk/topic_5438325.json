Correct me if I am wrong.Quote from: uche6215 on February 06, 2023, 07:19:20 AMInvesting your little money on Bitcoin isn't a RISK, ask me how.There is no investment without risk, so before you invest in any stock or in any digital currency, always keep in the back of your mind that there might or will be a detriment in the future. In case you want to convince anyone to invest in Bitcoin, always tell them that the market will not always be in their favor and that there is also a possibility of losing investment capital. By so doing, you will not get yourself into trouble.",

High or low risk of your investment only really depends on how many bitcoin you have, I mean the smaller the value of your investment, the smaller the level of your losses - as well as the potential profit.You may become an experienced user after while, and it will teach you well that price movements in the market are simply volatility that may not need to hurt you in the long term. Good patience will make you get more profit because usually the price is still possible to be higher than what you expected. Of course in the short term it is difficult, but anything looks possible in the long term.",

You did not answered the argument made by @_act_, bitcoin is a great asset and investment opportunity but there is no need to make it more than what it is, by design the majority of the traders and investors have to lose money, any money you have earned is money which belonged to someone else but they lost it to you, and just as you can earn money you can also lose it, then it is pointless to argue there is no risk when investing in bitcoin when this is clearly the case.",

It is most of the wishes in human history, and it may last for a while, so your grandfather was remorseful because he did not buy a piece of land that was sold for one dollar, and your father regrets that he did not invest in Microsoft or Apple, and today you regret buying bitcoin, and if time returns to you, you will most likely not buy bitcoin, so think about the future.Quote from: uche6215 on February 06, 2023, 07:19:20 AMThe way am seeing things, from now till about 5 years time Bitcoin will be about $30k.You may want to buy bitcoin, but the circumstances do not allow it, for example, economic problems, high bills, inflation, life conditions and many other problems.",

Do not say investing in bitcoin is not risky, it requires knowledge and experience for not to invest at wrong time.A most ignored fact that keeps messing people up.When individuals thinks of cryptocurrencies and picking an investment, they often tend to look at it from the price of today or the ATH of 2021 in comparison with those of the genesis years in 2009/10.Apparently, those are long lost years and long lost opportunity to have taken advantage of that price.The market is bearish now, bitcoin investment is good and promiscuous but, it would always have risk enveloped around it and should you not approach it with a possibility of a lose, you might eventually lose and it would hurt.When investing, have a plan for your investment and try not to panic sale through all the FUD that is been promoted.

The way am seeing things, from now till about 5 years time Bitcoin will be about $30k.I see you've only been in this forum for five days. OK, I guess that's not a problem to look at, but if you talk about Bitcoin more. I don't think everyone needs to ask you more because maybe they already saw a price of $19K at the end of 2017 and experienced a huge increase in the final quarter of 2021. Actually this is enough to prove that Bitcoin is still very good to own and also kept for the long term because the target is of course not just for the price of $30K, but more than that and even three times the price of $30K if the timeframe is five years as you say.

Op I hope you're aware that the Bitcoin you own doesn't increase on it's value does. So even if you have been hodling onto 0.2 Bitcoin since 2017 till now it's still going to remain 0.2 even in the next 12 years to come. So I don't quite understand by what you mean by having \"15 BTC\" by now. Do you mean having BTC that's worth 15 BTC compare to when you bought yours or what?  Do you mind throwing more light on it.",

I think @_act_ is trying to point the OP to the fact that you cannot just speculate on the price of bitcoin without verifying the source of your information or prediction. It is also important to state that although bitcoin is a good investment but the risk associated to the sector shouldn't be overshadowed by baseless prediction. Although bitcoin is a long time investment that require patience and bravery but their are some emergencies that could force someone to sell his coins. I have come across some diehard bitcoin investors that had to dispose thier coins due to issues like health or loss of full time jobs. Therefore unforseen circumstances could affect ones financial plans or predictions which could warrant them to sell below the buying price.",

One must make a mist for him or her to correct her or himself to avoid such magnitude of mistake again. To some extent I might also agree with you in the sense that if you are investing for a long time investment then there is hope at the end. But if you are using it for trading there is full time risk in it. You can loss all your coin in five minutes. That amount you mentioned there is not the ATH price of bitcoin. BTC price had passed that price so the ancient bitcoiners are expecting $100,000 plus price from bitcoin from next year.",
