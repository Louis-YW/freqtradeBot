OP maybe doesn't understand English that much, or he doesn't understand what rape is, and I really hope it's the first one, and that's it's a ''slight mistake'' on his side. As for Kelly, the only thing that shocked me is that it took so long for him to get sentenced, I remember stories circulating rather publicly a while back. I guess money can buy you extensions on trials, but it can't make anyone forget what he did. The moral of the story is not not to take fame for granted, but not to be a piece of shit human being, fame or not.",

According to the report, the Super Star singer faced different counts chargers of child molestation, rape, and sexual harassment. He was tried and he was found guilty of the crime so nobody should feel sorry for him, he had all the money but he chose to be heartless and maybe he was demonic I don't care I believe he should face the consequences of his evil deeds so that other stars can also learn from his punishment.Being famous is good but using your fame to commit crimes against humanity Is not good, R Kelly committed all this evil acts thinking that he will not be caught one day but thank God for exposing his evil ways I believe he will regret even being a star and doing evil too.",

There are countless celebrities that are well behaved, hence it was not fame that instilled that criminal behavior in him. If this crime was committed by someone else, that person would still get the same punishment or even more. The morale lesson for me is that we must learn to apply self control because our right stops where other people's right starts. Also we must learn to treat people the way we want to be treated. Would he be happy if someone did to his daughters what he was doing to his victims? R.Kelly have always been a cheat and derived pleasure in having lust dealings with underage girls. the case of Aaliyah is still fresh in my memory.",

Kelly did and the trauma he has left on those girls and there families. Practically using there teenage minds against them and manipulating it to suit his purposes.He didn't end it at rapes and didn't limit it to teenagers even. Although the teenagers where his very targets but, once he perceived that you could be manipulated as a female, your pretty much in trouble.Unfortunately for these girls, he was a celebrity figure and its always like, 'wow, kelly noticed me!' and the next thing, your being isolated go a point you don't see any other girl in the house despite how many, ask for permission to eat, to use the bathroom and don't even do anything of your own freewill. Like, how could someone be this evil. To take away someone's pride and made not to belong in the society.What was even more amusing was, even during his triers, he was still looking out for more teenage girls in the crowd of supporters to violate. I wonder how he could do this and go through life everyday, knowing that he is causing so much pain to these girls and there families.Am not entirely satisfied with the time he got but its good enough the law caught up with him. He needs to be off the streets for a longer time. Where age won't be on his side to do any more damage when he eventually gets out, that's if he does get out.",

Kelly, a musician who is famous for his song (I believe I can fly) did, cannot be justified in the slightest regardless of a musician or a famous person. Having a lot of money and popularity does not guarantee someone will escape the action of every crime he has to be prosecuted according to the laws in force in the US. I am grateful that this case has been rolled out and that R. Kelly has received a 30 year prison sentence for his crimes against sexual violence against women.",
