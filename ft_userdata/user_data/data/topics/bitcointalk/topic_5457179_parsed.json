Is is the same if I turn off wifi on a more recent PC ? Any tips for generating seed offline without buying a new machine ?",

If you want to have a cold storage, you should run electrum on an airgapped device. This means that you should use a device which has been always offline and will be never online. With turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting your computer from internet when generating a wallet, you don't make your wallet a cold wallet.",

      "body": "Best course of action is using an Offline Live Linux, it fulfills all your needs for creating a cold storage in a secure way (air gap, clean and can run latest version without needing to upgrade your Windows or buy a new PC).There are many general purpose guides about creating a Live Linux disk like this one for Ubuntu using a USB disk: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu#1-overviewAll you have to do next is to download the tarball from the electrum.org website with the signature file and the developer public keys then transfer all of that to your Live Linux Disk which you would run without internet connection (disconnect LAN, turn off your router, etc.). Verify the binaries there using pgp then install and create your seed phrase.Here is a guide for verification: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5240594.0",

Best option is to format hard drive and install free open source Linux OS, something like Fedora, Debian or Mint are OK.You can even make dual installation with winOS if you never used Linux before and than install Electrum wallet on Linux.I would not suggest upgrading to win10 or 11, they are privacy nightmare and they are much more affected by malware and viruses.

I don't think it's a compatibility issue!Better figure out what is the root cause of the problem before proceeding.- Instead of buying a new device, you can simply install a different OS. I recommend Linux distros over windows.- An air-gapped device is a device that has never been connected to the internet or to any other network. If your turn on the wifi, even for a second, it's no longer an air-gapped device.",

It's generally considered to be more stable than Windows which is less prone to crashes, freezing, or sudden system errors, and most especially, this system is less prone to malware and viruses.IMO, for cold storage, I prefer to have a hardware wallet than an air-gapped wallet because ain't that kind of techy person and I don't want to put at risk my valuable asset having a trial and error experiment.Quote from: unknowncustomer on June 22, 2023, 08:37:42 AMAny tips for generating seed offline without buying a new machine ?A paper wallet, would like it?",
