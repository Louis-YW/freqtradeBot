I would be glad if more experienced users would provide me with more explanations that could help me give a detailed explanation of the content I am preparing. Thanks guysQuestion üôãKYC is an attack on Bitcoin, and it's usually advised for Bitcoiners to stay away from passing KYC and exposing their private information. So, my question is, since there are some cryptocurrency exchanges that don't make KYC compulsory for the purchase and withdrawal of a certain amount of Bitcoin, what is the risk of purchasing Bitcoin on such an exchange?RephraseDoe's purchasing Bitcoin on a centralized exchange where you don't pass KYC (KYC is maybe not compulsory) have any threat (harm) on the Bitcoiner?

The only risk in these exchanges is that sometimes when you deposit big amount then they ask for KYC to withdraw your fund which is very common now and exchanges excuses for suspicious behavior so now you have to pass kyc to withdraw fund so your privacy not secure now.",

The exchange can as well be hacked or go bankrupt just like any other centralized exchange, and if your assets are kept there, you'll lose it.QuoteOr can the Bitcoiner still be tracked or identified by the CEO through other means?Mind you that even using decentralized exchanges isn't enough if you want privacy and you also don't want to be tracked.

So, my question is, since there are some cryptocurrency exchanges that don't make KYC compulsory for the purchase and withdrawal of a certain amount of Bitcoin, what is the risk of purchasing Bitcoin on such an exchange? I don‚Äôt think there could be any risk just that it will sooner or later ask for the KYC if it is a centralized exchange because of regulations. Also when the exchange encounters problem it will be those who have completed¬† KYC that would get a refund so you would have be very careful of this exchange‚Äôs that do both non KYC and KYC. This is not by any chance advising you to move to those with KYC protocols but for full privacy stick to just decentralized exchanges.

Or can the Bitcoiner still be tracked or identified by the CEO through other means? this is similar to the answer above. But concerning bitcoin been traced without any KYC information i would say it would be hard to trace it directly to the person. But since bitcoin transactions is stored publicly on the blockchain then I would say it can be monitored most especially if the bitcoiner uses a single address for all gis transactions and once you get monitored there is believe that you could get caught. That‚Äôs why it is better to use different addresses for every transactions Another thing is some use‚Äôs usually register on exchanges using phone number and even if that exchange doesn‚Äôt requires KYC, your phone number can be used to trace you except if you register the SIM card with fake identification",

If you don't, they can still track your addresses, they can put them under a Unknown49436 name until you make a move that is KYC related and then they can labe it properly. Of course, that's only (heh) privacy problem, not actual harm (especially if you're a good citizen and pay the required tax on your money or gains).The real threat, as said, comes from the fact that \"not your key, not your coins\" and if you use exchanges with \"unknown\" reputation (to say it nice). If you're unsure of the reputation of the exchange you want to use, better ask around.I will add that the bigger risk for operations with centralized exchanges may actually be your own bank (if you go on that route). Some of them may ask odd questions or even close your account because they made up odd policies against crypto.",

So, my question is, since there are some cryptocurrency exchanges that don't make KYC compulsory for the purchase and withdrawal of a certain amount of Bitcoin, what is the risk of purchasing Bitcoin on such an exchange?The first risk is that centralized exchange might freeze your coins or assets until you provide KYC, buying BTC from exchanges is not wrong but keeping them on exchanges is wrong, because \"not your key, not your coin\". The second risk might be, that those exchanges are just a hub of scammers and they just want you to use those exchanges, but this risk can be managed if one has the knowledge to differentiate a good and a scam exchange. In my thought, KYC is not a thread or attack to BTC, I know the BTC is made to avoid the middleman and the troublesome work of providing the documentation, but besides that, Due to the KYC factor, many people started to think about BTC just like due to the ETFs more people will come to trust the BTC. I hope you understand what I am talking about.

So they know your 4 personal data and they can use this to get more information by cooperating with other centralized sites.I think that despite using a real name without any valid means of proper identification, it's just useless because there are a lot of people that have similar or similar names around the world.

The advent of exchange paved way for the fast adoption of Bitcoin on individual basis because exchanges are like a door step services where you can easily access your assets at your comfort zone compared to the banks.KYC as you have said was not part of the Bitcoin goal and as a matter of fact, I see it as anti Bitcoin because it is not inline ¬†with Satoshi ¬†dream on inventing the Bitcoin. The Bitcoin was invented as a pseudo anonymous assets where by the identity of the holders would not be revealed in any way but gradually as the awareness and adoption became popular, the government took advantage of the situation by holding them to ransome forcing them to conduct KYC on their registered members which in other words reveals the identity of Bitcoin holders on their various platforms. This further reveals everything about a bitcoin investor making their identity not safe anymore.If an exchange chooses not to impose KYC on her clients, that is their decision but as an investor or a trader you need be smart and wise with your assets and funds. It is always advised not to save your assets on exchange because of the possibility of exchange being too porous for hackers or running away with ones funds. When trading, you should be able to transfer your assets out of the exchange after that to keep you on the Safe side. Lastly, risk of purchasing Bitcoin on exchange with no ¬†KYC features is high though just like the risks involved in doing ¬†KYC on exchange with such features. When buying on such exchange, there is every possibility that you have purchased a stolen asset being tracked, there every tendency that the exchange might abscond with your assets as the case maybe, you might be under surveillance as your identity is not known to see the end result of the assets you have purchased and where it's going to and who receives it. KYC or no KYC exchange tends to possess a risky and dangerous modus operandus as it relates to their operations. Either way, they are just an arm of the government to check mate and monitor the activities of Crypto holders and keep them on the check.",

In some cases, these laws must be immediately adopted or implemented by businesses. ¬†An exchange operating a KYC-free crypto business can be forced to change this policy because they have been mandated to do that by a new law. ¬†Also, customer's funds can be frozen until they provide the needed personal information. There are also cases where the government can seize exchange without notice and compel the client to produce some data before the release of their funds.

If you really want to be safe from worrying about KYC in the future then just trade via P2P or DEX, there are lots of options now.",

If you use a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer like Bisq, then the risk is minimized. That means that you only hand over your bank info to some stranger. It's better than a centralized exchange which gathers thousand of clients' data, and much better from KYC-CEX, which gathers even more important data.
