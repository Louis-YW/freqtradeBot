Bitmain is even worse, they make pre-sales, and hold + use the Antminer, only to ship them once the market collapses. What they did with the L7s was quite a caricature.. I have never ordered directly from them, their reputation is too bad for me. I prefer to have a trusted intermediary who deals with them, and who also avoids me astronomical minimum orders...I had never wondered about GPUs, it's quite interesting. I've been trying to find some numbers or articles to get an idea on a global worldwide scale, to see how widespread this bad practice is. I can only find a few sources that talk about some Chinese suppliers, but one can imagine that the Chinese are not the only ones to do this kind of trickery... In the end, it's better to buy a guaranteed refurbished product than a  ‘‘too good to be true price’’ in China.At least they can't lie too much about the used Antminers  When they arrive from China full of dirt and dust, it takes away all the mystery",

Nope. You would mine with them and hopefully that's what they do.Think about a second what you are exactly asking from bitmain now. Basically you are asking them to give you free money.

Yes it all boils down to \"Bitmain, y u no gimme money?\"No you are  wrong, what I am asking to Bitmain is to respect the delays they gave when they signed a sale order with someone, and to tell \"used\" instead of \"new /  never used\" when the miner is used. I don't care what they are supposed to do in some theories, in the real world when they sell miners, it means that they earn profit from the sell, otherwise they wouldn't propose it to the people. So they just have to respect the deal, like it's supposed to be in absolutely every commercial deal.\"Asking them to give free money\" : FREE MONEY ? Are serious ?You mean I don't pay for electricity ? I don't pay neither for parts, or the building I bought to use them ? I don't pay my ASICs ? Is my time spent to do maintenance and to manage the ASICs worthless ?Where is the free money ? Do you think that I am a 14 yo person who never organized a mining setup ?  Telling me that I am asking from Bitmain for free money is totally crazy.QuoteFor these reasons, I always recommend people to buy crypto instead of mining. Mining isn't worth the trouble you are getting.It depends, maybe for you that's fine. Each situation is different, each country has his own kw/h rate, people have different skills, different opportunities to buy and host hardware..For me, mining was and is still more than profitable, so if I just bought coins instead of my mining equipment, I would not have earn as much as with mining (around 2 times less). Even with the current difficulty, you can still be profitable if your electricity rate is not too violent.",

Consoles have traits on their own, I agree with that.

If this was reballing some GPU chip for a product worth $500 it would be worth it, but to go thru this hassle of reusing the memory chips just sounds crazy. Yes, they do. The GDDR5 memory is dirt cheap so it might not be worth the hassle of replacing all of them. Cost and labor work to replace all of the memory chips isn't rewarding so sometimes, people sold a faulty VGA with GDDR5 memory for 10 bucks. Usually, if you got like 1 or 2 faulty GDDR5 memory, replacing 1 or 2 is right up everyone's alley. It isn't like they need to reballing all of the memory. They just took the faulty VGAs with a few bad memory and replace them with the recycled memory that they got from other VGAs. Basically, the frankenstein VGA, you see. Some are greedy enough to retouch the PCB so it looks new and sold it with the tag as a brand-new product. GDDR6/X is now where this process is profitable while GDDR5 is less so. Thanks to the crypto mining boon back in the heyday leading to the massive amount of GDDR5 flooring the market, so you're half-right on your assessment.Quote from: FP91G on February 24, 2023, 03:57:18 PMWhat reviews are you talking about?

A bunch of dudes found something very cheap but questionable quality/price, a dude with technical background brought it first and broke it down, testing to see what was inside them and telling the other if it was worth the price/performance for social creed. We've some really old bb forums that took root from overclocking and PC hardware since 2006. Also, some VGA is at the end of product life so I doubt if you could find a truly new analogue for that VGAs (1060, 580,...)",
