That's probably because the platform wasn't reviewed or reported when you used it. It's also possible that there's an issue with this AvengerDao platform and has been issuing false or misleading warnings. It seems they flagged a lot of other projects but I cannot see any published report.You're still free to use it if you insist. Certik trust score on this platform is \"Good\" but it should also be noted that there was no resolution to all the 8 findings of Certik https://www.certik.com/projects/positionexchange",

From how you describe it it looks like it is dangerous,however in order to be sure I think that you can try to connect a ready made Trust wallet in a virtual machine,highly recommend running Linux so if there is a malware it won't do that big of a damage but even if it does,you are in a virtual machine with a just made Trust wallet so you have no funds there so you can go ahead and test such website this way.This is my personal approach to any website like those when I get warnings from my browsers or wallets like Trust although I use Metamask and I don't think Metamask warns you,but whenever a site asks me to connect my wallet I go and test in a sandbox,virtual machine readily made for such purposes.Most programs of virtualization use Snapshots so if anything bad happens you can go back to a good state of the VM with just one click.",

Are you interacting with another token smart contract in any cases before that warning popped out?Based on CoinMarketCap and the DEX site, the DEX smart contract is 0x5CA42204cDaa70d5c773946e69dE942b85CA6706, surely a different one compared with the screenshot. Disregarding the warning is not recommended in any way, even if you already have interacted previously.I have tried to connect to the site with my test device. All things are fine. I'm able to connect successfully without any warning.",

I don't really know about position.exchange so i can tell you if this exchange is safe or not, but you already said, that you have used it before already and everything worked great so far.I know though that this warning also comes if you want to interact with the site drip.community and this site is used by a lot of people since a year or so now and there also never was an issue there. The thing with drip.community is, that it is a contract that pays you 1% of your deposit every day, so of course this is a very risky investment, maybe that is why the warning is shown.So yeah, just because Trustwallet does show this warning does not automatically mean, that there really is something wrong with the site you want to connect to.",

By separating your fund into different wallets, you reduce risk to lose it all with only one blackswan event like Luke Dash Jr. got.It is important to use a wallet with very tiny fund to explore new platforms.Relying on a wallet software to warn you about risk is not good. They can be late to detect hazardous elements or their warning can be false.After exploring them, make sure you revoke smart contract access.https://app.unrekt.net/It is always safer to limit your curiosity.

There is most likely something they know that you do not know. You have used it before, does not mean that you can always trust them. You have no idea what may have transpired in the company from the time you used them last to the present date. The security warning also could also be an updated feature that Trust wallet has introduced, so it always be that they warned you if anything should happen, Just like the function of a disclaimer. Anyhow, just be sure to read it properly and be extra sure of what you are doing.",

At least that's what I understand if you relate it to the Binance (parent company) article that introduced this firm, I think trustwallet has been implementing it since last September.Actually, this feature is quite helpful for users with low ability to verify smart contract codes.",

Maybe the dex is under development or there are some bugs. If it's risky, you better not connect it first. remember that the security of your wallet will be more important. If it turns out that there are some bugs and it becomes a hacking hole, your assets will also be lost and of course, you don't want that to happen.",

Protecting the private key and mnemonic is the guarantee to avoid risks. The security of the blockchain is always a topic of greatest concern to each of us.
