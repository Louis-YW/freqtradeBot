      "body": "I like how Mike Hearn was eager to learn all the aspects of bitcoin in its infancy. He was genuinely curious when he sent those emails as far as I can see. Also, Satoshi answered and explained it in detail which makes me think that Satoshi really is a person of high intellect capable of explaining difficult technicalities in simpler terms.I believe there are also some snippets of conversation here in this forum that Hal Finney posted. I'd try to take a look of it since Hal is one of the genesis miners which Satoshi came in contact with.",
