I'm hesitant about the name though, I think you're unfortunately setting the company up for a lawsuit from Facebook/Meta. They've trademarked \"Metaverse\" specifically in the cryptocurrency industry already, and so \"Ametaverse\" will never fly by them. How can the company grow enough when that cloud will always loom overhead if the name stays the same?",
