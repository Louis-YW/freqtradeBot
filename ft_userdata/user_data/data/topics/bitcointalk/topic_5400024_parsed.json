  "content": "Hi Guys,i ve got a solar system and want to reduce load for example from 3000W to 2000W if the solar system generate not enough power for my antminer s19pro.My computer knows about the “available” power and can start a SSH script and set the value.Braiin OS+ does have a SSH console and supports S19pro, but im not sure if its possible to set the value with a script.Does anybody have a solution for my situation or knows if its possible?Best regardsPhilip",

      "body": "Why not just remove the one hashboard from your miner if your miner is running at 3000w removing one hashboard will drop to 2000w?Or you can try to run the miner at low power mode I don't know how much wattage will drop but I guess it will be around 2kw.If you are using Braiins OS it has an option under miner>configuration>autotuning where you can able to limit the power consumption you can set it to 2000w if you want to run it with that power.",

I have been giving that command for more than a year, it is useful to use the Braiins OS thread here, or the Telegram support group for faster response.Braiins OS+ is focused in efficient power consumption. However, be aware that for the x19 family, the estimation may be inaccurate. So do measure at the wall after Tuner Status shows: Stable. Newer releases have been improving the power curve estimation.",
