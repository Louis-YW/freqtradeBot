      "body": "You need to post the complete kernel log, these issues usually happen to temps related issues, could be the miner itself or the PSU, the second reason could be the voltage, overvoltage or undervoltage can cause hashrate fluctuation, pretty hard to tell whats wrong without more info.",

Best regards.To be completely honest very few texts except for ones atÂ  bitmain certified centers have had their hands in the new + variants. If they are anything like the previous generation of s19 variants they are made with aluminum boards and have no mosfets. Meaning when one board throws an error the power supply is forced to turn off all three boards instead of just the one to protect the machine. Your next step in diagnosing the issue would be to test the power rails using a multimeter when you see this issue occurring. With this info and more complete logs we likely can still help you.

These things should be used in immersion only...I thought they did this because the heat sinks would just literally fall off while running sideways. With the heat sinks now spring loaded and clamped on I'm having difficulty figuring out why this is still done. I concluded is the old folly, \" it's just how we've always done it\". I've considered the convective benefits and see no appreciable difference, at least with such high pressure forced air. I suppose if you lay them horizontally you have to use more shelves which take up more space which don't let you put as many miners in one location which for obvious reasons will allow them all to perform better with the same cooling a denser configuration would in an identical pod. Although, I actually just learned that bitmain is going to attempt soldering heat sinks on again, this isn't one of those is it?",
