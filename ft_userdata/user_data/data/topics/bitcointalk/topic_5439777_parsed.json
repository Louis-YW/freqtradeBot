  "content": "Quote“Some people are looking for my trouble. And I came here prepared. Today, there are some pastors with the gift of divination who go about ripping people off. This is why we should carry our ‘guns’ and defend ourselves. I will particularly be coming very soon for some of you sleeping in the church,” he said as the church erupted in laughter.The church statement reads: “On Sunday, February 12, a resident pastor of House on the Rock, Abuja Church, Pastor Uche Aigbe in a message about fighting the good fight with spiritual weapons, carried an unloaded gun to illustrate his message on ‘Guarding your Faith.’ “Without hesitation, Pastor Uche has acknowledged the gravity of his actions and apologises unreservedly for them. As a church, House on the Rock rejects all forms of violence and we stand on the good news gospel of Jesus Christ which embraces peace and goodwill for all of mankind. We are cooperating fully with the authorities as they carry out their investigations into this incident, and we will continue to engage internally to ensure this break in protocol does not happen again.”Source: https://dailytrust.com/house-on-the-rock-why-our-pastor-mounted-the-pulpit-with-ak-47/Please correct me if am wrong but I think something like this has never happened before in this country and this should be the very first time a pastor is bringing a gun to church. I've my thoughts on this subject and it can be found in 2 Cor 10:4 \"For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds\" (NKJ) \"The weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds\". (NIV)I don't really know what message he was trying to send by bringing a riffle to church. Nigeria is very fragile, and we don't need this. I would really like to hear your take on this.",

Mostly war turn zones were soldiers and officers are posted that is where our will see such happening. Nobody would wake up in the morning with his or her senses going to church with gun as such. It is not normal but for safety reasons they do it more especially at war zones were every one needs to be at alert. So I see no reason for this picture because they might likely be at military base so that warrants him to carry his arms in other to protect him or herself.",

      "body": "All the time I have been to church, in teaching the word of God, many illustrations are drawn from the past incidents of Christ on earth, the prophets, and the disciples of Jesus, and most of those incidents are related to human life or situations humans are faced with. The word of God can be taught with some illustration from movies, either through the project or TVs in the church, but coming to the pulpit to preach the word of God with a gun is something terrible because it may cause some people to lose focus when hearing the word of God that was meant to be heard, and the church members' attention will be totally drawn to the gun. Even if the pastor is a soldier, I believe he should have some other armed soldiers that should be garrisoned in the church premises instead of the pastor coming to the alter with his gun. In my opinion, it is a wrong act.",

If he is illustrating the word of God, why should he use a gun to do that. If he is teaching about when Jesus Christ fed 5000 men with two loaves bread and five fishes,will he demonstrate this by feeding his church members ? This pastor never talk the truth why he carry gun come church.All these na signs of end time,a pastor is to discourage his church members to stay away fr fire arms because of its implications and it is an unlawful act. Instead,this one dey teach him members how to carry gun. So many kind of people don dey use church dey do so many atrocities these days all in the name of pastor.",

If na to pay security personnels or get our own security to protect members or repel any attacks during church service that one na different matter. But no be you as a man of God to come carry riffle mount alter dey preach dey tell members say dem need to arm themselves. Asin how?
