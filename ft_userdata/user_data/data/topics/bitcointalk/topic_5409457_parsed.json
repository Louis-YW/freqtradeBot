[Guide] Searching effectivelyThe same goes for plagiarism. Someone considers everyone so naive that by copying the text and passing it off as their own, they expect to receive some merit.I was once surprised at how often topics with the same content and meaning appear in this section. And this shows that once a month we retell the same thing.Yesterday I sent a report to repeat the topic, but it remained unprocessed. Why? All this has already happened, and the same people repeat the same words. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5409342.msg60726279#msg60726279",

I can still somehow understand someone who is young and inexperienced and follows the line of least resistance, but I really don't understand those who open a new thread on the same topic, even though there is already a thread on the same topic that you can hardly overlook.",

If your intention is to share an information or your knowledge with the forum, endeavor to make use of the search option to see if it has already been shared so you don't create a duplicate and an unnecessary topic.If it is a topic you intend starting with an intention to know better, still make use of the search option, but ensure to read through the topic that is if you find any topic on it already to see if they have been addressed properly. If so you can lay the topic to rest in your head and not start an unnecessary discussion, but if after going through the topic and your concern is not clear maybe due to your case being peculiar, feel free to start the discussion again from your own angle, you can go ahead to reference still that there was a topic of such before, but it didn't put your concern to rest. You have the right to ask a question in your own terms.",

There are too many topics on the forum with almost the same questions, which have already been answered several times.It irritates me personally, and I believe other forum members as well.Questions about how to advance on the forum, how to get merit or how to make money on the forum have become particularly irritating. It seems to me that we have answered these questions at least a hundred times  Sometimes there are too many such topics and it is difficult to find a meaningful and interesting topic for discussion.Advice like this from the OP is good but I'm sure it won't have any effect on most newbie members.",

The irony of making a new topic about unnecessarily making new topics was not lost on me.

It would be nice to see more locked threads with people asking genuine questions and getting genuine answers before moving on.Some topics seem to attract spammers who just keep adding more rubbish to the heap. It's almost as if signature spammers are relieved to have something to post about so they just add their bullshit answer to the end of the thread.I really wish the quality of discussion was better but I also don't want to get carried away giving signature spammers a hard time because I'd like to join a campaign at some point and maybe keeping the quality of your posts high while still making quota is much harder than I realize.",
