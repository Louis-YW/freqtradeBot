I notice that people do not put their money much in gambling than trading whereas the risk and loss is more efficient in gambling than trading. When we study trading very well there is no way we can trade in a month without making profit and as a beginner in trading we don't need to start trading with money that we can not afford to loss, while in gambling so many people gamble with their salary and last money. So I prefer trading more than gambling because it is a skill and it can be controlled.",

As gambling is addictive, trading is also addictive.You just have to discipline yourself in both and use the amount of money that you can afford to lose to gamble or trade. Quote from: Promocodeudo on June 10, 2023, 12:43:49 PMWhile trading is a skill that you will learn and understand the basic factors that can hinder your trading not to be successful, a trader can notice it's mistakes after loss and make corrections while a gambler mistakes can't be corrected because it deals with prediction. A gambler can correct his mistake after losses, but gambling is luck and using just little amount of money that you can afford to lose. Some people will trade and continue to lose too, just like in gambling, it may even be more. Both are risky, both require different approach too.Quote from: Promocodeudo on June 10, 2023, 12:43:49 PMWhen we study trading very well there is no way we can trade in a month without making profitBut there are many traders that are gamblers, I mean they think that they are trading, but they know nothing. Also there are many with ignorance. Many of them calling themselves traders are losing too. Quote from: Promocodeudo on June 10, 2023, 12:43:49 PMand as a beginner in trading we don't need to start trading with money that we can not afford to lossAlso use the money that you can afford to lose to gamble.Quote from: Promocodeudo on June 10, 2023, 12:43:49 PMwhile in gambling so many people gamble with their salary and last money. Also in trading Quote from: Promocodeudo on June 10, 2023, 12:43:49 PMSo I prefer trading more than gambling because it is a skill and it can be controlled.I too prefer trading than gambling because the possibility of making money is more in trading than gambling. Trading also require skills like you said before and if planned well, profit can become reality, but people should know that trading can be as dangerous as or more dangerous than gambling.",

Just as @Oshosondy said, if an inexperienced trader goes on to put thier money into a stock or let's say some altcoins in hope for some profits all they at that point was gambling since they had no idea about the outcome, but if it was the case of an experience trader they would have been able to carry out proper research the would reduce the chance of themÂ  losing. In both gambling and trading risk is involved but the level of skill possessed by the trader makes a difference but the same thing can't be said also for gambing no matter how experienced a gambler is.",

      "body": "Well, there was never a time gambling was the same as trading, even though they have some similarities, gambling is gambling while trading is trading, like op said, gambling is more of a luck based activity, though part of gambling like sports betting, is more of information (what you know about a team or player/fighter) based, games like poker, and other card games is also skill based as well as luck, trading on the other hand is purely skill based, though we still can not over rule the fact the luck still plays an important role in trading as well, for example, it takes luck to buy a coin, and it pumps x500, x1000 or even more after you have bought it, it's not like you knew that such was going to happen, luck helped the trader buy that coin or token.So overall, gambling or trading, both are good ways of making, how you prepare yourself, and go about your trading activity or gambling activity will determine how much you will make or lose from either of the two.",

So from here fundamentally everything can be separated very clearly, even people who don't understand trading and go to the stock exchange to buy even though they don't know what to buy and what to sell still enter into 2 activities tied together.As for gambling, it means that there are no buyers, no sellers, there is only risking ownership to get more profit with the risk that if the stake fails then everything will automatically be forfeited.",

In trading, you are also relying on your luck accompanied with the knowledge that you have at a given period of time. It's also important that you act in a timely manner, else you will not make a profit, or if you do, it's not maximized and as huge as it should be. If I have funds and time to spare, I'd go the route of trading, but if time is not something that I can really give, I'd just go gambling and let the RNGods decide my fate.",

Here you can closely analyse where your profits are going and hence increase the risk intake for it. Gambling is basically done with 2 outcomes and itâs for getting quick profits in instant amount of time. So yes gambling is really different from trading in many aspects.",

However, this is not the case in most casino games, where the house has the edge and players are expected to lose over time.If you gamble you may have noticed that in some casino games like blackjack, counting cards can give players an edge, but casinos may kick them out if they become too successful. In trading, there are no restrictions on using one's skills to develop an edge and trade profitably.Both trading and gambling require dedication, understanding of the game or market, risk management, and sufficient capital. However, the majority of people tend to lose money in both activities, with a small percentage achieving consistent profits.",
