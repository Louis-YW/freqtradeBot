Not all neutral feedback looks bad on a user's profile; I have one currently on mine. This was given to me by a member whom I took a loan from, and the feedback is a sign and notification to other members that I'm still on an active loan with him or her. Quote from: LoyceV on October 10, 2019, 03:37:17 PMUse Neutral feedback for anything that doesn't mean someone can or can't be trusted.

Is it like a warning or something?Going by the literal meaning of the word \"neutral\", it means the tag is neither positive nor negative. However, going by my observation, most of the neutral tags given sounds like a warning which in some cases not different from direct negative. The worrisome thing about neutral tags is that they are influence by individual personal view and not by the forum standard. Unfortunately, it has now turn to weapon of attack among members having personal grudges with one another. The best thing to do is to be genuine to the best of your capacity and don't do anything that'll warrant the tag other than positive.",

Thanks for this link you provided.Some user still uses the neutral feedback this way, most times if your activities in the forum becomes suspicious or you start doing things you have never done in the forum some might just use it as a note to inform others to keep a close eyes at your account. That's one way to use the neutral feedback.But take note that it can also be used to thank someone or if you ever did something for someone or they did something for you, you can use the neutral feedback to thank them, so you see it's not always about watching or notifying others about your activities. But sometimes you'll see some users using the neutral tag as their personal note while some tagged others with a neutral tag but when you read the comments you'll notice that it has a negative meaning . So as you can see no everyone in the forum knows how to use the trust feedback system correctly so keep that in mind whenever you're about to go through someone's tags.",

These days you can earn a neutral feedback when you are in a disagreement with another user and if they don't like it. I don't think this warrants neutral feedback; although most people have different ways of judging, merely disagreeing with someone's opinion in an argument is not enough for a neutral tag \"What will be the comment of such a tag\"? I guess such could possibly be considered or seen as trust abuse. Unless in a situation where the person who is opposing someone's opinion doesn't have enough facts to prove their own point but rather is gallivanting around some unverified information.",

Is it like a warning or something?Neutral tage can come as a result of breaking some rules; perhaps you can say it's a warning (you said), yea, a warning for the user and also for other members too to avoid being scammed or deceived by the tagged victim.There are some situations where one could formulate a fictional topic just to deceive others, but let's say it's discovered as a lie. In such a case, some DT members can give neutral tags while another DT can still give a Red tag for the same offence. So, most times, tags are based on which DT gives them; some DT can give neutral tags while others will give negative tags, but both tags are just for warning.Also, some neutral tags are not really given when an offence is committed; they could also be given after some successful trade if the member doesn't really want to give a positive tag. Some lenders on the forum will put neutral tags on any members who do take a loan.",

Or if such happens either neutral or red tags is it permanent? Can't it be removed after a couple of days, week or months if not guilty? Like we know someone's rep is at stake.",

Is it like a warning or something?Neutral or negative feedback system that can be given to accounts in this forum. It's all caused by various reasons. Some are in the form of warnings, or clear reasons about an account that has committed fraud or is known to be carrying out account farms and all of these accounts are entered into the same signature or bounty.But not only that, those who can create an account on this forum can be given a neutral or negative stamp. Other examples that I know of, one of which is continuously making spam posts or replies, or continuously making posts that are copy paste from a site or from a platform. Because this violates the rules that apply in this forum, usually accounts with habits like that will get a neutral stamp and if the habit continues to be carried out, they will eventually be given a negative stamp. Maybe there are other things that I don't know about the reasons why users in BTT can be labeled negative or neutral.But the clear and fundamental reason for all of these problems, in essence, accounts that are given a neutral or negative stamp on this forum, is caused by violating the rules and conditions that have been set in this forum. So that's what I know about the reasons for users on the BTT forum, which can be labeled neutral or negative.",

There are some instances where members get a red tag from other members if they think that the users did something that is against the rules or probably accuse of something but if he did redeem himself or the accusation just wasn't true some members will just revise that feedback to neutral. It wasn't some kind of warning like you said I guess the easiest way to describe it is a comment but you could use it as well as a warning some members used a neutral tag as a warning as well as alarming other members to be careful making transactions to this profile something like that. It was also used in lending if you loan to other members they will tag you a neutral tag about the loan and then revise that in the deadline if you're going to pay or not. Neutral usually doesnt have any heavy consequences compared to a red tag, so just make sure to follow the rules to avoid getting a red tag.",
