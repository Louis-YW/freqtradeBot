  "content": "Hello dear bitcoin community,i would like to create a multisig wallet via Electrum and HWW.My questions now would be:1)Do I only need the 3 seeds of the hardware wallet to restore the wallet, or do I also need the master public keys?2)To sign I would then need 2 of 3 of the HWW,but to restore I need all 3 seeds right?Or are 2 out of 3 enough to restore the wallet ?3)Is it also possible to create a 2 of 3 multisig with the Bitcoin Core wallet?Thanks very much.",

      "body": "Generally speaking, for creating a m of n multi-signature wallet, n master public keys are required. For spending fund from the multi-signature wallet, m of seed phrases are also required. Take note that master public keys can be derived from the seed phrases. If you want to create a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet with three seed phrases, no master public key is needed. Because all master public keys are derived from the seed phrases.If you want to create a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet with two seed phrases, you will need 1 master public key as well.If you want to create a 2 of 3 multi-signature wallet with one seed phrase, you will need 2 master public keys as well. (For spending fund from this wallet, the transaction has to be signed by a cosigner as well)",

      "body": "Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on March 04, 2023, 01:47:19 PMWhat exactly is the difference between Electrs and EPS?EPS is focused for single-wallet usage.Electrs can be used with any amount of unrelated wallets. Also can be used by block explorer (if you install one).Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on March 04, 2023, 01:47:19 PMCan Electrs also be privatized?Or does that only work with EPS?I'm not sure what you mean here. I've always user Electrs locally and didn't expose it to the internet, it works very good like that. But I don't know if or where would be the settings Electrs would advertise itself as Electrum Server. However, since I have no port forwarding done for it, I'm not concerned.On the other hand, I've done tests with another server, Fulcrum, and there I had to explicitly disable its announcing to get to same behavior as I have with Electrs.Quote from: Bitcoiner2023 on March 04, 2023, 01:47:19 PMAnd in case of loss or damage, do I have to save seeds and public keys to restore my multisig wallet and move money or are just the seeds enough?In theory the seeds should be enough to re-create the wallet if it's the case.Just imagine: from the seeds you can restore the original 3 wallets. And I guess that from the 3 original wallets the multisig one can also be re-created. I don't see any reason to not be like that, but you can easily try this when you have the devices (or wait until you get answers from somebody who has actually done that).",
