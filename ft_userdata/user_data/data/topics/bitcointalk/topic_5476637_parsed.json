Lots of coins mined but hash is dropping now, your killing your own projecthttps://rheix.com/Algo GhostriderTonight, I'll make a un-official discord unless someone else doesNo need to bother and here is why:Total block mined from now: 4249 @ 150s block time equal approx: 7,4 days so launched approx nov 28th Pool (Rplant) show up nov 30th, 2 days later.What that means? They mined 2 complete days, so about 1100 blocks to load up to be able to create masternode.When they have enough, boom rplant pool, to be sure what normal folks can mine must be impossible to get enough to create masternode (850k).So their own masternode can get all the reward for a good period of time.Still want to mine/buy this shit?",
