      "body": "This is not a question that can just be answered. The client also need to ask the specialist or therapist about what is needed to be done for people that want to undergo hypnosis. According to Oxford, this is what I found about it online:Quotethe induction of a state of consciousness in which a person apparently loses the power of voluntary action and is highly responsive to suggestion or direction. Its use in therapy, typically to recover suppressed memories or to allow modification of behaviour, has been revived but is still controversial.How is the person going to apparently lose power of voluntary action? Through drug or what? Or just through psychotherapy? If drug is involved, how safe it is to health?I have been addicted before in gambling. What I noticed was that I have no way of earning and that makes me to depend on gambling. But gambling thought me lesson to never see gambling as a way of making money.",

      "body": "My first question to myself. How did I end up there? Curing a gambling addiction doesn't need special powers, it's about how someone could control it and be disciplined to stop it eventually. For instance, I did stop smoking which means it's all just in my head. But, there's a root of why I stopped, it's for the kids. I don't like the idea of them always smelling me like I am from the burning fireplace or worst. They are young, second-hand smoke is not good for their health. When it comes to gambling, money is on the line. I would not my kids to be unable to enjoy the perks of being a kid so I don't do much gambling and I always withdraw when I see profits to give them the fun of playing games that need to be paid. We don't really need those type of cure, all we need is discipline and embrace the fact that we are addicted to gambling so we can change it.",

And yes like you said the industry is no doubt very huge and growing more and more every and same as the numbers of addicted gambling so starting up a business to treat this particular illness of addiction will be welcome as a good move to also help the community and also make funds.",

Hypnosis effect usually doesn't have a long duration like amnesia so ypu should not worry about forgetting everything when you go home because that's not how it work. Hypnosis is use as therapy to give a gambling addict a time without thinking gambling since compulsive gambler always think about gambling most of the time. This therapy have a lot of session and having a few hours a day away from gambling will improve someones mind to not focus on gambling and finally get back in-charge on his addicted mind.",

I mean if you are under a professional then there's nothing to be afraid of or something specially if you will be assured that you can be cured through hypnosis and who knows it could really be good for you in the long run.It might controversial for some though, as the hypnotist might put some into your brain and most likely this will be the point of contention for us gamblers or even non gamblers who are thinking of getting under this non conventional method of curing our addiction whether gambling or other vices.",

It's different when you have to fight it out yourself, as compare to some medical professional playing with your brains?The side-effects might be slim and rare, but still though there is that small chance. So if I admitted that I have gambling addictions in the beginning, then maybe there are other methods to control or even stop it without me going into this tool to treat my gambling addiction, just saying.Plus, it could be expensive?",

      "body": "According to the information, hypnosis is one of the most effective way of treating gambling addiction since it tampers one persons mind/memory.  Now I wonder about the longevity of the effect of hypnosis.  So I have a couple of question in mind like, how could it really treat addiction when it tampers a person's brain.  How sure is the process that the injected mood will last.  We all know artificial settings won't function as good as normal ways of treating gambling addiction.  I am also hesitant to undergo hypnosis because of the possible side effects that may affect the way I think.Quote from: Beparanf on May 29, 2023, 04:00:24 PMQuote from: bittraffic on May 29, 2023, 03:55:45 PMYou'll not wanna be unaware of whats going on while waking around the city and back home but you forget gambling I guess thats what would happen.

Hypnosis is use as therapy to give a gambling addict a time without thinking gambling since compulsive gambler always think about gambling most of the time. So this is like putting our mind in sleep mode and insert images artificially in order for the patient to not think about gambling addiction.  I don't know how effective it is when the the effect of hypnosis subsided,  doesn't the victim think of gambling again the moment they come into their senses?Hypnosis is like delaying things and since it is a long therapy,  it really seems effective because the gambler will not think of gambling as long as they are under the effect of hypnosis .  Aside from that, I read that the research on hypnosis is rather small  so I think it needs more research to confirm things.It is obvious that gambling addict who are under hypnosis will not have gambling urges, so I wonder what happen after the effect subsided.  So I'd rather choose other form of treatment than hypnosis.",

You might have this sort of 'treatment' but still be stuck in some sort of depression that caused you to turn to betting, or any number of other reasons. Often if you can just willfully break the cycle for a few weeks, you can overcome whatever problem addiction you have - like smoking for example. People talk about the chemical side but it's often habitual later on the addiction so you need to find other activities that will fill your time instead.",

The most effective one would be for you to realise yourself that gambling is not helping and a need to stop the addiction or to just quit gambling. When a gambler see himself addicted and wants a way out, that means he has discovered that he has to stop which is the first step to stop gambling addiction. But what is most important is the root. I mean what that led to the person to be addicted. If someone is getting bored and using gambling to make use of the time, you can get yourself some other things to do like going out with friends and your girlfriend or your wife. The root of the addiction needs to be solved too.",

It just deals with using pictures and repeating words to alter the interest or focus of an individual. The negative effect of gambling addiction is huge. It has led to financial problems, divorce, crime, and even death. If I am a gambling addict and I consider it a good option, I will gladly submit myself to hypnosis. I have heard also heard that most cult groups use the same means to indoctrinate theirs so that they can be easily manipulated and controlled. Just recently there was a news from Kenya, where people were hypnotized to starve to death because they want to go to heaven. So I will have to do a thorough check on the health facility before I will subject myself to their medical process. I don't want \"jump from frying pan to fire\".",
