But if you are into traditional business, wouls you choose a real real state property or a digital one? Its goes boils down to appetite cause this could be a risky thing too. Its only existing virtually and cant be convertrd into real one. Unless thats the concept of real state nft to buy out property and the nft signify ownership for that and easy buying and selling. Anyway I am watching too how this will play out.",

I am interested in some NFT projects, so I want to find a great p2e game, which will be fascinating and profitable. I have heard about one p2e game few days ago. They have such a good arts and stories, their community grows by the day. I think that this project will succeed. It is called Reptile Chronicles. Have you heard about that?",

You can make money from them indeed but it is weird to compare NFT's with real life assets like apartments, farmland etc. I'd rather own farm lands like Bill Gates than having wurthless NFT's especially now is a good time when the food prices are soaring. Soon a slice of bread will cost a lot more than what it does now and your NFT's are not going to feed you. Investing in food makes more sense in this regard.",

But in fact few people are interested in it from an artistic point of view, most people see it as a speculative component. In the same way Real State NFTs will be perceived. Just another type of NFT tokens, which can be speculated with and profit. There is no other use for these tokens yet, which is why most of them depreciate so quickly.",

But definitely, those that are worth it shall stay and if there's still a value on it from its own community.Those rich folks that don't have anything to spend with would probably invest on this and actually, there are many of them. But for me, I'll go with the typical bitcoin portfolio and have a real estate where I can stay.",

If that is the case, then i don't really see the benefit of managing the ownership of real estates via NFT's instead of doing it via a notary. I don't even know if it is possible to do a real estate trade via an NFT. So far you always needed a notary that would confirm to you that you are now the owner of a real estate which also cost some money but it was needed in order to be the official owner. I don't think that it would be enough to just own the NFT of a real estate to be the official owner of a real estate in the view of he government an the authorities.Therefore i think that first legal issues need to be clarified.",

But as far as blockchain projects goes, yeah, they could benefit from the all those data being written in the blockchain database, so it's very safe and the transaction is going to be very fast as compare to the old and traditional way of buying real state projects. But now entering NFTs? there could be steps to ensure that there will be no scams running those NFTs on the first place. But anyhow, this could also be the start of something big so this could be the next trend but with a lot of challenges.",
