The idea of a scam that depends on the victim copying addresses from their transaction history may seem far-fetched and unlikely to succeed, but people lose money in all kinds of ways. Some people will most likely fall for it if they're careless and stupid enough. I do not think we should give this too much thought. This is not the type of scam that can happen to anyone. As they say, a fool and his money are easily parted.",

The scammers surely have some sort of list of addresses that are actively monitored. When such an address makes a transaction, the address poisoning scam follows soon after. Sometimes just a few seconds after the genuine transaction. It must be an automated service.Quote from: Rikafip on January 13, 2023, 10:59:02 AMAt first this tactic looks incredibly far fetched and not very likely to work as who would copy his own address from transaction history (that never even crossed my mind) but then again when I thought of all the ways people lose money I wouldn't be surprised if some fall for this, no matter how stupid it may seem. A few weeks after this new scheme became known, I read a report that mentioned that $1.5 million had already been scammed that way. It's even more now. Considering that other scams bring in hundreds of millions sometimes, it doesn't sound like a lot. Still, it proves that people are falling for it. It's enough for the scammers to continue looking for new or old victims.",
