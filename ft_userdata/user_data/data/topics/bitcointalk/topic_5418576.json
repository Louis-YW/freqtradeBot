For sure, there are some factors for the insolvency of this company specifically happening on the said platform that may not be true with other crypto miners. However, am just wondering what can happen if most of these miners will be suffering losses and will gradually cease doing business...or is this concern not founded on facts?",

      "body": "Glassnode made an analysis on both bullish and bearish cases in one of their weekly newsletters for October. Everyone can read the full analysis in the source of this summary.One of the bearish cases is on the miners' profitability and the increasing hashrate. It is certainly clear that one of the 2 should occur. Price pump or miner capitulation. However, there is also a third possibility which has already started. Jihan Wu, Changpeng Zhao and Justin Sun offer the cashflow to bail out the miners.The mining industry has been in the spotlight of late, with hashrate and difficulty pushing to new all-time-highs (covered in WoC 40). This acts to increase the cost of BTC production, despite miner revenues per hash falling to all-time lows.The Difficulty Regression Model is an estimated all-in-average cost of production, and is coincident with the spot price of $19.3k at the time of writing. A bearish cross-over was last seen in mid-2018, with a major mining industry capitulation following soon after, and persisting for several months.Indeed, the mining Hash Price has reached all-time-lows this week, with miners earning just $66.5k/day per Exahash applied. With Hash Price now falling below the post 2020 halving lows, despite coin prices being ~2x, this demonstrates just how extreme the recent increase in hashrate competition has become.Overall, the Bitcoin demand side, as measured by on-chain activity and network participation, is lacklustre to say the least. There are some green shoots of hope in the mempool, however there remains a $1.5B overhang of coins held by the mining cohort, whom are in extremely distressed territory.A deleveraging event of miners may lead to distribution into thin orderbooks (WoC 42), historically light demand, and persistent macroeconomic uncertainty and liquidity constraints.Source https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-43-2022/",

It very resilient and anti-fragile system. A mining farm going bust somewhere does not affect it in anyway. Difficulty will adjust if the company stops mining, and the remaining miners will earn more Bitcoin.I hope this actually discourages huge mining farms and encourage mining pools instead which improve decentralization. Small or medium scale miners from all over the world (esp in cold regions) pooling together resources to mine, earn and share rewards is better. One of the main reasons it is better is that they can use the miners to heat their home during winter or for other multiple uses while mining Bitcoin. That should help them remain profitable when bitcoin isn't high enough for them to sell.Proof of Work mining is part of what makes Bitcoin very secure.",
