Kennedy Jr. held a Health Policy Roundtable featuring a panel of health freedom advocates, including yours truly; my good friend Dr. Patrick Gentempo; Maureen McDonnell, a holistic pediatric nurse; Dr. Pierre Kory, cofounder of the Frontline COVID Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC); filmmaker Mikki Willis; Sayer Ji, founder of Greenmed.com; and Dr. Sherri Tenpenny.Opening StatementsThe event was hosted by Mary Holland, former president and general counsel for Children’s Health Defense (CHD), an organization founded by Kennedy. She’s currently on a leave of absence from the CHD to work on Kennedy’s presidential campaign.“I’m on the campaign in large part because of Mr. Kennedy’s strong stance to protect freedom, including health freedom, and to protect fundamental human rights,” Holland said in her opening statement.“Many of you watching are key supporters of the health freedom movement, and you’re familiar with a lot of the things Mr. Kennedy has been talking about over the years — about agency capture, corporate greed, corruption, pharmaceutical and medical harm, and abuse of government power, especially during COVID … and most of you agree that the U.S. healthcare system needs deep reform, which is our subject tonight.”...",
