I guess that was the downfall of terra because that was also the time wherein sources of profit in forms of p2e and nfts, also started to struggle. After that, we've seen more projects which had problems prolonging their platform in this industry  But I am not trying to blame everything from what he's done. The market is just that uncertain and many things could take place in an instant for both positice and negative situations. Maybe, it is a factor that many projects became alarming to the investors, which yield to low overall activity in this industry. Whether it would be able to recover or not, depends solely with the things which would take place for next year.",

WHERE GOOD NEWS in this list?!I think the biggest crypto news of 2022 was this:\"BIS Allows Banks to Hold 2% Of Their Reserves in Cryptocurrencies\"https://www.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/bis-allows-banks-to-hold-2-of-their-reserves-in-cryptocurrencies-2966647I think its more money than whole crypto capitalization. Why no one talks about it? Oh because we are in bear market and collapse of shitty altcoin is more important  Bitcoin is now an official reserve asset of banks!",

I didn't know that \"market impact\" is part of the guilt assessment in court. Because its not! And market impact from single event is hard to estimate because there were many other bearish events that were triggered one after another. Such as braking major support lines, braking trend lines etc. Bitcoin was far less oversold and in far worse technical situation when luna collapsed compared to FTX going bust. It would be different if FTX crash first and than luna after months.But the biggest difference is that Sam stole funds from his users on purpose, while Do-Kwon made a start-up based on innovative technology that failed.People affected by Do-Kwon knew about risks. All risks were in open source code. We f.ed up investing in something that should not work.People affected by Sam were scammed, lied and robbed.Thats the difference. No one should compare it based on market impact. Being rude doesn't mean you are more guilty.",

There are too many events that quickly change the market condition which means there are too many weak hands in the market pretending real investors. People are easily getting FUD and panic, but at least with these events people learned from their mistakes and have an awareness of how to protect their assets. Now people learned what is noncustodial wallets.",

Second bigger tragedy about FTX as two highest exchange market have been collapse and many people loss their fund after withdrawing problem close, actually FTT coins as part from FTX exchange have going dump almost the same with Luna coin.Another fake promised with Mt.Gox exchange market never refunding with their user Bitcoin assets, having rumor they will refund all Bitcoin assets to their user trough August 2022 until end this year never have planning to refund their member Bitcoin assets.",

All of this began much earlier than the Terra events.

If Do-Kwon was just an innovator that failed, can you explain why Interpol issued a red notice for him then?And when Do-Kwon was warned about unsustainable interest rate and collapse but chose not to take perfectly valid critique seriously, making him well aware in my book that ust would crash and burn when conditions were right.",

If not for Terra events, the price dump would have been caused by other events, such as bankruptcies of major crypto services. It was all long overdue and would have happened anyway. Terra only accelerated what was in store for the market, I think. In my opinion, FTX, not Terra, was the biggest blow to the industry, and it was not in terms of how much bitcoin dropped.",

I somehow agreed with your statements, terra is like the main cause the valuation of many cryptocurrencies goes down so significantly, I wonder if ftx is actually a chain result of luna collapsing and if luna weren't collapsing would they still spare, even though cryptocurrencies still have the chance of recovering back I think we're already far off from the ath even if there's massive bullrun big fat chance we could hardly surpass the previous ath and just settle with recovering back the value. honestly, the chain effect caused by the collapses of these big platforms are massive, there are so many new coins that failed and just outright gets abandoned, I think big platform nowadays should really take care of their internals.",
