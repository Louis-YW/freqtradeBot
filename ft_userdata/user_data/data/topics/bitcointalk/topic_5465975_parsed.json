  "content": "Recently I came across an article that celebrated the Indian stock market's performance. It seems the Indian stock market has delivered a 10.9% return, which is higher than the US & China. It is great news that the Indian economy is shining and growth has been straight upward in the last decade. As an Indian, it makes me proud when I recall where we were in 2013 to where we are now in 2023. Within that emotional outburst of pride in my mind, a strange question popped up, which was to compare the ROI both from Bitcoin and the Stock Market.Let's do the math for the Indian Stock Market. If you had invested $100 ten years back with an ROI of 10.9%, your money would have become $235 approximately by now. Not bad considering not many bank FDs or mutual funds are able to generate such an ROI.Now, let's do the math for Bitcoin. Again, the investment amount in this case would be $100. In August of 2013, the average price of Bitcoin was $135. Considering the price, you would have bought 0.74 Bitcoin. In August of 2023, the average price of Bitcoin was $27,297, which would result in your $100 investment growing to $20,200 ten years later. That is a 201 times return on your initial investment of $100 or, in simple words, a 20100% return.Think again - which is better, Bitcoin or the Stock Market? If you are someone with diamond hands, then Bitcoin is the right investment. The potential for enormous growth and returns far exceeds traditional investments.",

      "body": "Traditional forms of investment cannot give such returns in the long term. I remember my father always encouraging me to invest in property and for the long-term gain and tax benefits. In a decade's time, a property cannot give 200x returns like Bitcoin has done. There are people who would say that Bitcoin was cheaper in 2013 and it is not possible to make that purchase of 1 Bitcoin. Yes, I agree it was cheap in 2013 it is still cheap in 2023 as there will be a time when the price might go beyond 100k. A small invest now can give you the same kind of ROI in the next 10 years.",

We all very well know that stock markets pricing atleast in a longer term has been based on prices derived directly through performance and earnings of companies which too have grown at a very similar scale, while Crypto markets run has been more on hype so far, the projects even though have been launched but nowhere can we see the real word value addition that they have delivered of such amounts. Also it's like comparing a highly risky investment with a relatively very low risky investment. Obviously with change of risk the returns changes by too much. Lastly a very big point is, you are comparing the market indicies returns with bitcoin return, compare it with an individual share like Bajaj finance, which too has been insane.",

We cannot wait for regulation when we don't know what will be in it. In the meantime we can share with someone in our family our wallets private key. Life is unpredictable, if anything happens to us our family will have access to the Bitcoin or crypto in our wallet. It is not that Bitcoin cannot be inherited in our Indian society. We do share have a joint bank account with our partner why not have a multisig wallet with them. Keep your Satoshis in that wallet and pass on the information to your kids.

At first, I thought bitcoin and crypto was a scam based on their views. When I wanted to open stock trading accounts but didn’t have the required documents, I started researching cryptocurrency. I thought KYC was easier with cryptocurrency. To my amazement, crypto wasn’t as shady as some people said. And now i invest in both. I invest small amount which is non taxable.",

I beg to differ here. Returns from stocks can be as high as 60% over the years, I am talking from my own experience but if you get trapped by the brokers' words and buy shit-shares, you will end up in 20% loss, that too done in the long term, short term is even more risky. Crypto is always more risky on the day but safer on the long. Having the hang of both, I dont compare them much but can only see their good.QuoteI don't think opening demat account doesn't need much intense KYC, just Aadhaar card and video call verification is enough, and you can open via banking apps with nothing and just paying the subscription fee.

Having the hang of both, I dont compare them much but can only see their good.Most cryptocurrencies, especially altcoins, can be very risky and might drop by 99% in the long run. maybe, some crypto with good projects could be a smart investment for short term like 1-2 years.Quote from: TheUltraElite on October 28, 2023, 11:59:43 AMQuoteI don't think opening demat account doesn't need much intense KYC, just Aadhaar card and video call verification is enough, and you can open via banking apps with nothing and just paying the subscription fee. It not an issue at all. Its a personal choice of whether they are willing to undergo KYC or not.I didn't have my Aadhaar card linked to my mobile number, which was needed to open a demat account and receive the OTP. Now I have my Aadhaar linked with mobile number and can invest in stocks too.",

I beg to differ here. Returns from stocks can be as high as 60% over the years, I am talking from my own experience but if you get trapped by the brokers' words and buy shit-shares, you will end up in 20% loss, that too done in the long term, short term is even more risky. Crypto is always more risky on the day but safer on the long. Having the hang of both, I dont compare them much but can only see their good.If we are talking about Individual company's shares then the returns you mentioned is possible but what I said is an average.Let's compare two renowned company shares here, ITC and Tata Motors.ITC's growth in the last 1-year time frame is around 24% but if we see its 5-year growth then it's 53% so on an average it's growing 10%While Tata Motors share growth in 1-year time frame is 55% and 5 year growth 236%.So if we are good enough to pick the companies which is good reputation and potential to grow then high returns is possible. But these returns are nowhere near when it comes to Bitcoin that is probably why younger generation choose to pick bitcoin and other cryptos.",
