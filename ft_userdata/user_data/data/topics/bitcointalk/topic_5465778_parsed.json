Most of the casinos require some kind of KYC these days and I'm quite sure that no good casino is allowing members to get withdrawals of good amounts without completing the KYC details.It's a policy from those casinos and if they asked you about KYC details then you'll have to provide those details to them and once they get those details then they will verify your account and release your funds. It's really something against a user's privacy but we can't do anything because it's now a days in terms and conditions of almost every trusted casino. If you really want to access your account once again and withdraw your funds from their platform then you must have to send them those KYC requirements.",

You can't just reason out that because that time 6 years ago there was no KYC needed and the policy today doesn't apply to you. The Policy is for all. Old and new users will be asked. Too late to withdraw little by little since you already did it.  Withdrawing funds little by little within their minimum withdrawal threshold I guess they won't be asking it.",

I don't mess with that site, but like others have said it's becoming the norm for sites to do kyc these days. It's your responsibility to keep up with a sites rules or their ToS. If they are about to implement kyc to users, you should have withdrawn or spoke with the owners and see if they will let you slide. The site isn't targeting you to keep your funds. I dont agree with kyc either and try to avoid sites that implement it.",

Knowing fully well that you have such an amount of asset there what you should have done is to make sure your account is up to date because that asset is not worth that risk of losing them as casinos are also looking for funds to do away with. It is unfortunate his has happened unless a reputable member could help you out in reaching out to the casino to give the benefit of doubt in proving your real identity so as to access you assets.How come you have been here for this long time and you have no been active in contribution in any ways but just a spectator observing activities and events.",

Well, it's okay to provide a picture of passport or ID with a note in hand and some small details like email but why should you share an utility bill with your name and address on it and why should you share bank statement? And they usually ask for 6 months bank statement. I mean, the casino is registered in Curacao and I have no idea who actually manages it and where do they actually operate, how can I give them such a sensitive information when no one is responsible for leaking of my data? And we all know how often they leak or sell our data. I'm not saying it directly about crypto.games but it's just a regular situation in this sector and it needs to be changed!Hope they will explain in details what's the reason of asking you for KYC documents.",

If you don't agree to their KYC terms, the only active option you have in your account is the withdrawal button. I think casinos should adopt this too instead of this endless rope pulling.This is a valid argument and definitely something we should discuss more. We have seen numerous cases of casino operators changing their terms of service 'on the fly,' transitioning from No-KYC to Full KYC, disregarding the fact that these were not the terms under which users initially entered into a relationship with them. At the very least, casino operators should allow users to withdraw funds from their accounts before imposing the full KYC verification requirement. This would provide users with a fair opportunity to access their existing balances without being subjected to sudden and unexpected demands for personal information. Users who initially joined the platform under different conditions should not be trapped in a situation where they cannot access their funds.The thing is, some platforms are all about making a quick buck and raking in short-term profits. They don't seem to realize that their shady actions could seriously mess up their rep in the long haul within the community. I've been thinking, maybe it's about time we put together a list of those platforms that, well, they're not exactly scams, but they're not too far off either. You know, the ones that don't play fair and don't care about ethics, but only care about their own pockets.",

This is the normal thing casinos and exchanges do so as to be on the safe side by alerting their clients to update but if the reverse is the case then OP should have known that it is not safe to have left such amount of asset on his account with the casino. It is generally known here that  asset(s) not under your custody is not your own and as such should have be withdrawn with immediate effect. Well, since you have a large followership  or invited referrals under registered with them, I think they would definitely look into it as loyal fan and give you a soft landing.KYC was introduced as a feature that allowed user to claim \"VIP Birthday Cash\"  & \"Faster Betting Speed\"Even as of today, KYC is not mandatory (only when requested).And you're requested to complete it. Is it that hard to understand?OP if they had requested that you do your KYC it is easy to understand and as simple as ABC do your KYC and wait for their response. If they fail to release your assets to you then it looks fishy on their side but for the now you are requested to do the needful so as to have access to your funds. You should know that in the first place that at any point in time casino or exchanges would definitely request for your details so as to process your funds or whatever the case maybe. If you are conversant with most casinos term and conditions when it comes to clients or customers KYC and withdrawal, they state it clear that they have the sole right to demand for KYC if the need arises so in that case you should have known that irrespective of the fact that you are an old member with them. It is very simple for you to understand mate.",
