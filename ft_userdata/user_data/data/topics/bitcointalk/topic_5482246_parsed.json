  "content": "With the current rate of inflation in our individual countries, many people see it that there is a better future in investing and holding Bitcoin for a long period of time. Many see it as a breakthrough out of poverty while some see it as a way of storing value. However, in as much as we love comfortability, convenience in our daily lives there are individuals who will rather choose to forgo short term pleasure like luxury purchases, expensive outings, Unfurnished apartments all for the sake of acquiring a lot of Bitcoin in their portfolio. They are determined and dedicated to believe in the long term benefit of Bitcoin while making personal sacrifices to secure their future. Based on their commitment to keep to their decision it makes me ask myself how do this set of person go about their daily lives when they know they can afford those things they see around? Do you think this is a strategy to accumulate Bitcoin faster because of the volatile nature of Bitcoin? Lastly have anyone come across any individual who will deny his comfort for Bitcoin and what do you think are their motivations?",

While investing in Bitcoin, it's necessary to save some emergency funds and at least be in a comfortable state so that there is no discomfort or distress that can cause them to sell off their Bitcoin early.If an individual actually has enough money (very rich) or less money (not too rich), spending on their needs and things that give them comfort should not be a problem. For someone to invest in Bitcoin, they don't need to invest all their money in it; at least investing based on their budget and their pocket size will be more favorable for them.",

But if you're alone, I guess that makes sense and easier to do because you don't need to think of any family member that will be sacrificed the status of life because of your goal to invest in Bitcoin. That's why for the singles out there, if you are able to buy Bitcoin and you include that to your expenditures every time you receive your paycheck then you have to keep on doing that. Because you'll never know how tight it is going to be when you're with a partner already or when you become a family guy.",

Of course, Bitcoin cannot currently be easily used for real-life transactions such as buying cigarettes or eating at a food stall. I don't think it's possible to pay for small purchases using Bitcoin because transaction fees also need to be taken into consideration. The continuously fluctuating price of Bitcoin is the beauty of investing, when the market is experiencing a decline it can be an opportunity to consider a long-term investment strategy by increasing the amount of investment without any worries and speculation among traders and investors.",

I don't want to do like the ERE (Early Retirement Extreme) people, who live a shitty life, skimping as much as possible, even on basic things like food and other things that can affect their health, so that in a hypothetical future they can retire. The best years to enjoy are when you are young. If you spend too much time saving, you might die and not have enjoyed anything, or when you are old enough to retire you are in poor physical condition. That's why I think there needs to be a balance between saving (and investing) for the future and enjoying the present.",

I even have some projects I should have embarked upon starting last year, but because of the investment opportunity coming from cryptocurrency, I paused. I believe this will help me faster if I invest more money in cryptocurrency, and is not new to people as well.But I will never live a nonsense kind of life because of Bitcoin and others. What if it fails?QuoteDo you think this is a strategy to accumulate Bitcoin faster because of the volatile nature of Bitcoin?Of course, more money committed to investment means more money to be gained from it, which is why people deprive themselves temporarily and also hope it works as planned.QuoteLastly have anyone come across any individual who will deny his comfort for Bitcoin and what do you think are their motivations?Yes, I have seen and that includes me, but not to the level of living like a pauper in the name of crypto investment. I follow the rule of investment that advice to invest only the money you can afford to lose. Though I do more as I have enough in crypto, but it is not affecting my living negatively whatsoever.",

Reducing what you spend on can make more money available to spend on investing in bitcoins. But when reducing your expenses, do not remove important needs from what you need to spend money on because you are trying to save money to invest in bitcoins. See a doctor when you need to, dress and eat well. If you neglect yourself good healthcare after you have denied yourself some comfort, if you fall sick, you may die and leave all your bitcoins lost if you did not plan a way to pass it on to someone. Take care of yourself as you try to invest.",

      "body": "Like some sort of pushing things just to invest? Well yes, it is a good idea but never expect anything less than struggle. The reason why it would be best to invest an extra money is for daily necessities. Imagine being able to invest in Bitcoin but suddenly needing money for food or hospital expenses. You need to have a 'margin' on the amount you are planning to invest and amount you will be needing to live. Let's say you were able to put a huge amount in your wallet from this industry then you happened to have an emergency or that you will be needing urgent money. This is, I believe, the most common instance an investor is pulling out his assets which sometimes result to complete loss because the chance of earning profit from holding was also cut  by that time. So what's the right thing? Save and invest. It would be much better in the long run to only do things properly. If you will go all in to an asset you'd be always at the edge which will for sure make you uncomfortable and probably not a good investment outcome or journey.",
