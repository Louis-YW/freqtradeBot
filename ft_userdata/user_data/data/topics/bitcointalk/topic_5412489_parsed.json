  "content": "There is a huge ‼️possibility of a repeat of BOND's summer success before the end of September. - The RSI of the token has been in an uptrend since July 14, as is the MFI. - Network activity levels on Santiment revealed an increase in token activity on the network along with its price. - The indicator of unique addresses used to make transactions with BOND in the period under review also increased by 51%. - The growth of new addresses in the network for the period under review increased by more than 800%. - Since July 15, the average age of investments in dollars according to BOND (MDIA) began to decrease. ⚡️‼️All indications are that BOND is starting to pick up speed. Based on previous experience, it can get up to $35-40 per token by the end of Septemberhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l72V_mTpvow",

      "body": "The coin had a good accumulation zone this summer, which has already profited everyone who bought at that time. At this point, almost all of the coin's supply is circulating. $35 is a good price, but that probably won't happen in late September and is unlikely to happen at all this year. Where is a 7x increase in the coin even supposed to happen from? At the expense of what? Because that's what TA is showing? As of today, the situation in the crypto market is very bad, inflation continues to rise, unemployment continues to rise. Obviously, the market doesn't have enough liquidity to push prices up and that situation isn't going to change anytime soon.",

Bond ha strong potential to show once again big pump like it does previously. It is good to buy some and wait for rise. It can give more profit then lunc",

Although these were completely different domains and in different zones.Right, but sometimes we look at the people who shill for a project, and if someone see that he has a negative feedback, it might impacted the project that he wanted to project.But I do agree that we should do our due diligence and analyze those projects because afterall, it's our own money that we are going to invest here. And with that, I can't say that this project is good or ripe for a bull run.",
