The reason you give is actually the most important, as the base of cryptocurrency, bitcoin which is also the largest or biggest cryptocurrency coin base on market cap and adoption rate, many of these Alticoins are tied to it. The most important that after halving period that move up the market is news that surrounds the market and as such if a positive news is released about bitcoin it affects other Alticoins because most of Alticoin investors believes that should bitcoin survive then they have an opportunity to also survive and as such they accumulate these Alticoins as positive news touches bitcoin. Also also Alticoins on most exchanges are paired with bitcoin and need to purchase it first before they can actually swap them to their preferred Alticoins.",

      "body": "I will try to answer it in short because the list of factors is long like: the first one is everyone in the market has different opinions  and ideology of BTC and ALTs. They think of BTC as the king while the ALTs as Minister. Whenever the price of BTC will increase it means the sentiments of market will change. For example if people have invested in BTC when the price was around $25k then the dominance of BTC will increase which put 6 or 7 different possibilities on the last like if high BTC (d) means lower prices of ALTs, etc.So, when the BTC . D will be high the last might be lower and when the price of BTC will high holders and traders will try to book profit and dominance might decrease and once it will decrease the price could increase. So the sentiments of market and Profit/loss ratio also depends. Sometimes, investors are looking for opportunities that could earn them huge profits amid the high risk included so they do for ALTs instead of BTC. Which means BTC was not their first choice due to less volatility and ALTs was their first choice which ill increase the ALTs dominance this te prices of ALTs will increase.",

Most centralized and decentralised exchange had Bitcoin as the base asset in a trading pair. Asset prices would be calculated in sats or BTC. If BTC is at 30K and the price of ETH/BTC was 0.01 BTC (300 USD) an increase in Bitcoin price from 30K to 40K means the price of ETH/BTC will now be 400 USD minus it moving even from 0.01 BTCThe same applies if the Bitcoin price drops. Today, there are many stablecoin trading pairs, but the altcoin-Bitcoin trading pairs still exist and with Bitcooin's dominance, it will affect other coin prices when it moves.",

Marketcap and trading volume of Bitcoin is very high. Its domination is high too, you can see the Major Cryptoassets By Percentage of Total Market Capitalization (Bitcoin Dominance Chart).In this world, will people look at biggest economic country, the USA. or small countries like El Salvador when they need to get signals for the global economic growth or recession?They will look at GDP of the USA. not El Salvador.https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?most_recent_value_desc=trueIn cryptocurrency market, when they need to get similar signals, they will look at a biggest cryptocurrency Bitcoin.",

Again most of these other crypto currencies are always priced against Bitcoin...what I mean is that they're measured in BTC....just like BTC is the measuring instrument of this other currencies...this is one among many reasons why they tend to fluctuate as Bitcoin price also fluctuatesSummarily, Bitcoin is a measuring instrument of the other cryptocurrencies!",

      "body": "There are a couple of reasons. For starters people are usually introduced to bitcoin first and then find out about altcoins, or even if it is the other way around (eg. finding out about shittokens like NFTs) they eventually realize that the only viable cryptocurrency that is actually offering utilities is bitcoin so they all eventually end up wanting to own bitcoin.As people start accumulating bitcoin, some of them will start thinking about ways to increase their \"wealth\". That means investing the bitcoins they already have and one of the options is by entering the market to start trading bitcoin/fiat or bitcoin/altcoin pairs and to make profit.This means each time bitcoin price is not making big moves these traders tend to move to altcoin market and trade them more. Which is why we see more pump and dumps in the altcoin market during stable periods (even short ones) and we see altcoins get dumped each time bitcoin starts making a big move up or down. This is because people dump their altcoins to rush back to the bitcoin market.",

Yes, it's true if you look at the USD exchange rate. But if it's exchange rate among crypto it can stay the sameLet's try to simulate a bit1btc = 100 eth 1btc = 1000 usd1eth = 100 usdIf the price of BTC increases 2x against the dollar1btc = 100 eth1btc = 2000 usd1eth = 200 usdIf you look at the simulation above, the price of btc to eth remains the same. But because the demand for btc is high, the price goes up, so indirectly the price of eth also goes up.Maybe there is so little explanation, so when the price of bitcoin goes up like crazy and touches ath, then indirectly almost all altcoin prices will also go up, especially altcoins that have btc pairs on the crypto exchange.",

      "body": "The largest of all cryptocurrencies, think of Bitcoin as the big brother. The innovator, the king of the hill, if you will, is the one who started it all. Its younger brothers, the altcoins, take after Bitcoin in terms of behaviour. Since they hold Bitcoin in high regard, when Bitcoin succeeds, they take inspiration from it and do likewise. They sense the pessimism when Bitcoin declines and follow that path as well.What causes Bitcoin to fluctuate, then? Supply and demand is an elementary economics principle. 21 million Bitcoins are the maximum number that can ever exist. The supply component is that. However, demand increases as more people become aware of Bitcoin and desire to own some of it. Also, prices rise as demand outpaces supply. Value decreases when there is a decrease in demand or when fear sets in.So thats a brief summary of the link between Bitcoin and altcoins as well as the impact of supply and demand on Bitcoin's price. There are ups and downs, but its always enjoyable to watch a reality TV show!",

Even there are decentralized exchanges that don't have bitcoin on its pair because they're based with ERC20, BEP20/BSC and other altcoin networks, still bitcoin plays a part with those.
