  "content": "Does Binance (or any other broker) store the same coin on different networks, when deposited via different networks?Example:I send 10 USDT from broker X to Binance via the Tron networkI send 10 USDT from broker Y to Binance via the Ethereum networkThe balance on Binance is 20 USDT. I am able to withraw the complete amount via one or the other network is seems.Yet where do the coins actually reside on Binance? I imagine 10 USDT on an ETH wallet and 10 on a Tron wallet?If so, what happens if the Tron network is compromised (e.g. hack or dump), do I lose half of my funds?As far as I know I cannot see on binance that my USDT coins are devided amongst different addresses/networks.",

But Coinmeistah is very right that you can not see the coins separately on the centralized exchanges and you can be able to withdraw to any other network available for withdrawal on the exchange. What Coinmeistah mean is that if you deposit USDT on Tron network, the same amount of USDT on Tron network should be seen separately from other USDT on another network, but that is not how it works on exchanges, the total balance deposited would be seen in all networks of USDT that was deposited. That is how it is also on Binance on the spot wallet.",

Just as @_act_ said it isn't real token just some figure that let you know your current balance. And when you want to withdraw your 28 usdt from Binance it gives you an option to select your preferred network.But even after you're done with your withdrawal and you're received your token in your wallet, if you still go to a Blockchain explorer to scan your Binance deposit address (0x07a277*****) you'll still see that everything is still there the same way you sent them (in different networks).",

But in history you can see the transaction link so you know it will be coming from tron, eth or whatever network as long as it supported by binance.",

You as user do not really have an insight in this (although you can check some historical data). You can use block explorers to work out where your funds went too. You just need to put in the address you sent funds from and keep clicking until you get to the exchanges address (often one that holds a lot of funds but sometimes one that has lots of inputs and outputs - like a wallet that's actively processing deposits and withdrawals).

So if popularity would impact risk in a positive way, this is a good thing.The security of usdt and tron gets tested quite a lot by its existence on defi platforms (like exchanges/liquidity pools). If it were insecure, it wouldn't have lasted this long. If it didn't have a full reserve it probably would have though as people will mostly assume it's 1:1 and an attacker probably wouldn't have enough money to compete with usdt's fund even if they only had a few % of a reserve (some coins have taken 20% to reach their peg with bad liquidity).

Most actual coins don't suffer as many of these losses as they provide more basic functions (like bitcoin and ethereum).",

The Terra UST case is a case where an exploit of the main network protocol caused the coin to lose value, and that also impacted UST derivative tokens on other networks.Security from theft, hacking is different in each centralized service. As already explained above me, they mostly have \"cold storage\" for a large number of customer assets and implement a SAFU system.",
