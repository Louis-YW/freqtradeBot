  "content": "Bitcoin miner profits get squeezed as hash price drops to lowest since October 2023https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-miner-profits-squeeze-hash-price-drops-lowest-since-october-2023The article is from two days ago but in meantime I see that charts put the income at record lows, I don't have access to cryptoquant premium charts but this one:https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-mining_profitability.html#6mWhat are the implications for this, are home miners going to get wiped out by huge companies that have access to investors capital and cheap electricity? Would that be a danger to centralization? Or are miners going to try and manipulate the fees and the mempool creating fake scarcity of space and driving the fees up to compensate for what they have lost?Can they even do that as I saw people in the mining section saying ?Note:I'm no miner, I just a long time played with GPU mining, what 'm trying to see if there is hope for cheaper fees on the horizon and what could make things worse or better.Sorry for the avalanche of questions!",

A lot of people have stopped transacting through Bitcoin because of exorbitant transaction fees. If Bitcoin wants to survive as a cryptocurrency and remain competitive, the transaction fees must come down. Wiping out of these nonsense tokens will be a great help.",

Bitcoin miners have their income not only from Bitcoin block subsidy but also from Bitcoin transaction fee.Bitcoin transaction fee does not depend on halving and Block subsidy, it depends on demands of people and capacity of mempools to handle transactions. If people have big demand and can not wait, they will spend higher fee for miners to confirm transactions.Another conspiracy theory, did some guys want to do Runes mints massively, to help Bitcoin miners get better transaction fees during waiting time for price to soar?",

Bitcoin miners have their income not only from Bitcoin block subsidy but also from Bitcoin transaction fee.How is it a conspiracy theory when it has happened some months every other time halving has taken place historically?In the lastest block, Subsidy + fees = ‎3.491 BTC ~ $220,549. That can easily turn into $440K when the Bitcoin price doubles, as it usually does during the bull run.Before the halving, Subsidy + fees were averaging between 6.5 to 7 BTC per block. Tell me how much that was in fiat value when BTC was around $20K - 30K?You can't deny that the bitcoin price uptrend also helps so much. That's why bear markets are a nightmare to miners.",

Weak miners will have to shut down their ASICs, stop mining, sale off their ASICs to stronger and bigger miners.",

Those who were mining bitcoin back then may have switched to another coin (LTC, ETH) and could have built their fortune on those said coins. The ones who remained in bitcoin are those who have substantially-sized farms to begin with, and have been expanding ever since due to their ability to take the hit in price drops.Snall and mid-sized miners will no longer be profitable with the current market. They either need to buy more equipment, point their hashes toward another low diff coin, or sell everything and just call it quits in order to not be on the losing side of mining.",

Everyone of them have their challenges when it comes to mining there are times that things work out in their favour and they earn from what they have as reward, while the one they realized also from transaction fees also have helped many of them to also meet up to their target on income and beyond, and now that the whole thing has been slashed down, they will have to bear it and cover up till things go as usual.Quote from: The Hidebehinder on April 26, 2024, 01:09:37 PMWould that be a danger to centralization?

So why do fees continue to increase and show no signs of decreasing? Just like many years ago, mining bitcoin is not too difficult and most people can participate in mining with a moderate amount of capital. But until now mining has been reserved only for wealthy investors, mining has become an expensive game. I also wouldn't be surprised that bitcoin will gradually become a game only for those with a lot of money in the coming years.
