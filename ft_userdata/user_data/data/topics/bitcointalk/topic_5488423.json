All my crypto holdings is just for my investment venture outside my business.I established my business through taking profit on previous bull run. I mention this because some newbie might be inspired of having their own business using crypto profit and use the profit later on for crypto investment instead of investing purely on Bitcoin without any consistent source of income aside from your job. Right now, I’m employed on my own business which gives me a lot of freedom to do what I like while still invested on Bitcoin.",

With fiat currency, it does not degeg to itself.If you worry about decreasing purchasing power of your national fiat currency, take profit and convert it to US. dollar.",

Right now, I am keeping an open mind and remaining fluid. I honestly do not have a meticulously crafted plan for what lies beyond this bull run. Instead, I have chosen to be patient and watch how the events unfold without jumping into any premature planning. I know that there are opportunities that may arise in the future as a result of the bull run, therefore, I am taking this time to position and adapt myself to seize them when they arise.",

In fact, let me just address you to be a responsible man who foresees the future and plans not only ahead of it but considering the welfares of his generation to come.That's a long term goal investor speaking in you but this is only possible to come through when you've enough of side hustles to provide your daily life needs and also your ability to be concious on your financial expenditures.I also hope you'd breed your children up so that they follows yours ways maybe do better than you do. Indeed I love your diplomatic investment scheme. All the best to us all who thinks responsibly with the fear of downfalls against the future.",

Like the majority, I'd sell some into stable coins and will wait for the dip again, but I guess that dip is going to be big where I can accumulate back those sold BTCs that I do. That's the cycle that many are doing and even the big institutions that have joined the market, they've got their own prices to sell and that's why if you're going to miss the time of selling, it's okay but you have to wait again for a couple of years to see the bull run again.What I just like this time is it seems that we've been gone through the years so fast.

If the current price is the momentum that is being waited for then I will sell then wait for a slight decline to re-accumulate purchases. I think most people do that when the price of Bitcoin exceeds its highest price because this is the moment they have been waiting for. Save the profits you earn before accumulating buybacks and I will not change profits on altcoins because I don't think it's appropriate.The plan you have implemented is good and quite useful for people, especially in the area where you live, there are many poor people. But one thing you have to remember is that you don't need to invest all the money you have because we need spare money for other needs.
