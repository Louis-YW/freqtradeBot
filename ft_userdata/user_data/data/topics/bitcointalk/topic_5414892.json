  "content": "Strange request, but I'm blind and the bitcoin testnet faucets out there an're texactly accessible.  I managed to get 0.0001 testnet coins, but that's not enough for what I'm doing, which is alot.Does anyone by chance have some extra testnet coins on hand they can spare?  If yes and if possible, can you fire them off to: tb1qnd8uvmrvqxuhxhhucpj8yz92wugq88f4r0xqrj  Would be greatly appreciated.  Don't have anything to offer except for spending hundreds of hours in helping expand the bitcoin eco-system.Best,Matt",
