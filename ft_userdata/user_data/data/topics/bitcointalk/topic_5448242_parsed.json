      "body": "Thank you, and it is good that MetaMask has prevented users from accessing this scam domain. As you can see, the difference lies in the domain name and the post-dot for both domains, but few people notice that. Scammers always intend to make the interface of their scam site somewhat similar to the official domain of the project, so if the person is hasty and someone sends him the fake domain for the Syscoin project, then this person will inevitably not notice the difference until it is too late, so be careful in making decisions and not rushing and not connecting the main wallet in something that it deems suspicious and these tips will be most useful.Also, it is good that we report this domain so that it is suspended.",

Thanks OP for sharing with this. i hope no one fall victim because website was new and easily traceable as a scam by Metamask. Quote from: Baofeng on April 10, 2023, 10:00:58 AMWebsite: Code:https://syscoin.live/Archive: https://archive.is/wiUAAIt will ask to connect your wallet, so please don't do it, otherwise if will drain your wallet right away.If you connected your Metamask your entire fund will be taken by the hacker. These scammers are using advance bots for this purpose which automatically make a popup to your Metamask and automatic trace fund in your wallet. The amount of fee will be same to your fund balance and if you approve, Nothing can be done after that. Always be careful and read full especially amount of fee before approving Metamask funds.",

Only God knows how many have already fall victim of that fake website phishing and secondly the Swift response to reporting the site from members here was wonderful as it was done with utmost effect to further stall people's wallet from being hacked and funds stolen.@Baofeng you did a good job by making available the report form so members could see it and making report immediately when ever any fake phishing website is spotted.
