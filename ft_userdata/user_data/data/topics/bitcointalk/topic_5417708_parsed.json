      "body": "First off, welcome to the forum. Second, If your post is genuine then thanks for trying to kick it off with a giveaway.  Third, NO ONE will send you any of that information without first proving yourself with months, if not years of participation. Often any newbie would be subject to using a escrow account for any transaction. If you truly do want to practice sending and receiving BTC I would encourage you to find a different outlet for that. I suggest you continue posting and learning the ways of the forum. This process takes time to earn trust. Overall just try and be less creepy and suspicious. Other than that welcome to forum.",

Mopar that’s post 4odd way to do so. are you using a hw wallet or an exchange account? if an exchange account good luck at properly tracking that. Also, if an exchange account, I would recommend getting it off and using a cold storage wallet for majority of funds and a hw hot wallet (properly backed up) for usable funds.",
