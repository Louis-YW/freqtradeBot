Bitcoin.org was created by satoshi and is now controlled by Cøbra.Take note that even if bitcoin.org was still owned by satoshi, it wasn't the official website of bitcoin.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5437107.msg61771381#msg61771381I know many newbies don't know this either, that is why I decide to make a topic out of this, thanks sir hossainimr93, it feels really good learning something new about Bitcoin from time to time on this forum.",

And everybody should realize that they should never focus on how they can earn on early days of participation of this forum they should invest in knowledge because for sure once they learn all the aspects they need the earning will follow because they became skilled and maybe their contribution here will be monetized by people or company would like to reward their service provided.",

Are we to keep quiet whenever we learn something that others might benefit from?I assume that most members know that this website is not an official site that represents Bitcoin, but there are certainly those who did not know that - although even in case you still live in the belief that it is an official Bitcoin site, there is no harm - because the information on that site will not mislead you or others in any way because it is under the control of good people.Quote from: Crypt0Gore on February 16, 2023, 12:21:04 PMSince you are a legendary member then pls guide me, maybe next time I won't have to do the same. Since it doesn't matter. I think I already did that, and if you didn't understand, the advice was well-intentioned. Here's another tip -> don't judge members by their rank, because there are a lot of members who have high ranks and still don't know the difference between Bitcoin and blockchain",

      "body": "Generally learning something new about anything gives the feeling of joy and accomplishment. The beauty about it is that if you consciously discipline yourself to learn one new thing everyday and not forget, within a very short time, you will be surprised at how much you will know. For beginner's and newbies to cryptocurrency, this is a good strategy to learn quickly, you can facilitate and make your learning time quick by challenging yourself to learn something new about bitcoins for a stipulated number of days, say a 90-days Challenge or a 100-days challenge, or any adequate number of days that you can stay committed and dedicated to learning. During the time you allocate to yourself to learn, make conscious efforts everyday to do your research and learn a new thing about bitcoins. Apart from the knowledge to gain, it will also help you in developing the culture of doing your own research.",

As this forum is made for newbies, everyone has the right to discuss these issues here.
