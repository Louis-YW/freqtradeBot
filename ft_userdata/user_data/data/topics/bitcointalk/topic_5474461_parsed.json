If the fees come down it will get confirmed but that will be subjected to it been still in the mempool. It will later be drop if the fees do not come down soon and the wallet doesn’t have an in built rebroadcast.",

The new segwit addresses are the native segwit address having the prefixes of bc1 and are Bech32 encoded. Both have just slightly different in transaction fees with native segwit (bc1) having the lower fees If you look at the transaction ID posted by the OP he was send from the address type 3 (old segwit) to a new the one (bc1)",

Yes it is rare to see transaction still left in mempool for almost 1-2 years but it is much possible either by the user himself rebroadcasting it regularly and the fee as stated above or the wallet used as an inbuilt rebroadcast which it does regularly. This will make the nodes that have dropped the transaction to pick it again and could remain like that except if the fee paid was at one time ok to get it confirmed",

It’s hardly of any relevance or perhaps it’s requested to clear error IP on forum account creation. I wonder if that’s it else, why the dust amount and at such a time when, you even have to give it some hours for transactions of 100sat/vbyte to confirm and yet here you are @OP with 12sat/vbyte.Does it really make much difference @o_e_I_e_o, having your transactions listed at the bottom of some of the pools and getting dropped. In both cases, you get to wait until the network is decongested and fees reduced.I feel, your more relaxed having your transaction, dropped/rejected and stayed in your wallet.",
