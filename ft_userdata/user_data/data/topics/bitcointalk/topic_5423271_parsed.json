Oh, how wrong I was!!ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦ðŸ¤¦Â With consistency and devotion (and a truckload of pushing, if I may add), I've been able to come this far. Many exceptional individuals on here also so played a key role in my growth and it would be an act of ingratitude if I don't mention a few of them.The Chymist; always backing me up with not only merits, but constructive criticism as well.Philipma 1957;Â  I should say a lot, probably a eulogy of sorts, but I'd just be brief. Thank you for your unrelenting support.Cryptoprenuerbrainboss, Pooya, Welsh and all those who helped in one way or another to push me to this pinnacle.Â Learning, they say, never stops and I hope to keep learning till I get there. For now, I drop my pen here...To the real MVPs of this forum, I say my thanks.",
