This is more suitable for Off-topic",

Discord is really bad for going offline too and the fact it was only an hour of downtime is quite impressive for meta (Facebook went away for ages after the last issues they had with it).",

Whereas the Signal App on the other hand includes a similar interface, one-to-one chat, group chat, file transfers, photos, voice calls, and video calls which are end-to-end encrypted. Only the people involved in the chat can view them which always give me that extra feeling of privacy. End-to-end encryption happens between the individual phones that are using the Signal App. Even the company that operates Signal App cannot see these messages even if they wanted to. Â This is because Signal created its own encryption protocol for this.",
