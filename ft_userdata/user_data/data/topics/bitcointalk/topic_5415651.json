  "content": "Major Market Corrections Bitcoin bottomed two to three weeks before the SPX did which is the s p 500. over the last week, the s p has made new lows while Bitcoin continues to hold its impressive ground, it's good to see that the bifurcation that tore apart the equity market took a dump right and the pay 500 also saw its worst drop in not at 9.3 percent this month if this is the worst drop since March 2020 you know when the government shut down the entire Globe.so look at what Bitcoin said it's held it's June Lowe's. I think that we have bottomed already because I can't imagine what would cause the Cascade that we had I mean back in June we had a Cascade way worse than March 2020.keep that in mind you know when the government shut down the entire Globe, we had a worse Cascade back up this time around than back in March 2020 and that's because we had lending platforms go down we had Celsius Luna, we had the dollar reaching par essentially for the year from the Euro and so many other crazy data points that it was kind of like a giant Black Swan that we had you know what I mean so people are expecting to go down to 10000 now 16 000 and I I've told people to listen this is what I think I could be wrong but I've been right so far that I think we have bottomed but you know we still have those stragglers out there that are saying we're gonna head down after this, you know the Market's going to bring everything down but it hasn't broken down it's taken away it's walked away from just being in lockstep with the broader stock the great market.",

As for whether it will be even less, it is possible, but I think not much. For some reason, analysts predict a fall even below 10,000 in the coming years, but I don’t believe in this and, in my humble opinion, this will not happen. And this is not a collapse but a correction.",

Bitcoin stopped growing reaching ATH at 69k in Nov 2021, where the dump started (damn its almost a year ago ... seams like yesterday). While stocks (SP500) were growing for next 2 months untill Jan 2022. Same can be seen at bitcoin bottom. That bitcoin will stop dropping and start climbing 2 months before SP500 bottom.

Yes, those who are experienced, know that bitcoin is not dead and will never be dead however here the OP is searching for the ultimate low for this bear market. To be true, no one can exactly time the bottom but the bottom can be very near. I am not sure if 17,000$ was the bottom because the market can still move further down on any news or political situation especially according to the Russian war.",

Another bottom possible to be hit though, after failing many times to break the resistance Bitcoin can even go lower than $15k and I’m sure many are waiting already for that price because they know that’s a good price to entry and we should also have that kind of mindset and never panic.",

Although when I first join the crypto race, I abstractly think that the market can just crash anytime and investors is going to lose their funds since I never knew how the crypto market works. It is very simple. Because the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile.  It hasn't set up its ground yet to be stable and there are lots of rejections, and acceptance happening, and whoever dominated can give a trend to the cryptocurrency market.  Aside from that, having a bear market for so long makes the market very sensitive to negative news,  thus the market is easily shaken once negative news happens in the market.Quote from: Wakate on October 02, 2022, 11:06:45 AMFor those that think the market could crash any moment from now show go and check Bitcoin chat from 2013 to see for themselves how the market moves. Market crashing doesn't necessarily mean the cryptocurrency will go down the drain.  Besides, the 2013 event has nothing to do with the current event of BTC.  It may be a reference but today's happening is independent of that date.  Besides, there is no denying that Bitcoin had already crashed.",

Their only goal is to reduce inflation by all means, even if raising interest rates will cause the world economy to fall into recession. My prediction is that the Fed will not stop raising rates or cutting rates in the next few rounds, at least until the US Presidential election in 2024. They're going to have to find a way to get inflation back under control, for the election to go well and that's the pressure that I think the Fed is under. Raising interest rates is aimed at controlling global inflation but they still have a huge responsibility to their country.",
