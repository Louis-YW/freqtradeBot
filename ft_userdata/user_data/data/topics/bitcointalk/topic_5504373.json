  "content": "I wish to discuss the following attack vector, as it seems to be a major security risk for Bitcoin.If Ethereum mounted a successful 51% attack on Bitcoin, it would likely crash the value of Bitcoin, making Ethereum the new number one cryptocurrency.The cost of a 51% attack has been estimated to be $6–$20 billion [1]. This is only 1.3%–4.4% of Ethereum's current market cap. And it is only 0.5%–1.5% of its potential growth if Ethereum knocks down Bitcoin and conquers its full share of the cryptocurrency market.If Ethereum's stakeholders pool their resources, they could thus easily afford a 51% attack (also known as a Goldfinger attack in this case) against Bitcoin, and could profit quite considerably from it.In my recent preprint [2], I also discuss how the stakeholders could potentially bribe existing Bitcoin miners anonymously through smart contracts in order to make the 51% attack even more feasible.I posted a similar topic over on AltcoinsTalks' discussion forum, and there seems to be at least partial agreement in that thread that Ethereum stakeholders could indeed afford such an attack, and that they could in theory gain from it. The main contention at this moment seems to be more about whether they would dare or not. So I want to pose the following question to this discussion forum: What steps will Bitcoin take to mitigate this attack vector, if any?In particular, is it realistic that Bitcoin will convert to Proof-of-Stake as well in order to prevent such a 51% attack from being profitable? General discussion about the feasibility and severity of this \"Rival Goldfinger attack vector\" is also very welcome: Is it safe to invest in Bitcoin before this attack vector has been mitigated?[1] L.

      "body": "@franky1, you make some very good points. In particular, it is true that the Ethereum stakeholders wouldn't just be able to buy the ASICs from one day to the other. Nor will they likely be able to bribe the existing miners unless they also pay for their ASICs as well, since these will most likely be very hard to sell after a fall of Bitcoin.This cost is considered, however, in the referenced $6B–$20B estimate by Nuzzi et al.I also want to contest you on the statement that Ethereum would collapse as a result of buying enough ASICs or bribing enough miners. $6B–$20B is only 1.3%–4.4% of Ethereum's market cap, so it will only require 1.3%–4.4% of all Ether in order to pay for a 51% attack. Not something that is at all likely to cause a crash of Ethereum, will you agree?To your point about the attackers having to 'wait around to collude' (assuming that they choose to buy ASICs rather than bribe miners and buy into existing infrastructure), it is worth pointing out that they don't have to be idle as miners in that time. They can behave as honest miners right up until the attack. Also, since this will mean that rewards will become more thinly spread out, some of the actual honest miners, who aren't backed by Ethereum stakeholders, will likely fall off in that time, making it easier for the attackers to gain a majority.And to your point about the consequences of a 51% attack, it is worth underlining that the majority of the costs of a 51% attack are from buying the equipment. The operational costs are small in comparison. Once the attackers have gained a majority (and with the backing of Ethereum's stakeholders), they will thus be able to rewrite many more than just a few blocks of the history. They could potentially steal a lot of bitcoin in doing so. And it is therefore unlikely, as far as I can see, that Bitcoin's value wouldn't be severely damaged by this. Would you agree?",

That would be around 2.5% of Bitcoin's market cap so the \"threat\" kinda goes both ways.These are two very good points.First of all, it is true that the price of Ethereum seems to have roughly followed the price of Bitcoin in the past. However, (as User Stompix pointed out in the mentioned AltcoinsTalks thread) it is not at all impossible that Ethereum will be able to spin it as battle between 'PoS vs. PoW' (and 'Ethereum vs Bitcoin'), sort of like a 'Nokia vs Samsung' or 'Pepsi vs Coca-Cola' situation. Once the public hears that there is a contest between the two technologies, the price of the two might no longer remain correlated.Your second point is also very valid. But first of all, if some of the Ethereum stakeholders start funding an attack, all they and other stakeholders would have to do is to in order to mitigate a reverse attack is to collectively stake a larger amount of the total Ether. And what's more, if one reads the Ethereum docs, see in particular https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#pos-and-security, it appears that the Ethereum stakeholders believe (and maybe rightfully so) that they will easily be able to revert a 51% attack, even if one happens.",

Not sure that anyone from crypto really want to do it for promoting of own project Well, imagine that the attack is preceded by a long argument between the Ethereum and Bitcoin communities about whether PoW is still a viable technology.If the Ethereum stakeholders can only prove that they have enough the power and money to mount a 51% attack on Bitcoin, perhaps by showcasing a small and harmless demonstration, then they would have a pretty good argument for why investors should buy into their PoS solution instead.At that point, all they would need to do, in my view, is to stir up tensions about whether an actual attack will happen just enough for the some of the Bitcoin stakeholders to become uneasy and start migrating to Ethereum instead.Once this migration has started, Bitcoin's value would drop, which would then make a 51% attack even more affordable. This could thus create a positive feedback loop where more and more investors will start migrating from Bitcoin to Ethereum.The first ones to move will earn a lot of money, just like the preexisting Ethereum stakeholders, but the last ones to move will have lost a lot.What do you think, is this scenario pure sci-fi, or does it sound like something that could realistically happen?",

It would be funny to watch ETH stakers collaborating such an attack only to find out that it would backfire at them.what people dont realise about ethereum is due to the change of ethereum years ago, they lost alot of independent market speculation. and jsut become a shadow of bitcoins arbitrage market. in short its bitcoins doing arbitrage via eth bridges in the market that is keeping ethereums price up. even when its value(cost) had declined by 95%+so when the stakers(locked of of the market) suddenly unlock and sell. they will affect the market more then people thinkethereum does not have much of its own independent value sentiment. its just a sheep market for bitcoin arbitragingyou can see this because the difference between its independent market discover changed to a near flat line compared to bitcoin where bitcoin took control of ethereum price discoverylook how random and independent ethereum price was before may 14th 2021then look how calm and roughly pegged ethereums price ratio became after May 14th 2021yes slowly ethereum is losing its price ratio peg, moving from 12eth=1btc to now 20 eth=1btc over 3+ years. but the stability difference of that may 14th 2021 is revealing that ethereum lost its independent price discovery and come somewhat pegged to bitcoin at the 12 to 20 eth per btc ratio since then.that ratio would get hit more when ethereum stakers unstaked and went to market",

      "body": "We've already discussed 51% attacks on Bitcoin in a few recent threads. My own scenario had a large nation-state player like China or Russia doing it.It's worth noting that in that discussion, it was pointed out that only two companies control more that 51% of the Bitcoin hashrate. An entity controlling these two companies (either through legal/political or clandestine means) could effectively control the Bitcoin network.The other conclusion from the threads was that Bitcoin is ultimately protected by... the US federal government. Any actor, be it private or national, would have the USA to contend with if it were to try something like this. Indeed, it is undoubtedly the threat of the US government's reprisals that probably keeps a major entity from attacking Bitcoin. (Kind of ironic, given all of the anti-government rhetoric coming from some of the Bitcoin community). This is worth thinking about, since the one thing Bitcoin could not survive would be an attack by the US government itself, say if Trump were elected and he was told that replacing Bitcoin with his own personal currency would make him a trillionaire.",

      "body": "Quote from: mjdamgaard on July 28, 2024, 11:17:38 AMFirst of all, it is true that the price of Ethereum seems to have roughly followed the price of Bitcoin in the past. However, (as User Stompix pointed out in the mentioned AltcoinsTalks thread) it is not at all impossible that Ethereum will be able to spin it as battle between 'PoS vs. PoW' (and 'Ethereum vs Bitcoin'), sort of like a 'Nokia vs Samsung' or 'Pepsi vs Coca-Cola' situation. Once the public hears that there is a contest between the two technologies, the price of the two might no longer remain correlated.I think at this point anyone that is interested enough in crypto to be invested (or to consider investing) is already well aware of the PoW vs PoS situation.Regardless of that it seems impossible to guess how the market would react in practice, but given that history suggests both that (1) Bitcoin crashing takes the rest of the market with it and that (2) markets react surprisingly little to 51% attacks (though those were admittedly rather minor alts) it seems like the odds are not especially in an attacker's favor -- at least in the scenario of Ethereum trying to take Bitcoin's throne by means of a 51% attack.Quote from: mjdamgaard on July 28, 2024, 11:17:38 AMYour second point is also very valid. But first of all, if some of the Ethereum stakeholders start funding an attack, all they and other stakeholders would have to do is to in order to mitigate a reverse attack is to collectively stake a larger amount of the total Ether. And what's more, if one reads the Ethereum docs, see in particular https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/#pos-and-security, it appears that the Ethereum stakeholders believe (and maybe rightfully so) that they will easily be able to revert a 51% attack, even if one happens.Please note that I'm merely comparing the two cost estimates given by the paper, assuming that both cost estimates are equally reasonable and that both attack scenarios are of similar impact. Discussing the validity of these conclusions are a different matter, but would require taking a closer look at both estimates.Quote from: mjdamgaard on July 28, 2024, 04:32:29 PMQuote from: hatshepsut93 on July 28, 2024, 11:58:28 AM6-20M to reverse how many blocks exactly? The way PoW deterrence works is that the cost is disproportionately higher than the result of such attack. Spending such high percentage of total market cap would be viewed as a loss for Ethereum, because it means that after a couple dozens of such attacks Ethereum's value will collapse, will Bitcoin will just suffer from a temporary set back. And the practical damage of 51% attack can be mitigated by requiring more confirmations. 6–20 billion, so hundreds of blocks, really.According to the paper the range of 6-20 billion would apply to an attack that lasts for one hour. So that's about 6 blocks, not hundreds.",

      "body": "Quote from: franky1 on July 28, 2024, 04:57:46 PMyou think 1–4% is not enough to crash a market.. but here is the thing.. not all coins circulating are on the market.. only a small proportion of coins crculating are on market orders so a sudden increase of coins hitting the market supply would cause changetake for instance bitcoin, there are over 19m coins in circulation.. but there are not 19 m coins on the market. most market orders are 0.0X coins per order.. so if there was a sudden period where people were colluding to sell for instance 190,000(just 1%) coin the market orders would flood with sell orders compared to the norm.. now translate that to the numbers of ethereum circulation amount and market supply and see some scenarios of then dumping 1-4% of that circulation on the market supply.. you will soon see how it affects the marketswe seen it many times in the bitcoin market when the market orders were <1btc each. but then whales created walls and orders of just 1000 coin order lumps.. it had enough impact on the marketsThis seems surprising to me. According to https://bitinfocharts.com (today), the transaction volume is roughly 0.6% each day. So I have a hard time wrapping my head around the proposition that transfers of 1%-4%, potentially over several days or months, would crash Ethereum?Also, I think the context for why these transfers happen is important, i.e. whether they happen because investors lose interest, or if they happen simply as part of making payments. By the way, have you considered the eventuality that I describe in my preprint where the stakeholders simply locks Ether to a smart contract instead, which is then automatically pays the participating miners in case of a successful 51% attack? Here the transfers only happen once the 51% attack has already taken place.To your other points of your reply, yes it is true that it would require more than 51% for such an attack, ideally, and it is also true that the attackers have to weigh the profits of being honest miners against the rewards of an attack. But in the end, all this is a matter of money. And if the funding Ethereum stakeholders are willing and able to part with enough, then they should be able buy the miners for their malicious cause, assuming that the miners act selfishly, of course.",

For example back in 2017 bitcoin was at $20k and ethereum at 0.15BTC then bitcoin crashed to $3k and ethereum got destroyed by dumping down to 0.01BTC.Today bitcoin is back up to $20k and past that to almost $70k while ethereum is about 0.04BTC[...]At the end of the day with or without bitcoin we all know that ethereum is useless. Its only utility is for junk creation (ICO, IEO, STO, NFT, etc.) that have no usages in the real world.It also has unlimited supply and a mutable blockchain with so many security flaws.I believe that you are vastly underestimating Ethereum. The value of Ethereum is not 4% of Bitcoin's. It is currently 32%, according to https://bitinfocharts.com.And regarding all the supposed security flaws of Ethereum's protocol that you mention, this also shows that there are quite a lot of people who disagrees with you and believes it to be secure. However, I would love to hear more about what you believe those security to be? This sounds quite interesting.Quote from: pooya87 on July 28, 2024, 05:02:38 PMYou can't 51% attack with money, you'll need hardware. There is no $6-$20 billion worth of hardware for sale!You can't also pay for it with market cap, they'll need to first own that much ether then dump it to get the money which would crash the price of this shitcoin and won't give them nearly as much as tens of millions let alone billions![...]A miner is running a business and has made a significant investment. Why would a businessman kill his own business by attacking the very thing that is making them profit?Yes, this is already taken into account in the estimated price of the attack.",

They have been discussed on and off for years and yet since nobody has ever done it, it shows that it's not really viable to do.-Dave",
