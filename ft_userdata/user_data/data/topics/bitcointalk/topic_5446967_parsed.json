What stops a node from having multiple domain names? You have only replaced proof-of-work with proof-of-domain-names.",

Quote from: pwn8 on March 31, 2023, 03:00:49 AMnothing. nobody has implemented this idea before because maybe it is not \"decentralized\" enough. It is completely centralized as the domain provider or domain producer (i.e., ICANN), have all voting power. You just invented a more complicated version of fiat.Genuine question: how do nodes verify that someone was a minter? The moment someone loses permission to a domain name, they can no longer provide sufficient evidence that they minted a block, and hence, does not solve Byzantine generals' problem.",

Using an internet asset to create a decentralized and energy efficient cryptocurrency.This works well with Java, Android, and publishing packages on the internet. Less so for cryptocurrency.As an example, I have currently 4 (!!!) domain names in my hosting panel right now. What stops me from directing all of them towards my node?You see, domains by themselves do not provide any cryptographic security whatsoever. And this strikes me as a form of proof-of-stake, but without any kind of probabilities calculation at all.",
