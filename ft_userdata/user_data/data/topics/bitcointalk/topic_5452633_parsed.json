Electrum generated me seed phrase, I wrote it down on a paper for me to proceed, I proceeded and write it on Electrum but I was not able to press on finish. I went back and use I already have a seed instead, I wrote the seed phrase and I was able to press finish and it was successful.The bug is that I was not able to proceed directly but I used I already have a seed to import the seed phrase. This can confuse newbies.It was on Android Electrum.",

This can confuse newbies.It's not a bug.If you already created a set of Electrum seed then you don't need to finish the procedure before completing the wallet. You can restore the wallet associated with the seed set anytime.I guess I did not misunderstand your case with the wallet.",

      "body": "OP is right. The problem is that when you use suggested words instead of typing the words completely, it adds an space at the end of the words. If you type the last word manually, you will be able to select \"finish\".If you use the suggested word when entering the last word, you will need to tap on \"back\" button, so that the extra space is deleted. After that, you can select \"finish\". When you select \"I already have a seed\" and then enter your seed phrase, it works fine even if you enter the last word using suggested words.",

I hope this would be corrected in the next update because it can confuse some people.",
