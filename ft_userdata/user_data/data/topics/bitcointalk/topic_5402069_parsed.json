  "content": "The so called insurrection in USA Capitol on January 6 2021 was actually a protest against the election of Nov 2020. Those protesters  have the right to protest against evil deeds as long as it's done lawfully... how they went about it (whether moral/peaceful or not) is currently the issue. Well, I believe the intention was to have a protest that was moral/legal but few people with different aganda (evil agenda) took advantage of the protest to cause problems. I even watched lots of protesters (esp those at the front) trying to stop those who came to cause problems by preventing them physically from breaking things & shouting at them. The protesters didn't behave like people who came to overthrow the elected leaders even though that could be done morally(I mean the CREATOR using people overthrow treacherous government officials). I even noticed the police letting what looked like true protesters inside the building and I wondered from that moment whether they could be doing that because it's legal or they are knowingly/unknowingly being used by the enemy so that the true protesters who were let inside could be blamed for the mayhem caused by those with different agenda inside....you know, a well written script to blame the protesters for insurrection/lawlessness and make things look like it was the intention of President Donald Trump and his followers all along. I believe this was part of what made it easy for the enemy to act against the President  even when he had a strong case that should have been looked into to prevent a situation where a legitimate government is remove from power via fraudulent means. The Protest would have been done differently though to prevent problems. As a Spiritual person I believe the protesters would have sought permission from their CREATOR to even know whether it's right time. If they were relying on their wisdom and power then the government should have provided adequate security in urgent cases, as it was necessary to convince the leaders through protest not to certify what they believed was fraudulent election... It was around the time the leaders were about to certify the election.The solution to the January 6 issue is simple: * Get qualified people(saints) to investigate and prosecute those who try to frame the innocent protesters * Make sure those behind the mayhem are punished * Make sure those who deliberately cause much problems are punished. * Those who were deceived to do things that are not that bad or serious should be pardon if they have apologized * Allow innocent protesters who may be wrongfully imprisoned to go free* Resolve the root cause of the protest. If you ignore or do not obey the instructions above then you are on your own.",

But we heard they were coming, so we got ready for them. They were scared of our community guns, and went away.Can't tell for sure about the Capitol BLM insurrection. But it looks like some of the Capitol police were in on it, as they ushered the BLM rioters in. This is shown in some of the videos.BREAKING: Internal Memo Reveals Capitol Police Were Warned BLM from Baltimore Was Bussing in Rioters Disguised as Trump Supporters on Jan. 6Quote from: https://foxmetronews.com/news/breaking-internal-memo-reveals-capitol-police-were-warned-blm-from-baltimore-was-bussing-in-rioters-disguised-as-trump-supporters-on-jan-6/Trump supporters were framed by FBI and government operatives and BLM and Antifa terrorists.A leaked internal memo revealed that the US Capitol Police intel unit warned that BLM from Baltimore was bussing in rioters for January 6th protests.According to the memo the rioters were going to blend in.Via investigative reporter Paul Sperry:\"BLM/Antif will wear MAGA hats, wear camo,and attempt to blend in with MAGA crowd\" so violence blamed on Trump supporters attending Trump rally\"Antifa was actively involved in the January 6th protests and riots.This has been widely discussed by officials and in reports on this website.Cristina Laila wrote this back in February 2021 —  Ex-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund dropped a bombshell in February 2021 during a hearing before the Senate Rules and Homeland Security committees.Mr. Sund testified that according to intelligence gathered by law enforcement groups, members of the Proud Boys, white supremacist groups, ANTIFA and other extremist groups were expected to participate on January 6 and that they may be inclined to become violent.The Democrat-media complex has totally ignored eyewitness accounts detailing how black bloc Antifa terrorists infiltrated the peaceful MAGA demonstrations....",
