  "content": "Hello all! I had an experience with attempt to make new type of account in Ledger Live for my Nano X. I had existing 'Native Segwit' accounts so I've decided to create a 'Taproot' account for Bitcoin. While synchronizing took place I've discovered some 'Bitcoin 3' 'Segwit' account pending to be created with few satoshies on it. As I had updated Ledger Live quite frequently and I had no such amount of Bitcoins transferred to me (at least which I know of) using 'Segwit' is it safe to accept such suspicious account synchronization? I haven't sent it and did not ask for it in reasonable observable past time. So the source of such account is totally unknown to me. If this happened long time back then it should be already put inside my accounts by Ledger Live synchronization process as I did 'Clear Cache' for it quite often and got no accounts updates whatsoever isn't it? How safely handle that pending amount of BTC for such 'unknown' account? I had some unpleasant talk by mobile with a crook who posed as 'finance security officer' recently. By chance he must be getting my mobile from one of the crypto exchanges I visit not so long ago. Since then I try to remain low. Could it be that such small satoshi amounts are by chance interlinked to any type of criminal action and they are waiting to be picked up to initiate legal prosecution connected to it? Is it possible anyway?",

      "body": "^^ Yamane is right. This is a dust attack and if you can remember where you have pasted your bitcoin address somewhere and these are people that have been sending these small amounts to check if the user is still active and it's not just you that's experiencing this. It was also long time ago that I've received something like this but it's not with a satoshi but in a total dead altcoin that's no longer active. To know more about dust attack: What is a crypto dusting attack, and how do you avoid it?Don't worry about that, you can either send your assets first to another wallet then produce another one with your ledger nano x with a new private key if you're not confident about that and from the another wallet you've made, send it again to the newly produce addresses with a new private key that you've made. If that sounds complicated then just ignore that amount and make new sets of accounts on ledger live.",
