  "content": "Let's debunk some misconceptions today! When doing research about a Coin, people need to do a good DYOR. It is important to research and find out about good projects and what a project really is about. It is about researching tech and basics. Sometimes, people fail to do a basic research and end up investing in wrong Coins, getting (wrong) prejudices about a Coin / lose out on very promising Coins / end up investing in failed Coins. We really need to do a good research and also share our knowledge. So, I share mine today! Avalanche is a COIN, not a Token! Some people have called Avalanche [AVAX] a Token, what is wrong because it is a Coin. It always has been a Coin. No doubt! Avalanche’s AVAX was already launched as a Coin! Why is it important? It is very important to look up if a Cryptocurrency is a Coin or a Token. A Token is of lesser value because it’s using an existing Blockchain as a Base. A Token is not genuine! A Token is not a new technology because it’s just based on an existing Blockchain. For example: Ethereum Tokens are based on Ethereum using ERC20 standard. Ethereum is a coins and all ERC20 technology is based on it. Difference coin and token – very important to know. Because a coin is always a unique technology! BitCoins, Ethereum Coins, LiteCoins, Avalanche Coins are all coins, all are independent Blockhains, independent technology. Avalanche is a smart-contract Blockchain launched in 2020 and AVAX is Avalanche's native Coin! Avalanche has gotten a lot name recognition by using a novel consensus mechanism, called Avalanche Consensus for its Coin. A Coin is a unique Blockchain and independent technology. A Token is NOT a unique Blockchain and NOT independent technology. It’s always based on an existing Blockchain. Very important to know! People have confused it for a long time but now you know! So, now you know: Avalanche is a COIN, not a Token!",

      "body": "You are right, a coin is much more valuable compared to a token because a token is not really an innovation. A token is just a product while a coin is where you can build products from. A coin will be much more usefull and people always need to favor coin over token, if it's a good coin. I found a good explanation from coders on Coinmarketcap about difference coin / token: https://support.coinmarketcap.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018692892-What-is-the-difference-between-a-coin-and-a-token-QuoteWhat's the difference between a coin and a token?A coin is a cryptocurrency that can operate independently. For example, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) are coins.A token is a digital unit designed with utility in mind, providing access and use of a larger cryptoeconomic system. It does not have store of value on its own, but are made so that software can be developed around it. For example, Tether (USDT) is a token that operates on the Omni platform.Coin is much better. People need to understand, what's coin and what's token.",

This has been discussed so many times in the past even there were some awareness thread about this,. The only thing that makes it different was the blockchain that used by the coin rather than asset that peg with the blockchain as operational insfrastructure to run the asset (token). In this case the coin can be considered as a asset from the parent chain.",

Some projects are trying to create fuss and most likely it was also a campaign against Avalanche, where competitors lied and said, AVAX is a token. But it was FUD, because AVAX is a coin. We should not fall for such FUD.",

Either it can be a token or project as long as it has real potential for the future it will be profitable and that is how ethereum is still surviving even when the transaction fee went insane.BNB can be another example which started as a token then build its own blockchain now many projects are launched over BSC chain esp[ecially after the fee hike for erc20 tokens.",

CMC top 10 are almost all coins, bro. Plz check: https://coinmarketcap.com/",
