  "content": "Normally I use Electrum Windows Program to send and receive BTCs.However I would appreciate to have Electrum Wallet information on my Android 13 smartphone too.E.g. to get information if I already received a BTC transfer.or to copy & paste a BTC address and send it to my partner.Ok, I could download and install the Electrum App to get access to my wallet over there.But I don't want to open the wallet in full access mode.Instead everything should be possible except sendingÂ  BTCs.Therefore I need something like a read-only mode which cannot (never) be changed on in my Smartphone.So it must by a special Electrum App compilation which never allows \"write\" mode even if I enter the correct wallet passwd.Alternatively Electrum could offer a second wallet password for read-only mode.Everything is acceptable as long as I do not have to enter my full \"write\" wallet password.Is this somehow possible?Or can this be implemented in the next version?",

Get different wallets like Electrum, Sparrow and some other open source and import the private keys of each addresses on the different wallets.
