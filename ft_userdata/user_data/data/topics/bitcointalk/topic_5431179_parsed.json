The integrity of the data and who was given authorization to write data to the database are both open to public scrutiny.",

Blocks are not ordered based on time at all - they are ordered based on each block's hash containing a reference to the previous block. Miners are free to alter the timestamp on a block by a window of approximately 3 hours, and there are plenty of instances of later blocks having earlier timestamps than the blocks they were built on top of.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on December 24, 2022, 02:14:34 PMIt's a task that can be solved with a large amount of computing power, and this task is designed in such way that on average it always takes the whole network 10 minutes to solve it.What I would add to this is that the proof of work system which bitcoin uses means that it is hard to find the solution, but easy to verify the solution. It is hard for miners to find a block header which results in the required hash for their block to be valid, but once they've found the solution, other nodes can verify their solution in milliseconds. There is no way to fake the work required to find the solution, so by broadcasting a valid block which other nodes can verify very quickly, you are proving you have done the work required to find that block.",

Using a unique hash of a block prevents that because it will be the same. Blockchains have timestamps of when a block was mined but I do not think this can be 100% relied upon because of the differences. My computer and your computer despite being connected to the internet and getting the time directly from the rtc are probably not the same. This can be tested with some of your devices in your own household.",

They can verify everything themselves, from the genesis block to the latest broadcasted transaction, they can examine and run the code themselves, they can learn exactly how elliptic curve multiplication works, and so on. You can choose to trust it if you want, but you can also choose to understand and verify it all yourself. With fiat on the other hand (or with centralized exchanges), you can only trust, and history has shown us repeatedly that that trust is often misplaced and abused.Quote from: AverageGlabella on December 24, 2022, 06:03:38 PMBlockchains have timestamps of when a block was mined but I do not think this can be 100% relied upon because of the differences.They can't. The timestamps are predominantly used to help calculate the difficulty over a two week period. They are in no way accurate enough to determine the order of blocks.
