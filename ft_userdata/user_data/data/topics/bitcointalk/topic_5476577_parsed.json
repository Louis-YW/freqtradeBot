      "body": "The difference between spot and perp is mostly leverage. With spot you basically got 1x leverage. There is margin trading which is slightly higher leverage like 3-5x. You borrow USD to buy more BTC and pay interest.Perp trading is basically up to 100-200x or so. And it’s meant for short term trades because you pay a funding fee every hour if you are going with the crowd. If you are against the crowd you sometimes get paid for funding instead of paying it. Hence why these are best for short term trades. You can also get liquidated but 1x spot trading you can’t.",

      "body": "whales do not put their hoard of coins on the spot marketif you look at the market orderbook of spot market most order lines are under 1btcwhales bet using multiple bitcoins and ontop of that leverage it which makes the volume of futures market multiple times higheryes whales do then put a small percentage of hoard into spot where they then create walls and arbitrage deals to control the spot price to keep the price exceeding their bet limitwe seen it saturday where alot of futures contracts completed where they bet the price wont go over $39kwe seen it sunday where alot of futures contracts completed where they bet the price wont go over $40k weekend-yesterday where alot of futures contracts completed where they bet the price wont go over $39k-$40k. and now they won. they dont need to control the price to stay under $39k-$40k and so the natural spot market was allowed to climb.if you look at a monthly spot chart and you see flatlines like /\\           /  \\/\\/\\/\\/\\//\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/instead of /\\  |\\     /\\/\\  /\\        /\\/  \\/  \\/\\/     |/  \\/\\/\\/   \\this is an indicator of whale controlling a market. prices dont usually stay flat in a volatile currency",

I just want to know if there is a way living in the U.S. I can deposit and trade accepting counter party risk, but not worry about getting paid when I withdraw. In other words site goes Mt. Gox that's what I get for holding coins on a site, otherwise no prob using a VPN ect but do I have to sweat getting paid or just the trades?",

This is what I know about this matter.Here's the difference between Perpetual and Spot trading: https://www.gate.io/blog_detail/247/difference-between-perpetual-futures-and-spot-trading",
