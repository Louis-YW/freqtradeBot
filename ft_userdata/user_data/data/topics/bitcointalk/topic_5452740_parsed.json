This is why most hodlers long ago learned never to use centralized exchanges. Bitcoin is a trustless medium of exchange - why would you trust a third party to hold your coins?To name a few Mt. Gox, FTX have \"lost\"/stolen people's funds.Coinbase and Binance have both had periods where they held peoples' funds and delayed/prevented withdrawals.Rule of thumb: \"Not your keys, not your coins.\" That means if you trust a third-party with your private Bitcoin wallet keys (or any other crypto), you no longer own those coins and have to trust that third party to A. never lose them B. Never steal them C. Never have them stolen. There are many ways to safeguard your coins and keep them yourself. Research them.",

That is why choose a non-custodial and open-source wallet and try to differentiate what is Custodial vs. Non Custodial Wallets.  Choose the wallet where you hold the private keys to your wallet, which means you are the only one who can access your funds, and those wallets are generally considered to be more secure than custodial wallets because they don't rely on third-party services to store your private keys. My answer to your last question is yes there is.It's Mt. Gox, filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing a huge amount of Bitcoins due to a hack, and then people learn how to use a con-custodial wallet.",

Now and in future, if that wallet company is closed or the wallet software is abandoned for further development, you can move your bitcoin to a new wallet provides by another wallet software and company.Not your keys, not your coins, that is to remind people that if they store their coins on exchange, they don't have private keys and if that exchange company closes or collapses or bankrupts, they will lose their coins.With non custodial wallets and private keys, you are fine and don't have to care what happen with that wallet company.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accounts",

If yes, then it is important to remind that in such case you have no physical control over the coins, which means you kind of already lost them once handed over to random guys on the Internet! What you have is a promise to return coins on demand, but as with other similar promises it can well be broken for whatever reason, which usually results in you getting failed expectations regarding safety or possible income. If a company closes down, goes bankrupt, or turns out to be a malicious scheme created to play games with naive newcomers, you lose your coins for good as if you never possessed space inside the blockchain. As I said, the only time you can claim that coins are yours is when you have a corresponding private key to an address with those coins. On the other hand, if a wallet is non-custodial, hosted on a public repository on GitHub, and follows all cryptocurrency wallet specifications such as BIP39, you can be sure that if it stops functioning, you can take your private key or seed phrase and import it in some other wallet supporting the same standards. In this case, no matter what happens to people developing the wallet, you can always transfer to any place you like: you keep controlling your funds while choosing services to manage interactions with the blockchain.",

Id your Bitcoins are in a custodial wallet, you don't have the keys, so you can't prove ownership of the funds, thus if the company collapses, it does so with your funds.Having said that, if you use a non-custodial wallet that gives you ownership of your funds/keys, as long as you have the keys, or the seed phrase that can recover the keys anytime, your funds are safe in your custody. Even if the wallet stops functioning, you'd basically just use your keys to spend it in another wallet, because your funds isn't stored inside any wallet, but on the blockchain.",

So, if the wallet company has your private keys, you've got to make sure you have a backup, or you might lose your bitcoin. So, make sure you've got a backup of your private keys stashed somewhere safe, okay? Yes, there are some wallet companies that shut down or have problems that mess with people's bitcoin. Like in 2014, the Mt. Gox exchange (which was also a wallet service) went bankrupt because they lost around 850,000 bitcoin that belonged to their users. Bummer. So, there was this one time when the Parity wallet (where a lot of Ethereum was kept) got messed up because of a bug in its smart contract code back in 2017. This caused them to lose around $280 million worth of Ethereum. Bummer. That's why we've got to know what kind of wallet we're using now so we can be ready.",
