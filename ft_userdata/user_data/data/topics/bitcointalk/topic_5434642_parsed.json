Nevertheless, we might have seen the bottom already as technically 2023 should still be in the bearish zone.

So I guess by January 31 or February 1 we are going to have a clearer sign if the trend continues in crypto market, because it's going to happen the next FED's meeting, which could announce the reduction of interest rates in US. If that happens as awaited, it's possible Bitcoin enters an impressive rising mode, rewarding us with a pre-bullish season appetizer. That is a very significant hypothesis in my opinion. It really shouldn't be seen as nothing.",

      "body": "I figured Bitcoin is basically going to be in a holding pattern in the bottom range until the Fed announces no more interest rate raises. I have been assuming the last rate raise will be March or May. But the inflation dropping down to 6.5% was great news and so investors are probably speculating that there will maybe only be a couple more 25 point raises and that's it. So yeah, the Bitcoin machine started building up after that and the people just started getting real hyped about the possibility of the bear market ending soon.It'll be interesting to see if Bitcoin holds above $20k or so or if it falls back to $17k/$18k for a while before truly breaking out of the bottom of the market sometime in the next few months. The market may decide it was overly exuberant today and that the price shouldn't really break out until the Fed stops raising rates.I expect whatever the rate ends up being, the Fed will probably keep it there until late in the year or early next year, but once the Fed does finally start actually reducing the rates again that's really gonna make investors dive into Bitcoin (even though it shouldn't because the rate doesn't actually affect Bitcoin at all lol, but investors are silly people and they just think Bitcoin is a tech stock haha). But that's not something to worry about now as there won't be any rate cutting for a good long while, right now it's all about when does rate raising end.As soon as the Fed signals no more raising rates, Bitcoin will fly. What we saw today is probably just the earliest group of people getting in before the crowd does, front-running all the people who are actually waiting for the Fed to stop QT to start buying.I didn't think we'd see $20k until March at the earliest. Not complaining haha. Hopefully today at least convinced plenty of the doom and gloom people that no Bitcoin of course is not going down to $10k or $6k or $3k or whatever silly number they are waiting for haha.",

Under normal conditions, without so much bullshit leverage cascading and cases like FTX affecting the ecosystem, we would not have gone below $20k at the bottom of the bear market. Now we are back to what would be normal, as sub $20k levels are priced in and in the next few cycles will be seen as a bargain. Take the opportunity to load up now while it is still cheap (this does not affect those of you who do DCA).",

That's a common thing but to see such is making me feel happy as well as they're sharing the good vibes that they're getting from the market.
