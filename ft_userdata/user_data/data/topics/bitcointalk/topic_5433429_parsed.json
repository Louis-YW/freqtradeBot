I collect links everywhere!Do you honestly believe that someone will look through your directory to see how and who received their first bitcoin or uses it as a payment method?IMHO, but I'm interested in reading this at a time when it's relevant. Someone opened their own salon, someone teaches the basics of bitcoin in the church, and someone else added bonuses for going to the salon. It's all interesting once, so I don't think it needs to be cataloged. Unless someone does not understand, how are such subjects created? Let people grow, at least even using fantasy; they should do something on their own and not rewrite others' links, implying orderliness on the forum. The same fishing merits. Just don't interfere with each other.Quote from: _act_ on January 08, 2023, 08:25:16 AMYou created a thread about your 2022 work and you locked it: BlackBoss_ Works.

Some of the topics you referenced gave me the momentum to add bitcoin payments in my business. I donât think they should be in your thread. Itâs not the same as âa new rank threadâ, I think your so called educational memes is worthless than any of the topics you referenced in OP. So much for keeping the forum clean.

I just don't want to mention it as its just been said one-two many times.I do hope they are getting patronage though and actually balancing up there crypto and fiat accounts.

As for people who disguise for just merit i will just advise them to have a chill there are other means to get it.Ascertaining the intentions of the OPs of these threads might be difficult because none of them would ever accept that their sole aim is to get merit. I cannot also conclude because they would give you many genuine reasons why they started the thread. But one striking benefit I have seen from this thread is that they offer some basic guidelines or lessons about Bitcoin. Most times the OP of some of these threads seek advice from the community about a better way of using Bitcoin personally and in their business, while others on how to teach or create Bitcoin awareness better in their area. And we have seen some members giving uncommon Ideas that have even helped me personally.My humble advice is that if you suspect that any thread is for merit hunting or fishing, don't give any merit. If these merit fishers realize that their baits are getting nothing, they would stop. We shouldn't discourage people with genuine intentions from sharing their stories and getting relevant advice or information.",

My consideration is that every user has the right to speak, but if it is an attempt to get merit or fishing for merit then of course it will be difficult for other users to get it. Making it up or really low effort might come across easily, so it's okay if they don't get support.I just try to stay positive in any effort they have, sometimes it's true but they can't convey it well because of the limitations.",
