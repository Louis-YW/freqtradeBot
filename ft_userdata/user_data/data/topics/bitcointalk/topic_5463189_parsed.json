      "body": "Although it is a little bummer to you, it is save this way. Not just that any vulnerability might cause your contacts to be modified but for privacy purposes it is not good sending bitcoin to one address all the time. Since bitcoin transaction can be seen on the blockchain it is possible that your wallet might be monitored and be under surveillance by possible hackers.Â Try to use different addresses for too many transactions. It is a lot easier this days since many wallet ( like electrum) use the hierarchy deterministic method to generate keys which subsequently generates multiple addresses on a single (at most 20 receiving addresses) wallets.

Also, the \"Address Labels\" feature can help you achieve a comparable functionality to your described scenario. This feature allows you to assign custom labels to addresses that you commonly use.Quote from: EL MOHA on August 14, 2023, 05:59:38 AM Try to use different addresses for too many transactions.

Well, this isn't really an option because lots of those centralized services won't let you change your deposit address. So, many of us end up sending funds to the same addresses over and over again.",

If so, there's no 'Contacts' in the mobile version, unfortunately.Or are you looking for convenient way to use the saved contacts?If so, you can right-click a contact, select \"Pay to\" and you'll be moved to the 'Send' tab with it as the recipient.",

Indeed, they are a bad idea altogether since they encourage address reuse. Having said that, contacts are saved within the wallet file, and thus are encrypted along with everything else (provided you choose to encrypt your wallet file, which you obviously should). Any person or malware which can bypass this encryption to access or modify your contacts can just as easily bypass this encryption and access your private keys.",
