  "content": "BC.game was unique, looked so great until now, why have you changed the design?As a long term affiliate this is terrible, users would have less trust in the site, who came up with this brilliant idea to change the design? Why? Why not let your users vote for it? Games shouldn't only be provably fair, the users should be involved with such important decisions.",

      "body": "I just checked it, it does not look so bad, it is kind of minimalist and intuitive, I think.It has a little bit of this trend called \"Blanding\" on it. On the other hand it looks also a bit generic, this is a design choice I have seen in other webpages, it does not highlight much de personality of this casino, perhaps that is the objective of the managers behind the web design of BC: to make people to feel more \"familiar\" with a simpler design, of course, I am not sure whether this was their intention or not. If you really do not like the change they made, you should let them know on the official thread or mail them about it, they may appreciate the feedback from you and other players.",
