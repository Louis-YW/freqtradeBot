  "content": "Having known that fiat money is a type of currency, a bill of exchange, a negotiable instrument, otherwise known as paper money or dollar bill used to purchase or pay for products or services that ensures our comfort, it is rather debatable whether saving fiat in the bank, at home or in bitcoins, is a good idea. Bitcoin, however, is a digital currency. It utilizes a computer network as a medium of exchange that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. Let us, therefore, consider some of these pros and cons to see the light:1 Bitcoin is secured by blockchain technology, thereby making it difficult to counterfeit or toy with.2 Bitcoin hardly has a physical structure to speak its value unlike that inherent for fiat money. It operates on a decentralized infrastructure that makes direct money transfers quick, traceable, transparent, and immutable.3 The number of parties involved is technically only two for bitcoin, unlike fiat where third parties must be present.4 As the current world change has been from the traditional mode of exchange to electronic mode(digital mode). Bitcoin has an upper hand, as it is purely digital. 5 Bitcoin has in recent times proven to be a strong alternative to fiat money, thereby making it a unitarian global currency.6 Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies have just a finite number of the same available.7 Bitcoin ensures ease to do business with both local and international parties that involve huge amounts of cash, without having to incur heavy charges considering the volatility of the exchange rate, unlike fiat money.The pandemic shook the economy and exposed flaws in both personal and public systems of commerce. Recession became an aftereffect after the World pandemic and the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has added to this quotient. It is however noteworthy to examine these pros and cons of saving fiat versus that of saving with crypto in this period, to be ready for uncertainties.Knowing what you now know, would you rather save fiat more or save in Bitcoins more?",

This is totally debatable.6. True, but 99.999% of cryptocurrencies doesn't matter in the SoV/currency category because most cryptocurrencies are pseudo-equity.

People need to practice proper risk management with investing. In general though based on my personal situation(this should be different from person to person), I can go with higher allocation with BTC because I don't have much responsibilities.",

When transferring fiat online is it can be easily trace by government especially if the person doing it is laundering money. I think it also depend on the country's economy if svaing fiat is profitable. After all, it is you who will decide to focus on fiat, btc or both. For me, I save both.",

( and this is not to that saving in Bitcoin does not have its own flaws as well).But what about our Grand MAs and PAs? Would majority of them agree that it is better to save their money in Bitcoin even after agreeing to the flaws fiat money possess?Bitcoin, just the same way it has captured the hearts of the younger generations, still needs to capture the hearts of the older generations amongst us...and on this note, it still have a very long way to go.",

I wouldn't really risk all my assets on Bitcoin, not as crazy as that one family that sold all their assets for Bitcoin (which paid off, but really, what are the chances of that happening again). I'm still going to manage my assets properly so I can respond to both emergencies and for saving up for the long term. I still haven't really withdrawn my initial investments on Bitcoin and I DCA as well so I don't think I'd have issues there. I still keep a part as fiat though, separate from the amount I invest and the amount I use for daily expenses and monthly bills.",

But then we cannot deny that the world revolves around fiat. It is next to impossible to live with Bitcoin alone. Stores, shops, schools, hospitals, hotels, transportation, and so on accept fiat rather than Bitcoin. Therefore, you need fiat. So keep your savings in Bitcoin but it doesn't mean that you'll convert all your fiat into Bitcoin. You still should keep a good amount of fiat with you.",

Most people encounter counterfeit banknotes only a few times in their lives and in small numbers. Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on August 03, 2022, 03:53:17 PM2 Bitcoin hardly has a physical structure to speak its value unlike that inherent for fiat money. It operates on a decentralized infrastructure that makes direct money transfers quick, traceable, transparent, and immutable.Bitcoin transfers are not quick, many banks and payment networks these days offer nearly instant transactions. Bitcoin tx takes 10 minutes on average, if you pay enough fees to get in next block. And it can take hours or days if your fee is too low.Transparency and traceability is bad, it means other people can see where you are sending money.Immutability has pros and cons. If you lose your money, no one will recover them for you. Zero chance.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on August 03, 2022, 03:53:17 PM3 The number of parties involved is technically only two for bitcoin, unlike fiat where third parties must be present.Again, third parties can cause harm, but also can cause good. They can fix your mistakes and save your money from certain bad situations.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on August 03, 2022, 03:53:17 PM4 As the current world change has been from the traditional mode of exchange to electronic mode(digital mode). Bitcoin has an upper hand, as it is purely digital. In terms of digitalization, Bitcoin has no upper hand over fiat, which is also digital. People these days are paying with fiat via cards, phones and apps.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on August 03, 2022, 03:53:17 PM5 Bitcoin has in recent times proven to be a strong alternative to fiat money, thereby making it a unitarian global currency.Actually its the opposite, the image of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty was shattered.",
