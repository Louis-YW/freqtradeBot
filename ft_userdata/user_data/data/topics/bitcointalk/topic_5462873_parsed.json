  "content": "Today we're going to talk about how there is zero credibility in the marketing and promotions team at Stake.com.  I'm posting this here, after posting on the Stake forum as I was warned that I could be censored on their website.Stake's Marketing and Promotions team is one of the most horrible I've ever seen.I'll tell you how they proved it.On the last 8th of this month they posted the following tweet from promotions related to Stake's anniversary.  https://twitter.com/Stake/status/1688792656745308160?s=19img: https://prnt.sc/2vy6y2HOp-AVAs you can see, they asked who had the oldest Stake account and asked to post proof of it.Note that at NO TIME in this tweet did they specify that it would only be valid if the person posted their private account.A few moments after this tweet was published, I responded with this:  https://twitter.com/guilhxrmesa/status/1688793072774123520?s=19img 2: https://prnt.sc/k7xZDBa8-SVwimg 3: https://prnt.sc/H5SEEOm49NVcYou see, I responded with a screenshot of the oldest known account on the Stake website.  It was created by Stake itself on August 1, 2017.If you look at the responses I got to this Tweet of mine, you'll realize that the promotion announcement was so open that several people thought I won.  Watch.img 4: https://prnt.sc/47lrRkQYbKl7So far so good, they started announcing the winners of the other promotions until they finally released this one in particular.The moment arrives and Stake's profile posted this:img 5: https://prnt.sc/S-TguJ8eIXZIand notice which account was announced as the winner.img 6: https://prnt.sc/UyLa0_XPaXw2A player, who alias is a Stake moderator, with an account created on August 3rd.See how it doesn't make sense.  How could the person who was selected as the Winner not actually be the person who posted the oldest account.So I contacted support to question the result, as I was clearly wronged.I messaged support and they picked up the information related to what I just talked about and said they would get back to me with an answer on this.By the time I spoke to the supertee for the first time, the promotion tweet was available.Hours passed and I opened my Twitter and checked the promo tweet and found it was deleted.I contact support again and get the following message.img 7: https://prnt.sc/nJyhgDCJakRZThe translation:\"By the opinion of Marketing they informed the public that \"Shinjo\" was declared the first winner of the competition.However, upon further investigation, it was found that \"Singpays\" and \"Biggad\" users had the oldest accounts as far as we could see, so it was decided that we will provide additional payment for these users without any public announcement.Therefore, we request that any further questions to the support team regarding this competition, for those users who provide a screenshot with the user \"Stake\" or additional screenshots of other users of this competition, be disregarded.As the winner was announced publicly and the correct winners behind the scenes have already been paid.\"There is proof of what I told you.The team failed in social communication, talked about the choice of winners, failed in transparency.Wrongly picked winners based on undisclosed criteria and chose to delete the Tweet and not give satisfaction.I've been playing on the site for 3 years, I've always participated in promotions and I've already recommended the site to several friends, so much so that I even have people with my code.  But I've never seen anything as ugly as this.See for yourself and tell me if I'm wrong?Any chance I get, I will talk about the marketing and promotions team, saying how selective and lacking in credibility they are.  How shameful is that.The most absurd thing is that this is not a lack of money, but really bad character.  They preferred to delete the tweet and inform the support team to DISREGARD people who queried thisIn addition, the fact that they said in the initial tweet that there was no point in cheating that they would check and still paid a wrong winner, just shows the incompetence of the team even more.Great embarrassment.",

Not setting a precise deadline leaves room for manipulation. I am seconding this, reading the details in the opening post --and before reading khaled0111's comment-- gave me an impression that OP hit a language barrier. The promo was about rewarding oldest user by asking them to provide their account's name and age, not Stake's own account. Thus, in a way, OP is not even eligible to enter the contest as his answer is wrong, he didn't enroll his own account, he enrolled Stake's.",

Stake asked, \"Who's got the oldest stake account?\" which clearly indicates whoever comment here with the oldest account will be the winner. OP haven't posted about their own account. As Stake said, it has to be a private account.However, as told above, mods or any internal should be out of the contest as they are very likely to own the oldest account and still involved/active.",

First of all, I am sure you understand now that Stake's promo is to reward the oldest account which enrolling to the competition, not to point out the oldest account known. For example, if bitcointalk provided the same competition, I should enrolled mine, registered on 3rd of February 2016 instead of pointing and \"enrolling\" theymos [registered 9th February 2010], I can not and may not enrolled theymos'.OP's case, he misunderstood the instruction, he pointed out \"theymos\" instead of enrollling his own account.",
