  "content": "Good news that the CBN rate has been removed from noncustodial wallets and exchanges' naira exchange rate as CBN do not determine the Investors and Exporters rate again. It was frustrating before, but I have seen it changed and more correlate to the parallel market rate.This thread is about BTC/NGN price speculation. No altcoin should be included. USD can be included. I noticed we are discussing BTC/USD also.Most or all of us here are using the parallel (black) market rate to exchange naira to bitcoin or bitcoin to naira. Because of this, we are going to use naira exchange rate in the parallel market. We are not using CBN rate, neither are we using Investors and Exporters rate. But this may change with time if there is any need to change it to I&E rate.We can make short term or long term speculation. But we know how long term speculations are more accurate if compared with short term speculations. We should not take the speculation on this thread as an information to be used for investment. This thread would likely be helpful, but research more before investing in bitcoin. Do not post on this thread if you have nothing good to speculate about. I will not make this thread to be self-modetrated, but any spam will be reported and most likely would be deleted by a moderator.We are using the Parallel market rate. If you are not using the parallel market rate, specify the one that you use.",

It was frustrating before, but I have seen it changed and more correlate to the parallel market rate.Yeah.. Its a good news to have a parallel value for Naira/Dollar on all platforms without conflicting interest, because moreover that CBN rate that was on exchange & wallets was useless in the sense that it can't be used to buy coins due to limitations placed on both Visa and master cards, of which black market was the only option to the common man. Moreover, I saw that Binance started using the black market rate on it's spot trading like 5days ago, and same as \"Trust wallet\" whose value per dollar started falling gradually from on the 15th of June at #610/$1 to this day at #816/$1 on Trust wallet.

Are you being sarcastic right now with this statement,  because we all know that none of the offers mentioned economic tools really have effects on Bitcoin price,  both on the long-term or short-term speculation,  bitcoin has its own price dynamics that have proven to have voided all other statistical analyses and this is what has made bitcoin price unpredictable. I welcome this thread as a discussion thread just like Bitcoin speculations on the wall observer thread,  but this one is for our local board and the currency of speculation is ₦‎ vs BTC.But even at that,  ₦‎ vs BTC price speculation may not yield much response from the local board members since most people will not be able to make a post since they may lack what contribution to make in this regard because bitcoin to naira price speculation analyses tools may be hard for most newbies unless they will just read others comments that are if we work to keep the thread/discussion active.",

And if we tok about BTC and NGN speculation, and since the CBN has removed their rate from the exchange market  the price might favourable, because the parallel market is always a preferable one to the CBN, Investors, and Exporters exchanges rate. I believe when when BTC price goes up  again to 60k$ again, the naira will also be appreciated to the owners of BTC  more it is now.And the CBN policy change again, everything will be back again but I don't think the CBN will restructured the exchange to the previous rate again because it might also affect their market.",

I think this is a downgrade and I would rather prefer selling with the Black market rate.We can not use the CBN annoying rate, it has gone up but because of the high volatility and the weighted average in the I&E window, the price CBN listed is still low. Either we use the parallel market rate or the I&E rate. But with time, the CBN rate will increase if the volatility in the I&E window become reduced, unlike as it went up from ₦461 to over ₦750.Edit:I have just checked the CBN rate just now:https://www.cbn.gov.ng/rates/exchratebycurrency.aspThe CBN rate has been updated to ₦753. Which means the volatility in the I&E window has decreased. But we can not use the CBN rate because it takes the weighted average of the I&E rate. So, what is more correct is the precent price on I&E window.So either we use the I&E rate or the parallel market rate. I was first suggesting the parallel market rate just because it is what we are using yet as CBN ban cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. But if CBN support it, we have no option than to use the I&E rate. Changing it won't be of any issue because I&E rate and parallel market rate looks similar.",

Yeah bitcoin at 25 million plus after having more than 2% increase in the last 24 hours but aside the XRP FOMO and the current reports of big financial institutions moving towards bitcoin ETF, I think the bitcoin to Naira is also greatly affected by the fact that the Naira is down against the dollar. The Naira is trading above 815 against the dollar which also increases the price of bitcoin. So far so good the I and E setting the market hasn’t helped the Naira against the other currencies but with time we shall see This is a great initiative to have our own local speculation board (+1).",
