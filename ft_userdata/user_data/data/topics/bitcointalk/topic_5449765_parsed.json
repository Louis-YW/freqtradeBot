Just as the story teaches that you should be careful with the people you help in delivering sealed packages, you should also be careful with people at ATM machines that give you their cards and ask that you help them withdraw money. Those cards may be stolen cards, and because ATM machines have cameras that take your pictures on every withdrawal, you may be the one to be arrested for the stolen card because on CCTV you are the one with the card making the withdrawal.",

No amount of explanation will set her free from security operatives unless the woman wey give her d drug come testify say na she give am. Dis na call to be more vigilant on who we wan help and d type of packages we receive to help deliver for people. Thorough searching of packages and assurance on the type of goods to deliver abroad is very important now. May we not fall into a thing of pity when we try to help others.",

For the now, if possible we can categorically state our mode of interaction here so everyone member of this local board would see it and be guided based on our standing order. With this there would be limit to some sort of topics created here and when I mean limit I mean there would not be any how irrelevant thread created here, topics with not value or guide to scale through in this platform.If we can move a motion then that would be fine for the full house to decide wether to cast a bite or not if that should be done. Let us put our local board in good form and not the type that when other international board visits,they would see the level of our interactions they would not dare us. As it stands now do you all know that currently our board is on the focus for some activities?",
