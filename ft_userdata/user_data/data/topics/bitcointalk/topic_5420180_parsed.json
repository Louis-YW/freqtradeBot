I have reviewed reports about the service and there are no complaints about it. Unfortunately, the options in this field are somewhat limited, and users must seek the assistance of those who are more experienced to choose the best option.There is also disperse application which I also consider to be a good application and is very commonly used with the exception that it charges fees for the service that it is better to compare with the fees on the rest of the options.",

If you want to do the former, just import the private keys and empty the wallet to a specific destination. If you want to do the latter, just fill the \"Pay to\" form like that:Code:ADDRESS_1, BTC_AMOUNTADDRESS_2, BTC_AMOUNTADDRESS_3, BTC_AMOUNTADDRESS_4, BTC_AMOUNTetc.",

Disperse were mentioned already above. Multisender is a tool for ethereum based tokens while bulksender have it different network support such as binance, ethereum, tron, matic, AVAX and solana network.Code:https://disperse.app/https://bulksender.app/https://multisend.org/Now if you're talking about bitcoin, then electrum is the best choice as already mentioned many times above.Another note, this multi sender is probably uses large gas fees, because they are designed to send at least 20 transactions above or so. So expect that fees they required is high. Disperse.app is somewhat the cheapest fees required on the list above.",

Also I find a tool called cointool app but the gas fee is higher than if I send the transaction one by one myself, is this normal? The prices are volatile now, dump at the moment and that possible the fee is more growing up than usual. Many transaction are in and out from wallet to exchange, and vice versa. I think whatever wallet you want to use is the same, the fee is not predictable, it could be growing up from today. There have site which you can use to multiple send, https://multisend.org, but I never tried. dwyor",

Use a Trust Wallet App, is more helpful to choose BNB, Tron or Matic chains for any given transaction and they are low transaction fees that the wallet can accumulate difference type of chain in one wallet.",

The percentage of charge fees you get depends on you coin you are transacting with. There are network pools that assumes these fees so you can not get precise feedback as no one knows your coins.As for multiple at a time, that is far unknown to me.",
