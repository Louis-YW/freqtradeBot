You learn from others who are ahead, how they construct their sentences, their sources, crypto books and speakers they listen to…stuff like that. The pressure to get merits can easily get to newbies and other growing ranks alike, I think it is more of a need to feel a sense of belonging than having the required rank to participate in signature campaigns. Consistency requires a long term commitment. But first I think you’ve to have quality first, if a person is making low quality posts and is consistent in doing so for a number of years, that will yield no positive response from the community. When being consistent, make sure you’re improving along the way.",

The forum is all for keeping your privacy private irrespective of this been a centralized platform. All you just have to do to succeed here is staying consistent in a positive way. Each user that has been highly rated on the forum didn't just do that overnight, they have payed their dues by been consistent for sometime so if you want to achieve same success or accolades then you have to be consistent as well. The forum does recognize quality writings as there's nobody who is putting efforts in their writing that hasn't been appreciate in some way. You either get appreciated with merits or get a slot in signature campaigns for your quality writings. We also have the knowledge benefits that been consistent brings you as the more you engaged with thread here, the more you leaen new things daily. As a newbie you just have to let go of all the distractions that the forum brings and try to filter the advise on the forum and only take those which will be beneficial to you in the long run like accumulating Bitcoin now.",

As related to this forum, someone can be said to be consistent if on a regular basis, they make comments, create posts and partake in activities that help bolster the forum. The rewards of merit and bounties is the product of effort as merits can only be gotten when a post more than makes sense and buttress the point of discussion in total. To stay hunger and yearn to be better here is the drive that encourages a consistent effort.",

Some people tend to pressure themselves to be able to meet up with their specific goals especially when they've got no boss to pressurize them like in this forum. While others don't like being under pressure in any way, they're people who work with a deadline to gain positive results. There's a saying \"that given a enough time nothing is achieved\". Those who set a deadline to hit a specific rank in the forum, learn a specific knowledge and pass a certain information, are already under self pressure. I don't think consistency takes out pressure, only the subconscious removes pressure most especially self imposed pressure. Therefore, unless the said member hits his goals within the expected time frame he will have no rest. On the whole, consistency helps in any field, but rarely cures pressure because working under a deadline requires congruous pressure.",

The pressure can only come from you if you set goals for yourself and aren't working toward them, especially if you want to rank up and succeed in signature campaigns.
