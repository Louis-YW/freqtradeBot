Retail investors do not have the power to do market manipulation. Actually we need more mature retail investor to lower the whale influence(I am not talking about speculators who will react instantly after a news release). People should use non-custodial exchanges or wallets to secure their funds. It doesn't need any fees to open and if you are long-term investor gas fees are not that insane either.Quote from: Husires on November 10, 2022, 10:49:45 AMWere custodial exchanges a mistake?TBH after what happened in the last couple of days, investors will remain fearful of keeping their funds in custodial exchanges. If 16B worth of exchange can fall to zero overnight, this can happen with other exchanges too. None of them show transparency about their reserve so investors won't trust centralized exchange until they make their balance sheet public.",

I'd say you're wrong under certain circumstances and depending on how you define \"manipulation\".  I'm also going to assume you're talking about the market for bitcoin only.  When average investors act in concert (during periods of panic selling or severe FOMO), they certainly can move the market--but that's not manipulation, it's just market forces in action.  And bitcoin's market cap is high enough that I don't think a single whale could move it at will.  I'm not sure how much bitcoin you'd have to dump on the market (or buy) just to get the price to move, say, $100--but I would think that it'd be a massive amount.  When bitcoin's market cap was much smaller it was easier for whales to manipulate the price if they wanted to, but even with the price now at $16,250 I don't think it's feasible.  And man I'm such a pleb.  I don't think I'll ever move past pleb status.",

They're considered the whales too in the market so, it's two way for them and they can manipulate the markets anytime they badly want to.But the good thing is that everyone is starting to learn how dangerous they could be. And whether they've got safu or any fu feature they've got to give confidence to their users.Everyone has that idea now if you don't own the keys, you don't own your coins and we always say that.",

      "body": "Perhaps people are scared but it is difficult to give up completely with centralized exchanges because they provide us with a lot of services and facilities that DEXs do not yet provide. Investors who put money in CEX are not holding but they are day traders, P2P traders...CEX is a tool, a place for them to make profits in the market. If people were scared and wanted to stay away from centralized exchanges, maybe they did it when Mt.gox crashed, the crash of Mt.gox is much bigger than what FTX caused.",

All market manipulations take place with the help of the market participants (or the \"average investors\") otherwise it won't happen. Take a look at altcoins' pump and dumps. They have to have the pumping groups and other sheep that would participate in it otherwise the pump won't happen nor will it give them any profit.So when we are talking about investors selling or buying together it depends on why they are doing that. If they are making an irrational decision based on lies then it is still considered market manipulation. For example if they are panic selling just because some stock market got dumped, or if they are panic buying because some celebrity tweeted something about bitcoin then they are both clear examples of market manipulation.",

      "body": "Honestly a very good thing. Not only because retailers are moving to private key wallets but that retail investors have now become this much intelligent that they are aware of the risk that these custodial exchanges are just looting away your money by competing against each other and eventually if you are on such an exchange you will always lose money. I really like this change but This is an opportunity for decentralised exchanges to buckle up and give more trading opportunities to people as wallets are not effecient enough for exchange.",

When people know what you have they try to find your weakness and broke you. CZ knew FTX doesn't have the reserve they were talking about so he takes advantage. If CZ doesn't know that this may never happen. Retail investors are the blood cell of the whole bitcoin ecosystem. Without them, bitcoin will be a ball for big players who will constantly battle against one another to take them down. Regulation may give them safety and assurance that someone will not try to gamble with their money.",
