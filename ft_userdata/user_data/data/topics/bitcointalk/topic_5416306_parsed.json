  "content": "Despite the absence of legal status for cryptocurrencies in Namibia. Payments in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will still be accepted, according to a statement from the Central Bank of Namibia.This occured after the gradual inclusion of \"virtual assets (VA) and virtual assets service providers (VASP) under its Fintech Innovations Regulatory Framework through its innovation center\".Although digital currencies like Bitcoin (BTC) are still not legally recognized, the BON had emphasized in a statement released around the end of September that merchants and dealers may accept payment in this form if they are \"ready to participate in such an exchange or trade.\" This is the statement that was previously made below: The bank's changing position on cryptocurrencies appears to be a sign that the BON is becoming more accepting of them. The central bank stated in the past:It did ‚Äúnot recognise, support and recommend the possession, utilisation and trading of cryptocurrencies by members of the public.‚Äù The bank also warned Namibians there would be no legal recourse in the event they lost money.Namibia does not, however, rank among the top African nations in terms of the number of bitcoin users. However, as a result of this action by Namibia's central bank, there is hope that the usage of cryptocurrency would be accepted and made legal there, which will spread the beneficial use of it among other African nations.https://finbold.com/namibias-central-bank-says-bitcoin-can-be-accepted-as-payment/https://www.bon.com.na/https://www.google.com/amp/s/cryptonomist.ch/2022/10/07/central-bank-of-namibia-enables-payments-in-bitcoin-and-other-crypto/https://www.namibian.com.na/211884/archive-read/BoN-will-not-defend-victims-of-crypto-scammers",

Allowing other digital currency for any kind of payment except Bitcoin will not make their bitcoiners to believe that the governments is working for their favour without include Bitcoin, because many bitcoiners in the country are very ready to start accepting Bitcoin as a payment in their businesses.",

You are very correct and am sure you covered almost everything as regards to African governments and Bitcoin adoption generally, I leave in Nigeria and I know what it takes to go through the third-party banking system and how Bitcoin has become a better alternative even though some African countries not making Bitcoin legal and central banks attacks on Bitcoin, even though the is a high volume of cryptocurrency trading in this countries. I had an ugly experience last month in Cameron, I traveled in from Nigeria to Cameron for a company event, and on the last day of my departure back to Nigeria my flight was canceled and I was already out of Cameron CFA, and no one around unless Nigeria the exchange of both local currencies was almost impossible even though both are African countries. I hard to make use of my Bitcoin exchanged it and used the money to see myself through. So in Africa, Bitcoin has become a better alternative to banknotes.",

I think this is something that a lot of people miss out on. Bitcoin truly has achieved its goal, and gone well beyond what we thought was possible all those years ago. I think part of the plan was creating something like it, but getting people to adopt it, and actively use it was another challenge all together. For example, in the UK we don't get presented with the same challenges, exchanging local currencies, and all of that is relatively simple. So, it's always nice to learn about how Bitcoin has actually got people out of a situation which 15 years ago they may have been stuck in. I did touch upon it, but I do believe Africa is one of the places proving this every day, that Bitcoin is a viable option, but also has already achieved its goal.",

What is important is that Bitcoin is given an open status and not what China did to cryptocurrency and mining which was then unfortunate.

With a population of about 2.5 million people, unemployment has constantly declined. They have good infrastructures which include multiple internet service providers. It can be assumed that, unlike most African countries, Namibians can invest in Bitcoin because most of them can provide their basic needs and have some kind of extra savings. This country also has an excellent literacy rate because just less than 9% of the population are uneducated.But the good news is that about 50% do not have access to banking facilities due to the high cost of financial services and excessive bureaucratic bottlenecks associated with banking services. Banking services in Africa are sometimes nightmares; some people would never want such experiences. They are not customer-centered and very demanding. Bitcoin would be an appropriate alternative for the citizens of this promising nation.The government just woke up from its slumber to understand that a country that derives a large part of its income from tourism but discourages the use of Bitcoin is making a big economic blunder. Nevertheless, we hope that this move would be prosperous.",

Their local currency is subject to very high inflation and it makes sense for such countries to switch to btc. It is possible that the mass adoption of crypto currencies will come not from the side of developed countries and strong economies, because in principle everything is fine with them and there are no strong incentives to change something in their system. Therefore, I assume that the implementation of bitcoin may begin from African countries, like Namibia. The main reason for which is that the value of the national currency is rapidly depreciating.",

The reason may be the strict Bank policies and regulations that may impose a burden on the people of Namibia to remain subject to the bank. Whereas Bitcoin provides them with a solution where they don't need any regulations and requirements to hold Bitcoin. Plus Bitcoin has a fluctuating value that can provide benefits, so the people of Namibia have a potential source of income without the need to contact the bank.",

The western world has deprived the African nations the basic rights, that's why they are still too under developed.

This announcement doesn't make Bitcoin legal tender. The Central Bank has just decided to look the other way, and it doesn't mind that individuals or businesses use virtual assets (that's the term they use and not Bitcoin) as a medium of exchange. But they still warn their citizens of the dangers of using unregulated currencies (cryptocurrencies), and they are considering introducing a Namibian CBDC. If that happens, they would rather have people use the centralized government asset rather than bitcoin, which they can't touch or regulate.",
