Whenever it comes to do business with members of bitcointallk, majority that have interacted with me know, I give them the best attention I can offer. I do this because I consider people i interact with from the forum as more of a family than just business connection. I can't actually recall this very situation playing out like this but I'm not denying it and I want to apologize openly to you if I might have offended you.I clear my telegram message very often because of the numerous spams (bounty appeals, request to join my service or offer me a fake campaign etc) messages I get often and as a result of this exercise I might've mistakenly cleared some legitimate messages in the process but it wasn't intentional to threat your client in that way. Once again I apologize, you could see I communicated with you well at first before this other incident happened. Your feedback was appreciated irrespective of how negative it was. We'll always strive to improve our service and maybe we work together in future.",

Yes, but it's a legitimate request. Deleting my message and blocking me right away (+ deleting @billl0's message and blocking him as well right away) is not how a professional business is done.

That's why I've recommended your service to a client and I was surprised that you deleted my message and blocked me...After all, I've the same profile picture on Telegram for years now...",

There are so many imposters using my information to try scamming also my workers don't use the same username or ID as I do. If you follow that link, you'll be chatting with me directly and  sorry this didn't happen today. Ps: 1 hour ago I was busy watching POWER on Netflix with my girlfriend. The image you showed, my name isn't written as the one that shows when you follow the link I share above.",

I have that link from your ANN topic and it says @PedroBrainbossBM but I'll check it of course as I know that we had a previous discussion. Edit: after checking all the Telegram @names it seems to be a glitch from Telegram that even when typing \"PedroBrainbossBM\" will lead me to a fake group (I've typed \"PedroBrainbossBM\" on my phone because I'm not using Telegram on my Laptop). I'm sorry for the inconvenience as it's really a scam group, which shows up when still typing \"PedroBrainbossBM\". Telegram should fix it ASAP. I'll delete my OP, my feedback and my comment in your topic. Sorry for the inconvenience once again....",

I know this problem has been solved, but this could help alert those who may not be aware. Especially those who may want to search @PedroBrainbossBM instead of just following the telegram link the Bounty Management service AnnouncementThere's actually a person trying to impersonate CryptopreneurBrainboss  and he created so many different channels recently 11th March. So the telegram link is shared in the channel, but it's in form of hypertext link. On the text, it looks as though it is @@PedroBrainbossBM but if you click on it, it redirects to @PedroBrainbassBM",
