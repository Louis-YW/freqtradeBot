But dis amount of money is too much for government that mean well for their citizens because, people are going through a lot of challenges in the country which 2 billions can even do something that will create job opportunities for people to reduce suffering in the land. Well, is no longer a new thing to me because many presidents has did it which this new elected president Bola Ahmed Tinubu will like to do the same thing too when he is preparing to hand over power, but I still believe in Nigeria that one day those things will stop 4 us to be proud of our country Nigeria.",

Government suppose prioritize tins like food, shelter, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and job creation wey go benefit citizens wella. But e fit be say the money dem allocate for villa renovation fit dey for national budget sake of security, history, or maintenance reasons. Even still, government suppose make sure say dem dey accountable and responsive to people wey dem dey govern, and make sure say dem use resources to build the nation and help people.But e no get as e wan take be, the money we dem allocate too choke and e sure me die say na one of the means to embezzle funds.

Let's look at clear and open facts about this matter, I mean c'mon it is the ASO ROCK  for God sake and we all are aware of changes that seasonally take place when their is change of governance and it happens in almost all levels of government. For example the change of my state government saw the renewal of almost all the equipment and building if not all in the government house when the new governor wanted to resume office and it cost them billions of naira and this one we talking about is refurnishing of the presidential villa you must imagine the cost materials used in that building so the above mention is worth what its been used for and no need to get all dramaticall about the amount..",

Indeed 14 billion naira is not too much for the renovation of Aso Rock unless you don't have a mental picture of what the structures in the villa are, because anyone familiar with what is at stake in the Asio villa, will know that any renovation work will cost amounts running into billions of naira. So I don't see any reason why we should complain about an amount that can not solve any national issues, most especially now that the inflation rate os extremely high and the cost of building materials has gone over the roof.",

But if we complain, who will hear our cry. This is what happens every time there’s transition of government and it’s not peculiar to the Aso Rock only, it also happens in all the 36 states of the federation too. After the refurnishing, they’ll still be monthly or annual allowance for maintenance of those places again. We just have to face the reality that they’re ripping us and we can’t just continue like this, we hope for a change soon.

I believe maintenance is also a very good culture to uphold, especially the presidential residence, but the annoying thing is that the Nigerian government has a lot of misplaced priorities and focuses on things that are not necessary. the issue of unemployment has become a global problem just that Nigeria has a high rate of unemployment the best thing now is for the youths to make themselves useful by either starting a small business or learning a skill. waiting for the government will only hurt you and waste your time the only thing the government is good at is making empty promises.",
