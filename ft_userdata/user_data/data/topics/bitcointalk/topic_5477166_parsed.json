  "content": "house always win, also bigger house eat smaller house (buyout)I think we have underestimate michael saylor, although I'm strong believer that house always win, it seem I failed to realized also big house can eat the small house alive. Obviously michael saylor is very shady, we can finally see micheal saylor has a lot of hidden wealth, which make him the bigger house than anyone else, nobody know how bigger exactly is the house michael saylor. Despite bigger house can eat the smaller house, the rule that house always win is still relevant today, because we can just rewrite it into \"bigger house always win\" instead of \"house always win\"good luck",
