And in developing nations, during the pandemic, many millions could afford the cost of a  vaccine, but didn't have primary access, due to proactive contracts from developed nations. These are a signi-ficant proportion of our market.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Bioviratech combines the world of the pharmaceutical distribution of vaccines, international law, smart contracts/Crypto and blockchain to generate legal contracts linked to unique smart contracts. These create tokenized options thatgive the bearer the right to, but not the cost of, a vaccinefor a future pandemic after the most vulnerable have been vaccinated.000000000000000000000000000000Legal ObligationLegal obligation with pharmaceutical companies to embrace a more even distribution of required vaccines.    Subsidiary TransactionSimple collaboration across regions for government and regulatory limitations of international distribution    Bioviratech TokensBVT & BVTD speculative tokensdistributed evenly, providing purchaseaccess to available vaccines..BIOVIRATECH..VISION.000000000000000000000000000    0000  Addressing the disproportionate distribution of vaccines, experienced by many countries and even delays and inefficiencies within Europe.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Negotiations with Pharmaceutical companies to create 360 contracts to produce options for a vaccine for a future pandemic.Tokenizing the legal contracts using smart contracts utilizing blockchain technologyfor transparency of transactions without compromising privacy.Maintaining the value of vaccines and recouping all associated losses and costs of manufacturing and distribution with no particular preference to any region..BVT TOKEN..DISTRIBUTION.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000││││││││││││││   The amount that can be purchased by each person is both limited and staggered in this form.  From day 1-15, one purchase per person and from day 16-30 unlimited in both amounts thatcan be purchased and how many times per person.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000Day 1-2: up to $5 per person (max. purchase)Day 3-4: up to $10 per person (max. purchase)Day 5-6: up to $100 per person (max. purchase)Day 7-10: up to $1000 per person (max. purchase)Day 11-15: up to $10k per person (max. purchase)Day 16-30: unlimited maximum purchase.BVT TOKEN..SUMMARY.Contract:0x5dc8dd8F4A132695DFc62f A6fc6992Be880Ee51D00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000   Presale refund policyIf the contracts are incomplete, the presale will be refunded from the  Administration fee of 2%, if the Admin fee equals, at least, the presale funds raised plus  50%. i.e Admin fee (2%) = $360k + $180kICO refund policyThe amount of refund depends upon the community. For example, if the community votes to  deploy funds and the team can’t close the contract with a pharmaceutical company, the  estimated cost would be :     • 2% - Exchange fees       • 2% - Administration fees     • 1% - (Per month) Escrow fees00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000So the refund would be 100% - 5% = 95% (minus transaction costs and  changes to your cryptocurrency). If the community vote to hold in Escrow until the team has completed contracts with a  pharmaceutical company, if a refund is required, the estimated cost could be:     • 2% - Exchange fees     • 2% - Administration fees     • 12% - (Per month) Escrow fees (12 months)Thus, the refund would be 100% - 19% = 81%(minus transaction costs &changes to your cryptocurrency). Escrow is a perfect way to protect the community’s interests and the community votes as to which  Escrow company they would like to use..BIOVIRATECH..TEAM.00000000000000000000000Terence HarteCEONeil Andrew BuckleyBusiness consultantDr. John BolodeokuMedical consultant00000000000000000000000Simon AngelCTOOladapo Ibironke (MIoD)CDO & COOIchiro DaichiEngineerMuhammad KashifHead of Design",
