A bear market is an opportunity for you to stack up more Bitcoins in preparation for the Bull market. Not so long ago, Bitcoin was worth about $16K, today it's almost 100% ROI since then, and I can bet there are so many people regretting and wishing they had bought more Bitcoins at that time",

Now the price of bitcoin had crossed new high of 30,200$, it was expected one as compared to the previous price of bitcoin. It was hard for bitcoin to cross the value of 30k dollars over a month. But the same price of bitcoin had crossed the 30k dollars due to some good number of investors into bitcoin investments after the first quarter of this year. Now the bear market was over with the pump and you can cash out bitcoin to fiat with some profits. Whenever the price of bitcoin had reduced due to bear market, it’s essential one of the new people to buy some coin at the dump in the price of bitcoin. Holding for the longer period is important one.",

You already know after the bear market there will be a bull market that all bitcoin traders look forward to. But for those who are not affected by bear markets or bull markets are those who trade futures, they have up and down options to be able to make profits from both conditions, but the risk will certainly be greater.

This is a sign that Bitcoin has a lot of encouragement so that it can reach its highest price again. Lots of positive news for Bitcoin these days. Such as the statement of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who said that Bitcoin is a way out of the splash zone when this bubble always burstsQuoteCryptocurrencies like Bitcoin give the public an escape route from the splatter zone when this bubble invariably bursts. So the White House is colluding with the banksters to keep us all trapped in the bubble of profiteering and control.https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1645499840963518476",

An opportunity to invest more by filling your bags. If you look at the dip, you can not invest but panic sell. Hold for a long term and watch as it grows everyday. Bitcoin price was far below $17K months past but now $30k and still going high. Does this not tell you anything OP. If I  were you, I would do away with FUD and key in.

Last year from June to December was the bearish market,so many weak hands couldn't be patient to hold their coins. Instead,due to panic,they sold off their investment thinking that it was the doom time for bitcoin because they lack the knowledge of their investment. This year started the pump from January and at April,the price of bitcoin has hit 30k. Those investors who understand people price movement saw last year bear market, as an opportunity for them to accumulate more bitcoin to their portfolios. Such people will be smiling at the profit now and will be happy for the price increase. We are in the time that bitcoin price is going up gradually, stop talking about the bear market anymore and think on how to join the moving train,by purchasing bitcoin if you have not cause the bearish days are over.",

On the other hand, there are traders who are still profiting whether it is a bull or a bear market. Overall, there are some benefits of bear market still especially if you took the opportunity, and bought it at a lower price. Bear market being unpredictable? In what way?Like you said, investors and entrepreneurs really need to adopt to how Bitcoin moves, so that they will be a successful one, and earn profits from either bull or bear market.",
