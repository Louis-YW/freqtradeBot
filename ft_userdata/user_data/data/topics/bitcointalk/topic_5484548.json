  "content": "The biggest problem Satoshi had to address was the problem of sybil attack.  But socially you can't stop the ever creation of fake identities to look like a view is supportedHayek's work has been hijacked by nefarious people most notably including Saifedean.  Many bitcoin are at least vaguely away of Hayek's work. What they don't know is Hayek's work ABSOLUTELY flies in the face of Saifedean's bitcoin standard orientation of bitcoin.Hayek warns against people like Saifedean selling destructive policy and ideas to people.The bitcoin maximalist view also wrap's satoshi's perspective in a lie.  If satoshi was a fan of Hayek then he meant to FIX inflation not be the originator of the cause of GLOBAL HYPERINFLATION.I show this very well in my works and I show that the views that quickly jump online to counter mine.  Are unfounded, they won't cite Hayek, they will only TELL you about Hayek.  And thus part of a greater sybil attack on the communities intelligence.Thus I offer a few tools for traversing Hayek that will allow the community to understand and highlight this nefarious wrapping of Satoshi and Hayek so the myth and ignorance can be lifted.https://github.com/jalToorey/IdealMoney/wiki/On-the-Tools-and-Metaphors-Necessary-To-Properly-Traverse-Hayek%E2%80%99s-Denationalization-of-Money-In-the-Face-and-Light-of-BitcoinI'm still finishing a part 2 and 3 etc.  But this link here is super damning.",
