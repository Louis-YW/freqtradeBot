Or is it done automatically?Thank you for replyJust input the smart contract of tokens on dextool and poocoin. Or even so name of the tokens you wanted to see the chart.Its automatically there if the project is popular or famous since they display top 10 high volumes on those platform. But if its not, then you need to manually add the smart contract which should be recommended to avoid such copy paste project.Many are imitating a project using a different contract and some got victim by it if not check carefully if they looking on the right token chart.",

The thing that you shall do to copy the smartcontract of token from the pancakeswap or BSC scan and then put it on the search toolbar on the dextools or poocoin. The system will be automatically searching the pair in the blockchain. You can choose which pair from the list.
