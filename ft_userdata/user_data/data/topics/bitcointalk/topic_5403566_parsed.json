Way to go buddy. Reach for the stars.Thank you for your kind words, don't worry. There is no room for spam in this forum and you know it well as you've been in this forum longer than I am if I am not mistaken. By the way, for others who have misjudge my capability. I am also a bounty manager way back 2017-2018 where the market is as lively as last year but because of competition, I decided to stop offering my bounty management services as I can see that the competition is getting hotter as days passes by. There are plenty of trolls that will attack someone's management especially if they can see a little mistake or even if they don't. I remember debating big bounty managers here before you became well known in managing bounty campaigns. For now, I am trying my best to sustain my daily needs as I have no work right now and I am hoping that you can give me a little space here to get some clients. *To avoid spam*- I will create post in notepad and I will send it to my client and they will be the one to decide whether that post is in good quality or not. Then they will be the one to post it and not me. - And I will only give a maximum of 5 post per client. This is to avoid spam in this forum as I am very thankful also to this forum because I earned a lot last bull season by doing bounty management work. Cheers and Have a good day to you, I respect you as you were able to reach that high without any big attacks from previous bounty managers who wants to monopolize the bounty management campaign services. Or if you are friend of them then it's good. Quote from: PX-Z on June 22, 2022, 07:01:59 AMQuote from: Cr3ator on June 22, 2022, 06:32:33 AMI can post up to 50 post perday.

As I can see, you came here last 2017 only and I didn't bother looking if what are your achievements so far as I can see that you are not a manager nor someone who is higher to it. In terms of hard work. Don't worry, I can do 3 or even 10x of work compare to you just to sustain my financial needs. Don't worry, I am not planning in applying to any managers here as I was once before and I know better what a managers need.",

All I know is this kind of poster is commonly kicked in every campaign for spamming and burst posting. And i know most of the campaign managers or people will think the same.Don't doubt someone who is good to what they are doing. You know, at first when I am doing this kind of service. It takes me like 20-30 minutes just to complete a good quality of post. But if you keep doing it over and over again then it is like a routine and time will just reduce dramatically. Here's an advice, what do you think is the reason why bounty managers will kick their applicants like burst posting? Here is my answer as a bounty manager. \"They didn't follow the rules that I set\" or \"They didn't follow the forum rules\". These are only the most important thing that you should remember especially that I see you wearing a signature.Â  If you want to stay to whatever campaign you would like to join. Here's the tip. Just follow the forum rules and the bounty manager rules and you are good to go. In every campaign, the bounty managers will decide whatever rules that they will set the same as mine.I set different rules compare to other managers and I am doing it because I think this is the best rules that I think will help the forum to become clean and for my management to become easier.
