  "content": "So there's this meme coin called DogeBonk, they were on the BnB chain but migrated to ETH chain because BNB is basically dead.Some feats they did- First crypto in space- Time square billboards- other dumb antics to get attentionThe old token ATH was 200m.Here is the current chart https://dexscreener.com/ethereum/0x54bd053c294da6000064d82214f1866e3a10db15Another similar token called HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu(HPOs) also did the switch from bnb to ETH and is now at 55m on the ETH side.with way less antics than than dogebonk.Again this is a meme coin, so invest what you can lose because you will lose everything.If you have other meme coin suggestions let me know. preferbly below 5m market cap.",
