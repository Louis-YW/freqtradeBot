  "content": "Hi everyone,I was looking into the Bitcoin Genesis block and noticed something interesting. The hash of the Genesis block, 0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f, has two more leading zeros in its hex representation. This means its difficulty is thousands of times higher than what was initially set.Any idea why?I'll print the next 3 block hashes to illustrate:Block0:0x000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26fBlock1:0x00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048Block2:0x000000006a625f06636b8bb6ac7b960a8d03705d1ace08b1a19da3fdcc99ddbdBlock3:0x0000000082b5015589a3fdf2d4baff403e6f0be035a5d9742c1cae6295464449",

Also, if you want to see, which other blocks could be mined, then you can try to move those testnet coins: 16fb1c624b3658c78630c39f1c33e8f3dbdb71373f33eb22c6abe4405c0815bc.

He couldn't have mined the genesis block and then changed the difficulty afterwards since that would change the nBits field, change the hash, and therefore invalidate the block.",

      "body": "QuoteHe couldn't have mined the genesis block and then changed the difficulty afterwards since that would change the nBits field, change the hash, and therefore invalidate the block.I assume he updated the difficulty in the code that generated the block data, but not in the code that checked if some block header is acceptable or not. Because if you explore the testnet transaction I gave you, then you notice that you can find a lot of block headers with 32 leading zero bits, and not that much headers with 40 zero bits. That means, his code probably mined, and skipped all of those 32-bit blocks, and landed on the first 40-bit block he could find.See transaction 16fb1c624b3658c78630c39f1c33e8f3dbdb71373f33eb22c6abe4405c0815bc in testnet, and see, how many 40-bit block headers you have, and how many 32-bit block headers are there, with a different extraNonce. Also, garlonicon in the past did some re-mining, you can find in this post:Quote from: garlonicon on January 31, 2022, 07:33:58 PMQuoteGenesis block header hash is this (hex): 000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f Note that it starts with 43 zero bits. Why? The block target difficulty was much lower (around 32 bits), so we can assume Satoshi did this on purpose.There is more: if you use a different extraNonce value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, you will notice that there are more headers starting with 40 zero bits or more:Code:extraNonce: 0x01, time: 0x495fab1d, offset: 0x0c, nonce: 0x3429da6f, hash: 00000000 00052ab4 78b6f8a2 dcaba26a 189361c9 030b5d56 c524cb7b ddf00d0cextraNonce: 0x02, time: 0x495fab20, offset: 0x09, nonce: 0x6f42bb66, hash: 00000000 00381808 e3b876ad 01e1262e 3a4ca528 72b1cc25 ca072fbd bc29d41fextraNonce: 0x03, time: 0x495fab1f, offset: 0x0a, nonce: 0xe3d4f1f1, hash: 00000000 00792af0 bf962bc1 d3622071 92709091 65ae7c7b f8589911 d8277fa5extraNonce: 0x04, time: 0x495fab29, offset: 0x00, nonce: 0x7c2bac1d, hash: 00000000 0019d668 9c085ae1 65831e93 4ff763ae 46a2a6c1 72b3f1b6 0a8ce26fIf you try to find just another 40-bit block hash with the same extraNonce, it will be more than 300 seconds away.

Also Signet doesn't rely on the PoW so it's difficulty can be much lower.IIRC even at difficulty 1, a naive single threaded mining program does still take quite a bit longer than 10 minutes.
