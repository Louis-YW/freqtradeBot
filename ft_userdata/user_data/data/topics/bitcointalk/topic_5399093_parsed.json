Sounds like a ponzi scheme to me, I could be wrong but this is the first impression I have of this site. well some other things that I find strange:1 - The site is using the binance exchange or BNB logo when the site does not belong to binance2 - the site is giving away BNB free, this doesn't sound good because there's no way this can be sustainable in the long term",

I have an assumption that this is done at the expense of those investors who joined this project earlier, buying levels. Thus, we see that this project is a classic ponzi scheme.",

So, this ponzi it's over.as expected, the site did not last more than 3 months, I even doubt that it lasted more than 7 days, in the past ponzi sites had more durability because they had customers, currently with this financial crisis and with so many serious and honest investments and with so many people who already know the danger of using ponzi sites, today ponzi sites can't even have more than 10 customers and even those less than 10 customers make small deposits. I think OP closed the ponzi site because he saw that he wouldn't have customers and he was already wasting his time with this site",
