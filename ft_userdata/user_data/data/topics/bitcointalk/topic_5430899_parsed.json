      "body": "Twitter Deletes Tweets, Web Page About Ban on Links to Rival Social Networkshttps://me.pcmag.com/en/social-media-1/14103/twitter-deletes-tweets-web-page-about-ban-on-links-to-rival-social-networksJack Dorsey, meanwhile, has been tweeting links to Nostr after calling for a more open alternative to social networks like Twitter. There's no word on if Twitter plans to suspend its co-founder and former CEO. (On Twitter, Dorsey responded \"Why?\" to Twitter's initial tweet about the ban, adding \"doesn’t make sense\" in response to a tweet about Twitter banning Nostr promotion.)On Twitter, Musk says that “casually sharing occasional links is fine, but no more relentless advertising of competitors for free, which is absurd in the extreme.” But neither he nor Twitter explain what “relentless” or “casually” mean in this context. And since Twitter says the platform will remove “content that contains links or usernames” for the social networks it has singled out, the new policy is causing confusion, to say the least.On nostr nobody can ban you, nobody can delete your posts.Bitcoin & nostr = the future",

Usually bitcoiners are not so lenient about closed source software specially one that posts stuff on github but doesn't include any source code (has only binaries) since such projects look extra shady. https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/what-is-nostr/What is Nostr?Nostr is an open-source project and protocol built around the concept of self-owned account data and identities. Allowing individuals to host and broadcast their own data with the help of private and public key pairings. The Nostr protocol, along with the decentralised identification, enables websites and internet applications to access this data by request of the user to create ‘decentralized’ social networks and cross-site interoperability.https://twitter.com/mattdesl/status/1577385222265573378nostr is a new and highly experimental decentralized open source social messaging protocol, currently in developmentOne thing to make abundantly clear: Nostr is a protocol. It’s a set of rules that servers and clients use to communicate (just like Bitcoin, email or Bittorrent). Nostr is not an app nor a “platform” (like Twitter, Facebook, etc.), but many applications can be built on top of Nostr. So of course there will be software that is not open source but uses that open protocol like Bitcoin wallet software (other than Bitcoin Core) that has only binaries.Discovered nostr yesterday, but will check further.",

Because it seems that everyone will be able to socialize without worrying about censorship or interference and all users can voice their opinion about the platform. But the question is how do you run a platform with a decentralized system? do you guys really let users do as they please? if you let that, does that mean your platform has the opportunity to be filled with toxic users? and how do you overcome this?",

It was difficult for non-tech people to run it.How will you make nostr more accessible though? If the market target changes to your average joe, I think it won't be easy to encourage them to run their own relay, client, etc. What I can expect is another web/project that acts as a centralized social media platform that uses nostr as its backbone. This does not make the project loses its value though, just that the goal probably won't be achieved.The idea is promising IMO, but mainstream users probably won't use it (those who don't use crypto too often, for example). Probably not a downside but anyone planning to build or run a project using this platform should consider that. I've seen lots of projects that has interesting use cases like jester, so I'll keep following this.",

I am sure they will be able to include an edit function, but they might not want to have a delete option at all. If you are advertising something as censorship-resistant that doesn't have a centralized authority that decides what is acceptable and what isn't, there shouldn't be a way to delete posts. Hive and Steemit function in the same way if I am not wrong. If you want to get rid of your content, edit it. Better yet, think about the stuff you post before you post it because the internet is forever, whether there is a delete button or not.",
