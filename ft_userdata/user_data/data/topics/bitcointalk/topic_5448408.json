  "content": "I tried using the search engine to see if this topic has been discussed or created by someone but I couldn't find it.I see it that Newbies are getting it twisted to differentiate between centralized exchange and decentralized exchange thinking that they are the same. Some of them are been deceived by the words. Most centralized exchange confused their customers to make them believe that they are running a decentralized exchange.Centralized Exchange is an exchange that is own by someone and it is used for the purchase of crpytocurrency and also for the selling of crpytocurrency. In this exchange,a third party is needed to help customers keep their funds,for easy transactions between one another. That is,someone is in charge of every transaction made by conducting the transaction. Examples of centralized exchanges are Binance, Remittano e.t.c.                Prons of Centralized Exchange-- Centralized exchanges links people to the crypto market.--Your wallet is controlled by a third party, this makes it impossible for you not to have access to your wallet.-- Centralized exchanges are used by traders for trading.--Some exchanges gives a little interest,if you keep a certain amount of coins in their wallet.-- Centralized exchange makes changing of bitcoin to fiat and vice versa very easy without passing through stress.                    Cons of Centralized Exchange-- You don't have full control over your bitcoin because they are in charge of your keys. Not your keys.....not your coins.--You can be restricted from having 100% access to your funds,if you want to transfer all your coins to another wallet that is not in their platform.--You can lose your coin at anytime due to mismanagement of customers funds or a hack into the system.-- CEX, are not trustworthy,since they can gain your trust on them and scam you in the next minutes,and come with fake excuses. Some of them after scamming their customers, will go and open another exchange with a different name to continue their scam project.-- Centralized exchange depends mostly on users funds to run their exchange. If most users transfer all their funds at once or on the same day,it will lead to the crash of the exchange due to low liquidity.-- KYC is important in a centralized exchange which makes users identity known and all transaction can be tracked by government, which makes customers vulnerable to attack. Government can freeze customers funds for any reason.--Centralized exchange can easily be manipulated by the government.Decentralized Exchange : Decentralized exchanges are peer-to-peer market places,where crpytocurrency traders make transactions directly without handling over management of their funds to an intermediary (third party). This transactions are facilitated through the use of self-executing agreement written in code called smart contract. DEXs were created to remove the requirement for any authority to oversee an authorized trade performed within a specific exchange. They are noncustodial, which means that users keep p control of their wallets private keys. Users can immediately access their crypto balances after logging with their private keys.   A decentralized exchange is built on top of a blockchain network that support smart contracts and where users keep custody of their funds. Example of DEXs are bisqhttps://cointelegraph.com/learn/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-and-how-do-dexs-work              Prons of Decentralized Exchange-- You are in charge of your bitcoin : This means that you keep your funds in your own wallet,where no one can have easily access to.-- Governments or authority have no access to oversee your transactions because it done anonymously,and therefore,your funds can be freeze.-- DEX gives its users privacy and security.-- There is no back door in DEX,which means it cannot be manipulated by government or anyone.-- It uses P2P trading : You don't need third party to conduct trading for you, you do it yourself, because your transaction is on top of the block chain,and a transaction fee will be paid.-- Transactions are facilitated through smart contracts.              Cons of Decentralized Exchange -- For you to trade your bitcoin to fiat and vice versa,you need a trustworthy person to trade with,if not you can get scammed.--- You will lose your bitcoin, if you mistakenly send it to the wrong address, because Bitcoin transaction in the blockchain cannot be reversed.-- If you misplace your seed phrase,you will not have access to trading because your seed phrase is the what you will use to login to DEX.As bitcoiners it is good we understand about the type of exchange that we are using for trading. I don't think I have written them all,if someone have any addition to this,you can also add yours.Gracias.",

When a third party is having control of your wallet with keys so exactly you claim those funds to be yours if they restrict you? I think you have not heard about the phrase Not your keys,not your coins so for me this is the main reason to avoid these exchanges at all cost and you are categorising it under prons of CEX.Quote from: Sim_card on April 11, 2023, 02:54:43 PM-- Centralized exchange makes changing of bitcoin to fiat and vice versa very easy without passing through stress.You have again missed the concept of KYC which ends up your privacy completely because they can track you and giving your data to third party sources to be used for illicit activities also.Moreover your bank account is linked and government also know about your funds and can monitor you.In overall if you are okay with it then it's not a problem until it happens with you.",

So on that note, I will like to add that apart from \"Binance & Remitano\", we have other examples of centralized exchange such as \"Luno, Coinbase & Paxful', while in regards to other examples of a decentralized exchange, we have the likes of \"Uniswap, Sushiswap & Pancakeswap\" which offers direct peer-to-peer transaction without the help of a middle man.",

But not only those exchanges are centralized. Another type of exchanges that are centralized are instant exchanges. You do not have wallet on instant exchanges, but they can seize your coin when you send a coin to the address they control in exchange for another coin.Quote from: Sim_card on April 11, 2023, 02:54:43 PM--Your wallet is controlled by a third party, this makes it impossible for you not to have access to your wallet.Maybe you do not understand this. Or you means this makes it possible for you not to have access to your wallet? Because it is not your coin and not yours on the blockchain, you have no full control over your own coins, but the exchanges do.Quote from: Sim_card on April 11, 2023, 02:54:43 PM--Some exchanges gives a little interest,if you keep a certain amount of coins in their wallet.Okay. Can you mention the exchanges that gives interests? Although, if you have coins that you are not using to trade, send them all out of exchanges to noncustodial wallet.Quote from: Sim_card on April 11, 2023, 02:54:43 PM-- Centralized exchange makes changing of bitcoin to fiat and vice versa very easy without passing through stress.Wrong. All centralized exchanges that exchange fiat to crypto and crypto to fiat needs KYC that needs identity verification. Is that not stress enough?Also the real P2P are decentralized exchanges.",
