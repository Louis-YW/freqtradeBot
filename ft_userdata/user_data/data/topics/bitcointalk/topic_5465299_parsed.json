What i expect is in seing people taking this recent dip experience to the next level as the most trending news in crypto considering that they did same when the market pump and gives alot of reasons that could have been traced to the sudden rise, now that we are back to $25,900 what should we expect more, according to my own research, if we can realize the dip experience in August althrough then September should be a month we should expect the market to rise close to $40,000 this is not a condition of what the news is all about, we all know we are heading closer to halving and the market needs to gradually continue to change pumping up.",

Wait, we're in the speculation section, right?  Even if it turns out that someone guesses the price forecast, then this is pure chance.Personally, my assumption is that the price of BTC in September will be about the same level with minor fluctuations up and down. In general, the price will remain almost the same.Just don't try to use my forecast, otherwise you will lose your deposit.  There are no Nostradamus Michael Burry among us. Michael, you don't have account here, right?",

      "body": "Time flies. We're already in September. We are back to $25k and it is June all over again. There will be dump attempts to break this strong resistance and there is a good chance that they will fail similar to June then we see the breakout back above $30k again.With the fact that the recent attempt to go up (the failed $28k rise) could mean my theory above is correct so far since with fake dump attempts there will be also these sudden jumps upward as the dump fails.P.S. What does everyone think about the similarities of bitcoin price with gold in the recent months?Gold rose in July, stayed up in August and dump started on 8th bottom was 18th.Bitcoin rose in last week of June and continued in July and stayed up until August 16 and bottom was basically on 18th.",

      "body": "The price rebounded quickly from the bottom of 25,600, which confirms that it is still possible to retest 31,000 again during this month, but the possibility that we will reach levels of 38,000 thousand to 42,000 has become a little more difficult. Thus, we can say that during this month, the best we will get is to retest 31,000 again.it is still possible for us to be between 19,500 and 24,785. Therefore, during this month, if the price does not move higher, the end of this month will definitely be between these two levels.This month's peak will be: 31,000This month's low will be: 19,500The probability that the price is in a range 19,500 to 24,785 (51%)The probability that the price is in a range 25,600 to 31,000 (49%)",

Its going to be something that could be done a lot better on the long run. I understand that its not that easy to get it higher, but it could potentially happen and we are going to end up seeing it eventually. I hope that would be this month, we just need to figure out a way to make it happen one way or another, and from the looks of it, it feels like we are going to have some sort of issues on the long run if we are not careful so it could drop as well. We need to push, and keep on pushing and we can see above 28k and stay there.",

I think sentiment is now more sensitive than some of the news that is presented, when positive comes bitcoin cannot stand longer but different things negative comes it continues longer.",

Here I don't understand why it's difficult for bitcoin to maintain its value above $ 28k and recover to penetrate $ 30k, but the behavior of traders seems to be the main reason so far. Yes, there was panic there but I hope that doesn't make my optimism collapse. OP, at least I voted for the first option on the poll, that's what I was hoping for this September instead of sideways.",

I'm not sure there are any big news on the horizon yet but that notwithstanding, I'm not sure the price will go below $24-25K since it already went that enough in August. I mean, all the June and July gains went blew off in August.I have voted in the poll:Low >>> 24-25kHigh >>> 28K towards 30K price levels.We'll see.

The price rise on Wednesday to $27k and as it is the price has come down to $25k and we don't know how the price will be in this month. But I am predicting the price in this month to be $28k. Yes the $28 as I said will be the resistance line in the month but that is not guarantee yet because the price is unpredictable. In this days the market movement is confusing",

Current market conditions tend to be very uncertain - even high volatility can occur unexpectedly.Of course I can't hide my desire to see bitcoin break its strongest resistance at $30k - but some analysts say there is a possibility of a deeper slide due to the negative impact of external factors; [government regulations and policies]. The impact is worrisome as it tends to cause major panic - but I have to stick to the main plan where the long term prospects for bitcoin investment are the most attractive.",

Maybe slow grind til the end of the year, nothing exciting. Unless some bad news or old coins come back to the market, then things could get ugly again. Halving next year though so in two months people will start thinking about that again.Last line of support until a lower low? Would be surprised to see price turn it around from here.",

Mtgox is one of the issues I will be keeping an eye on throughout this year - it will obviously send the price of bitcoin falling to low levels that could possibly fall below $20k. For September - I chose sideways, at least it's safe to think about that.I definitely don't expect bitcoin to test the new support level at $24k - but that can't be prevented if market participants sell off. Of course that would be bad for the market - but just like in the past, prices will recover over time.",
