After you DCA, all coins you own will have a same average price. If you sell any fraction of your coins, the rest will have same average price like before selling.Average price only changes if you buy new coins at new prices different than your current average price.",

      "body": "Well, i don't think anything changes, if you bought the 350 CNS at an average price of 45 U.S dollars per coin, even if you took out 100 of them, the remaining 250 were still bought at 45 U.S dollars per coin. The change in average price would occur if the price of CNS rises and you start to accumulate again, then would the average price per coin change.Having said that, mind you that DCA is usually best with coins that are sustainable for the long term, if you are using DCA to accumulate a coin that has no actual utility or sustainability, you might run into a huge loss in the future.",

Assuming the price of bitcoin has decreased, if you are receiving $500 weekly, you can start to use $20 to buy bitcoin every week, that is DCA. Because you do not buy bitcoin at once but buying it weekly at varing price means DCA because you can take average of the bitcoin bought weekly but summing the total coin bought and divide it by the number of times you bought it to get the average price for you to be making profit.",

So now I have 250 CNS. The question: is the average still 45 USD per CNS? Or how do I calculate average price per coin after selling 100 of them?To calculate the average purchase price of your coins, when you have multiple transactions, you can use the weighted average method.For example, let's say you purchased 10 coins at $100, sold 5 at $150, and then purchased 5 more at $90. The calculations would be as follows:Transaction 1: Buy 10 coins at $100Total cost = 10 x $100 = $1000Transaction 2: Sell 5 coins at $150Total cost = Total cost - $750 (5 x $150, but we will subtract that amount since you received money)Transaction 3: Buy 5 coins at $90Total cost = Total cost + $450 (5 x $90)Total cost of all transactions = $1000 - $750 + $450 = $700Total quantity of coins purchased = 10 - 5 + 5 = 10Average purchase price = $700 / 10 = $70Therefore, the average purchase price of your coins in this case would be $70.Using this calculation method will provide a more precise average price compared to only calculating the purchase price. Essentially, each time you purchase coins at a price below the current average and sell them at a price higher than the current average, your overall average purchase price will decrease.",

If it is supposed to lower the risk, there is no measure of risk providedMarketing stuff created by banks and brokers since people think it's safer and continue to inject money no matter what the market is doing.It's not worse in the falling markets, but worse in rising markets. That's what the article from your first link proves. The author invested a lump sum and DCA into the S&P over a period of a few years where the market was rising, so obviously the lump sum investment gave him much greater returns. I don't get why these people try to prove a point by doing such obvious experiments.OP, your DCA strategy didn't work well because you sold part of your investment at a random time. DCA is a great strat when you don't know where the bottom of the bear market will be, but you want to accumulate anyway. It doesn't work well when you keep buying and selling before the market turns around. My DCA strategy focuses on buying during the bear market and selling the same way by slowly doing a reverse DCA into fiat money in a bull run. How do I know when there's a bull run? Usually a good indicator is breaking through 50% of the ATH. I did that in 2018 and 2019 where bitcoin was below 10k. That was almost a whole year where I did my DCA. When we broke above 10k USD I begun to slowly DCA back into fiat, but when we fell below again and went to 4k in 2020 I was buying. Then again, when we broke above towards 20k I was DCAing back to fiat and then slowly all the way to the ATH in 2021. When we went below 40k USD I stopped selling and waited for the market to show me what to do. We went to 30k so I started buying again.",

Assume after you DCA 1 year, you have 10 coins, with average price is $25,000. If you sell 2 coins, the 8 coins left will have same average price at $25,000. If you buy new coins like 2 coins or 5 coins at $30,000, those new coins will be used to calculate your new average price for your total 10 coins or 13 coins.Buy 2 new coins at $30,000: [(8*25,000) + (2*30,000) ]/10 = 26,000 is your new average price.Buy 5 new coins at $30,000: [(8*25,000) + (5*30,000) ]/13 = 26,923 is your new average price.",

If you are thinking of your average you have to know the value of when you bought a unit and how much you are selling it for and like the quoted post, if you have a coin with potential for rising then DCA will be profitable for you but if it is depreciating, that means you are simply going to have a reduce profit or nothing at all if you are selling at lesser price from what you bought thereby running into losses.",

Or how do I calculate average price per coin after selling 100 of them?You basically multiply the price per coin into the number of coins you bought at that price and then you add the total values. Finally divided it by total number of coins to get the average per coin. Now in case selling it created issues so there are two things you can do to simplify it. Either assume the same average price as it was before and consider everything you got in access as gain in this time. Otherwise reduce the total sales value from total cost and make this new cost. Basically profit will be booked together in just one time.",
