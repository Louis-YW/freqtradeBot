All that required is the patience, which we can never expect with our people. Everyone want to invest today and need their investment to be doubled by the very next day. Maybe there are few lucky ones who were able to experience similar things, and for the same it isn't mandatory that we could also have the same luck.",

Those that I mentioned are the most important things you need to have in order to make money in real estate. This is no longer the 80s or 90s wherein it's fairly easy to acquire a property somewhere and hold on to it. Everything is being gatekept nowadays by land developers and other commercial investors that the average person can no longer get a piece of the action in this asset class.",

They do not allow or do not set clear rules on renting and ownership or multiple properties, making the possibility of losing the investment to be real.I have seen it happening here in Venezuela before, home gets invaded by outsiders and the government rather than taking care of the problem, just ignore the fact it is a crime and even favors the invaders if there are children among them, It is just a complete travesty on the respect for private property.",

Owning land properties isn't limited to politicians and rich people. I have witnessed people that came from rags to riches and understood that this is a way to accumulate through acquiring land properties because the value of it appreciates and it's also limited. Having land property is truly a generational wealth, you can pass it on to the next generation of your family.Quote from: FiveG on June 12, 2023, 10:41:06 PMIn my country Nigeria if you don't have any of this properties forget yourself, you will end up making life mortgage and tenancy.

What do you think?I think that's for most countries, if you don't have a property for now, you'll mostly need to get into renting for the entire of your lifetime. But that's the inspiration that mostly get that we don't want to rent forever and that's why we're doing something for us to be able to afford mortgage or buy our homes. While those that leverage what they've got, they're acquiring assets/properties after properties and they'll use the rent for it to pay for the monthly mortgages.",

In the 20th century most of the great fortunes were made with real estate or once made in another sector they bought a good part of real estate. Today the biggest fortunes have been made related to the internet, and although real estate is still important, it is less so. Maybe in your country it is still important and everything digital is less important, but the global trend is different. Real estate is taxed, easily confiscated and hardly transportable. Compare that to Bitcoin which is often taxed, but is hardly confiscable and very easily transportable, so if you don't agree with the taxes you can easily take it somewhere else.",

Investing in bitcoin is undeniably more profitable than investing in land, but when it comes to risk, bitcoin is much riskier. If investing in bitcoin was easy to earn profits without risk, all investors would not have ignored bitcoin so easily. According to some statistics, real estate is still the top choices of investors, while bitcoin only accounts for a tiny market share. I think they will have a reason to do it. Most of us here invest in bitcoin because we don't have much money to invest in land, and we all want to make big profits with little capital. That's what a lot of people are trying to deny.",

What do you think?Yes, land properties are good investment when you purchase them from the right person and wait for some years for the land to appreciate very well before you can sell to make a passive income. But if you purchase land in undeveloped areas, it will make you regret why you invested such amount of money because before the place will turn to develop area maybe you are no longer alive to enjoy your investment. It will be favourable if you can try Bitcoin investment in this season since the price has decreased to $25,437 and it will make you to prefer Bitcoin investment than estate investment.",

But in general, I agree that investing in land is still profitable now. Especially taking into account also the problem with food, which, perhaps, awaits the little man in the near future.",

I've seen people bought properties like these after 10-15 years, with the continuous development, the city expanded as well to a point where it reaches out to those properties that was sold cheap before. Now, they are building commercial structures in this area and already reaping the profit for waiting such a long time.
