  "content": "Russian billionaire Vyacheslav Taran was killed when the helicopter he was traveling in crashed near Monaco. Reports in Ukrainian media have previously alleged that Taran, who was co-founder of trading and investment platform Libertex and foreign exchange trading group Forex Club.Just last week, the founder of Hong Kong-based digital asset company Amber Group Tiantian Kullander died suddenly in his sleep. The 30-year-old had built the company into a $3 billion ‘fintech unicorn.’A month before Kullander’s death, MakerDAO developer and crypto millionaire Nikolai Mushegian apparently drowned in Puerto Rico.Back in July 2021, the crypto industry was rocked by the news that controversial Romanian crypto billionaire Mircea Popescu — also known as ‘the father of bitcoin toxicity‘ — had drowned in Costa Rica.More details - https://protos.com/russian-billionaire-latest-crypto-tycoon-to-die-mysteriously/",

Everyone at that moment agreed including him (while laughing), no way that if something bad would have happened would outsiders believe the story of him dying like that, for sure it must have been an assassination.Billionaire dying in a car crash? No way, all of them have f1 skills! Billionaire dying in a plane crash? No billionaire can die falling from 1 mile in the sky, dying from disease? We all know billionaires are mutants that can't catch any diseases! You have hundreds of teenagers dying after falling from a building or electrocuted on a train taking selfies but now way a billionaire the same age would die trying to go on a late swimming after smoking pot all night.Of course, that changes in Russia, where a lot commit suicide by stabbing themselves in the back 20 times after falling from the 5th floor of a two stories high building.",

Billionaires are always targets of criminals and most times they are attacked and sometimes they loose their lives. These billionaires are also targets of competitors and business associates. Most business competitors would go to any length to outsmart or silence competition. Another common cause of the death of the rich is lack of rest. Most of them work themselves to death because they hardly rest or have time to seek medical attention. Lastly most business owners might not be able to stand the shame of losing their business or go bankrupt, so they commit suicide immediately they perceive that the business have started dying or is slipping out of their control",

They could be having bad lifestyle which is leading them to die in their sleeps. It could be merely mechanical fault in the helicopter and much more.

An article from news.Bitcoin.com stated that the helecopter crash somewhere in the area of Villefranche-sur-Mer.  I believe the body and the plane had been found but according to the news[1] the cause of the crash is unconfirmed.  Then the news continues by citing several deaths of company heads, where some of the death are somehow suspicious, like the one that fall out of the window of the hospitalQuoteLukoil's company Chairman Ravil Maganov, 67, died after reportedly falling out of a window of a Moscow hospital, also in September.And being drawned after falling off a boat.QuoteThe group includes the 39-year-old Managing Director of Russia’s Corporation for the Development of the Far East and the Arctic, Ivan Pechorin, who drowned after falling off a boat near Vladivostok on Sept. 10.Those are indeed suspicious but well, it is not related to the crypto industry, so who cares  [1] https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-billionaire-and-crypto-businessman-dies-in-helicopter-crash-in-france/",

Moreover, while crashing on a private helicopter is something that would not have happened without the wealth, dying in one's sleep or drowning are quite possible without it. I would not attach too much meaning to these events, and I generally agree with others that there is probably nothing to these situations other than people dying of natural causes. Of course, having immense wealth and being public about it makes a person a target, but it does not mean that these particular people were killed or that crypto wealth carries more risk than any other wealth in terms of becoming a target.",

Even to completely normal, regular people with no absurd wealth.I could however believe that some billionaire tried to fly the helicopter and crashed because he was not a good helicopter pilot, just a billionaire with too much time on his hands.

The point is they are gone and they left pretty heavy stash behind them which by default will get inherited to their decedent's (surprisingly they could be the one writing those conspiracy theories )",
