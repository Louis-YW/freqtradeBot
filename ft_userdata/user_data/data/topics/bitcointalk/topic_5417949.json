  "content": "The Australian Lotteries ( THE LOTT ) Powerball draw on the 27th of October 2022 is a cool AUD $160,000,000 which is the equivalent of USD $ 101,750,000 - roughly equivalent to 5,316 bitcoins at today's going rate.https://bitcoindata.science/bitcoin-units-converter.html?d=AUDBreaking it down, I'd buy 500 bitcoins, or 400 Bitcoins and a spread of other crypto totalling 100 bitcoins. (about 10% / $USD $10M of my winnings on Powerball).It's almost too difficult to say what I'd spend the rest on.  Once you've bought a house, a car, an overseas trip, another house, another car then another round the world trip.  Then, the portfolio of real estate, shares etc.  At a guess you'd need to put $USD $10M cash into a 12 month term deposit and live off of the yearly interest.  But then what else do you spend the money on - beer and hookers?Or do you?Would you take the USD $100M and gamble it on one roll of the dice?How would you spend $USD $100M - Some, all or none on gambling?",

He said it depends how quickly I would burn through the money. He was right to say so – because even a gambler as myself would be careful about cleansing that amount of cash without some sort of plan.All things considered, I think I would probably spend a good chunk of money immediately, invest about half of it in a set of businesses or ventures, and keep the remaining in cash reserves. Granted, this is just my rough estimate and there are many exceptions; perhaps I might spend much less on life's little pleasures and more on the important things like a family, medical care, and retirement savings.",
