There are really just those people who do really like to play out chess and doesnt mind about dealing up with something because leisure time or hobby is totally different when we do speak about on something that talks about investment or whatever we do called with trading which it do involves making money or profit which there are certain factors which it would really be needing for you to acquire such skill or needing it up for you to be able to survive.Somehow, making yourself that get excercised in speaking about having those mental type of games then it wont really be  that bad but i dont really see the relevance or in connectionif we do speak about training up yourself to become better with trading. Nothing beats out if you do just simply directly engage yourself and enhance that specific skills that you areplanning to acquire.",

It is almost impossible to replicate the emotional part of trading unless you trade in my opinion.  You got it right. While I also agree that trading and playing chess are both battle of minds but their process of doing it are different. Trading creates more mental and emotional challenges, and you can only learn to deal and overcome them by resorting into practical trading. That way, you will motivate more discipline and patience into your trades, and establish more stable emotions that will help you to create successful trading outcome.",

You can also play Sudoku or scrabble or even generally try other activities that may not be games.

I can advise every trader to play chess on a daily basis, even a single game just to enhance their mind to the said skills acquired by playing chess. I've been playing chess for quite some time and notice how it affects my cognitive skills especially my decision making not just in trading but in general. Chess also helps your mind relax, let your mind work against your opponent, and workout itself in a way. Being trader has a lot of techniques, but for me the most important is how you think through your trades with your analysis. If you play on Chess.com feel free to invite!",

Some points can indeed be attributed to trading strategies and tips such as Patience and perseverance, Critical thinking, and planning. But a Chess game is a mind game with an attempt to find the right way to stop the opponent's game move, but in trading, the move will not be certain because there will be significant changes. Chess chooses a more definite move with the theory that has been learned. But trading is not just about analyzing technicals, Fundamentals will influence such as FUD and News that affect each other, so any prediction will not be 100% successful.
