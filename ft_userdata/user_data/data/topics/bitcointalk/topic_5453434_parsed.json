      "body": "I'd potentially be interested for an hourly wage basis rather than a single payment upon completion (unfortunately, it's just risky since some clients withhold payment for years until things are 'perfect'). If not me though, definitely consider Freelancer.com. You can post this here and honestly probably could get a pretty great design for just $500. Freelancer.com is full of users all over the world who specialize in web design and work at their own country's standard wage. For someone in your shoes just starting out with a new venture, Freelancer.com is probably your best option. If this is something you've been working on for a while, that's when you'd want to hire someone a little more stable and steady (like meÂ  )",
