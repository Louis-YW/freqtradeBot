      "body": "This probably didn't have much of an effect on bitcoin's price and is just two things happening at once.I think US monetary policy has been speculated to be maintaining an inflation of about 8% so this could be that just catching up. Surely inflation dollars being reported as high would be a good thing for crypto too as there's extra cash moving through the economy.",

      "body": "Inflation and the U.S.A baby boomers beginning retirement is causing a run from all speculative investments into more stable investments, such as cash, bonds, gold & silver.This is a natural progression of the aging demographics when people that retire switch from speculation to more investments that are less likely to lose against inflation. For others, due to the inflation, they need the fiat to survive causing the sell offs.Since crypto & stocks are sold to buy food & energy , expect the sell off to get much worse for the foreseeable future.* Some would say crypto can be used instead of cash, while true, Merchants and Utilities would immediately sell for fiat , as they can't afford holding crypto that can drop large % in a single day, which still creates a sell off.  One upcoming concern for btc holders is how long Tesla car company will hold their btc, as their sell off would definitely impact the BTC market price. *",

This is mostly inaccurate as it's just a regular day in Bitcoin market cycle.Zooming our of the charts a bit more, this drop would be quite insignificant.This thread is a better fit in speculation board as that discussed trading action and price movements, but it's not really a general topic for Bitcoin discussion.",

Perhaps you mean the short-term impact after the announcement made Bitcoin drop below $30K.

We tend to think of crypto as a decentralised network and therefore completly autonomus from outside factors, but that's just not the case. When there is a looming threat of economic collapse like there is now, people tend to buckle down and not invest. And like it or not, crypto, for the most part, is still considered and investment.",

You need to give it more time for the analyists to draw conclusions. There isn't enough data. Secondly, the global economy isn't doing well, and plenty of institutional investors are not involved in crypto assets due to fears of recession. Investors are putting their money into tangible investments (precious metals, housing, etc.) That's going to drive the price down, obviously.Don't panic.",

      "body": "Inevitably, inflation is going to skyrocket in US and in Europe due to the economical policies adopted by FED and ECB, but for now it's still profitable for big investors to participate these traditional markets, because interest rates are going to increase, what can be really profitable on short run, just like ponzi schemes are for early investors. However,once inflation hits hard and in high intensity, those investors will cashout their profits and come back to crypto market in order to protect their funds by investing on the most reputable cryptocurrencies (mainly bitcoin and ethereum) while speculating part of their funds, as usual, in altcoins. That is the next bull run I'm waiting for.That is my read of the scenario and that is why I think bitcoin is still dropping with such news. Investors are fleeing for now, but they are going to come back soon.",

I don't think it will have much a short or long term impact on the price of Bitcoin. At the end of the day Bitcoin is its own currency, and doesn't depend on USD.
