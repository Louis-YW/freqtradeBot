      "body": "Are you one of the promoters or managers of this project? Or can I know what your position is in QizonCoin? Actually, I checked your site platform, and I saw something that was not good. Let's just say that I will give a personal review based on what I saw in this project of yours. First, because of the lack of transparency of each member of the team, we don't know what their good track record is; instead, you turned their pictures into animations. This is where you will have a problem secondly, its price value has no demand, so its volatility is high.I also can't see if this coin has legal jurisdiction. Therefore, the investment to be made here is very high-risk. I'm sorry, but there seem to be red flags in my personal review",

You should not expect anything good from such exchanges after listing. Right now you can buy tokens of this project on their website, the domain was registered 4 months ago. The token costs 3 cents, and listing on exchanges will be only in the second quarter of 2024. The registration expiration date is April 2024. What is the probability that the site will close much earlier than the token listing on exchanges?",

Also announcing an exchange prior to listing is also another red flag cause big exchange dont allowed that and ending up not listing there usually. So for a project with such a noise like this will ptobably only consist of promises.",

The invested funds into this crypto coin are directed into research and development within hydrogen and EV technologies.First you dont have the assurance that this coin will be one of the best or will outperform coins in it class and ass an investor If you consider investing in a prohect because of this kind of hype then it means that you will have high chances of getting invol e in a shit coin that will end up as a total waste of investment on the long run.More also I think this project is systematically being promoted by the ops and at that we can be right to say that ops is part of the team, and he is looking for ways to market the project here in the forum.Quote then it not only promises the best returns but also contributes to mitigating the environmental impacts through reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Keeping this unique approach in mind, the chances of getting high returns on investing in Qizon Coin get high which makes it a worthwhile option to invest your money.I don't think a serious project that is looking for long-term funding to carry out research and development is ripe enough also to be considered as a profitable investment.",

Most new projects show good only at the start, developers are very active as well but later on, you will see their true colors and project intention - scam. I'm not yet saying this project is useless but still it can't buy my interest. If the team wanted to be recognized more and gain trust in the community, it is better target to be listed in reputable exchanges or big names as they can help the project grow. But still impossible if the project is useless and has no use-case because the words themselves can't be enough to drag people to invest.",

To me, any token that sells its tokens on a website, rather than on a dedicated token sales platform, is a potential scam. Another concern here is that the listing date on exchanges may be further away than the expiration date of the site registration. A banal exit scam may occur.

Well, OP, you know already that it was hard to convince people to invest in a project that has no use case. Most of all, people are now been cautious in dealing with new projects due to scam issues that we have and your project is in question. You can't please them either unless your project shows interesting results that would gain attention but for now, people are thinking this is another worthless project.",

In the past, ICOs could be launched directly from the project's website, and when the site closed, there was a scam, and no one controlled it. Now there are various launchpads that organize various ICOs. If a project is not launched on any launchpad, but sells its tokens on its website, it can be a good signal that it is a scam and the developer of this scam does not want to spend money on attracting various services, as he does not have money for it. He wants to get rich on the scam with minimal investments.",

Yes I was able to participate on this kind of ICOS during 2017 and yes you are right. But some of them are good or given so much profits before. Im not sure whether they are strive until now. Thats why ICO hypes and bounty are become a thing during that time. Plus there are no IEOs or IDO during that time too so your choice is to trust the project that are launching if you wanna ride or not. But yeah, since IEO inception this kind of thing died out now and if there are still left people are skeptical.",

Listing might come next after the successful launching of the project, so the option to sell on their site first is usually the normal practice though there are other ways to offer it to the public, its just that this is the most convenient way.

It's quite easy to detect the authentication of picture used by the project. Anything is far easy with AI. It seems like that the owner of that site was a traditional scammers who used the old trick to fool the investors. I just wanna say that if he probably a part of team too. His intention was in shilling his scam token here to get victims to invest their money in that shitty project ran by cartoon. The name mentioned as team looked like thai/viet's name.",
