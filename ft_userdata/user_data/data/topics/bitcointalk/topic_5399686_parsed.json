  "content": "Africa having a population of over 1.4 billion people, surpassing Europe and USA, saw the rapid increase in the usage of p2p  transactions since the Covid pandemic,with countries like, Nigeria, Ghana, South Africa, Kenya and Togo topping the chart. Despite that(Increase in peer-2-peer, usage of digital currencies) they've had some limitations to the utilization of Bitcoin in Africa which have been a pain in the neck for them citizen's! Some of them are Viz ;•Price / Financial Limitations.•Enlightenment.•Banks and Poor Governmental support.•Ignorance / Information hoarding.•Education / Basic amenities.•Ignorance / Information hoarding.•Mining of Bitcoin.•Resistance to Change.PRICE / FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS:The average African ( Narrowing down to the average Nigeria ) does not have 15 million spare to buy 1Bitcoin, that's because the average african thinks it's a must to buy 1 Bitcoin not fractions of Bitcoin as they're yet to understand that Bitcoin can be bought in fractions  ( Satoshi's ). The price alone is chasing away investors,that's why you see the shift in focus to alternative coins that have lesser value's.ENLIGHTENMENT: Assuming, those teaching friends, buddies and pals about Bitcoin can enlighten them bro's that, Bitcoin can be bought in little fractions of Satoshi's rather than telling them to buy altcoins and altnets that will outperform Bitcoin. The information is out there but not properly encoded to be decoded. Shouldn't pay listening ear to influencers who hype a particular project for profit sake.BANKS /POOR GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT:Reasons for merging them both are because, Government controls the bank, so it boggles me to see and hear from folks that banks championed the ban of Bitcoin. Most government in africa care less, as most if not all, are outdated, old standard sniffing scumbags and scavengers who knows few if not nothing about the Benefits of Bitcoin.EDUCATION / BASIC AMENITIES:You don't expect folks who've got no good literacy skills to pick up interest for Bitcoin as they'll find it as a very cumbersome load too carry.Most African countries in Africa can be classified as developing, where in some cases, the poverty rate is about half the the population of a given country.We've also got electricity and bad networks as one of our challenges and with the income level as per the minimum wage for most africans, those at grass roots are unable to go through like on the pay grade not too think of getting the necessary device to be Crypto enabled.IGNORANCE / INFORMATION HOARDING:Like I said , the information might be there but not properly shared or encoded to be decode. Ain't it disheartening when you see and hear people hurdle information about Bitcoin ?Ignorance plays a key role in the limitation of Bitcoin in africa, as there are hundreds of million People who hasn't heard about Bitcoin.MINING OF BITCOIN: Due to weather, and lack of cheap electricity, I think this are another limitations in setting up a Bitcoin mining farm, as getting one down here would cost them huge sum's for Asics, coz they'll thrive in hot ends. Improvisation can be done with the sun for solar energy though.Some older generations are also over reliant on them local fiat,(Not saying they be scared of new technologies though)as they find it difficult to adapt to change ( older generations )as they find some interface as scam or difficult too keep up with the current trend's. But if Bitcoin can be used in them day to day activities then, then it shouldn't be more hard or complex to utilize.Will you consider High/ Low transaction fees as a limitation also ? Someone school my ass!",

      "body": "I can agree with you that there is a lack of education in many parts of the world, not just Africa about bitcoin. But the possibilities especially on a big semi developed continent are huge. As you can store money easily on a mobile wallet and send it with relatively low fees to other countries with no control whatsoever. For everyday payments it is maybe not the best because of those fees and the confirmation time.Maybe you can set up an FAQ website in an African language and guide them how to buy some, because I think many people only learn about bitcoin after their first receive some Sats.",

Not sure why Elon Musk is not doing it on all Africa since he is from Africa, he has Starlink so instead of putting up on other countries why not give his best to the country where he is from. China had built a field of windmills and solar panel in the desert. Africa should be able to do something like this with Elon Musk help.  Probably enough that they could have mining farms.",

If you have money to invest in bitcoin or to work with bitcoin and earn an income from it, you will have money to pay for transactions fees. I think the main limitations right now are the financial one, as mentioned, the lack of educational background/understanding on bitcoin usage and lack of access to technological gadgets and devices, which proportionate a much better comprehension and learnship not only on crypto subject, but in every aspects covering technological matters.If every african had access to internet, a desktop or smartphone, they would easily understand bitcoin can be bought in fractions, while learning how to use an exchange by seeing how it works on practice.",

Ethereum is still a very popular chain among developers of new projects and we all know that transaction fees there are insanely high. Won't that be conflicting if they buy erc-20 tokens?",

I like you maturity and the manner you often arrange your words, quite amazing. I believe that you are more convinced that Africa is a weak continent. Yes Africa is poor, it's crystal clear but you are bringing it to the table in the worse manner. Dude, this is too thick to drop it in this form. You know there are so many non african countries that could be worse than what you have described entirely. You can't compare the entire African continent to the world most successful, richest, developed and well coordinated country like the United States. This is of no match...lol! America seems to be the greatest when it comes to power, economy, dominance and it will looks unacceptable if you compare with Africa. Quotethis gap is caused by FOREXthe exchange rate.You are very correct, FOREX FOReignExchangeIt evolves exchange of currencies of different countries which are paired to each other. Just like the way GBP is pegged to USD. With this, we can easily compared them and know their values based on FOREX. We have other currencies that are paired to USD like; USD/CAD, USD/AUD, USD/YAN, USDNGN, USDGBP etc. The African currencies have no strong value compared to the USD, that is why things always go wrong due to bad governments and lack of quality education.Quotemeaning taking years to buy 0.1btc even if they had the same property size and same furnishings and same dietsI rest my case!",

A solution may be to offer freelance work for BTC which can be sold globally, this is working quite well in South America for example. Of course this needs knowledge and equipment (a PC) not everyone has in these countries.Quote from: Oluwa-btc on May 22, 2022, 06:21:11 AM•Mining of Bitcoin.I think this is very different depending of the region you're living in. The main problems, apart from financing, are the climate (as you already wrote) which makes cooling more expensive, and grid quality/the risk of blackouts. However, many regions in northern and southern Africa have a big potential for solar energy, which could be used for grid-independent mining farms.The best locations are seen in this map - in addition to the Sahara there are also excellent regions with probably better (i.e. cooler) climate in Namibia/South Africa and Kenya/Tanzania: SolarGIS Solar Map Africa and Middle East(dunno why I can't embed it directly from Wikimedia Commons here - is there some kind of blocking active there?)",

I reckon it might also be a much needed transformation for miners to progress from being more centralized, large mining farms to smaller, independent and decentralized mining hubs. The biggest cause of this transformation would be the increasing energy prices which have began already in Europe and other parts of the world. I speculate it will not stop there and it will only become worse. We should not deny the reality that this will certainly affect the cryptomining business.Larger Shocks Are Coming With Your Electrical energy PaymentsNearly unnoticed, regional ahead electrical energy contracts for late 2022 and, particularly, for 2023 have risen considerably over the previous few weeks, heralding additional utility invoice hikes. In some circumstances, ahead contracts have set document highs, having surged about 40% over the past two months.To date in Might, the benchmark German one-year ahead electrical energy contract has averaged 222 euros ($235) per megawatt hour, heading towards its highest ever month-to-month degree, above the earlier document set final December at 207 euros per megawatt hour. Earlier than 2021, the best common for a similar benchmark contract was 83 euros in July 2008.Source https://easttip.com/larger-shocks-are-coming-with-your-electrical-energy-payments/",

IMO, they are well aware and have made their analysis on the subject and must have seen that it threatens the financial control they have on their citizens and further make less important our already struggling currency. Because these leader are sometimes power drunk and bent on subjecting citizens to control, they have gone ahead to limit and frustrate it's use. Another reason is the fact that some african leaders are not pioneer thinkers, they always wait and want to follow in the steps of other European leaders. Some African leaders are under the heavy influence of other countries, which is not supposed to be so. They seldom make original decisions.",
