Even though Bitcoin will be ban in Nigeria i think it will not stop the existence of P2P exchange transactions, so i dont know why most at times many crypto investors get afraid of government banning Bitcoin in particular. i was told that in the two years Nigeria government ban Bitcoin but till date people are still transacting with Bitcoin, it can only be possible for a government if Bitcoin is a centralized currency but since its a decentralized currency and i think that government can only carry out a speculation and fake information about Bitcoin. So in summary government of a particular country dont have the power to ban existence of Bitcoin.",

With time bitcoin may seem like a preferred choice of money and the government will not be happy about it. Which may lead to lots of restriction of bitcoin in our country.",

They can declear it illegal and make strick legislation about it. Nigerian government didn't ban Bitcoin, it was the CBN that said that commercial banks should not facilitate the transaction of Bitcoin. What it means it that you can't buy Bitcoin directly from exchanges with your bank cards and others. That's why Nigerians opted for the p2p.",

Actually is very possible for the federal government to banned crypto because so long as they are in power they have every right to make any decision they want, so perhaps just like how others has mention on there post above, there was a time the CBN banned the use of crypto but however the only challenges they had was that crypto was beyond there reach to monitor and however people continues to do there crypto business, so there is no way the government can be able to know if someone is into crypto or not. Although I believe that one of the reasons why government behave that way towards crypto was that they were not able to monitor or regulate it and secondly crypto has affected most bank because people no longer like to save there money in the bank but instead they invest it on crypto, so there is no way government can prevent us from using crypto.",

      "body": "Government as an entity that is only not authorized to have regulatory capacities over Bitcoin in any form of its regulations but yes, the government have all the governing capacities to decide if Bitcoin as a crypto currency would be banned, restricted or suspended in its nation. Thus Nigerian government do have those capacities which that is why they succeeded in banning Bitcoin and Crypto currencies at February 2021 nation wide and was later lifted that private and individual sectors are permitted to deal on but was and still prohibited at the government sectors.The decentralization of Bitcoin is not limited that the government can not impose it legal tendered or illegal tenders within its local countries but limited at the regulatory system such as the value exchange, the volatility nature and so also the security aspects (Blockchain) of it.Hence the government can further decide to restrict everyone from the Bitcoins affair by sanctioning (warning) with any form of penalty placed at any violated citizens of masses in the nation.This can successfully be achieved by the central bank of Nigeria (CBN) deactivating from the Bitcoin digital currency exchange to the local currency (naira #).Also as discouraging its citizens with false biasing potentials of the Bitcoin currency, so basically people would begin to adapt to being doubt about the Bitcoin since the news came from the national financial authorities.If we here think we have escaped it, that is false because the internet protocols could be termed a restriction from giving permission to related cases about Bitcoin possibly through the virtual private network (VPN). Let us recall that it happened in about last year or so when Nigeria government got cut off (banned) from the Twitter (X network) but some individuals were only able to use the site through a VPN swap to other country.Yes. I can't go much in details but remembered about a Bitcoin investors who came from a Bitcoin banned country but yet, he keeps going to hasn't been easy for him whereas, he has to do with a third party in order to make an exchange of his Bitcoin in his wallet and her has been operating on that anonymously at the form of illegally indulgences.So, the government definitely have the capacities of inconveniencing everyone about Bitcoin and AltCoins as long crypto is concernedThat is my best knowledge pertaining this thread even though I am a late follow-up in the Bitcoin industry, I keep to some certain updates.",

Th fact that after a restriction has been placed on a articular thing, people still do it doesn't mean it can't be banned. It's true that bitcoin is decentralized and doesn't literally work based on government regulations and interventions but what to should understand is that the government has the power to decide what goes on in her  country and can issue a statement that any one found mining, trading or investing in bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency be arrested. What would you do about that?The thing I have come t know about the ban on cryptocurrency by the FGN is that they've only disallowed banks from accepting it and demands that crypto funds in their custody be seized, I doubt that any bank will want to go against that directive but since I haven't found a law prohibiting citizens from holding bitcoin or engaging in the trading of bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency, it becomes now reasonable time to still invest and get involved in it without any form of fear.",

So in summary government of a particular country dont have the power to ban existence of Bitcoin.I think so many people actually misunderstood the essence or should I say limitation of the supposed ban of Bitcoin in Nigeria. Well I will start off by supporting your statement which is the impossibility or slim chance of the government actually controlling people from using Bitcoin, just take china for example, I mean the country was actually among the first to show it's hatred towards Bitcoin and placing a ban on Bitcoin but that's doesn't mean Bitcoin isn't flourishing there in fact china seems to be among the major consumer of Bitcoin and imagine if this ban was actually strictly possible, it would have had a major impact on the adoption and transaction because china is the most populated and in terms of technological wise they are rated among the top elite.Well  for the case of Nigeria, Bitcoin was actually just restricted in local transaction with the local fiat banks and this ban was actually stipulated by the CBN of Nigeria maybe due to the fact they can't task transaction of Bitcoin. I know this because my local zenith bank account was actually closed by the CBN because of the transaction that supposedly occur on my bank relating to Bitcoin but since then the p2p option was the only way to trade Bitcoin and boy has it gain massive adoption.",

The regulations can only make it uncomfortable for the use of the currency in the country which can take away the interest of many people who would have shown interest in the cryptocurrency. For us that are bitcoin enthusiasts, we can only manage and continue the use of it without allowing the restrictions to be a stand block for us not to utilize it again.",

It is pertinent to note that crypto currency is not banned in Nigeria and as a matter of fact, the federal government is looking for a way to formulate a policy for it but for the mean time, CBN instructed or prohibited Nigerian banks to stop transacting with Crypto which the standing order still remains and still in existence till this very moment until further notice.There have not been any law passed to get crypto ban in Nigeria. If that is to take place it must scale through readings in the national assembly and the lawmakers of our nation must delebrate on it before passing it into law.",

And also the temporary ban placed on it. They are also thinking like CBN. And also being afraid because they have no braches where complain can be laid when problem arises.Quote from: Justinopet on December 13, 2023, 05:47:56 PMSo in summary government of a particular country dont have the power to ban existence of Bitcoin.They have the power to ban centralized exchange CEX but can't ban DEX.
