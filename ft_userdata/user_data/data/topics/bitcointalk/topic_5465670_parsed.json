Third party security is not the best and it is the worst security ever. Op I must tell you the truth, my funds are not save with you, and I can't entrust you to keep my funds for me even though the wallet is using 2FA authentication. From my observation, your mode of operation is a centralized system which your are to secure funds for people, lolz.. what a calamity to be fall...Â But wait, are we to place bet in the sportsbook or to save funds in the site which one are you operating on?",

None right!I dont know on why would really be needing to boast up when it comes to security? As these things are already or should really be standard. You wont really be able to make yourself reputableor something be known or could be trusted if you wont be having this basic or main factor to have on a good platform. If ever there would be some exploits of funds then expect that it would really reflect out on the overall confidence of people around on testing out on your site.",

While it's truly a top priority of most casinos for the sake of their customers. They have to give that confidence that gambler's money and deposits are all safe.But on this term, having a high security shouldn't be just on words. It's easy to say that a casino has a top notch security but you'll never know what's next.",

Just imagine an employee goes rogue and decides to create a back door to allow him withdraw users funds of the company funds and flee, will your 2FA system help prevent such thing?",

None right!I dont know on why would really be needing to boast up when it comes to security? It's hard to say there's none when sports bettors could let their bankroll sit between several sportsbooks so they could get shop and lock the best odds possible for their bets. The 2FA feature back then was only optional, but now most sites require you to have it enabled and it gets triggered during the withdrawal process, which is fine since it's better to have your account secured than to let it happen.I guess they also found the news about the Stake hack earlier today and want to take advantage of the situation, assuming some gamblers will start to look for a new sportsbook.",

Yeah, just recently read about the news and I am sad for Stake.com. You are right, it's not just about the security of the users so 2FA's might not really be relevant at the start. First, a gambling site must prove its own security because there are too many attackers that will start from them before they can take the information of their users. Even with 2FA's, and e-mail verification, a gambler can be hacked when the hacker goes through the website first by stealing the information from them. But I guess nitrobetting is a starting business so they are still upgrading, I hope the upgrades will not stop after this.",

And so far, 2FA is part of standard security implemented in many sites and casinos.However, every casino must have implemented very good security standards to protect its system from hackers and theft of identity or financial data in the casino. Usually, hackers choose their target and look for system leaks to use as an entry into a site. They will usually look for important data on the site and if possible, they will also steal money from the system.That is why we must be careful about the data and money we store on a site or casino. But if the hack were aided by insiders who knew about the leak, it wouldn't help because they would have already found a way in and used it to take what they wanted.",

In fact, if I were a hacker with incredible skills, I won't be spending so much time looking for individual accounts that are easier to attack. How much would I be getting with it? I'd rather be eyeing the platforms themselves that have tens or even hundreds of millions kept in a wallet. Spotting a vulnerability that exposes individual accounts won't yield much. But spotting a soft spot or a flaw in the security system of the likes of Stake would instantly give me millions.",
