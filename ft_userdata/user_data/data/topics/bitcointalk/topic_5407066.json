Quote from: mexite on July 20, 2022, 09:08:28 PMWil it be before or after the next Bitcoin halving or this price would never come?It must be after. Bitcoin already reached the new price when it was getting done with the halving. You must see the previous history. Quote from: mexite on July 20, 2022, 09:08:28 PMWhat's your opinion? Im sure that it can but i also believe if bitcoin can't reach that in short time caused by the global crisis that was making so many people feeling fear.",

Do you think that BTC will ever rise to and above 100k in the near future? Wil it be before or after the next Bitcoin halving or this price would never come?What's your opinion? Yes, Bitcoin will reach $100k for sure. However, when it hits $100k no one can tell you for sure. That's the million dollar question. It will probably take years for bitcoin to reach a new ATH .if you have faith in bitcoin then now you should just focus on buying and holding, once bitcoin hits $100k we won't get a chance to see bitcoin at $20k again, those who don't buy now will be the ones who regret it later.actually we can tell when and that is after  after the halving season in 4-5 years from now but if you are asking for a sooner result then this is past due as the last halving happened back in 2021 when price indeed increase incredible .and also we have already reached almost 70k last year so what could be the hindrance breaking 100k in the coming years?or maybe in the next year it will happen? so what could be the situation that bitcoin will never reach?",

We saw BTC pump to its ATH previously when Musk said Tesla was buying, El Salvador made it a legal currency, and the Ukraine war was about to start. Similar world events could easily pump BTC to 100k. Personally, and being that this is an altcoin speculation board, I feel that ALTs will have the highest returns, especially microcap gems like Wanna, CNDL, Rose and TRI.",

If in the near future the price of $100k in Bitcoin is still very difficult to happen because considering the price of Bitcoin which is currently still at $23k so there is more time needed for Bitcoin to reach the price of $100k if there are many people who make bulk buying in Bitcoin with good news support from now on.So it's still likely to happen, but support is also needed in this case for Bitcoin.",

Honestly, seeing the opportunity to make a big material profit through BTC is something for which I feel very grateful. But on the contrary, if only thinking about opportunities without making a clear move on them, it is also meaningless. So I believe that if anyone has experienced different emotions from profit to loss, they will all admit that the future of this market is magical enough to make everyone happy.",

During the previous bull market this was the discussion. The price of bitcoin was around $3000. By the time speculations were to reach $5000. Even the prediction of $8000 - $10k were criticised. This is the reality of people's mind, and the market outlawed reaching close to $20k which is the ath by that time.",

But reaching $100K is possible. But when, you will never know. So far the decline in the price of BTC is still reasonable. This is similar to 2018 after the halving. This year is also similar, but there are slight differences due to poor macro-financial conditions. I still believe that BTC still has confidence and is capable of returning to ATH.",

Any time people have questioned about whether bitcoin can reach even the higher all time high from time to the time but bitcoin is always answering such question by reaching the higher rate than the previous ATH. BTC will even surpass 100k if the market will be starting to bullish and block production will become even smaller due to the halving. This will be happening in the next decade. Im sure that bitcoin can reach such target. Bitcoin is not an inflation hedge. Even bitcoin was loosing due to the various reasons can make the total supply of bitcoin will be decreasing as well.

I don't think it's coming anytime soon, but as you're talking about it, the future could be If someone has combed through BTC from $1000 to now, it is only a matter of time before it sets the bar higher. I'm not a person who likes to go too deep into what people think is important to BTC, but in my experience, the opportunity it brings to things that someone already believes in and wants will definitely be done. My expectation is not what the price will be in the future when I realize that it will go up long term, and so I will hold more instead of thinking about selling for a higher price",

That was the one that drives the price. The main reason why 100k is so elusive is because it wasn't a small amount.You can't just expect that btc will continue to rise on that amount once it start moving upwards but there is a process here that needs to be followed and that is once we reached every new ath, the price will go down for a while before it will move up again hitting another ath. If 100k won't be achieved before halving then after halving we can easily get it, since halving is said to bring a positive impact to the price of btc.",
