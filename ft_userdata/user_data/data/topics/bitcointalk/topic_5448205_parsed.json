And another difference between solo and polo mining in pool mining you'll have to share the mined coin with those that were part of the pool while for solo you get to keep everything. Just look at it as owning a business and running a partnership business where solo is you owning the business so only get to receive both profits and losses while for partnership which is pool mining in this case you get to share with those you're partnering with.",

If you are able to go for solo mining in a way that you have enough hash rate that can compete with other mining pool too, it would be good to do like others and let small miners to join you and you will become a mining pool and you will be the one that is controlling you mining pool. What I can say now is that you should not mine solo if you do not have the capability. Just join a good mining pool if you are not able to create a mining pool because mining pools are the ones that are mining most blocks now, although there is a chance that some few solo miners with small but significant hash rate can still be able to mine blocks too, but this occurrence is not common at all.",
