And now could not resist the urge to round up that figure to 140,000BTC.It is also great that they are not selling any at all, but applying the business model of using their deposits as collateral to take out spendable loans that they can repay at a later time and still retain their Bitcoins holding. This way they do not simply tie up their cash in Bitcoin but can still have money to fund their activities.Quote from: cafter on April 05, 2023, 12:55:12 PMthis news impact price of bitcoin ? if yes, then may be they transfer coins from other wallet to pump bitcoin significantly and dump on high price (just a random thought but, before this tweet came out the price also risen up maybe they bought in real)It can impact the sentiment of Bitcoin holders positively.

I am not an expert in predicting prices but if big authorities are buying BTC and announcing it publicly then that has a good impact on the market for the long term as these BTC will be held captive for a long period of time instead of for trading purposes. This will increase the demand as low supply is there in the market. Overall, this will increase the hash power to increase in order to mine and thus the reward of BTC will decrease. Well, I think that's an obvious thing and every one of us Is familiar with this scenario. Things are getting close. One more thing I have in mind is that if the trading volume will decrease then the load on the blockchain will be less (like traffic). Then the transactional fee will be reduced?",

But it must also be expressed that the strategy that Microstrategy is applying in the market has also brought great profits to them and investors.For me, even though there are only a few cryptos, but seeing some large corporations pay more attention to this market, is also giving me a certain amount of joy in the belief that one day not far from the market.

They won't ever get to that 1% number of 210,000 but that's probably good anyway, we don't need a single company owning 1% of the supply, and they can probably get to high 100,000s after a bunch more years of accumulation.Just imagine if we start having dozens of companies racing to buy up Bitcoin to grow their corporate wealth and ensure their company is always financially safe. Too bad corporate executives outside Saylor haven't figured Bitcoin out yet. Maybe one day we'll see corporations putting in hundreds of millions of dollars into Bitcoin each month.One of Zuckerberg's two goats is named Bitcoin. So he's gotta personally have a good stack of satoshis. I'm waiting for the day when Facebook announces a large Bitcoin buy or starts accumulating regularly. Zuckberberg would have been much smarter putting billions into Bitcoin rather than burning through billions of dollars on trying to pivot to Meta.There was a small short lived corporate race into Bitcoin in late 2020 and early 2021. I wonder if we'll see a much larger corporate race into Bitcoin in 2024/25...though any companies that are smart will accumulate this year and early next year rather than wait for high prices.",
