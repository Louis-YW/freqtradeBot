In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsWhere are the so-called ICO projects that actually rewarded the bounty participants still doing well in the market today? -I believe at the moment we can't point to any successful ones around and with the blame games that have been flying around between bounty hunters and projects teams of who dump the token price after they're listed. -Due to this massive failure of projects to attain success in recent times, there have been limited bounties that actually reward their participants and even third, the reward is so minimal to amount to anything. -So best to avoid that spam first activities of the bounty board, since ther are made of tons of scam projects and a bounty is a total waste of time.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsThere’s still a lot of bounty promotions in bounty thread so technically this kind of promotions are still there but of course that can’t be the basis of the success of the project, some are doing fine while some are still struggling. Bounty still works, all you have to do is to choose your best approach and choose the right manager to handle this promotions and help the project be know by many, for you to succeed you must have a good project and a good marketing strategy, bounty seems to be one of the best option in crypto promotions.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsSince I have been in this forum I haven't heard of any one. The ones that I had high hopes for later turn out to be scam, after they have successfully accumulated some certain amount through their ICO and presales they rug pull and disappear with investors cash ( not all of them though) while the rest of them; is either they dump the price of the token or the remove liquidating of the token. And another thing that affects the ICO process is the way hunters do their jobs, when you go Twitter or medium and search for a project you'll see so many results pop up but when you start reading you'll notice that they're all plagarised post filled with so many hashtags and I don't really see how that's going to help a project grow.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsI believe that bounty isn't not that much worthy anymore to join unless you hit a jackpot by having a successful project. The type of campaigns you mentioned is I believe past their time already. Those niche becomes hot for a certain time until project that applies those on their projects doesn't help anymore in accumulating funds in their project which leads to the main project failed. I don't really have any idea on what is currently happening on bounty campaign scene right now but the last time I heard is there is an increase on number of non-paying campaign, Small awards and scammers which is certainly due to bad market situation.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsThose altcoin projects run a lot of bounties in forum. In Bounties  (Altcoins) you can see a lot of bounty threads. Not all of bounties distributed payments to participants. Very few projects gain success but let be careful with what you call as success for altcoin project.Success can be easily considered as if a token has good pump but with altcoins, most of their pumps are traps. They will fall back especially in bear market and success in bull market will become nightmare in bear market.I don't consider those altcoins projects with short lasting pumps and growths in one bull market are successful projects.Dead coins: How many cryptocurrencies have failed?",

So use all means necessary, social media, forums including this one, crypto sites, etc. You cannot tell how it would create an impact to the success of your project. I have not monitored bounties for a long time but I noticed that there are still many projects using it for promotion. The forum is like a one-stop shop for bounty activities. A project promoted here is also promoted elsewhere through managers here.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaigns This forum is the biggest place for the bitcoin/crypto users to gather than any other forum in the internet. Getting your project exposed to these people is the starting point before going to fintech expos and all that.I think your post confuses between effectiveness of marketing via bounty and awarding participants. I am tell you that effectiveness of marketing is good but even better if you are going in through signature campaigns (bitcoin paying) because bounty campaigns (altcoin/token paying) generate a lot of noise and spam. Obviously the past has been a record for successful campaigns and you can talk to the campaign managers who have been working here for years to get an idea about the same.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsI have not checked the altcoin bounty section of this forum in a while because i already am part of a very good bounty. I think though that it is still possible to find a really good altcoin bounty, even today. Before i was accepted at my recent bounty i participated in the bounty of Radix. This was almost two years ago but the tokens i got from a few weeks of signature bounty brought me tokens that are still worth 1000$ at the moment and during it's ATH in 2021 or so they were worth around 10k$. So i think it is still possible to find good altcoin bounties. You just need to thoroughly check the project first. Don't just join the bounty of the project that is offering the biggest bounty. If the project is dead already in a few weeks, then it doesn't matter if you got a lot of tokens from them.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsNothing comes to mind. At least not recently. I think so many people were burned in 2018 by projects they believed in and invested their money into, that the community has become rightfully cynical of most of the offerings here. It’s a bit of a shame as that attitude will certainly hinder innovation, but at least it keeps people from throwing their money away in scams.",

Maybe before crypto started to bloom, forum is the best placr to market the project but now there are plenty of social platform that effectively use to earn from rewards or community promotions. Like coingecko, they have now marketing promotions and give airdrops to users on doing task. Recently acs protocol given good rewards to participants.",

In any niche, DNFs , Gaming, ICOs any type of fundraising campaignsThey are too many to mention. To answer that, yes, it's always been effective to run bounties and campaigns through the forum because this is the place where most people are looking for projects in which they want to invest. It's the forum where the central attraction for the crypto market where everyone checks out if there are some new projects that they should invest in. But not every bounty and campaign that conducts it here do find success. But these marketing are really a great factor that contributes to a project's success.",
