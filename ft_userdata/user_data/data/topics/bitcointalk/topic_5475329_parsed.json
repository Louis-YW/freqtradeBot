So I went to Walmaet.com and got her a 65\" for $230!That page doesn't exist, you obviously meant Walmart? 65-inch TV for only $230 seems like a mission impossible to me, at least where I live. Even if there is such a cheap TV somewhere, I honestly doubt that it is a well-known brand, and if it is a no-name brand, then I wonder what quality the device is and how much the warranty is worth?It is very likely this model, but for me personally, that brand is not something I like.",

      "body": "This year I haven't got anything on Black Friday. I just didn't needed anything specific. And buying something what I don't really need just because it's great deal - it's not for me.In previous years I got some good deals paying with Bitcoin like hosting, domains or VPN. But now it often feels that many sellers is cheating. They inceease prices before Black Friday and then add big discount that it would look like amazing deal.Quote from: Lucius on November 24, 2023, 04:13:16 PMIt is very likely this model, but for me personally, that brand is not something I like.Getting 65 inches 4K TV for $230 sounds too good to be true. Everything looks nice on paper, but when you will try to watch, I doubt that image that you will get will look satisfying. TV is something what people usually don't buy for year or two, but longer period, so, I don't think it's place to save money and buy cheapest model. But for mother-in-law maybe it will be OK. And it's Roku based TV what is big no for me. I only accept Android TV",

I'm currently building a shop/small warehouse so anything beneficial to this project is my primary focus. I've been consolidating wants vs needs  and liabilities vs assets this year... However my mother in law hasn't ever gotten anything from me for a holiday(worth remembering) we usually swap coffee related gifts. I doubt this gets me brownie points in her book but it damn sure did in my wife's.",

I really wanted a good smartwatch and a speaker. I ended up stocking grocery supplies, some cosmetics and winter clothes.The single most expensive shopping I did was a piano for my dad with his money.",

I don't know the periods of time you made that shopping of a TV but with the period of time this post was made, Walmart black Fridays deals was still ongoing.And the events deal begins since the 8th of November with an online and continues from the stores in details time programs schedules and wraps up the event deals on the 26th November.Quote from: WhyFhy on November 24, 2023, 01:08:31 PMWhat deals are y'all hunting for today? I know it is nice taking advantages on purchases during the black Fridays but I am not moved my it at all because I get what I needs at the right time so I don't have to do some unnecessary shoppings on what I am not in need of because there is a black Friday where services are tendered a cheap rate.",

As the saying goes\" one man's meat is another man's poison\" for me there is nothing like black Friday. because those price you see there are same but they confuse people by making it look as if the price has changed. For example a goods sold at $60 at beginning of this year January might be sold for $65 and confuse you by putting something like this $100 before, $65 now.But for me now to rank up is my problem, if I rank up I will be happier than Christmas bonanzer or any black Friday.",

Last year, I bought a shoe for $140 compared to the real price, which was $210, only to discover later that its price was $90.With Bitcoin, I can only buy gift cards, some discounted digital products, or hardware wallets.",

I would like to hunting for a bitcoin purchase with a 50% black friday discount. Is this sold in Walmart?  Have the Walmart removed bitcoin ATMs from their stores yet? I somehow lost sight of this point.",
