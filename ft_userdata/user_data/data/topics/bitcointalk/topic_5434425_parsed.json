We don't sign any legal documents when submitting the registration form, and I'm curious how far can the authorities reach this. You could be considered \"affiliated\" by accepting payment for advertising the service. I think that it is highly unlikely that an authority would reach their arm all the way from the founder of the service, to those who work on it technically/directly in some way, to those who manage campaigns, then to you, just for being paid a few dollars per post to have some flashy text in your signature. I doubt the arm would even reach as far as the campaign manager. As LoyceV said, the entire advertising industry would collapse if things worked that way and if it worked like this at maximum efficiency, the population of incarcerated versus not would probably be way out of balance. If you are worried about being prosecuted for being very slightly and temporarily affiliated with a service that is very likely to have some users that are using it for illicit purposes (which is almost certain with mixing services if I'm not wrong), then don't. If you were ever prosecuted, it's probably likely that it's not the primary reason that whatever authority responsible was coming to you. I would assume (take with a grain of salt) that you'd have nothing to worry about ifÂ  you aren't already under watch for a much more serious reason and/or you are doing basic things to sufficiently upkeep your privacy.",

Of course, the laws will be different around the world so what would happen would be different depending on jurisdiction but there's little chance you would personally be in trouble, but maybe your country has different laws on what people are allowed to advertise. I'm sure you could potentially get into trouble for advertising illegal services but I would be very surprised if someone came after you or other people who were advertising a company on some random website. How would they even know who you are? It's not like you've signed a contract with them and they have all your details that law enforcement can get if they shut down a service. All they have is a username on a forum unless they subpoena the board to get more information but I doubt that would happen just to try find out who was advertising them here.

Here in the US there is a big emphasis on Mens rea https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_reaSo there is the element of what is going on. Using your HSBC example they knew, but it was going to be just about impossible to prove who knew what and when. If some shifty looking person shows up at my shop and I take in a few thousand in cash and take a cut and give it back with a 1099 tax form it's fairly obvious what I was doing.So that is going to be a big part of it. If you are wearing a signature for Bob's Meth and Heroin shop it's going to be a much more difficult thing to talk your way out of then say [looks down at signature] ChipMixer which is a legit service for people who just don't want to be tracked.-Dave",

Since a lot of the campaigns users advertise here are legitimate businesses that have been operating for years, this isn't likely to be a concern for many. However, if the authorities expect you're related to the service any other way other than advertising, and have some convincing evidence to back that up; they will likely take it further, and include it in the request to theymos for more information. It's up to theymos then if he complies, and to what extent. Generally, he'd have to comply given the evidence was strong enough.",

Also, like I said, err on the side of caution if you're worried. Law Enforcement could always decide to go after people who were advertising a service they deem illegal but unless it's a ponzi or some other scam then I think the chances of them wasting time trying to find out who was advertising a service on a message board would be slim though obviously not impossible.

They can and will go after Ponzi promoters etc. A fair few youtubers ended up getting into trouble for promoting these things to their audience even though they weren't directly involved they were making money from their referrals etc and spreading the scam to a larger audience. I think some even went to jail for it. Didn't some high profile celebs like Floyd Mayweather and Kim Kardashian also get into trouble for promoting pump and dumps and unregistered securities related to crypto coins as well? Those things are a little different to promoting other services but the legality of such will vary from region to region. Gambling sites are illegal in many counties for instance. I'm sure even bitcoin by itself is illegal to use in many countries too.",
