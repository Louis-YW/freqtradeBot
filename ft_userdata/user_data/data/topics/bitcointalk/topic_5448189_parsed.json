Big things come in small packages, educating others on bitcoin is valuable to the bitcoin ecosystem as running your own node. Was the $20 in bitcoin or fiat? I would prefer if you gave them bitcoins so they can have their own non custodial wallets and learn how to send/receive bitcoins. Happy Easter!",

I think you have done a remarkable thing on this day by giving away $100 worth of Bitcoin. Also, I think you should give us some pictures to really make us believe you did what you said, that's if you don't mind. Am now the Thomas that's not yet convinced.",

Do they know how to keep their wallet safe,  and what are they planning to do with that bitcoin?",

A lot of people would have started it like that if they have something to start on. It's great that you were able to ask them to create a non-custodial wallet because it can be quite overwhelming at first if they don't have devices to use or if they want something easy.",

I am sure some of them might not have known bitcoin before but you have introduced it to them. They might not invest in or buy the currency now because most of them are still depending on their parent but they might consider it in the future.  I also have some reservations about your selfless service. In my country, students in high schools are between the ages of 9-16 years. So I want to add that introducing some of these students to bitcoin at this tender age might become a distraction to them. They should focus more on their academic and social life at this age and not on financial matters. Please don't get me wrong, I commend your effort but I am not comfortable with the ages of your target.",

You have done well OP but i am curious to know more on your interactive session with the students. You said  you had a lecture with them on whatsApp how were you able to decipher that they all really understood what you taught because giving them bitcoin after teaching them when you were not there with them does not guarantee that they really understood the process as you can not tell as they are smart kids. I am not i anyway discrediting your good works but i am just curious as to know.",

A little quiz with a prize would make them study and research more about Bitcoin for them to have knowledge about it. However it makes me think on how can they manage their Bitcoin in their wallet? I hope you gave them instructions too for them to make it big and not gonna freeze in their wallet for a long time. They might just flex that they have Bitcoin but for a long time they didn't even know how to convert it in fiat money or how to make profit from it.",

I don't understand how they got their wallet ? Where you the one that taught them about how to get a noncustodial wallet, if yes. Did you teach them how to use their wallet and to back up their phrase seed. I feel this is too much for them as a newbie for their age. Next time don't introduce them to money,instead just teach them the basics of bitcoin and when they are grown up and they like bitcoin concept, they can learn on their own from when you stopped. This will distract them from their studies because if they tell their friends about this. They may all be looking for watsap groups that gives out bitcoin which is untrue",

But since you give $20 to five random students, each student will get $4.  In this case, if you want to pay them via Bitcoin, you will be charged a $0.5-$1 transaction fee when you send that $4 to their Bitcoin address.  And when those students go to sell those bitcoins they will still be charged exactly the same fee.  So this fee may seem unfair as there are small amount transactions. But on the other hand if you pay it in fiat then they won't know much about bitcoin.  So you pay in Bitcoin it will help them to understand about Bitcoin practically.",

If possible frequently visit the children and teach them how to safely invest money on various crypto assets, how to avoid losses and how to prevent scams.

So how many children exactly there with you from the first, it I am not wrong then, 5 are only the winners, and there were more people also?

That could make them more curious about Bitcoin and make them interested in being able to adopt Bitcoin as their digital asset.
