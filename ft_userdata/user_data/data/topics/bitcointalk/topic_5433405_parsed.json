Not sure why I'm even bothering to reply this butthurt troll. What's wrong with you? 2017 was left by the developer in the source code, it was fixed when it was mentioned by someone else. I don't consider fixed float a regular 'exchange', they don't ask for KYC and they just swap coins like we do.By the way, \"us asking\" is literally 2 new accounts that were made for the sole purpose to comment on this thread, lol. Not a 'RED FLAG' at all, huh?",

If you don't want, don't use us, couldn't care less about a guy who makes a new account to make posts.you ignored my questions, now you want to ignore other users questions very SUSPICIOUS, specially when they have a point.like why would you claim that you were working from 2017 when you're new?I'm not obliged to answer any questions, first of all. Secondly, it was already answered, get a pair of glasses. Finally, You're a troll who makes new accounts to shit on this thread. You've been very clear on the suspicious part, if it's so suspicious for you, just f**k off and don't use us, and stop spamming with new accounts. Get something better to do & although thanks for bumping the thread, appreciate it.that's very unprofessional, we are asking questions because we are concerned about all the RED FLAGS you are showingwhat's wrong with us asking why you were claiming that you are working from 2017 when you are only a few weeks old besides you denying working with any exchange and then admitting to it?Are you slow or something? When you drive a car and see a potential impact (red flag), do you push the pedal even further or push the brakes? If it's a red flag, don't use us. Not sure why I'm even bothering to reply this butthurt troll. What's wrong with you? 2017 was left by the developer in the source code, it was fixed when it was mentioned by someone else. I don't consider fixed float a regular 'exchange', they don't ask for KYC and they just swap coins like we do.By the way, \"us asking\" is literally 2 new accounts that were made for the sole purpose to comment on this thread, lol. Not a 'RED FLAG' at all, huh?you're making MISLEADING statements and lying about not using an exchange then admitting to it also claiming that you are working from 2017 YOU are the seller in this position not ME, why do you KEEP DODGING all questions from the first post on the thread and changing the subject if you are not planning on EXIT SCAMMING like previous exchanges",

We do have partners that we work with, which isn't an exchange & which does not require KYC. My apologies for the \"About page\", we didn't intend to be misleading, will be fixed within the day, appreciate you pointing that out.Didn't you say \"We do have partners that we work with, which isn't an exchange\" is this another false statement?Also you're saying FEATURED ON BLOCKCHAIR as if it's a reliable source which is NOT. Blockchair is an explorer not an adviser they list exchanges that use them EVEN if they're shady. FTX was listed there few months ago.Sir please be transparent this is a crypto exchange not a candy shop, not a month has gone by and you're already showing all red flags.Aren't you tired of making new accounts? I can hire you for support if you have too much free time on your hand.
