She is 50+ but managed a busy small hotel and has a son who had been playing games on the computer all the time. After some discussion, I advised her to just remind the son not to gamble the BTC. So she asked how I end up gambling online. I'm not totally a gambler at all, I started investing and somehow stray as I'm trying to win some. She began to worry since her son is on the computer all the time and might gamble upon learning the BTC can be gambled.Which one has a high possibility of happening, a gamer eventually becomes a gambler or an investor turns into a gambler?But first, answer the poll which are you. Are you a gambler that become an investor or an investor that turned into a gambler?",

At this time, there may have been many hidden advertisements containing gambling.I am an investor who is also a gambler but a responsible gambler by always monitoring the amount of money I gamble with.He should really watch over his son, who often plays games on the computer and taking him to learn to manage his hotel would be better for him so his focus would be distracted from playing games all the time.",

I think the crypto market may attract those who are already gamblers, but putting money into shitcoins hoping to hit the next 100 or 1,000x is quite similar to gambling. Today bitcoin is more stable, despite its volatility and I think people who buy bitcoin don't have that gambler mentality in general.In any case, I think the path is from gambler to gambling with cryptocurrencies or bitcoin, not the other way around.",

Quote from: bittraffic on December 13, 2022, 02:26:34 AMShe began to worry since her son is on the computer all the time and might gamble upon learning the BTC can be gambled.I wouldn't think of connecting gambling to BTC really. If the said son was investing in BTC then that in itself should be a time and money sinker imo, and would probably give him enough stress that I wouldn't really consider doing anything else. I'm just baffled how a simple convo of a son using the computer all day turned into BTC and then gambling. Your average gamer joe just probably plays Dota 2/Cs:go or some variant of those really.",

Even when I invest (in some alts I like) I consider that as some form of gambling... gambling is a philosophy!Whether someone will like trading or gambling depends on many factors. People generally like to try and experiment with new things, it's important what we encounter first, whether there is someone close to us who will introduce us to and guide us through the world of investing or gambling. There are various and incredible examples, I guess each of us learns about things along the way... so I don't think there are any rules about this matter.",

They invest money in the game or they deposit so that they have something to bet. Another thing that they invest is time and effort. In some gambling sites like bitdice, bustabit, and bitvest you can also invest on them (literally).In investing, there is also a gambling with it or so-called risks. Old school gamers are free from the influence of gambling but the one that is exposed in gambling are the kids that play modern games in the app store and android store because most of the games there are pay to win.",

There might come a time after investing you might find yourself gambling after getting into cryptocurrency since blockchain is also used by gambling platforms and is advertised anywhere. I can't see any relationship between investing and gambling, it all depends on how you view cryptocurrency, if you treat it as an investment then you will never invest just to gamble away your money. People learn about crypto in various ways, gambling can also be one of the reasons for it.",

Investment/separate.2. Gamble/separate.What I mean is.I invest with my hard-earned money, professionally I don't mix gambling money with investment money, I prefer to provide investment returns to my family, without having to involve gambling money.My goal is to gamble only as entertainment and experience, where I have to involve money to bet, really hot money, so winning for me is not a pride as well as losing is not a cry for me, solely for pleasure for me.Of course, these two reasons are not an option for me, except: the poll implies 'investment' or 'gambling' of course I choose both, why both, of course there are reasons for that, as I said above.",

Regarding the other question, I think a gamer has a higher chance to be a gambler first than a BTC investor. This is a fact, there are bets happening inside the game, you name it, CS, Dota, etc.. They put money at stake to make the game more entertaining and that's considered gambling. Unlike an investor which have different paths to take, he can be a long-term, short-term investor, a trader, or would not just give a damn about gambling at all.",

Are you a gambler that become an investor or an investor that turned into a gambler?With today's competition in esports, it's very highly likely that gamers can be turned into easy gamblers. There's no question about that and that's a high probability so the woman should really be worried about it. How old is the son then? If he's in the teenage years, well, that's one of the stages that curiosity will tick in for these youngsters. Just tell the woman that doesn't give her BTC to her son and just keep it to herself so that she's the one managing the ins and outs of the transactions.",

The same goes for bitcoin investors, the bitcoin orientation you receive from the start determines whether you will remain true investors or have gambling in your gene. I'm not sure why people are afraid of gamers these days turning into addicted gamblers, I remember hanging out as a kid at a gaming house with my friends for fun, betting against each other, and my parents didn't see the big picture of us becoming gamblers at the end of the day, but today parents are afraid that their children will become gamblers.",

The moment I learned about crypto, I decided to take a risk in it because who knows, it might be worth the shot. And it is. You just have to have a good self-control. Discipline is a must in investing and trading. Most especially in gambling if you're going to make it as one of your source of income. This is why it is important to know the pros and cons of risk taking and gambling in general. You must know the basics such as how to analyze and assess, how to make a strategy, and the likes to have higher chances of winning.However, it is not really advisable to make gambling as your main source of income. It should just be your way or outlet to release stress. And if ever you really will insist to make a profit out of it, you should be ready for the consequences.",
