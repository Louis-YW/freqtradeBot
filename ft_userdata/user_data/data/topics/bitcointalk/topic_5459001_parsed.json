Sounds like youhave plenty of design ideas CT.",

CTThat's cool as shit - I love the patina on it, how did you manage that if I may ask? (Didn't really see it till Alouain's closeup above).I'd buy one of those for sure. The antiqued/toned look is amazing.  Quote from: aoluain on July 09, 2023, 07:16:29 AMWas wondering the same as owlcatz - it looks amazing, love the design of it and the aged look.These along with you other editions sit very well with BitcoinPenny's Spanish treasures release IMO.I think the theme is complimentary to the Caribbean Treasures releases Yes, I agree there too, thanks for the close-up shot!",

If more \"Silver Keys\" are made, i'll list them. They are just a fun side project. From the 1,000's of wallets I have held, Silver Keys are by far the most badass wallet I've seen.",
