First you must have ARM packages or APPImage format for wallet so they could work with your device.I know that Electrum wallet works just fine in RaspberryPi if you install all required packages, but I didn't try with Atomic and Exodus wallet.It's much better multicurrency option to use hardware wallet connected with RaspberryPi and I am sure that Trezor Suite is available as ARM and it works with RPi4.",
