In addition, there are those who share their ideas in this forum, so you can create a thread called Trading Ideas In Tradingview and present your idea in it, and others will help you. By presenting his analyzes and so on.",

Usually they are profitable for a few weeks, maybe a month and then boom they go bust along with anyone who follows them.Those with TradingView are no different. They aren’t some Wall Street traders who post their best trades online and get nothing in return. They are just people who are posting for fun and get people to follow. However they are never profitable in the long run.",

      "body": "First and foremost, when it comes to trading you can never get all your  market forecasts correct because so many factors beyond our control affect the markets.Secondly, following a few traders isn't a bad idea as their trading ideas can be used as reference points in trying to understand why a trade won or lost but heavy dependance on these guys is a no no for me as these will make money off subscriptions of which you could have bought yourself a nice meal off that by learning how to trade by yourself...process might be boring but the rewards will be better and sweet once you master this art.Quote from: david678345 on October 14, 2023, 06:31:33 PMany trader worth following on tradingview?No name comes to mind but when it comes to general trading - Michael aka ICT, the man of the moment.",

However they are never profitable in the long run. I have seen some copy traders are consistent performers. Their last few month's performance was amazing and their followers are massive. I don't think all of them are just bullshit, if they are then their career should have ended after one or two months. This is not the case for all of them. I agree with you that most of them are just a salesman but pro traders but some of them are really amazing.",
