  "content": "When we talk about cold wallet, we mean that the wallet is stored on a machine/phone, which has no access to the internet.Even if you install Electrum wallet on machine which has no internet access, it is the Electrum cold storage. The same goes for the Airgapped devices. Here I have few questions.1- If we connect the Internet to that machine once or sometimes (to update the Electrum wallet) , will it not remain a cold storage?2- If we are sure that there is no malware or something in the computer, what difference does it make to connect that cold storage computer sometimes to the internet to make transactions? As per my understanding, we do not connect cold storage to the internet because we fear that any malware may get our electrum seeds etc. Is is right ? There is no other reason. Connecting to Internet, does not mean that the Internet will know the private key or leaks your private key.3- If we install electrum on computer (which is malware free and connected to the internet), make a new wallet, keep a note of the seeds and then uninstall electrum from that computer and also remove the wallet files, isn't it secure too?",

You cannot or never be sure once it touches or connects to the internet because once it touches it then consider it been already compromised. There are malwares that can’t easily be detected. And connecting it sometimes to internet as you have suggested even if you are sure the device doesn’t have malware doesn’t not make it a cold storage again but rather a hot storage that is yet to catch malware. A cold storage never touches the internet.",

Second, when you delete data, all you are actually doing is telling your computer it can write over these sectors of your hard disk when it needs to. The data isn't actually removed until it is written over, which could take months or even years depending on how you use that disk.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 31, 2023, 06:36:21 AMif we are sure that there are no vulnerabilities in the system, then we can connect to the internet.You aren't sure.

Have you read every line of code for every piece of software running your computer, from your BIOS and OS through to your wallet software? Are you examining every incoming and outgoing packet across your internet connect to check for malware or data being leaked? Of course not. Therefore you have no idea if there are vulnerabilities in your system.This is the whole point of a permanently airgapped device. It is impossible to have a completely secure system connected to the internet, but you can mitigate a lot of possible attack vectors simple by airgapping your device permanently.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 31, 2023, 06:36:21 AMAgain, assuming the computer never gets stolen, uninstalling the electrum keeps the coin safe even if some malware later comes in that computer and we never re-install the electrum in that computer without formatting it first.Again, nope. Your wallet data will still exist on your hard drive unless you have deliberately written over the necessary sectors, which few people do. Malware can access that data and send it off to an attacker.",

With tail OS, the Electrum wallet comes by default and there is no need to install any more softwares. Secondly, you can keep save that USB like you save a hardware wallet.",

Which means it should not have any connection to outer world even there must not be any Bluetooth, or NFC etc. This definition indicates that we should not attach our AG wallet to outside world even if we do it for once or two time then it is not Air-gapped anymore. To update the wallet you could use SD card or usb to insert data into your wallet. In my knowledge most of the wallet even do not have the option of SD card mean to insert data in it. But in current era, new wallets are coming which have many features. like QR scan etc. and more which also lies on security levels.

But you are saying you are connecting that computer to online will not make it non-air-gapped. I mean the question is same but you changed the device. i.e. In first question the device was air-gapped wallet and in this question the device is air-gapped computer. So my answer is same for the Question 1 and 2.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 31, 2023, 03:00:49 AM3- If we install electrum on computer (which is malware free and connected to the internet), make a new wallet, keep a note of the seeds and then uninstall electrum from that computer and also remove the wallet files, isn't it secure too?Secure from what? I mean if you are that sure about your computer being free of virus then what's the need of uninstalling the electrum from it. But still in my knowledge it is not a practical thing to achieve Means not a single computer could remain free of malware. There are numerous types of Malware so new types of malwares will keep coming. But Yeah this method is way secure then keeping that Electrum wallet installed on your device.",

I use a hot wallet frequently. But I only use it for amounts I can afford to lose. My rule of thumb is \"How much cash would you carry around in your physical wallet?\" $100? Fine. Then $100 worth of bitcoin can be in a hot wallet. $10,000? No chance. So that amount of bitcoin should be on something more secure, be that a hardware wallet or an airgapped wallet.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 31, 2023, 08:13:01 PMSince i do not have any extra system with me right now to meet this emergency, is the tails USB with the built-in electrum can be trusted?It's certainly better than a hot wallet, provided you disconnect your internet connection prior to booting to Tails and keep Tails offline the entire time you are using it. But it is not as good as a proper hardware wallet or dedicated airgapped computer.",

This can be a cost effective and better solution rather than making a computer or a mobile an air-gapped device. With tail OS, the Electrum wallet comes by default and there is no need to install any more softwares. Secondly, you can keep save that USB like you save a hardware wallet.Since i do not have any extra system with me right now to meet this emergency, is the tails USB with the built-in electrum can be trusted?Better learn how to setup before doing it on your own or else you may end up either setting the wallet incorrectly or losing your bitcoins.I would advise you to first watch these three tutorials to have a basic understanding. Although these are a bit old, but they will give you an idea of what you are going to do.Hardware Wallets in TAILS or Ubuntu Linux - Verify GPG Electrum, udev rules, sweep Paper WalletHow To Make A DIY Cold Storage Bitcoin WalletElectrum offline transactions tutorial",

This verification step should never be skipped. Be aware that TAILS is agnostic, forgets everything you saved, unless you have a persistent storage partition setup (which is usually or should be encrypted; don't forget or loose the decryption passphrase!).Don't rely on a single USB flash device, be it with TAILS or some other encrypted container or other valuable data on it, as such devices can fail. Cheap flash storage is sometimes of questionable quality. No backups, no mercy!",

There's not really a point discussing something that doesn't exist.QuoteWe use Cold Storage only to avoid any possible risk that comes through the Internet, Right?Wrong. It also protects you against your own stupid mistakes. Example:Quote from: LoyceV on April 18, 2019, 11:17:39 AMIn June, 2016, I accidentally copied the private key for 1foreverDArUNEX2gVD26vautcx3b8zTZ in my Google search bar. That's been bugging me ever since. It still holds a small balance (~), which isn't what I worry about (and I still use it for tips).I've downloaded my data from Google, and it confirms Google still knows the private key. It's not something I worry about that much, but it's a loose end to tie up.Quote from: noormcs5 on August 31, 2023, 03:00:49 AMif we are sure that there are no vulnerabilities in the system, then we can connect to the internet.The whole reason of using cold storage is because you can't know all vulnerabilities. For laughs:Quote from: https://www.theregister.com/2004/08/19/infected_in20_minutes/What normally happens within twenty minutes? That's how long your average unprotected PC running Windows XP, fresh out of the box, will last once it's connected to the Internet.~20 minutes is not long enough to update your Windows PC before it is too late.That's a while ago, but there's no reason to think it won't happen now.Quote from: Cricktor on September 03, 2023, 07:59:53 PMI consider TAILS safe enough for me.Are you talking about cold or hot storage? It's easy to have 2 USB sticks, paint tape one blue and the other red. The blue cold one doesn't have internet and holds your private keys, the red hot one has internet and a watch-only wallet.QuoteDon't rely on a single USB flash device, be it with TAILS or some other encrypted container or other valuable data on it, as such devices can fail. Cheap flash storage is sometimes of questionable quality. No backups, no mercy!Keep your seed words on paper and you don't have to worry about the USB stick.Quote from: Medusah on September 03, 2023, 10:16:06 PMThere are millions of things to account for your computer's security.  One of them is the net.  Never connecting to the net, and to no network in general can mitigate every possible network attack.But for how long?Quote from: LoyceMobile on August 24, 2023, 08:31:02 AMUpdate: I googled it, and the first thing I found was lifetime eSim for €2.50, to be soldered inside a device. This is very scary, it will create a whole new level of attacks. Imagine replacing someone's hardware wallet with a fake device with esim that instantly broadcasts the PIN. Air gapped devices will need a faraday cage to be sure.",
