      "body": "I actually for something like this it doesn't really matter whether it's a big or small gamble but of course there are a number of things to pay attention to and the most basic is reputation. As long as they have a good reputation I don't have a problem with it but if it doesn't make me comfortable with the reputation they have I certainly won't look at things like this.The Coinplay case might be one of the lessons learned (again).On the other hand, I also just want to apply that even though gambling is something that has a certain risk of loss, but on the other hand I don't want to be reckless when choosing a casino site because indeed this can be said to be a basis that must be known because even though gambling is bad, of course fraud in gambling is something worse.",

      "body": "If asked why we have to play on a small gambling platform, maybe it's because we need new experience on the game side or it could also be to seek luck on that gambling platform, but sometimes playing on a small gambling platform is always vulnerable to fraud, so most old gamblers often avoid new platforms, let alone platforms. little gamble.I am a person who likes to find new experiences on small gambling platforms, usually playing to test games only, make a small deposit and play according to a fee that I can afford to lose, beginners should not do that because they are vulnerable to fraud so it's best to avoid unless you want to play with risk, after all, there are still many large gambling platforms that are safer to try than small gambling platforms that are prone to the risk of fraud.",

This question is also for the owners of gambling platform, maybe they can help to reply it.Maybe this question come out because we are at the time when we have so many popular and trusted casinos already. How if we are at the time when all casinos are still new? all the sites you mentioned above were minor gambling platform as well at the beginning. Playing on minor/new gambling site is fine as long as we know how to choose which one looks good enough. Coming up to the chance of something bad (scam or something else), it may happened also in major/old reputable casinos. Do you remember the history of Safedice? It was a great reputable site but they were gone badly.",

Trusted they may be, the likes of Cloudbet, Fortunejack, and others cannot actually guarantee us of 100% smooth experience. Although, of course, brands like them are still a lot more worth of our trust than those who don't have the track record yet like Coinplay. But I understand those who are trying to explore options and new and better features. The competition among crypto gambling platforms is getting stronger and stronger. New platforms are born every now and then offering a new kind of experience. The risk, though, is high with these new players in the industry.",

Assuming you know someone to be good and trustworthy while other people like you are also referring the person to be good. Is that not enough for you to consider doing business with the person after you further research and also pointing to the direction of the person to be a good person and reliable. If you see another person that is not yet known to the community, would that be the person you will do business with? Although anything can happen, but people prefer to going for reputable sites.",

This question is also for the owners of gambling platform, maybe they can help to reply it.Give them the benefit of the doubt, usually the start up gambling site also gives more rewards and bonuses so they can attract more players, you might wanna take advantage of that, just be ready for the possible risk since new sites are more prone to rug pull or a scam site. Many gamblers want's to try other platform and find their luck there, if you are ok with the minor casinos considering you do your own research for that, then it should be no problem at all.",

This question is also for the owners of gambling platform, maybe they can help to reply it.why do you have to rule out the possibility of new competitors in the online gambling business appearing, even online gambling sites that are already big now start from user distrust but they are successful in dealing with users and maintaining their reputationRegarding coinplay, I don't know what really happened to them, but each gambling site has its own system. Apart from that, we cannot fully blame the owner of the gambling business because it is possible for users to try to cheat but end up having bad luck until their accounts are locked",

Big casinos were small at first... You are a legendary member, you must remember the days when all the big names in the crypto gambling industry were starting out and taking their first steps. I gave a chance to most of them and I still play in some of them. I often give a chance to some new casino, and why not? I would use StarBets as an example, a relatively new casino and I am active there almost from the start (like I was active in many big casinos from the start), they have a nice story with dividends (something I like) and until now everything there works fine, without any problems when it comes to withdrawals, and like many other fair crypto casinos they also have provably fair games that can be tested.",
