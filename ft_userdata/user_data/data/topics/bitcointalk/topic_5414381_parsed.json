  "content": "Analysis is what differentiate a crypto market trader from a crypto market gambler. When i mean analysis i don't just refer to blindly following support and resistance zone because it's the most common tool used in the crypto market. You will hear some OG say wait for support to buy and when it gets to resistance don't hesitate to sell. Support and resistance could be a powerful tool if it works in confluence but with the current trend support and resistance alone can be so undependable.The market gets more complicated has more adoption hits the crypto community causing the margin between the bulls and bears to remain in  constant fluctuation pending when a temporal direction is reached. And has long as this direction isn't permanent the tools for analysis keeps updating.Technical analysis this days seems even more frustrating as candle sticks keeps pushing trades against traders. Because emotions and instincts are been mistaken for analysis. Trading the obvious is rather the aim and not trading the expected or assumed.",

On a serious note, we should refrain from trading while market is having high volatility because of any major news like FED Rate Hikes. As a result, we won't do the same mistake while analyzing and even taking trades. I usually do this because we won't need to trade every single week, just take a break for a week and make profits in the next one while market isn't having major events or volatility. Basically TA+FA = Profits From Trading",

Currently, the condition of the crypto market is more complicated to analyze even though we have learned how to use multiple indicators at the same time because the price of bitcoin in the market can change direction at any time. This makes many of us wrong in buying or selling, but some people can still benefit from the current situation. Current trading can trigger stress levels to be higher because of the reversal that occurs in the market every day, making it difficult for us to analyze.",

We also know that pump and dump is a form of market manipulation. In other words it is something that is not predictable due to lack of logic.In other words your post is more right about bitcoin but when you talk about crypto market aka altcoins, it becomes less right.QuoteThe market gets more complicated has more adoption hits the crypto community causing the margin between the bulls and bears to remain in  constant fluctuation pending when a temporal direction is reached. But that also means the order books become more packed with orders making manipulation that much harder. A good comparison is between bitcoin and small altcoins. You have to spend millions of dollars to push bitcoin price up or down a little bit but with a couple of thousands you can pump most of the altcoins significantly.QuoteTechnical analysis this days seems even more frustrating as candle sticks keeps pushing trades against traders.Another indication that TA doesn't work in markets that are dominated by manipulation.",

Like bitcoin.Bag holding is w hen you bag hold something that is overvalue but still dumps and has no potential of rising back up ever again. Like altcoins. If you look at 2018 and topics that were made those days you can see how people are advising others to be \"patient\" and bag hold altcoins that kept dumping and never went back up again to the 2017 prices like ETH that to this day has not been able to go back to its 2017 price despite all the pump attempts.",

Trading the obvious is rather the aim and not trading the expected or assumed.Well, I guess that's a plus in some sort of form since it makes those who are correct in actually reading the market profit more. I wouldn't pull down instinct sometimes since a good call can sometimes just come from a gut feeling, especially if it was backed by the current news and whatnot. Heck just determining the general trend imo is more than good enough, and any specifics after that are just a bonus to taking in more profits.I'd also just put emotions under control, they exist as a form of warning sometimes but if you know how to control them and if you believe in what you've studied/analyzed then in the first place I don't think your emotions would take control of you.",

About 90% of traders don't control their emotion while trading and hence loose money while they're supposed to make profit due to emotions, this was equally a big challenge that I was faced with during my early time of trading, I close trades when I'm not supposed to and wouldn't leave the market as when due, will  want to recover every lost that I encountered while trading forgetting that sometimes you win and some you loose, until I realized that whenever I lost about two trades in a day I have to take a leave and shut my computer down for another day because some day the market won't just favour you no matter your level of analysis even with all the best tools.",

A professional even suffers a loss due to some errors they cannot detect. The market is not always predictable, sometimes the market becomes very wild and not as desired. Profits and losses are mutually exclusive, but the percentage of profits must be higher than the losses.

A professional trader won't allow his emotions to control his decisions. You should focus on your goal and objective so you will not be distracted by the changes in the market due to its volatility. Trading has lots of challenges so you better be ready to face all of them. Control your emotions or else they will be the ones to control you. Focus on your analysis than your personal instinct. Apply the basic fundamentals and strategies that you know are effective, especially in times of doubt and confusion. Being professional isnt a state that you could really gain up directly without having able to experience lots of trials and errors which would basically involving emotion handling too which it would really be that crucial on making yourself a better trader because if you are someone who are really that impulsive specially on hard or tough decisions then you would definitely fail or find yourself to be not that mucheffective on trading career but of course no one would really able to get it perfectly on just few tries.Just continue to engage and try to be versatile on various conditions and make yourself way more better compared on yesterday.",
