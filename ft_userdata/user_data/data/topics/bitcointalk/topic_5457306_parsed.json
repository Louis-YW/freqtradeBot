Again assume it is true reason, what happened to cause price fall to under $16,000?QuoteDo you think the race to accumulate bitcoin will begin, and what consequences it may have for the price and stability of this cryptocurrency?  Price will continue to be volatile except if governments set daily price margin for this market and has Circuit Break like stock market has. Anyway volatility won't be excluded because it is important part and beauty of a market.Market cycles are more important and some facts about market cycles inA volatile road to nowhere",

Do you think the race to accumulate bitcoin will begin, and what consequences it may have for the price and stability of this cryptocurrency?  The race to accumulate bitcoin is already the name of the game ever since, specially from early adopters. It's not the question of how we accumulate, it's the question on when we accumulate and when we are going to sell to make profits.https://twitter.com/GregSchoen/status/70261648811761665As for institutional investors accumulating, or companies holding BTC on their balance sheet,https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/treasuries/And they have been doing it with or without the renewed interested in Bitcoin ETF's that we have seen lately. This is smart investors, they are usually accumulate during crash, like what we witnessed last year when the price hits bottom at $15k.",

However, this race to acquire Bitcoin might also introduce higher levels of volatility. On the other hand, the involvement of institutional players could contribute to stability, but it's important to consider market conditions, regulations, and broader economic factors that can impact its price and overall stability.Bitcoin is already volatile though, with or without the renewed interest from institutions. It's just that everyone might have been in the bandwagon, specially hearing BlackRock’s ETF filing, and then pause in rate hike in the U.S and other factors.Of course there could be consequences in the end, specially if we will hear SEC rejecting Blackrock and the price might go down again. Nevertheless, it will be short term though and as we enter the second half of the year, there could be more positive news and then institutions and retail investors preparing themselves for the block halving next year.",

I could be wrong but I don't feel too many barriers from knowledge to practice in order to create a wallet and store my cryptocurrencies including bitcoin safely.People who want to use Bitcoin ETFs and other cryptocurrency ETFs will not actually own any coin or token, and if those companies do shady things, those people will gain nothing in their hands eventually.

Do you think the race to accumulate bitcoin will begin, and what consequences it may have for the price and stability of this cryptocurrency?   This happened a few years back when Bitcoin ETFs were being first talked about and the media was buzzing with this new term. The forum was filled with threads pertaining to ETFs and how we could profit from them and then eventually the buzz died out.At present this has been quoted to be the reason behind the bullish movement. I consider this as an opportunity to sell and cash out for the time being if you have a mid-term selling goal.In the long run, bitcoin is better to buy in whole rather than an ETF. The concept was to bring in no-coiners into the risk field by making them buy ETFs over actual bitcoin. Lets see how this works out this time.",

      "body": "Big difference between applications for BTC ETFs and actually getting them approved. There have been applications for years, and given the current head of the SEC, who is in office until 2026 (and possibly until 2027 if his term gets extended), we won't be seeing an ETF anytime in the next few years.But when ETFs finally do start getting approved, probably in 4-5 years, yes it will certainly drive accumulation of Bitcoin. It does nothing to drive the adoption of Bitcoin for what it is - a currency, but it will bring in more investors and therefore lead to price increase. Given that it unthinkable that an ETF gets approved under Gensler's reign at the SEC, ETFs should be a driving force of bitcoin price appreciation next market cycle, not the current 4-year market cycle.But yeah, lots of people who invest don't know a thing about Bitcoin and don't know its relevance as a currency and just view it as an investment so there are a lot of folks out there in America who will pick up some Bitcoin in an ETF to get the price gains, but otherwise wouldn't bother trying to figure out how to get actual bitcoin through a crypto exchange because that is too new and 'scary' for them.What will drive bitcoin accumulation even more though is sensible regulations in the US. Once rules are put in place for exchanges and the average person feels like it is safer to buy bitcoin thanks to govt regulations, there will likely be a flood of new people and companies buying Bitcoin. If by next market cycle we get US regulations and ETFs, there will be a huge flood of new money coming in from people and large corporations. So if all this happens next market cycle (as opposed to this cycle in which a very antagonistic SEC should at least slightly dampen the bull market these next two years, that cycle could very well be larger percentage-wise than whatever the current market cycle ends up being (for example, if Bitcoin 2x's this market cycle to ~$140k, maybe it 2.5x's next market cycle to ~$350k or higher).",

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency give us control on our coins and tokens with private keysI can (obviously) keep my own private keys, but that doesn't get me the tax benefits. Short version: where I live, if you jump through the right hoops to save for your retirement, it's tax deductable. That means you get up to ~50% back from taxes. By the time you retire, your pension income is taxed, but the assumption is you'll pay a lower percentage by then.The big savings are in the reduced wealth tax: we pay ~2% each year on investments. If you still have a few decades to go before you retire, you lose about half your money to taxes.

Of course everyone wanted to accumuate as much as possible since the price could gone up to 100k and more. Is this possible? Answer is big yes.

I am not an expert in accounting and did not read all the application, but looks like the tax has a chance to be 21%, lower than 30%.
