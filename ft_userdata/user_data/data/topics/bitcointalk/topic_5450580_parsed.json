I'd like to move over to a bitcoin only wallet. I'd add a passphrase to the new wallet for an additional layer of protection. Nothing would happen to the old wallet since you would be using the same private key, but you shouldn't do that. Instead, sweep the private keys instead of importing them. You wouldn't want to risk importing a private key/seed that might have been compromised to a cold wallet. Which cold wallet are you going to use?",

Nothing since it'll be a different wallet since adding a \"BIP39 passphrase\" would change the entire hierarchy of keys.It wont derive the correct private keys from your old Bitcoin wallet.That's assuming that you meant \"BIP39 Passphrase\" and not just the \"Passphrase\" for wallet encryption.",

      "body": "I guess LoyceV is correct. BIP38 too is called passphrase. While OP is only referring to private key. Which likely means this is about a private key wallet, like paper wallets. If that is it, adding passphrase encrypts the wallet. If the old wallet is an online, what if the private key has been exposed before you encrypted it? It only means that the encryption is useless. Also useless if you do not delete the old wallet if it is an online wallet.But if it is HD wallet and adding BIP39 passphrase, nc50lc is right. But because it is another keys and addresses entirely if you add BIP39 passphrase. But why not generate new seed phrase instead and add passphrase.",

Write it down on paper and keep it somewhere safe.You are right, because writing the seed phrase down and document them as many they are will give a lesser problem for knowing or memorizing them, and if you think that you can memorised them you may skip some of the arrangement, I think it's quite understanding Â that writing your seed phrase on a paper should be the safest way of memorizing them because of long stays before making use of that particular wallet because you can't remember all.",
