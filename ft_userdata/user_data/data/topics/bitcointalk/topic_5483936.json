I think you need to draw the distinction between forks, hard forks, and soft forks.Forking creates an altcoin. That's when you just take the bitcoin code and change it how you want to create an altcoin. Lots of older altcoins were created this way, well before the BCH fork that started the trend of trying to pass off altcoins as Bitcoin and using the Bitcoin name to try to trick people.And then upgrading the actual Bitcoin network would be either hard forks or soft forks. And these get voted on to pass them so they can be implemented.A hard fork would not be backwards compatible, so basically it would be a clean break saying we don't care about the network not working for certain people or whatever anymore we just want to update the network without worrying about those sorts of consequences. This would create two separate blockchains, two separate protocols. Anyone still operating on the old bitcoin protocol after the hard fork would be completely separated from the updated protocol. Basically this could lead to a split in bitcoin itself.A soft fork is a backwards compatible way to update the network protocol. And this is what has essentially been decided is the best way to upgrade Bitcoin so everything stays consistent, bitcoin stays immutable, everything keeps working, and network participants can upgrade at their leisure because everything still works no matter which version of the protocol you use. People running the old version just can't do whatever the new updated version does.",

But, if they did, that is something unethical. That would be preposterous to expect criminal exchanges to keep forked coins of users. I witnessed both forks for BCH and BSV, though with the eyes of a novice then. The noise preceding those events was as if Bitcoin was going to die off once the hard forks happened. It was crazy and those who had their Bitcoin in selected private wallets (and exchanges, I can't be sure anymore) got airdropped the forked coins. It was free money for so many people. Many exchanges profited from that by withholding those forked coins of customers that couldn't withdraw on time to private wallets to enable them claim. That event was an eye opener for so may people. It's the same thing with those who send exchange addresses for staking certain tokens to claim airdrops. That's not a good idea. Use private wallets.",

There is nothing wrong with this subject or with bringing it up. You just have to learn to use more accurate terminology.To answer your question, there is nothing stopping anybody from creating a copy of Bitcoin protocol or Bitcoin blockchain and creating a new altcoin like BCH, BCH-SV, BSV, BTCX, BTD,.... like 2017. The only thing stopping them is the fact that creating such useless copies can only work for a little while at the beginning (ie. 2017) but people slowly learn about their uselessness and most importantly learn how to dump their \"airdropped coins\" which means the price of these shitcoins drops a lot quicker now compared to the beginning where majority of users were confused about how they should sell them.",
