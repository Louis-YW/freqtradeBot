  "content": "Hello forum,When I import private keys into my core wallet I get three receiving addresses for each private key.  I only want the one receiving address that I used from my old hierarchical wallets.  Is there a way to import only the segwit or only the legacy or only the p2sh-p2wpkh without the other two?",
