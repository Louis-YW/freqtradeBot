Police dey do road safety work and road safety no come even know their works again. Dem dey confused so dem just dey stand on the road to stop vehicles, bikes, Keke any how. But won thing I know be sae, di Senate I know in Nigeria politics can't stop Nigeria politics for their bad habit. Because di whole problem is coming from the Senate House. Make we see weti go happen for the two parties.",

      "body": "Omo the matter don dey possibly get head because from wetin I dey see ehn Nigeria Police don begin sit up. Why I say so because  e get the video wey dey circulate for social media for long wey one police inspector slap one paddy man wey wear white for road  based on say the guy dey try to talk to am but him no gree. After that, police  high command conduct  necessary investigation, and the disciplinary commission recommend say make dem demote the officer found guilty of the offence and them do am on air for Nigerians to see. The other officer wey dey there wey the matter happen wey for call him colleague to order was reprimanded while their driver wey supposed dey duty post but no where to find am face dismissal.So I no doubt if police don sit up as senate don begin shook eye for their matter.  If Dem dey behave like this, I believe say Nigerians no go dey complain too much of police and their  brutality. I dey even hear say Rivers State government don even call the commissioner of police to earn him bois to not harass Rivers youth and citizens for the state.",

I no think say this one go fit work because both the senate and the police na them dey work hand in hand. You go see say oga senator get police men as him security and them dey follow am up and down. You won tell me say that senator no go fit use these him police security oppress people. He plenty well well wet I don see. Infact na the senators dey even give police back bone to full themselves for the country because na only talk senators dey talk but no action to stop the police people. Na police dey spoil this country because nothing government fit do them since the government need this policemen to carry out their dirties.",

And we saw how the elections went were the police were employed as thugs to disrupt the elections.",

I for like the sector for a change but like my friend Bit-Bender don talk, it’s a Charade designed to divert focus. So many designs for our nation exist for this sole purpose, to make you get the impression say, them Dey up to something or something better go come out and bring about an end to some of the happenings way no sweet for belle within we nation but, na just to pour water on top steam make we for calm down small. Sadly, e dey work and we continue to dey go through things.E hard to expect them not to be about the money or take matters serious with the plenty inflation way Dey happen and hardship for we nation. It’s all a design by the government.",

How una reason this mata?  The police have a very big problem especially when it comes to brutality against its citizens,  not only Nigeria has this problem, but it has been a global concern aside from brutality and talk of extortion, so many things I think for the past few weeks now I see that they have started making a scapegoat out of them, once you can provide a piece of evidence than the matter is going to be taking seriously they were videos of how the police were beating their own citizen, the normal way if the person is charged guilty of any crime why not detain him and if it is serious then charge him to the court that's what they call process not beating anyone up. since the senate has ordered the IG of police then we should expect improvement.",

No be today dey don dey talk all those one jare, all na just story Nigeria police don too spoil and nothing wey any government go do now wey go change them, make we talk true if police wan do work, dem sabi work ooo but na just dis corruption dey kill dem, Wetin dey always dey their head no pass how dem go take collect money from citizens illegally na Wetin dey their head be that.

Police get low mindset towards success, misinterpreting the meaning of hardwork.

Sometimes I wonder if police even really understand this language.... \"The police is ur frnd\". This na thought to bring the paramilitaries and the civilians together in unity as security na collective measure and being the other's keeper that na why Police get the guts to fit dey live in the midst of civilians but this people take chances on is just for the authority power invested in them come dey whine us, dey gamble with our lives, extorting us which r no suppose be so.As for our lawmakers, this people dey always put laws still forget say dem put such laws as dem no dey penalize who go against those laws while dem dey see some dignitaries like dem dey higher above the laws of the people, by the people and for the people.However, anywhere belle face na front. Even this law markers and the security agencies don dey see as as minorities tay tay no be today e start. Just imagine where the president elect Bola Ahmed Tinubu say \"Let the poor breath'.
