Real Madrid is still very consistent, but I do not think we should underate Manchester United too. In just this their first season with a new coach, they were able to win one competition and came second in another. Manchester United will get players were they need to and next season with this their present coach, they can win the champions league and even the premier league. They are not new to winning the competition as a club, so they are also one of the competitions title contenders next season.",

We always talk about more or less the same clubs, Manchester City, Real, Barcelona, PSG and Bayern, and this season we will probably be able to add Arsenal, Napoli and Inter to the list.The first league of champions is always the most difficult to win and that's why it will be much easier for Manchester City players now and they will play with much less pressure and that's why I consider them the main favorites for the new title.",

They are already focusing on some good signing in the next transfer market. They are choosing some great players for their number 9. They are focusing on Harry Cane, If they complete the deal that will be most highlighted and effective transfer. Also there will be some more effective transfers and that will make Real Madrid a Promising team for the next season.",

Currently, all the teams seem to be trying to build up their team's strength by bringing in several new players and selling some of the old ones.Manchester City is my favorite next season for the Champions League, if OP makes the pool then I will choose Manchester City again.",

Manchester City is a team with an amazing squad. Moreover, they have a technical genius who makes great contributions to this team. Under the technical leadership of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City can already be seen as one of the favorite teams for the cup for next year.",

They can actually make some adjustments in the defense line as well. Because I found the defenders quite desperate against Manchester City attackers.Real Madrid was outplayed and paid for their lack of pressure on the Manchester City team. The only way to deal with City is to constantly attack and be defensively alert at all times. Madrid needs to bring in more players to replace some players, especially in the attack and defense. Benzema needs a worthy replacement so as do some aging players. Most teams have started preparing for next season, so Madrid should take advantage of the transfer market now if they want to get the best players.Quote from: JooBra on June 12, 2023, 07:41:16 PMWe can't say much at this point but I'm pretty sure that City won't win it again.

Going 2years without bad game it's really hard and City does not have legacy of Real M to do that.It's too early to start predicting next season's winner but I also agree that City will not win it next season except the team is rejigged. Their performance in the finals proved that they need to do more if they want to retain the cup. There are so many teams in Europe that would have won the finals if they had the opportunities that Inter Milan had. I am sure that Napoli's Victor Osimhen and his teammates will not waste the chances that Martinez and Lukaku lost.",

For now their is every possibility for them retaining that trophy as their squad is currently the best so far and most big team are currently facing a lot of challenge so this is actually their best time to become champion of Europe twice but like you said it all depends on the squad performance in this new season campaign because a lot of changes I guess would come and most teams would have been familiar with their game style now so they would have deviced a way to stop their deadly counter.",

They can actually make some adjustments in the defense line as well. Because I found the defenders quite desperate against Manchester City attackers.Indeed. After Man City eliminated them in the semi-final round, Real Madrid already evaluated their squad. We can see that Real Madrid has started to rebuild again their squad, especially on the attacking line. There are only 2 attackers on Real Madrid squad (Vinicius and Rodrygo), Real Madrid needs some attackers to replace those players who left the club. The main target should be a new center forward (CF), a new striker who can replace Benzema's position. There is a rumor that Real Madrid is trying to sign Harry Kane, but it looks like not easy for Real Madrid to negotiate with Tottenham.Well, Real Madrid defense line is also not strong enough. They need some new defenders, especially for left and right backs. They also need 1 strong center back at least. I hope Real Madrid will consider putting Nacho Fernández and Jesús Vallejo on the transfer list.",
