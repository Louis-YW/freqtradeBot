Despite making several appeals, my account has remained banned for over 4 years.I feel ashamed for my previous actions and have learned a valuable lesson. I assure you that I will not repeat the same mistake again. I sincerely hope that I will be granted the opportunity to demonstrate my contributions to the forum.I understand that my actions violated the forum's guidelines, and I take full responsibility for my behavior. But I believe that people can learn from their mistakes and grow as individuals.I have also reached out to some of the forum members and moderators, and I appreciate the feedback they have given me. I understand that regaining their trust will take time, and I am willing to take the necessary steps towards that goal.I believe that the forum would benefit from diverse perspectives and ideas, and I am confident that I can contribute positively to its community. I am passionate about the forum's mission and would like to continue being a part of it.I would like to emphasize that I am not asking for special treatment or privileges. I am simply asking for a fair chance to prove myself and to make a positive impact on the forum. I hope that the moderators will consider my request and grant me the opportunity to do so.Four years is an extensive period, and I request the moderators to consider my situation with empathy.My forum profile url : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=364362",

      "body": "I don't actually know the whole story. I haven't been in this forum long enough, but judging from the few lines and pages I have read on your above link, I can see that your case is really huge. The issue of having about 4 alt accounts, which is really not a big problem to some, but to some it's a major problem, and to all, having all those accounts join one campaign is a huge offense, which you have been part of, plagiarism, and many others, which were all detected on your old thread. I'm not discouraging you from appealing, but I really think you have a very small chance of getting your account unbanned. I also think creating a second thread is not a good idea either; you could have just continued your appeal there; just one comment will bump up the thread.",

Some prefers to publicly admit it and some do not. Both have their own reasons.Having an alt account is fine, but ban evading is not. He is appealing for this account, but his alt accounts are also banned, so there's no point.It seems that his chances of survival are not much in the other thread,  so he decided to create a new thread so that the former things will pass away Nonetheless, 4 years is a good number of years to have served the punishment.

It's a statement of fact Redemption is another word used by priests: \"The action of saving or being saved from sin, error, or evil\".I'm not sure whether he is allowed to create a new account since I think I remember that a rule in the forum states that a ban for an account applies to all accounts of the same person. Although I may be wrong, because he has created a new alt and he is still writing from it.But, continuing with the beginning of my post, in the case he was allowed, walking the road of ranking up a brand new account from zero could be interpreted by me as an effort worthy of redemption. It is just that, as you said, he hasn't even tried it: it takes way less work.Anyway, good luck GreatOrchid, I think you've learned your lesson and I don't wish ill on anyone. Maybe I would have been a good priest, had it not been for the chastity thing.",

I don't also believe that the reason why members with high rank want thier accounts back after a ban is usually because they can't get merit. Yes, the main purpose of the forum is to learn about Bitcoin and contribute to the forum but it will be difficult to start as a beginner after enjoying the privileges enjoyed from a high-rank account. It will take an act of extraordinary courage to start as a newbie after being a Senior+ member. @OP ensure you follow the rules of the forum as you appeal for the unbanning of your main account because committing more blunders might complicate your canvas of getting your desire.",

I suspect he's still active on the forum with another account and a VPN and it's simply worth it to ask for that legendary account. After all, it doesn't hurt, nor cost anything. If pleading works, there will be another account to enter a campaign with, or sell to someone unaware of the account's history.",
