Even if you change the address now, it does not matter at all. But I think if you do not use your address to receive funds from the blacklisted address directly, you have no problem. But if you are not having fund on Binance, I will advise you not to use the exchange for now.",

You could use whirlpool for example. To be honest, personally I would:1. create a wallet specifically for this mixing service's payments.2. start doing whirlpool coinjoins and let them go to the wallet created on step (1).3. avoid sending any other transactions to this wallet (any of the addresses of this wallet).4. if you need to send out of this wallet, just do it from the fresh coinjoined UTXOs.In my opinion, you will be able to use the UTXOs anyway in the future. However, if everything has gone wrong and all the miners decide to reject these inputs, you want to have them as separate UTXOs. Don't mix them with other ones you may have.",

I think it's better for you to coinjoin (not via Wasabi) or mix your coins to get new coins without Sinbad traces. Then deposit them on decentralized exchanger and exchange them for altcoins like LTC and then deposit LTC to Binance.For new transactions, use a brand new address that won't be linked to your Sinbad wallet.",

I would not take much to create a new wallet and asking your campaign manager to change you receiving payment address. Keep the old fund the same wallet and not mix them with your new wallet (by transferring them). Rather try to exchange them via direct exchangers or coinjoin (as many others recommend this too).",

There is possibility that the exchange may still also seize coinjoin coins. Yes, I am in favour of this method. I use it a lot in general. In fact, there is nothing wrong with also keeping these funds in XMR and use XMR, because I don't consider XMR a s**coin but a proper altcoin, but this is on OP to decide. Then OP could have a clear distinction in his head that any new Bitcoin UTXO isn't linked with the previous UTXOs that come from the mixing service.The only catch is that should OP wish to get back to Bitcoin using a reverse swap from XMR, there is no way to know where the new BTC utxos come from. So, in case those utxos come from the same mixing service, he will not have gained anything. However, there is no way to know if any UTXO you receive, from now on, is linked to the mixing service we talk about. This is why I suggested coinjoins. I support coinjoins is general, no matter where the inputs come from. Bitcoin is money and as long as it is used widely, you will eventually receive money coming from illicit activities, just like the FIAT money you receive every day. We should learn to use coinjoins as a habit. It is not mandatory, but it is clearly a good option!",

So all those wallets become suspected   It doesn't cost you any money to generate a fresh address every time you need to receive Bitcoin, nor will you be saving on transaction fees by using the same one over and over again. Start doing that so it becomes a habit and also divide your activities in different wallets. Then, things like what you just explained won't happen. You said that you used that same address several years. Have you received any coins to it from a service that has your KYC details? For example, an exchange, a casino, etc.? If you have, it would be very easy for blockchain analysis or any interested 3rd-party to figure out who you are based on what that centralized service tells them. You moving the older coins before you started receiving Sinbad payments doesn't matter. Bitcoin's blockchain is public. The same person that owns coins from a CEX also received BTC from Sinbad. That's what the blockchain will show.",

We should learn to use coinjoins as a habit. It is not mandatory, but it is clearly a good option!Whilst CoinJoins are a good and easy way of obfuscating the origin of your funds, by the means of mixing them with other UTXOs, it is still frowned upon by many exchange. They seem to associate CoinJoin with criminal activities, and hence it's likely that it becomes an issue regardless. Privacy coins negates this issue because they are designed what that in mind, and in comparison would be much more fungible.I think the best method would be to have a form of plausible deniability. You have to convince the exchange that you're likely not the owner of the address that received the Sinbad tainted coins, and thus you should do multiple hops, like what hugeblack has said. The number of hops that is done matters less, but your spending pattern (ie. how it gets sent to the final address) would matter a lot more. For example, if you simply send the coins from one address into another, in a single transaction, it would be worse than splitting them and sending them to different addresses.",
