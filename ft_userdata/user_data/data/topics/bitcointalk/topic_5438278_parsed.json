And before you make any accusation you have to provide evidences and proofs to show that the casino really did what accused it for if not you will bear the consequences. So I will want you to go back prepare you evidences and create a thread in the accusation board. Befy then do what I said.",

Please reset your password via email.If the error you get while trying to login says your account is at risk, and that you should reset your password, it simply means that someone that is unauthorized have tried to access your account and BC.games blocked your account to protect you as well as stop the hacker from getting into your account.Now, the above is just my assumptions based on how you phrase your topic, I could be wrong, but a way to confirm if what i said above is right is  to try to change your password, if you are unable to, contact support and give them time to respond, and when I say give them time, I mean give them like two weeks to respond, if by two weeks , they don't respond, then I believe you are then free to become suspicious and also create a scam accusation and remember to include the evidences.",

      "body": "Two ideas I've got for this case.1. Before you reset the password through email, wait for someone to verify that through their official support. Is the email domain that sent you that notice official from bc.game? Did you reach out first through their official link to verify if it's actually them?2. If yes, why you haven't tried following the instruction first before the conclusion that they've closed your account? There's a reason why they've made your account have a reset and if that's the process then obey. But if not, then just ignore it because it could be a phishing link/email.",

So sorry about that but if I may ask you this question was there anything you did while trying to play on their platform? because as I see, you already have a negative trust attached to your account here which means otherwise because one would think you have default the casino policy and hence they might likely carryout such act  on your account, another is this, you have no evidence backing your claims as this is an accusations against the casino. It would be nice you make available evidence for site seeing so that we could verify and know what to do and how to go about it with follow up and also comments and contributions from members of this platform. If their presence is registered here on this platform, their representative would need avail themselves here for clarity as to why your account was banned. In your own best interest, go get evidence as it is pictorial excerpts for sight seeing.",

And have you tried resetting your password just as suggested via Gmail and you still weren't granted access? Because I'm sure that for such message to have pop-up is a sign maybe someone tried to accessing your account from a different device and got blocked by its robot due to protection against scams, and I think the only solution now is to contact customer care or its forum representatives just as suggested by other users, while also providing the necessary screenshot for further investigation",

Just first check with BC.GAME support page or try to log in to your account directly from your webpage before you act. I would have provided you with more details if you provided more information. Be it as it may, it's good that you are careful of antics on the internet, if it's just a direct email, it might not be from the company. I'd received lots of it, particularly the ones pretending to be from Coinbase, I always ignore them as the sender's email is not always that of Coinbase itself.Just try to know the truth, and if they block the account truly, you can report it here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0You might also want to read: https://www.wikihow.com/Report-Illegal-Gambling",
