And there are several ways a public awareness can be made, as you can either create a blog dedicated to posting educative piece about Bitcoin/Crypto or create a YouTube channel where you teach people how to use Bitcoin related tools (e.g Wallets, exchange or projects).However, What I am doing myself to help bitcoin grow is by assisting and educating people who don't know about Bitcoin but wishes to invest in it to achieve their dreams. I also help people convert their Bitcoin into fiat currency (p2p).",

It is a greater contribution to solve such things than. I would say that the number of nodes is not the weakest point of the Bitcoin ecosystem.I totally agree with you. I was thinking to help small shops in my town to accept bitcoin and help them install a solution but I found that they were not interested sadly (I asked like 20 or 30 people in the center of my town but they took me for an alien or something ^^)So yeah I know I want to do things with Bitcoin because I am hooked but I don't really know what to do. Running a node was easy and I love working with hardware so that was my first choice while thinking I was usefull for the network.",

Contribute to Bitcoin adoption does not mean you need to take risk with your bitcoin and can lose it by taking risk.Running a Bitcoin full node, Lightning Network node, pay your purchases with bitcoins, donations in bitcoins, and more things, but I am more favorite with things I am ready to pay my bitcoin, not with taking risk and knowing that I can lose it to scammers.",
