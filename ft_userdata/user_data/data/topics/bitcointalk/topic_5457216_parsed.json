It may sound harsh or too cruel, but we should not deny that this is a market with winners and losers. And if we want to win, we need to let others lose. Regarding the price prediction for this year, I still believe that history will repeat itself, there will be a serious dumping before the halving takes place.",

They have already accumulated so much BTC and still i think they will fill there bags. BTC might touch $40k too, and will provide many crypto newbies a chance to book some profit and believe me this is a trap, when newbies have long term planes but after watching big profits in there portfolio they felt greedy and sell of there assets from there big institute will accumulate more.",

For me, even if bitcoin hits $40k, I wouldn't expect too much for the rest of the year when we look at the state of the world economy and what history has shown us. I don't put too much faith and hope in something breakthrough this year. I am still aiming for the halving and will only believe that the bulls will come just 1 year after the halving.",

I used to see Bitcoin as though it could reach $40k or $50k before the end of 2023, but I think it should save all the bullish movement for the next halving season. Even if Bitcoin does reach $50k this year, I think I would not really take advantage of it because my sell target is not $50k; rather, I still want to buy more. If the price goes so high, then I would be buying just a few little fractions, compared to if I had bought at $25k.",

The first one was in January, with a rise from 16.5k to 23k, and the second took place in March, with an increase from 20k to 28k. Given these trends, I believe there is a good chance that we will hold the 30k level this time, and the next rally might even push us closer to 40k before the year ends. Who knows, maybe even more!",

A lot of good news lately with Bitcoin up 24% in a week but will it last?How high can we go before 2024? $40k? $50k? None TBH because I don't know what to expect.Does anybody expected that Bitcoin's price will go up that high this week? None I guess. Does anybody expect that Bitcoin will surpass the $30,000 price for quite some time? None I guess. Well, it's a good news for us short term Bitcoin holders that it went up significantly this week because we manage to sold some of our Bitcoins, but after this small rally I expect a bit of a correction. The good thing though is that it's pretty obvious that the bulls are currently having the momentum, and we might see more upwards movement in the weeks to come.How high can Bitcoin go next year? This is a bold prediction, but we might see Bitcoin reaching the past ATH at that year. Well, it's a prediction and it always has a 50% chance that it might go wrong, but I just want to be optimistic, and after all we don't know what price it will reach at that time. Let's just watch the show, and wait for Bitcoin to reach 6 digits again.",

This is something a question which no one could answer and this is why whenever you do see that there's some price drop then it would be wise that we do better to make out some opportunity on accumulating more.Yes, this current year 2023 does have lots of events which it do pertaining or connects about economical matters which is mostly get involving those main huge countries like US and China and other which are really thattending to dive once again on this market. We've seen banning and SEC issues but still in the end they do end up on launching their own crypto exchange which is utter shit kind of u-turn of events.Expecting something? Yes, they would later on making some announcement about crackdowns and ban and on the time these fellas had placed themselves on the bottom then this is where they do announce some bullish news.

Admit it or not, definitely everyone is looking for bitcoin to continue it's bullish sentiments, although we are not yet in the bull run.So maybe around $50k at the end of the year is not that bad. Currently there is a renewed positive sentiments as we reach $30k in just 2 days from $26k. So if this pattern continues then there is a big possibility that we might see a good end price.Nevertheless, we need to be cautious as well, we don't know what the future holds. So just better be prepared if $50k is a hit or miss this December.",

Because this year, there are two camps that will have different desires. The first camp definitely wants the price of bitcoin to rise, because maybe the investor is a short-term bitcoin investor, and maybe that person has no intention of adding bitcoin assets, so their main goal is to sell their assets. While the second camp, definitely wants the price of bitcoin to fall this year, because so they can buy bitcoin, to add assets and prepare for the upcoming bitcoin halving. I think that's what this year is going to be like with bitcoin investors.QuoteA lot of good news lately with Bitcoin up 24% in a week but will it last?How high can we go before 2024? $40k? $50k? Maybe in the next few weeks the increase in bitcoin prices will continue, because if you look at the state of the bitcoin market, it looks very likely that it will continue to rise, for the next few weeks. but for this year I think the price of bitcoin will decrease first. And the bitcoin price for this year according to my analysis will not pass the price of $ 40k.",

Those numbers are possible, we are around in the $30k'ish range or even surpassed it already. Long term, I'm expecting that at least the rest of 2023 will be crazy price run to $50k. Remember that next year, the block halving will commence, so by this time, everyone should be in the accumulation phase. So wise investors might continue to stack sats, regardless of the price and so with that, price could be around $40k-$50k. So take this opportunity, we just have to DCA and have the mental toughness to buy and look for the long run.",

I don't know what other people's expectations will be for the rest of the year for Bitcoin, but I just wish Bitcoin the best it can continue to exist. Especially in terms of price improvement which could continue to occur slowly over the rest of the year, in which case I would generally still expect a bigger price increase than the current price for the remainder of the next six months.QuoteA lot of good news lately with Bitcoin up 24% in a week but will it last?How high can we go before 2024? $40k? $50k? It will probably last a long time, although it's likely not to last too long. But as for speculating a price increase for the rest of the year, I'd just be more confident to say $40K because a price increase always takes more time than a decrease which only takes a moment. Nonetheless, the possibility for over $40K is also possible for Bitcoin in the next six months of the year.",
