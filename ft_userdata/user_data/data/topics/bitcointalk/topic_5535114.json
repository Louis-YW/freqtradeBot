  "content": "I never thought I would witness something like this unfold in real life, especially close to home.I have an uncle who has always loved technology. That's all I really knew about him when I was younger. He was a government worker at the time, and everything seemed fine. He was married with two kids, and life was going well until he had an accident.The accident cost him both of his legs. Since then, his wife took over everything, and they moved far away from us, which caused our relationship to fade. Now, all we do is talk on the phone.The last time I heard anything about him was when my mom told me that his wife had divorced him. He had no money or means to take care of his family which lead to the divorce but he did do something right.In those days when we used to discuss technology, he mined Bitcoin (BTC) in an old pool. He referred to his mining rig as the \"7970.\" However, since the value of Bitcoin wasn't very high at the time, he just left it in an old wallet.A few days ago, he called my mom, saying he needed to speak to me. I later got in touch with him, and he asked me how to import his BTC private key. He said, \"Do you remember that I mined Bitcoin with the 7970?\" I replied yes, and he mentioned he didn't know how to import the key.He was quite sure that he had something left in the wallet. After helping him out, I discovered he had 0.48 BTC in there. This has saved him, I believe. He wanted to send me something as a thank-you, but I refused because he needed the money more than I did.His son doesn't look back, the daughter married to another man and they are out of the country. I hope we don’t end up having children who will never look back and take care of us in the future.Please understand that I don’t like discussing my family online, but this experience has been surprising and provided a valuable lesson. It's a reminder for those who are taking care of their families without planning for their own futures. Your partner can leave you, your child can become indifferent, so always have something set aside just in case.",

Don't let taking care of your family's needs and wants make you not think of your own self in the future. What will you hold onto for financial support when you're old. Those you labor for won't be there for you as always; they have their own life to live, as you have yours. It is better to begin on time to have that thought in mind so that you won't be caught off-guard when unknown circumstances happen before or during old age. Because the investment you made for yourself is totally yours unless you choose to give away the ownership to someone else. Apart from that you are the sole owner of it. That will be what will save you when everyone leaves or you are no longer strong enough to provide for yourself",

Parents have needs to also plan for their own future after retirement or in case of any bad situation, so that they will still have something to fall back at. If you think that only when you are financially stable or rich, you will think about repaying your parents. I bet you will never repay your parents because you can't be sure when you will be rich and whether your parents will wait for you until then. To me, personal finances are not a reason or barrier that prevents us from showing filial piety to our parents. Because parents don't need you to give them a lot of money, what they need is for you to be there for them no matter what happens. Through this story, we are reminded that we should always have a backup plan for ourselves instead of thinking that we can rely on our loved ones. But I will not lose faith or doubt my loved ones because of this story. The world will have this person and that person and the man in this story is just the unlucky one. In my village and those 3 people are my close friends. Their father is sick and bedridden but his wife and 3 children have taken care of him for more than 15 years without a single complaint. They were willing to sacrifice their youth to take care of their sick father, which shows that not everyone is as cruel and heartless as the wife and children in OP's story.",

You can never predict what the end will be. Men are facing a lot in this world, and it would be wise for them to look deep before making decisions. I believe my uncle must have seen some warning signs but chose to ignore them.This is why my father used to say it's sometimes better to act as if you're really down for your family—so you can see who truly cares. Most people don't genuinely care; they only pretend to because of what they can still gain from you.Men are often valued based on what they provide, and I’m tired of this mentality. This is why I’ve chosen to help men; they need support more than women do. Society often shows pity for women while telling men to \"man up,\" as if they don't realize that men face many challenges too.What happened to my uncle opened my eyes. Some family members revealed their true colors after the incident too, he is just lucky that he mined the BTC and still have his key, many lost theirs as years go by.",

I hear stuffs like this happening everyday, this is one of the reasons I’m always of the opinion that, if not for unforeseen circumstances and the fact that no one knows what tomorrow holds, that’s it’s best to have an emergency fund somewhere that only you know, even if you’ll have other investments that your wife or family will be aware, one should still have a locked up savings or investment somewhere only he knows. Things happen everyday, and sometimes we don’t even know who to trust, even with our finances. So the best thing I believe is to prepare for the best as well as the worst possible scenarios.

For me he got redemption through bitcoin but was never planned. It was mercy that made him forgot this wallet if not he might h have withdraw those bitcoin long term ago. Personally the lessons I learn from this story is do what others are doing in terms of new technology even if you don’t see the need to do it and always keep valuable things save, Another big lesson is know who has access to your bitcoin back ups because imagine a scenario here where the man in question had actually giving the back up to his wife, in real scenario it would have been sensible but stories like this actually gives one reasons to doubt who you trust most of the times. I have seen people leaning towards not making their wives the access to their inheritance in case of divorce and stories like this.
