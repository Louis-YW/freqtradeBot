Not only have shops started accepting bitcoin, but some countries have also made it a legal tender. Some companies too also consider it a method of payment for large purchases, and they also use bitcoin as part of their reserve funds. Bitcoin adoption is rapidly increasing, and it's not just in shops accepting it this time.",

I remember my early days in the forum where we used to discourse on bitcoin's adoption and even speculate when bitcoin will get integrated as a payment method by merchants. It's really nice to see that in recent years, it's coming together but we're still not there (yet). There's plenty of work still to be done so that the average Joe can use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services at tx cost lower than the fees offered by commercial banks and card firms like mastercard, visa, etc.",

In some countries, even expressing their attitude to accepting bitcoin's extensive journey still has many challenges, but indeed for those who accompany its development to witness what they believe in, the feeling is wonderful.",

For every new ATH achieved, the world goes wild and talks about the potential of bitcoin and what its performance implies for the future. In my country right now there is not much stores that accept bitcoin in fact I have not seen one at all. I am waiting for bitcoin to spread all around the world, hopefully. It might be a long process but we are heading there",

For many of us on the other side of the world, this is not new.Some of the shops accepting BTC in some countries do it just for clout-chasing, just to attract young customers like you to their shop.",

In countries like El Salvador where bitcoin is accepted shops that accept Bitcoin as payment options will see greater sales, new customers, increased profit etc.If the use of bitcoin for transaction will make you face punishment or sanctions, I don't think that it would be logical for merchants to be accepting that as a form of payment for their product and/or services. Regarding the El Salvador situation, there's never been an article that reports that there were increase in sales or anything like that but there was a report that said that after some months, the use of it lowered and most people still preferred to use fiat over bitcoin and despite the $30 bitcoin subsidy of the government, there are still untouched bitcoin subsidy despite the massive amounts of download of the Chivo wallet.",

Bitcoin has gone beyond the way you have had it and you can unveil more things if you stick around here.There's not a lot of them unfortunately, maybe in my country it would still be the same as any other, they like to use fiat much more than bitcoin because they're either ignorant, they're not aware that bitcoin exist, or that bitcoin isn't a thing and most of them probably don't want the added hassle of having to convert bitcoin to fiat so they can cycle it back to their business to buy back their stocks and pay their workers. In a small business, it might work but the problem is that the tax season will be a hell of a lot more difficult to do because there's some issues they need to deal with involving doing transactions using bitcoin. Also, the word is patronage not patronizing because that would mean that the bitcoin users that are paying their gas on that gas station is condescending or demeaning them in some way.",

I think if a shop decided to put bitcoin as one of their accepted payment methods they genuinely believe in btc and would want to be part of it.For a country like Lugano, El Salvador, Brazil, England that have accepted to regulate the activity of cryptocurrency users in their countries respectively, I don't think shops or businesses there would find it hard to accept BTC or even any altcoins for their transactions, because it is a currency for exchange and payments that may include purchase or taxes. Where I think accepting BTC or cryptocurrency in shops or businesses isn't viable, is when such businesses exit in a region where crypto currency is banned or not accepted and regulated by the government. Unless it is from well known customers and trusted P2P traders or investors, shopping with BTC or cryptocurrency is a kind of option that is specifically requested or available to real crypto currency believers.",

I haven't looked into this, if this is true there are many things I have wanted to buy on Newegg, and this could make me go ahead with the purchases instead of using restricted credit cards from my country. It is a different story in my country, there is only 1 out of 1000 that are accepting crypto, and even now that the government isn't very friendly with crypto adopters in the country it will take some balls to display \"crypto is accepted here\" in front of your store, I took down mine months ago and still accept Bitcoin behind closed door.",

I will start with the fact that Lugano is not a country, just a region in Switzerland.Also you've put together regions or countries with big support (or legal tender) for Bitcoin with regions/countries with not that special status of Bitcoin. Not mentioning the Bitcoin is actually regulated in many (maybe even most) countries of the world.",

Bitcoin has generally gained a lot of influence around the world within a short period of time, although in our country Bitcoin is illegal because it is not officially awarded but we use it secretly. So there are people all over the world who are secretly using Bitcoin, grocery stores, furniture, clothing and food stores also have Bitcoin style bill payment systems in El Salvador. But very soon such modern technology will spread all over the world.",
