Anybody else having this same problem with ViaBTC?If you tried to receive the SMS more than once and still fail, it's likely an issue from your side, i'd check everything Davef mentioned above and contact your telco company, I have two sims from two different companies, and one really struggles to receive international SMSs, it was fine years ago but recently I started to encounter the issue, called them and they pretended that was nothing wrong on their side, which was a lie of course because I was able to receive the SMS on the other sim.I think you can switch to Google authenticator as long as you are still logged in and have access to your email, go to settings > account security > Google authenticator, if you managed to set that up you should be able to withdraw your funds without any issue.",

Just a generic response that’s says switch to authenticator if the sms issue continues Also try setting up auto withdrawls vs manual they work better.The three accounts I use are all auto withdrawl with low settings. It allows me to shut auto with drawl off with out sms it allows me to turn it back on without sms.But if I want to change the autowithrawl address it wants sms. I send all my coins to operate trezors addresses.all on autowithdrawal.I last turned auto withdrawal off JULY 1I will turn it on today on July 6I will turn it off on July 7",

If you don't want to use authenticator because you are boycotting Google products, you can use FreeOTP which is open-source and works fine.This is their website if you want to find more infos about it : https://freeotp.github.io/Otherwise, philip's answer could be a good solution for you. Playing with the autowithdrawal function is a very good way to avoid SMSes, you can turn it on only when you want to withdraw, and without SMS verification.But with this solution you will need to be able to receive their SMS at least one time to activate the service.",

Finally got a response from via but it was a generic response, not helpful and they sent a follow up email closing the ticket. I contacted my service provider (AT&T and they say everything is fine. (No surprises there lol) But they sent the following request for information to continue troubleshooting: “AT&T Free Msg: We will need Provider name or short code number and foreign origin. If you have further concerns call 8003310500  for additional help.” So I guess I’ll file another ticket with ViaBTC and see if they will provide that info for my service provider to continue troubleshooting the issue. If anybody here already has ViaBTC sms code provider name or short code and foreign origin and can post it that might speed up the process.",

That was annoying, worst part…. I dont know for certain which one of them was ultimately the problem or which of them fixed the problem. I kind of think it was AT&T fault but don’t know for certain. Either way it’s all working again now.",
