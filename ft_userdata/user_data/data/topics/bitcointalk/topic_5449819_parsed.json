Just think about the 2017 era of ICOs, where so many projects looked like amazing, prosperous ventures and yet 90%+ of them turned out to be scams, too expensive to build or just technically impossible to build. That's not to say anything about CivKit, it's just to say not to take a whitepaper as an official sign that something is possible.",

A few things about this on the first lecture, the technical data can wait till I had another coffee- not really a new concept, the same things has been already tried once- interesting that they are using naira and BTC in examples, so guess this is already targeted at a specific audience- I was really curious how they will handle escrows and disputes, again, nothing new, rebranded them as oracles (d'oh) that suffer from the same flaw as every previous solution, two or three people colluding will be able to force a decision even it's unfair. Furthermore, positions are either appointed by the team, thus stopping decentralization or voted in, which means they can be a victim of sybil attacks. (acknowledge by the whitepaper)- the interesting part would be the so-called bulletin boards, but I think the design of such boards relying on offers relayed via nostr message would be really unappealing to the masses. - the whole rank proof servers idea, seems neet but wouldn't it be also a simple attack target? I'll read it later on in more detail, although for the average user what's more important is how easy it is to use, not the magic that happens behind the app.Quote from: mendace on April 22, 2023, 09:06:49 PMI like the idea of ​​the marketplace even if I don't fully agree with the use of relays like Nostr as one could easily get to the relay host, instead it would be better if it were implemented directly in the blockchain What do you mean by getting implemented in the blockchain instead of Nostr ?

I am not sure why only a few days later, it turned to be CivKit. What are connections between Noones, CivKit and Ray Youssef?From graphic designs, Noones and CivKit are likely to be from a same team. Noones trading mechanism looks to be a copy cat of Paxful. The slogan of Noones is Global South that is exactly what Ray aims at.I am curious and uncertain with the announcement of Ray to launch CivKit two days ago.",

What do you mean by getting implemented in the blockchain instead of Nostr ? The signals between participants?Absolutely no, no ICO is needed for CivKit because it is a protocol that works on Bitcoin and above all with layer2 or LN.  As far as Nostr is concerned, from what I understand CivKit extrapolates the data present on an LN transaction and enters them in a trivial json to create the announcement on Nostr but therefore uses the same relays of Nostr, do you confirm?",
