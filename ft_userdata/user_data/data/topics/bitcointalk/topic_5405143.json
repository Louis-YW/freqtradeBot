The fact that someone is willing to sell them for something greater than 0 doesn't alter that fact. I'm giving tBTC for free, and I'm sure others do too, therefore the current monetary value is $0. Think of this: If a bitcoin user chooses to sell their BTC with an exchange rate of $1,000,000/BTC, it doesn't mean each BTC is worth $1,000,000, as long as there are other sellers with more reasonable prices.",
