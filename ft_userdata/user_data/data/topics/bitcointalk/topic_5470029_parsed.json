I think what you mean here is a disadvantage. This is my most common means of betting, and I don't even know what's being called until now. I always select multiple games from different sections and different categories when I want to make a bet, which always increases my expected winning amount since I can just select games that are a little odd from different sections. Just one game can ruin the entire slip. But there are times and selections that you can make that allow you to take your winnings minus the games that you lose at the end of the game and cut them down 2 out of the many selections that you have made depending on the option that you choose. This option always reduces the possible winning amount since it increases the chance of winning and not losing everything entirely.",

This option always reduces the possible winning amount since it increases the chance of winning and not losing everything entirely.In my country we call it cut 2 of cut 3 which means that if 1, 2, 3 games lose in your bets you have the opportunity to take the games that already won,  this is a feature that is mostly advertised by some of the casinos in my country,  although I have not tried it before to see and know how it works,  but then since it being advertised it then means those that used the feature will indeed get the benefits of not losing all the bet due to one or two games loses on the ticket. But what I will like to know with such feature os that,  will the winning games rewards be paid in full or the amount will be divided as a condition for using that cut 2?",

This is practically my area of betting as all my bets are currently on parley option because why? it reduces the amount of money one can possibly lose and it's also a huge percentage base on  luck so I don't think there is any secret to playing parley in betting but I wouldn't say the same thing for those that stake on a single game because the probability of researching about correct stats on the single game but the only thing is that the wager amount will be big if the odds is small which for me isn't much of my style.",

I have placed parlay bets in past a few times but all those bets went wrong and instead of winning I lost those bets. I have done those bets on sports and e-sports events I guess and I have only betted on the games where teams had low odds, but still I lost the bets. I know that a few others might with with parlay betting but I wasn't among those winners.",

It is a complicated to even predict the game.  But for comparison, it is better than football prediction because the teams will determine which team will will but Football in most cases are for luck.",

The casino already knows that such an option increases your chances of winning, so if they give you the same winning amount based on the odds, that will appear to be cheating on their side. I have not really checked the mechanism in which the odd reduction is being done, but I have noticed a drop in the odd, almost up to 30–40% of what the winning amount is supposed to be on the on set before one selected the option. That's, for instance, if your potential winning was supposed to be 100 based on the wager amount and you happen to select the cut one or cut two, like you called it, your potential winning amount will be reduced down to 70–60$, some times lower depending on how many games you have in that particular slip and how many games you have selected if they cut that won't affect your game.",

Let say I selected 5 games,  and among those 5 games I won 4 and lost one,  aside from the odds of the one I lost being deducted from my total odds in the cut one feature,  will the remaining 4 winning payments be on percentage deductions due to the feature or I will get my rewards payments in full?",

You will get your reward payment in full; your reward payment will already be known when you select that option.Let's say, for example, that you selected six games and you picked the option that if one of them cut (loose) out of the six, you still win. The moment you select that option, your potential winning amount will be decided. Even if the entire game happens to be played, the amount won't reduce or increase; it's just that amount that you saw before confirming your bet that you will receive. No percentage is being calculated after the end of the game.I hope I explained it well this time 🤔🤔",

Of course there's close to no advantage to parlay bets for players that's why the reward is just too damn big to pass up. Plus, with parlay bets, the casino keeps themselves afloat with all the parlay bets that have failed. Regarding parlay bets, try The International 2023 DOTA2 Esports, haven't checked it yet but a there are in-game parlay although there's no money involved there so I am sure there are betting sites doing parlay bets on the International 2023.",

I would love to know what it was! Do you have any current Parlay bets being wagered that you would be open to sharing? In casinos a parley bets simply mean multiple games combinations into one bets and this way all the total odds are combine and put in one bet this have its advantages and disadvantages at some point. The advantage of such multiple bets is that your total amount in winning will be in proportion to the total odds combinations from all games selected. One disadvantage of such multiple-game selection is the higher tendency of losing from one of the games,  this is why I don't make pre-game selections in this manner,  and the only time I make multiple-game selections and add combinations is when I am betting on live matches. I have not won any of my multicast snce I started gambling myself. The reward is so tempting and definitely it can get a non gambler betting on such game depending on how lucky he feels.Pretty sure everyone knew that in the games and rounds section of this forum there are several threads about parlays, completely free to join and you could play completely free risk.Thats one way to payley bet here no risk involve.",

Parlay or what is usually called multi bet is a bet that may provide quite large odds but also has big risk because when making bet like this to be successful the gambler must win all the bets combined.Apart from the meaning of multi betting you can actually try to predict every match whether in any type of sport to be able to combine it and if you are looking for multi betting references here maybe some people will have their own predictions but it is better for you to be able to predict it yourself because there will be There are good things you can learn from every bet you make.Maybe some people are always successful with the multi bets they make but it not certain that in the future they will also win so learning to keep making your own predictions is the advice I will give.Firstly every gambler must have a type of sport that they like but you may not necessarily like the sport or match that other gamblers like so that is why I advise you to prioritize your own predictions in the type of bet that you like.",

They are more concern on what will be the outcome in profit but the risk is high because you don't win the entire parley if you have lost any of it in the game so you have to win all and that is not very easy, of course it is a discouragement for me.Quote from: Hirose UK on October 12, 2023, 04:58:22 AMFirstly every gambler must have a type of sport that they like but you may not necessarily like the sport or match that other gamblers like so that is why I advise you to prioritize your own predictions in the type of bet that you like.This is true.
