If I'm not mistaken, I think one of them already has their own crypto wallet pre-installed in their smartphone. If this is possible, in most cases, projects that want to run full nodes on phones, should consider to talk with these companies.",

I guess no! Why bitcoin has value? It's because it takes a lot of money and effort to generate bitcoin so it has a production cost attached to it. Easy to achieve things never becomes valuable.",

But so far, there is no success because you have have to think, how can a mobile phone run full nodes when it's specs are limited in the first place?Mobile phones is design to be just like that, a phone, not for some crypto projects to run nodes.So for me there is no prospect market and it's very difficult to market this project, to be honest.",

This is a very good perspective. The idea of cost vs value. But when you think about it, mining bitcoin 12 years ago was basically easy as well. Anyone, and I mean anyone, can mine it. Tools are cheap and any pc/laptop can mine it during that time. Of course it is quite different now. But the idea of mobile mining should be reducing resources to generate decentralized ownership. And yes I agree that even though such mobile mining will exist, the market is not ready.",

It still does not disclose the fact that just because any brand new project still can be achieved easily it guarantees future worthiness. What does those two coin offer, what things that those brand new cryptocurrencies solve? let's not talk about the market acceptance, rather does any users truly utilizing what those cryptocurrencies offer? if yes the market will follow.And there is a whole other aspect in regard to decentralization and security, this brand new platform is in its infancy, surely we shouldn't talk too much about decentralization. While in the other hand, the security of a cryptocurrency system might tightly be related to its decentralization, nevertheless, if by chance of this mobile mining does not produce a firm consensus and wholly contributed to the network, it does not mean a thing.",

What's the reason if mining is a factor that make the project become successful? any coins either good coins, scam coins or dead coins can be mined lol, as long as you have a mining hardware, you can mine any mineable coins.There's no way to mining via phone, phone processor is really low performance except you bought a high end phone that would cost you a lot.

Actually you got a point if the phone requires to mine such blockchain via phone then a stronger specs is very much needed. Well nothing cheap nowadays but even we buy a cheaper phone, likely the processing would be long unless the blockchain built is really design for that and well compacted in order to get mine.OP can you name those two? That has potential to mine via phone which still survive up to now.",

It is certainly possible to run a node on a mobile phone but I don't know how practical it would be. I imagine it would take a really long time to complete the initial block download especially if you're on a cellular connection that slows your speeds if you go above a certain amount of data used.",

My general view is that these coins ( Minima and taucoin) are very similar. The main idea is to be a reliable payment option for people who don't want to get involved with any government and central bank.I think it will be very interesting in the near future to see these coins have no problem getting adopted.",

TAU for one is already doing their mobile mining thing. Minima's about to be released. I don't know about Minima but TAU has its own chain. As I've somehow mentioned, a tech team should consider block size and capacity to fully operate on mobile for mining. It need not be any POS or POW consensus as such consumes too much. It could really drain. What I find interesting is that when Pi started doing their KYC thing, I already had doubts. If these two projects asked for another kyc before withdrawal, then it's a sure thing that they aren't decentralized and might pose a risk in the future. Three problems must be solved:a. decentralizationb. securityc. speedMobile mining tech has yet to move in the industry but it could prove to be a great thing in the future. That's what I tought.",
