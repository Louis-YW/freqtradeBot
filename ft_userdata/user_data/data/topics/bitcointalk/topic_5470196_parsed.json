We can tackle humans but tackling of those bots is almost impossible. I also don't block anyone for most time because I don't find a need to block the ones who will actually stop the spam themselves and in fact when I used to block those then they used to send those messages from other accounts. The spammers want us to change our e-mail addresses and we don't really have to do that but instead ignore their mails and that's going to be the best solution I guess. The worst thing they can do is to send multiple of such spam mails and that's it. I have been on internet for more than 16 years and I have seen similar things just like you. I mostly ignore those as I think ignoring is the best solution for such things.",
