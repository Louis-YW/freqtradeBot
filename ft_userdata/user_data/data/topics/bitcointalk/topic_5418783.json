  "content": "Hey, everybody! So, this is a different approach to the same problem I'm trying to address with my other patch/proposal: here.As a refresher, that proposal was to add a pair of arrows to each post to easily skip to the next/previous post by the same member within a topic. Personally, I would appreciate a feature like that, because I've found that responding to someone's post without first having read their other posts in that topic, frequently leads to frustratingly redundant exchanges. Other members have expressed different reasons for wanting a feature like that, so I believe it to be a generally useful idea.I'm quite proud of that patch, but while pondering the small usability flaw that it has (see that post for details) I came up with what I think is a superior approach: Instead of a pair of arrows, there is now a single checkbox-like widget near the bottom of each post. When you click it, it shows you only the posts in that topic that were written by that same member [1]. When you click it again, it reverts to showing you all of the posts within that topic.In my testing environment, this approach feels much better to use than the arrows do, and it ends up being quite a natural way to navigate large threads because of how it considers the specific post that was clicked on, in both directions (e.g. you can be on a thread with 100 pages, click on the widget within a specific post, see only the 3 or 4 posts made by that user, and then when you \"leave\" that mode — by clicking the widget a second time — you'll end up on the page of the specific post that was clicked on).Here's what it looks like in action (you'll have to imagine the surrounding posts; widget is next to \"Report to moderator\"):After clicking the widget, the diamond will fill-in and you'll see only the posts made by Foxpup (showing just two here):If you click the widget now, you'll end up back in \"normal\" mode where you can see everyone's posts again. Pretty nifty, no?The sudden appearance of a little diamond thingy will mean nothing to people who haven't read this post, so there are a couple of helpful, context-sensitive tooltips that show up when you hover over the widget:For the technically-inclined forum users: This feature is implemented by modifying SMF to handle an extra URL parameter (\"u=\") when rendering topics. That means it can also be used \"manually\" (i.e. without the widget) which I'm guessing will find some uses. For example, if you're curious if a given user (say, theymos; u=35) has ever posted in a given topic (say, WO; topic=178336) then you could simply visit: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=178336;u=35 (though obviously this doesn't work just yet, because the patch hasn't been accepted).I've sent the code to theymos. As always, feedback from anyone about this proposed feature is appreciated (but, please consider my thoughts: here). If discussion leads to new/better ideas, I'll obviously consider incorporating them, and will then send theymos an updated patch.[1] If you click the widget on a guest post, then you'll see only the posts within that topic that were made by guests.",

It is too close to the \"Report\" link. Would it be better to place it in the lower left corner, next to \"Ignore\"?  That seems more logical to me, because it is supposed to do something opposite of what Ignore does.",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing your thoughts and suggestions, everybody! Placement of the widgetI can see the logic in having the widget next to \"Ignore\" like @Stalker22 suggested. I slightly prefer it where it is but I don't have a convincing argument for it, only that I like how \"Report to moderator\" is always pegged to the bottom-right and I don't like how \"Ignore\" moves around depending on the height of the post. How does everyone else feel about the placement? Should it go next to \"Report to moderator\", next to \"Ignore\" or somewhere else?Filtering more than one memberI like @tranthidung's suggestion of being able to multi-filter. This actually came up during development, because when I proudly showed my pooky wooky how this feature works, literally the first question out of her mouth was: \"Does it work for more than one person?\". Technically, it's quite easy to support this (by making the \"u=\" parameter take a comma-separated list). Coming up with a sensible UI is a bit more tricky. Something like what @Stalker22 suggested (separate checkbox and on/off link) is likely the way to do it, but there are a few subtleties that I think would take a fair amount of effort to resolve.I can see three paths for multi-filtering:Path 1: Leave the patch the way it is for now, and tackle multi-filtering at a later date.Path 2: Change the patch so that it \"technically\" works (i.e. if you manually edit the URL and give \"u=\" a list, it'll do what's expected) but leave the UI the way it is. That'll mean that only tech-savvy members can do multi-filtering. Tackle the UI for multi-filtering at a later date.Path 3: Spend the time now to get the whole shebang working (functionality and UI).I'm not strongly opposed to Path 3 but I am a little reluctant. If a consensus forms around the idea that Path 3 is the way forward then I'll totally roll up my sleeves and get to work, but personally, I'm inclined towards Path 2; that way, we get a pretty cool feature right away (assuming theymos likes the patch) but the infrastructure for multi-filtering will be in place for a later attempt to come up with a sensible UI for it. What do you guys think?",

I think the smaller diamond is much less conspicuous than the first attempt, which is a good thing (I think) because people have gotten used to how their names are displayed and messing with that too much is probably ill-advised.",

The right side is for posts and post-related controls.Yep, I think many will agree with you, but one counter-argument to the distinction that you're making (user-centric vs. post-centric) is that this widget is actually a little of both. It's user-centric because it filters by user, but it's post-centric because the specific post you're on when you click it plays a role (see: the example near the top of the initial post about the 100 page thread). It's a bit subtle, because it leans user-centric when you click on it initially, but post-centric when you click on it again. So, I think an argument can be made for putting it basically anywhere.Quote from: vapourminer on October 31, 2022, 10:01:17 AMand a big THANK YOU for your work on this, wherever it goes.Thanks, man.

When I had the idea, I was mightily impressed with myself, so I'm glad that someone else is excited about it, too! Some thoughts on placementI'm not that fond of placement B, both because of what I said earlier (it moves around depending on post height) and because I'd like to add this feature to PMs too (at some point, not now) and there's no \"Ignore\" link there (unless I'm missing it), so there'd be a slight asymmetry when using the feature on a post vs. on a message (i.e. it would be next to \"Ignore\" on a post but just kind of floating around on a message). Placement C has the same problem (but in a different way, there's already a checkbox at the top-right of PMs).I do like placement D, it's logical and it would work equally well for PMs, but it's pretty \"flashy\" putting a big ol' [I've since made it smaller] diamond next to everyone's name, so I'm concerned that theymos might think it's a little too disruptive.Placement A is kind of discreet and also works well for PMs (i.e. next to \"Report To Admin\", in that case). It's also not that illogical, once you consider what I said above to @Stalker22.Thanks for participating everyone, I think I'll let this thread soak for a bit, in case anybody else wants to cast their vote on placement, and then I'll send the (hopefully final) patch to theymos!",
