Are you excited for the future of crypto. If this is for real, it's not really a bad news as these projects have been gathering millions despite that the interest is little today. The next bull run will surely be bigger than the last time and that's why we're all waiting for it.But, not yet the time to see it. Maybe we need to wait for a year or two.",

I'm not willing to take that chance and if it happens I will have to buy more, I am prepared for both ways, the truth is in the past bear market many projects are born, I remember polkadot, harmony and few others listed on binance exchange and it looks like they will never grow, that includes Matic as well, look what happen.",

And if I may add, if the fundraising is done by known platforms like Binance, people are stilly buying because they have the hope that the project will take off. So if you want a lil bit of assurance, go to top launchpads and also study the project itself. You should not listen to the fud but you also need to do your own homework, learn the foundation of the project, their goals and plans.",

How much of that money is going to be stolen by developers that just wanted to scam people out of their money? How many people will never see that money again? Those are way more important questions than the fact that some projects are still raising millions of dollars on investments, so while some may think that it is a good thing that those projects are still getting some funding I do not think that is something good at all.",

A lot of people in the industry are investors, after all, I don't think the market being bearish would affect their decision to invest in projects they deem to be interesting or would generate profit, projects would still develop properly regardless of the market after all. Additionally, a lot of the profits come from the initial release of the projects, so early investors can generate way more than they invested across multiple investments if done properly. So it's kind of like one win offsets the losses of the rest kind of thing.",

Are you excited for the future of crypto. well, that's great news than the FUD circulating for dropping crypto. even, during a bear market, there are still many who see crypto as a profitable type of investment. In fact, I feel that when the price drops in a bear market, a lot of investors enter the crypto world looking for a viable investment. So, we see that even when there is a bear market, investors are still flocking to invest there.",

The strategy was they won't let players go in unless they buy an initial NFT and that is where the start of the fund being raised comes. Is it a good sign? No. It's pretty clear that unless the top cryptocurrencies are pumping there won't be one with altcoins. Or less. A good sign will be if they are using Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB as means of buying NFT or buying their tokens before they can exchange them for NFT.",

New projects may have hundreds of times the potential and opportunity to return profits, but the risk will be higher than those that have been proven and verified by the community. Investing in new projects is not bad but for newbies it is not recommended, if you have the ability to do your own research and have abundant capital, accept risks, there is no reason why you should not invest in a new project. But for newbies, this should be limited because the risk is too high, you know the new project has no guarantee of success.",

It's better if you are checking it directly. So many projects are still able raising the funds for the development purpose. You will find bunch of new projects that were able to do that.
