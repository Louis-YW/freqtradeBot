Mcafee was known for such statements. Yes, in my opinion, all of the above current payments can be made if you convert bitcoin to fiat currency on a monthly basis.  Bitcoin can be compared to a bank in that it is a store of value.  Previously, bankers kept gold bars in their cellars, which were tightly locked with a key.  This gold allowed bankers to carry out monetary transactions - for example, to issue letters of exchange to clients.  Bitcoin is our personal bank.  Its value is analogous to gold, and the private key is analogous to a large metal key from a secure basement - vault.  Whoever owns bitcoin owns wealth and can periodically sell some of their digital gold to cover running costs.",

But bitcoin can be our own bank, with bitcoin, we have full control over our assets. In terms of storing bitcoin assets, it is more secure than traditional banking. For example, when SVB goes bankrupt, if you deposit money there, maybe you won't lose your money, but if you need the money urgently and the bank collapses, you won't be able to withdraw your money to deal with the emergency. But with bitcoin, you won't have that problem, you can use it anytime.",

When paper currency was started many people started their commenting on this that it won't stay long and it's not possible to apply in society but with time people get adapted to it until now even it was also true it won't stay longer compared to the historical systems. Now the same thing is happening with Bitcoin people are thinking it won't be applicable but bro with time they need to accept it whether its governments, Institutes, or locals need to accept it.In the answer to your rest of the questions currently Answer is NO but we can enforce them to convert that No into Yes.",

Mcafee was known for such statements. All this listed payments ways are visible when bitcoin becomes legal tender like the fiats in banks. Almost all this seems payable with bank transfers so I don’t see the reason why it can’t be payed with bitcoin. The only thing is the recipient willingness to accept the payment in bitcoin. Although we aren’t there yet but gradual with the recent increase of business accepting it as mean of payment then one day we would all those listed been payed with bitcoin.Also social media is a place where everyone say what they believe is the truth, Michael Saylor might be saying something good about bitcoin that doesn’t sit well with some people but they are also some lnfluencers tat say Worse against bitcoin. But no matter what is said no FUD or media stereotypes can tarnish bitcoin image",

Does anyone tell us or wrote any guidelines that bitcoin is made so that we can compete with real-world banks? Satoshi's simply stated that you can be your own bank / or chose to have the freedom of transacting anonymously and without any limits. Those were the premium features that he offered through bitcoin. He never claimed that bitcoin should be used against the banks and compared the benefits. THe vision was simple, have your own bank!Quote from: elevates on March 14, 2023, 12:48:53 PMWe all know the positive aspect of Bitcoin and to an extent, I agree with what he tweeted.

Can you pay all your bills with Bitcoin?Can you pay your medical bills with Bitcoin?What's the point here? No one would use bitcoin for those purposes considering the current drive of holding and earning profits with it! In the future we may start having those offerings through stable pricing or a system that will correct the bitcoin deduction as the prices change and have the  stability issues resolved. But seriously we don't have to pay all those with bitcoins.",

As what the OP says promoting it in a wrong way won't give bitcoin the exact recognition it deserves and will only lead to bitcoin being misunderstood. This is one of the reasons why on the past years there're so many newbies are attracted to crypto for a while and then disheartened after knowing that they could lose anytime. Promoting it in a way that it looks like a scheme only leads bitcoin further away from its original purpose and goals. It is also not called promotion, rather it will be called plain old hyping. This is commonly used by those influencers to attract their target market but, is this really the best method to introduce crypto? Coz as what can I see these kind of method will only be effective temporarily.",

Or Michael Saylor has a parochial view on bitcoin. Bitcoin is an online currency that can be used for exchange. In the nutshell, bitcoin is money for exchange. And for 4 questions, I capitalize on YES. But all depends on the country's adoption and the awareness of people on bitcoin. If the awareness is very high and the adoption is more then one can use bitcoin to do all the above mentioned, like my country we can't use bitcoin to do all that except bitcoin lovers, which is about 0.0001%. I am just estimating that percentage to let you Know that the adoption is very much few. Which is not even up to 1%. Therefore, if the country adoption is high then you can use bitcoin for all that.",
