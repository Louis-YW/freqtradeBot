Already we know say e-naira dey, but trust me, we no wan use am. Ordinarily who would want to adopt a currency that's drops in value every now and then. Let me even ask, what's the benefit of adopting e-naira self?",

Me too I see say E-NAIRA no be threat to di hardcopy of the currency because na di same money wey we dey use na dem just create soft copy usage for am so weti dey ground be say di e-naira go even enhance di Nigerian Naira if di government and economic experts do am well. And I believe say na because of the economic downturn in the country through the forex stock exchange dem create am to support the stock exchange to make di Naira strong. But seen that the implementation process is not really favourable to the citizens so it seems that nobody is interested to use it for any transaction. And also this CBDC was created to support di country economy through di commercial banks because the commercial banks service were very poor so by creating the CBDC would fast track and make things and banking system very much easy but things are more complicated and difficult to use and do. Nigeria is a drama scene.There was a time they announced say plenty piple dey use am but I never really hear anyone dey use that app dey do any transaction at anywhere. Abi na hide dem dey hide dey use am? I believed since di CBDC e no dey work again, let dem just use the last option to use adopt bitcoin and use it. If dem, I mean di government adopt bitcoin. Di youth go happy die and di country economy go grow well and strong. Di e-naira no to make people financial stable. Na di copycat for the real economy online so there is no different of the both.",

Me too I see say E-NAIRA no be Should I say welcome back to you even though I do not consider you going on any break,  since your account was registered in this year 2023 you may have just taken off time to read and not on break anyways,  welcome and nice to read you contribution on this,  bit first,  I don't know why our government agencies have placed replying to false news as declaimer more important than making any meaningful changes to whatever seems to be the problem within their agencies. CBN have and will have all the time needed to work on improving on the e-naira,  because, in the present stage,  that project is good as a failed project and any avenue that corrupt politicians have used to steal public funds without traces. So instead of talking let them be transparent enough to tell Nigerians what will work and stop playing the media blame gamthey'reeir doing currently.",
