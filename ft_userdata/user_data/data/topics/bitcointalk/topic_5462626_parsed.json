These two coins are my chances to get back whatever I regretted before because of not trusting Bitcoin and Ethereum back when they were still cheap. BNB especially has a higher chance but due to what SEC is doing to them cornering Binance, it might take longer than what I am expecting. Well, I do know they could win the case but there will be doubts from retail investors that could ruin the value of it and the reputation. Although I like the fact that XRP partially won their case which gives an optimistic view that other coins that is being attacked by SEC can also do the same.",

But to tell you OP, as an investor, it was not just we choose altcoins to invest in because we've trusted them but for us to see if that project is worth investing in and profitable. Because smart investors don't just look at what will happen today or in the future and so they secure buying trusted coins but they look for every opportunity to earn whether it was meme coins, shitcoins, or potential projects.",

I believe in their stability so far and I think they are helmed by credible people who will not easily turned things ugly so we can say that their future can be solid, bright and prosperous. Now, the other three would be: XRP, Polygon and SOL. Of course, we are now flooded with altcoins as a new one is born almost everyday so we have to be careful because not all of them can make it beyond inception.",

Moreover if you want, you can buy these coins keeping in mind the thought of bull market. but there is no reason to be surprised, it is natural that the price of these coins is much higher now. On the other hand many new meme coins are entering the market now, so if you have a large amount of capital you can collect some meme coins for future bull markets. But all these new meme coins have risk but if one coin will jump hits then you might be rich.",

BNB Ethereum If asked to choose an ALT coin next, Matic would be on my list of choices. I would always suggest Bitcoin as an investment, but if one has more money to invest, these three coins can be invested in alongside Bitcoin. If these three coins can be invested then I think good things can be expected from these three coins because these three coins are not coins to lose from the market. Those who believe in ALT coins can think about these three coins if they want. I hope your thoughts will match with mine and you will also like these three coins.",

For me, Oasis Network (ROSE) is still the main altcoin in my portfolio, this coin seems to be undervalued since its launch, I will wait until the next bull market comes.",

Binance Coin is being considered as a more potential opportunity, but yes, the current situation with the SEC interfering in Binance operations could create an uncertain situation. This interference may affect the value and reputation of Binance Coin.Regarding XRP partially winning the lawsuit, this could fuel optimism that other coins hit by the SEC are likely to do the same. However, the situation may vary from case to case, due to the complexity of legal factors and the specific situation.",

They are Ethereum, FUN token and a minor portion of CRO token from Crypto.com platform, as I had to stake there to acquire the debit crypto card, but that is all. And to say the truth, if I could get rid of CRO I would do it right now, remaining only with ETH and FUN investments on my altcoins' portfolio. ETH, because it's the top 2 cryptocurrency since a long ago, probably not losing its spot for any other crypto any time soon and FUN because the benefits it proportionates through the premium program at Freebitco.in for long term Bitcoin holders/investors.",

I don’t also trust any altcoin because I know any of them can fail us at any moment, but if am leaving any amount in any coin, then I will rather leave it in Eth and BNB. Those are the two coins which I still have little confidence in, and if am investing in any altcoin, then I will be investing small amounts of money in the two coins, or I will be choosing one of it.",

The XRP choice seems the more solid one due to the SEC case they won over, but LTC halving is here and some are hoping for some changes for it, but again, as I've said in my previous posts about it, I have this doubt that nothing is really going to change with its market, just like in the other halvings.",
