Some also will relax to cash out their profit even if the price has reached its high. This happened in last halving in 2020 when the price reached $64k, speculation was still high on the range of $100k but price started dropping from $64k until the correction became real. So we need to be at alert while the price is bull .",

Now, Bitcoin is speculated to have been created partially because of a desire to give people an alternative in a situation like that, when everything's failing. But there still hasn't been a major economic crisis to see how it performs under such harsh global economic conditions.In any case, it doesn't look to me like 2024 will be the year of a big economic global crisis, so I don't think 2024 is 2008. Perhaps the op meant something else, but the post is vague, so I don't know.",

You're right, that's what I've noticed in the majority of the community here in the crypto space about what's going to happen with the bull that's coming next year. And I can't deny that somehow I'm also expecting it, but it's only around 40% anyway. It's hard to expect more than 100% because, for sure, this will cause them to blame Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in the end because what they expected didn't happen.I agree that it is not right to expect too much of the bull run that is coming with so many holdings in their wallets. It's still better to just practice regular trading habits on various exchange platforms to make money. The mindset should be whether you have holdings to make a profit or not; it's just there if you earn a lot and invest immediately, it's just that simple to do that, and if not, adjust for some time again to wait for the right time.",

As every other bull run year, a lot of hopes are in people for a better profit. Every coming halving use to get more attention than the previous one which shows that bitcoin is gradually expanding yearly and the use of it is on the increase. The market is full of uncertainty and highly volatile, speculative and manipulative. Just prepare your mind that you won’t get what you want completely as anticipated. I won’t say there won’t be profit, it may be above your expectations or below your expectations when it comes, and how you prepare your mind to react to the outcome makes you feel contended with the outcome.",

But their is a big difference from back then and now that’s why we should not have much of a high hope regarding the upcoming bitcoin halving as their is much of an awareness, holding preparation and other factors which can hinder the pump from being that big as what happen last time. Why we celebrate the upcoming halving we should not be overwhelmed and convinced that we are going to see price pump and taken a wrong decision of buying with more than what we have at hand, which might require us to borrow and invest hoping to get big profit when the halving happen and price pump up as that can of action can lead us to being disappointed.",

Bitcoin follows the same pattern as most economies in the event of disasters, and we have not reached a level where we are independent.How was bitcoin affected by COVID-19 in 2020 and also interest rates. I don't think bitcoin was affected in 2020, in the beginning of that year was the start of recovery for bitcoin around $7,200 after it dropped in 2019 to around $3,800. Therefore , I would say that 2020 was the build up to the bull run with the halving despite the harsh economic realities occasioned by the COVID-19. Bitcoin didn't get to ATH of $68,789 in November 2021 by magic but it was the rush in the investment on bitcoin after fiat was having the social contact \"fears\" which led also to online business revolution and work from home.",

I don't think we are going to have something like that in the past because 2007 isn't the same year as 2023, in 2007 that was 20th century but today, this is 21st century and a lots have change.The Central bank are not printing any dollars except if emergency should come later that will make them to so, the government are careful of what they do because if they go Brrr, only government will bear the cost operation and will pay back the central bank of the money they asked because it is going to be as more like a loan as fiscal policy.You should also lower your expectation, look at LTC halving and the value today, it has lost more than 30% of the gains and didn't a new all time or maybe its waiting for bitcoin to recover from the dump and then start pumping.",

Talk of a possible replacement in the forth coming year. It’s just a hypothetical thinking but then, do you really think there could be an altcoin that would offer a greater challenge to bitcoin in few years?I greatly doubt that. Maybe am overly stating this but then, it’s hard to find one who would be so willing and concerned like Satoshi Nakamoto to have not left a back door ti exploit his idea when it’s green. Still, it would be difficult to have people believing in any alt like we do bitcoin.",
