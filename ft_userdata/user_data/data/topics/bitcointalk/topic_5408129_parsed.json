The selling allowance is determined based on the recent buy and sell pressure of the token. Our investors gained 22% in 4 days and if you look at the chart it looks stable and healthy even though this bear market. Rebase rewards come from revenue generated by the protocol's transaction taxes (fees) and other various yield-generating features. We don't hide anything from our investors, everything is written on the whitepaper.",

Most DeFi 2.0 rebase protocols suffered in the long run as you said. We're on DeFi 3.0 with Afterburner now and our vision is to become a long-term project with great sustainability utilities implemented. The Afterburner Engine Tax that is collected from token transactions will be accumulated in Afterburner's Reward Pot. The collected amount will depend on the result of the engine's internal performance and it will be sent to the Burning Chamber directly. Check out the \"Afterburner Engine\" page on our whitepaper to gain an understanding of what I'm talking about. I put the link to the whitepaper below.Due to the Burning Chamber's respective nature, 15% of the chamber's BUSD holdings will be allocated for its automated buyback mechanism every week.The Burning Chamber will enforce a self-regulating supply control policy over the protocol and constantly remove some part of the circulating supply in order to keep the protocol stable and perpetually increase the value of the $ARB tokens that remain in circulation, and in the market.The Burning Chamber will also accumulate further $ARB tokens from another Buyback Mechanism that is being maintained by The ARB Treasury!The AFTERBURNER Protocol will be backed by two separate buyback mechanisms and The Burning Chamber will burn 2% of its total $ARB holdings daily.All in all, we're burning most of the tokens we collect from the fees and allocate some of it for future buybacks to back up the protocol. Thus, $ARB stands strong against minor price drops and gains back its value thanks to our innovative utilities. Check out our whitepaper to get detailed information about our features and $ARB in general: https://vertexbsc.gitbook.io/afterburner-finance/protocol-basics/feel-the-combustion",

Will this principle be on all type of wallet including the exchange wallet, can I also have my gain on my exchange wallet?The core problem of rebase token projects is sustainability. Tokens are created continuously and distributed as rewards by utilizing a rebase mechanism. Inherently, dragging the protocol to hyperinflation. Afterburner aims to solve this issue with its innovative features that burn most of the tokens they collect. Thus, keeping the price stable. The Anti-Dump Mechanism seems to be a success already.Afterburner lets you sell whenever you wish. Only with a daily sell limit, adjusted (1-5%) by the Anti-Dump Mechanism depending on how $ARB is performing. You can see the daily limit percentage in our app's \"Protocol Metrics\" tab, which is accessible from our website.",

This can't be implemented when it goes to the cex. The sell limit is adjusted by the Anti-Dump Mechanism from 1% up to 5%is it too low? I'd like to see the people of Bitcointalk debate over this as the answers will be mostly subjective. We're improving with every step and we believe that community feedback helps a lot in this regard. Anything can change for the better. You can reach out to us with your proposals using this link: https://arb.center/proposalHere's the support form link if you're facing an issue or want to open a support ticket: https://arb.center/supportOn the other hand, getting listed on a CEX as a rebase token is fairly difficult. Forking the project might work better with taxes and everything adjusted accordingly. Maybe creating a stable token, who knows?",
