You will notice that because of the recent spike in price in bitcoin, which reached $51k, many people are all eyes on bitcoin because of the hype, and because of that, many are also attracted to invest in or buy bitcoin, hoping that it will increase more and more, but in reality, bitcoin is volatile and it will not always go up and up. There are many bitcoin wannabes who anticipate the bull run, but without prior knowledge and preparation for the bull run, you can't maximise the winnings or the reward. Honestly, if the bitcoin bull run starts or happens anytime, I'm confident that I will gain a considerable amount since I already have the calculations of what possible profit I can get. So yeah, preparation for the bitcoin bull run is a must, but if you are a rich person, then it's easy for you to bring bitcoin in large amounts and wait for the great reward.",

I know of someone who is waiting for the bitcoin price to drop back to $12,000 before they can invest in it, and he has been waiting for this, yet the bitcoin price seems to be disappointing him. lol.  There are also those who would love to be part of a Bitcoin investment but don't have the resources required.

If we want to be among the beneficiaries of bull run, we have to invest cash and move forward. I have definitely invested some of my cash in Bitcoin I am trying to invest my cash using the DCA method because we know Bitcoin will go up a lot during the bull season in the market I am investing some of my income in Bitcoin with cash. From what I have invested I can see and am currently in good profit. I have a lot of interest to invest but if I get a good help from this forum then my investment can be increased more.

So if you want to join them and be one of those who hope for the best of bitcoin price this year, you should buy some bitcoins with how much money you have right now and make sure you don't have any other plan to spend it on something because you are not waiting for a short period like everybody else, until the price of bitcoins rises well, your money stay there if you want to gain a decent amount of income with your money.",

While for those who have keep procastinating and hoping for bitcoin to dip massively to a certain price range before they would accumulate some. All I would say is their loss, because they may endup missing out big time. Those that are still holding to such mindset should let go of it and try and start accumulating bitcoin with any suitable strategy (e.g DCAing) so that won't endup saying had I known.Well for your question @Barikui1 all I know is to accumulate more bitcoin, hodl, and sell when it's time to. Because we all know that the bullish run would surely come but we don't actually know the exact time, it might be this year or next. But still before then I would grab this golden opportunity to accumulate more bitcoin before the upcoming or next  bull run",

      "body": "Well there are two strategies for a bull run. Either just keep holding long term through numerous 4 year cycles, or try to sell near the top and buy back during the bear market.The problem with the second strategy is its hard to guess where the top will be. During much of the 2017 bull market I think most people were wondering if it would hit $10k, then it finally did it at the end of November, and 3 weeks later it had shot up all the way to $20k! But if someone had set their sell at $10k, thinking the top would be around there, they sold at only 50% the peak!In 2021, most people thought it would go to the $100k-$150k range. Instead it was a real small bull market and only made it to $69k, so anyone planning on selling only as it neared a likely top didn't sell anything at all as the price got nowhere near where most people thought it would go. Personally my original plan that year had been to sell one or two bitcoin in the $50,000s and $60,000s just to get out some money at a super low price but still well into the bull market, and then sell a bit more as it approached $100k, and a bit more above $100k. But then I decided why would I sell so super low like only in the $50,000s or $60,000s. But the bull market was so much smaller than expected so I didn't sell anything.And then there is the additional problem of buying back during the bear market. You don't know how low things will go, and with greater adoption and less volatility there is always the chance that the next bear market will be far more shallow than the previous ones. In fact if Terra Luna hadn't collapsed in 2022, and then caused a string of defaults wiping out the entire cypto lending industry, plus at least one crypto investment firm, plus FTX Bitcoin may very well have bottomed at >$30k instead of $15k, which would have been a much shallower bear market than ever before. And in 2026, maybe there won't be any big company collapses and maybe ETF buyers will be buying through the bull market and maybe those things together will mean the bear market only drops 50% instead of ~80%. But if you decently sell below the top of the bull peak, and don't get near the bottom, after paying taxes it can potentially not even be worth it to have sold, even though the difference in bull run peak and bear market bottom is so huge. It's only in hindsight that we can easily say \"man, people selling at the top and buying at the bottom can make a killing every market cycle!\"I think it's a lot less stressful to just keep accumulating, hold through the market cycles, or sell a little bit during a bull run if you need the money. But otherwise just keep holding until you actually get to the point where you want to spend the money you've been saving long term. I think the above reasons are why most people don't even try to play the huge market cycles, but just hold long term through multiple cycles.For the upcoming bull run, I had been thinking about trying to play the market cycle, selling like 2/3rds of my Bitcoin to buy back near the bottom, but for the above reasons I realized that's just too stressful and dangerous if I miss top and bottom by a large amount. So instead I plan on selling some but not a ton of Bitcoin, to set myself up financially in fiat very well, and have a little bit extra from the sale to maybe try to buy some cheap bitcoin near the bottom. But if I'm way off it's not a big deal cuz I'm only trying to play the top/bottom with a marginal amount of my overall bitcoin holdings.",

Having good profit taking strategy is good to help you firstly retrieve your initial capital gradually with a bull run and after all, will actually have profit in cash to use.If you don't have plan to take profit, you might stuck in a bear market and have no profit cash in hands, even struggle with loss in a next bear market.",

This is the money aspect of the bull run. On the other hand, bull run can mean that the industry is getting the attention of the people and even the mainstream media so there will be more \"investors\" coming in either to buy BTC directly or get involved with an ETF. Bull run is also the best time to silenced critics of the industry especially those who predicted that Bitcoin will be useless and will fail soon.",
