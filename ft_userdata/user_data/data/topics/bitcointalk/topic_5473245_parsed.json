  "content": "With the stiff regulations of crypto exchanges by various countries to mitigate the effect that might be caused by sudden collapse of exchanges or other related issues which have already forced some exchanges out of operations in some countries, many traders are now beginning to look towards DEX. DEXs like Uniswap, Suchiswap, Pancakeswap, Bitget swap among others have witnessed more inflow of traders lately with many attributing this to the wave of mandatory KYC on CEXs.A lot of new Dex are also springing up to provide alternatives for traders in the decentralized world. One of such platform is SAKAI Vault's: A layer 2 decentralized perpetual exchange build on the Binance smart chain. Just like other decentralized platforms, SAKAI vault not only enables traders to engage in futures trading without expiration date but also enhances AI powered trading strategies that offer an informed and profitable trading experience.With its native token $SAKAI scheduled for listing on the 8th of November, do you think SAKAI Vault's can rival the likes of industry leading platform like Uniswap, Suchiswap and Bitget Swap?",

Since the platform is still new, it won't just overtake the renowned DEXs that have been around and have deep liquidity for the coins they listed. SAKAI will need to first put in efforts like Bitget swap, like Pancakeswap, Sushi swap, uniswap etc before it can become the mainstream.",
