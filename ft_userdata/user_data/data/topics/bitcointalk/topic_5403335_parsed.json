If the improvement process is expected to slow down, the FED will find it increasingly narrow to evaluate. Plus the recession that we saw clearly spiked could be even more directional when the pandemic first hit. Many are eroded to think about paying interest rates because the increase is quite large. Moreover, the expanding war market presents a major obstacle to the US doing business in the region. Nearly 40 countries are now flocking to avoid the recession by guaranteeing limiting exports of goods for the sake of supply in their respective countries because of long-term preparations.",

Things will both become too expensive and demand will start going down at the same time, rising prices till that moment will make sure a lot of production is added to supply things that bring in a ton of revenue. The 2% might not be achievable if some other shit happens somewhere else in the world but the ones that think we're risking hyperinflation are just the same doomsday preachers that have been wrong so many times in the past.Remember the last oil crisis when it triggers the shale boom? Food prices going up and increased revenue per ha for farming will simply make farmers think of expansion, hiking up agricultural lease price to a level where previously uncultivated land become economically feasible for both the owner to lease and the farmer to work it out.If people don't want to buy stuff and drop purchases both merchants and manufacturers have no other choice than to drop prices or go out of business, it has been always like that and this will be absolutely no difference in it.

From all that can be read, such measures inevitably lead to a recession, and it seems that this is their goal - and not only for them but also for other governments in the world that are making almost identical moves. When you say that the recession could last for several years, I think its consequences will be felt at least until the end of this decade - because the war on the Eastern European border and the statements coming from the aggressors clearly indicate that they want much more than they have now. The EU without cheap oil and gas and with green ideologies will not do well in all this, which will probably bring to power various radical and anti-EU politicians.The example of the recently concluded parliamentary elections in France speaks volumes about how things are changing - the Macron party lost an absolute majority, and Marine le Pen won as many as ten times more MPs than in the last elections.Quote from: Darker45 on June 22, 2022, 03:39:57 AMThey're still here.

As for Russia and its intentions in Ukraine, not everything is as it seems - because the Russians have almost everything they really wanted - everything else was a smokescreen and a tactical stretching of Ukrainian forces.",

I highly doubt that it'll happen in 2 years as OP mentioned, a couple could possibly mean more than 3-4, which is a more realistic approach.
