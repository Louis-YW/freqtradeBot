If you came in that early, you'd likely be looking for a wallet.dat file. If you came in after things moved to the phrases, then you may have just sent yourself something like that.Otherwise, if you didn't back it up in some way, there's really no other way I can think of to help you.",

LOL I was simply asking if anyone knew if some of the original BTC wallets had login types instead of pass keys.Â The oldest thing that contains BTC wallets that had login types instead of pass keys is Blockchain.com, but it did not exist in 2009 - 2010 in 2011, so why not do an image search for Bitcoin wallets, maybe you will remember the login interface.What type of data do you have and when was it last modified? Is it account ID and password or what?",

Some of the early wallets might have passwords or private keys because security is important in cryptocurrency. But if you don't have specific information about your wallets from back then it might be tough to log into them. And It is too bad that Coinbase can't be used in your state which makes it harder for you to get to your old wallets.",
