  "content": "So, it's 2022, and I'm making a thread about Jake Paul. Who would've thought, especially to talk about his boxing career. I'll be honest intiially the whole Youtube boxing stuff I wasn't a massive fan of it. I actually somewhat enjoyed the KSI, and Logan Paul events, but Jake Paul was always the odd one out for me. Anything he did pretty much annoyed me. However, I've come to realise, and respect someone that initially I didn't. He knows business, and he knows how to promote himself. He basically setups up his own events, and you've got to respect someone putting in the graft. For the last few years he's basically dedicated his life to boxing, despite having all the money, and fame in the world. That's also quite admirable. Now, there's currently some rumours floating around about him fighting Anderson Silva, and say what you like about his previous opponents, Anderson Silva who don't get wrong is getting on a bit now, is still a very dangerous opponent, and I do believe he's won previously in a boxing match, so has experience against a decent level opponent I do believe. So, what do we all think about this being made? Is this the fight, that if it does happen you'll change your mind about Jake cherry picking his opponents? Honestly, I already have; even though he might cherry pick his opponents, he does it for a reason, and lets be quite honest with ourselves what boxer with any kind of success doesn't cherry pick fights early on in their careers? Joshua, Fury, Wilder, and even Chisora, and Loma have cherry picked fights in the past. However, with Jake it actually makes sense. The guy is all about business, and he's cherry picked these fights because he's trying to become the biggest PPV fighter. So, he's brought in Youtube supporters via his presence on there, he's brought in the MMA audience through fighting, and knocking out MMA legends, and he tried to dip his toes into mainstream boxing with two opponents that pulled out. He's basically building the foundations of something very, very successful, and I've got to put my hands together for that. Jake's won my respect, very much like his older brother, but for different reasons. Anyway, I'll update this thread as the news comes out, but it seems the word going around it'll be Anderson. What do we think of that particular match up? Still cherry picked? P.S I'm not sure I could take another MMA legend getting knocked out by a boxer, though. There's some sort of silly rivalry with boxing, and MMA.",

Even though he's won a boxing match, I doubt it is enough of a weapon for him against an opponent that picks fighters that are obviously not strong in the boxing department. Jake's strategy of choosing famous MMA fighters with weak punching abilities puts him in the limelight of being 'on par' with these guys. But if the fight is MMA, I doubt Jake will last a long time against these seasoned grapplers.One thing's for sure though, Silva or not, Jake is going to bag a lot of money in his future fight. He's mastered social media marketing and building hype on his bouts. He's a great advertiser and businessman, but I can't say much about his actual fighting skills.",

I remember watching some of the highlights of that boxing match, and he performed pretty damn good. Looks pretty slick, not as slick as he did in the UFC, but still very decent. Obviously, Jake goes into MMA that's a whole different story. If he went against any of his MMA opponents in MMA he'd likely get absolutely destroyed. However, I find boxing tends to even up the fight a little bit, and usually it's technique that wins, which isn't always the case with MMA.",

What he had done since brought a lot of new fans to boxing that's why he becomes even more significant in the sport. Challenging Silva seems like a big step to proving he isn't just picking his opponent. Silva had long defended a title on UFC for a long time. We may be able to see Jake losing the fight if Silva still can manage footwork.",

Plus, Anderson is literally legendary level when it comes to MMA, and as evidenced above Anderson is a proper striker, and while he was definitely known for his kicks in MMA, he's definitely better than a amateur in terms of striking ability. I just feel Jake doesn't get the credit, because of how I initially thought of him. So, he's fighting a uphill battle because of his past history, but he has decent striking, and he has some power in those shots. None of the knockouts were staged, and it's hard to knock someone out like he did, especially in boxing. Usually, it takes a lot of punches, like a compounding effect. His knockouts were literally off the cuff, without much damage before hand. That's not something to ignore, that's skill, and he obviously has the right biological structure to generate the power he does. Like I said, I was also a doubter, and thought it was ridiculous, but this is a young fighter who's looking to make a career, and he's got a better record, against better fighters than most champions had. Despite them being MMA fighters, they were literally champions. Woodley being the most impressive due to him being somewhat known for his power, and chin.",

Anderson Silva has knocked out boxers before in the ring and he should not be underestimated versus a youtuber.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BLzMPtFRxrsIt also appears that uncle Dana approves of this and has also said that this will be a challenge for our favorite youtuber hehehe. I hope that this is not a rumor.At the post-fight media scrum following last night’s Contender Series event, White was asked about Paul’s proposed boxing match with former UFC middleweight champion Anderson Silva, which is reportedly scheduled for late October. He is usually pretty hard on Paul, but in the case of a fight against his former middleweight legend he actually seemed somewhat impressed:“I don’t give a sh-t, but, if he’s really fighting Anderson Silva, if he’s really fighting Anderson Silva, if that’s true, it’s about time. He’s got a real fight on his hands there, regardless of how old Anderson is. That’s a real fight.”Source https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2022/8/31/23331081/boxing-dana-white-jake-paul-vs-anderson-silva-real-fight-ufc-news",

Silva is a natural born fighter specifically in MMA and boxing requires more stamina to sustain your strength, power, and agility all throughout the scheduled round of the match. I've seen the Silva vs Machado boxing fight and I can say Silva can actually box, however he tends to exhaust himself by throwing a lot of punches and basically he rans out of stamina maybe because like I said boxing requires more stamina coz you need to keep your head and feet movements and defend yourself all time with only your gloves on your knuckles. Jake Paul on the other hand was a YouTuber and practiced combat sport maybe around when he's older enough compared to Anderson Silva who's been training his whole life with combat sport. I don't think someone has an obvious advantage against each other though.",
