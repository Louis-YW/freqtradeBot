  "content": "Now is ZeroHedge who is spreading the word about how Russia is adapting their legal system to allow bitcoin payments: https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/russia-one-step-closer-using-bitcoin-crypto-international-tradeIt is the same article I posted yesterday. It is SWIFT who is going to be sanction by BTC and not the other way around. Read it here: https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-will-replace-swift-before-visa. And no, as someone asked me in another forum, I’m not Russian. I do not speak Russian. I speak other languages apart from English, but no, I do not speak Russian, and I have never been there. My position respecting Russia is total indifference. I do not even know anybody from Russia. I just think that Russia is not worst than the US respecting their international policies. That’s all. “Russians are criminals!”. As much as US Americans are respecting their international and even internal actions! And at this moment, for the EU and Europe as a whole, it is US who’s been targeting them since long ago. Go back to the Victoria Nuland’s conversation, right after the US promoted a coup de tat in Ukraine, when her telephone was wiretapped (probably by Russians) and she was caught spelling US officials’ true feelings about their actions over Europe: “F… the EU”. The conversation is public. If you don’t find it is because you don’t want to. Meanwhile the Germans, behaving as the dopes they are, are comfortably numb while sleeping over their big “siesta”. It was supposed that it were the Spaniards who liked the siesta. No, Germans started the siesta in 2014 and they haven’t wake up since then. A bunch of dopes with the skill of making nice cars. Dopes at the end. Whenever they wake up and they demonstrate they have realized they are the target in this Ukrainian war, and start doing something about it, I’ll change my opinion about them. Meanwhile and as much as you don’t like it, please, digest the truth.",

The EU made a costly mistake of relying on one source of fuel but it's been a costly one to a lot more countries too. I doubt Russia giving China and India discounts on oil takes them below the cost oil used to be during the pandemic.",

What is reliable, CNN? I’m just LOL. A lot. A txid. Some referenced research the article is based on. It'd be bullish if it came out that crypto was being tested by companies like Gazprom and Lukoil but I doubt there'll be the liquidity too and the power to circumvent sanctions. I'd also imagine an imperialist power to make their own CBDC instead of helping to either prop up or kill a crypto.",

I agree 100% with this.I live in a country where it is very costly and slow to do any kind of international fiat transfer (swift, transfer wise, whatever). Bitcoin already changed that.Bitcoin was designed to be free, not fast. Some countries already know that, such as turkey and Russia and Ukraine. I expect bitcoin adoption to grow in the next years, specially this kind of usage (to avoid sanctions, to make anonymous payments,  remittances,  etc)",

I expect bitcoin adoption to grow in the next years, specially this kind of usage (to avoid sanctions, to make anonymous payments,  remittances,  etc)It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years. On the one hand, BTC has moved away from the original idea of P2P in the last years, as well as from the electronic cash system idea, being used by many people as an investment, instead of making payments, and not P2P but through intermediaries. Even in El Salvador, where it has been legalized as a currency, most of those who use it do so through a company app with KYC for remittances. We will see if this changes and if so, to what extent,",

      "body": "As for the sanctions that prevent companies from doing business with Russia, Bitcoin will not succeed in helping Russia bypass the sanctions if international companies outside Russia do not yet accept Bitcoin. Whereas, if Russia actually started accepting bitcoin and imposed bitcoin as the official currency for the sale of oil and gas, as it did with the Russian ruble, this would represent a fatal blow to its enemies so that their sanctions would become meaningless and they would not be able to prevent international companies from using bitcoin.",

Bitcoin can't provide policies, so any effect of the rules of this kind of service published then is a risk that they create themselves. Tbh, I've been introduced to many payment services other than PP thanks to bitcoin transactions with my clients.

It's like saying \"I did kill my wife, but that shit happens all the time, Just look at Pistorius and Simpson!\" The US did its share of war crimes, like Germany in the 1940s and Great Britain in the 19th century, but the difference is Russia is committing them now and it's all well documented. We shouldn't be happy that they're avoiding sanctions.
