  "content": "An anonymous person, known only by leonidas.og, signed a message on Bitcoin with the private key associated with the 2009 block 1018. We could recall that a forum member onesignature, in this thread, signed a message using the private key associated to that block, last year, which attracted multiple attentions in the community. Yesterday, another person signed a message using the same private key, with the ordinal protocol. The inscribed message reads ord.io the ordinal explorer that leonidas is building, the person dmed leonidas.og on twitter about this and  leonidas decided to keep the person's name a secret. This block was mined by hal finney and sources from bitcoin news claim that Hal Finney's private keys got stolen, sold or hijacked. And the people in possession of the private key is using it to sign messages on the block and they're not showing any sign of stopping.  Here is the inscription: https://www.ord.io/11035214 What do you think about this strange signatures on block 1018?https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1666900463856279574",

Could you tell me what is strange in it, please.Ordinals is very famous recent months but it was created recently, not in 2009. I could be wrong but I think the story possibly isI am a developer and get access to that private key, know about that message.I have idea to build tokens on Bitcoin blockchain.I need a name for my project and one of idea for its name comes from the message.Eventually I named it Ordinals because the message is ord.io that likely randomly.That domain was registered in 2017, not in 2009.QuoteImportant datesExpires On2025-04-10Registered On2017-04-10Updated On2023-03-30",

      "body": "The mystery around the signature from the 1018 block certainly fuels a cryptic narrative. Though, I'd advise caution in attributing this to theft or sale of Hal Finney's keys. It's a major claim and would require substantiated evidence to uphold. Considering the decentralized and secure nature of the blockchain, this could alternatively be a publicity strategy for the ordinal explorer that leonidas.og is developing. A publicity stunt, perhaps? Nothing draws a crowd more than a bit of enigma. What we must remember is that signing a message with a private key doesn't necessarily indicate ownership of the associated Bitcoins. It's a complex and multi-layered issue, worth following closely but with a critical eye.",

I thought of it as strange since the private key is linked to Hal Finney and the address was created back in 2009, and only a few people can be able to sign a message with that private key. You can enlighten me more about how it works. And if it's not some weird thing many people would have done similar thing. I could see the surprise on different users when onesignature signed a message using that private key. What is the secret behind how they are doing it?",

It only means he signed the message, or that address he owned was sold to someone else or he was paid to make a signed message and inscript \"ord.io\" to make a hype about it — the ordinals. Because people are so hype when an old address is known to be still active after all this years.",

With the inscription and all that, we are going to see a ton of people who will keep on having some \"fun\" with this and we all know that it will end in a bad manner without a doubt. Too many people will fall victim to this, there were tries to bring even satoshi back, thankfully nobody bought that but it was obvious from the start. So all in all it is true that we are not going to see this end anytime soon, plenty more will happen and I hope that it will not get any attention. So far it hasn't so I am guessing that it probably won't in the future as well but that doesn't mean that it will go on like this, maybe one day it will get attention and hurt some peoples finances if there is some marketing or something in it for something shady.",

It was a small amount but i think his family was moving dust to send to an exchange and sell. If you search all of Hal’s known addresses you will see a recent transaction about 5 years back and it was his kids that moved those funds. So maybe they are the same ones that signed the message for a fee.",
