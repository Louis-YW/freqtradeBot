  "content": "One of the most difficult tasks or challenges I've had is openly discussing the multitudes of positives that bitcoin has, with others that are skeptics.I've been studying/reading/buying bitcoin since 2016. It's the best invention I've seen in my 50 years on this planet. The ability for anyone around the world, to take custody of their own money. The ability to transact with anyone, around the world, at any given time. The open ledger (blockchain) to hold all transaction accountable (that even the US Gov doesn't have).  The limited amount (21 million). The security.  The uptime.  I could go on...But of all the discussions I've had with co-workers, friends, and relatives about bitcoin, it seems to fall on deaf ears.  In fact, if talking to more than one person, it seems to be almost a witch-hunt on how bad of a ponzi bitcoin is, and how 'it is backed by nothing', etc.Now I realize that this reaction comes out of either fear, ignorance, or not knowing enough about it.  But no matter how hard I try to educate someone on the positives, it falls on deaf ears with some.  And it's deflating to the core.I've been in this space for 6-7 years.  I can't imagine how tough it must be for some of you OG's.  Do you still try to enlighten others, or do you relinquish to the fact that you aren't really gonna change someone's opinion, only they can do that?",

But when people see that no one around them uses it, it becomes very easy to dismiss it as a ponzi scheme or some other FUD narrative. So instead of focusing on countering attacks on Bitcoin, it would be more productive to focus on convincing people to adopt it. And using old narratives that \"it's a revolution\", \"it will replace all banks\" is not going to work, people have been hearing it for years. Better show them how it can improve their lives here and now.",

Honestly, I don't want to give advice or tell someone to invest in bitcoin because I know that no matter what I say, they will never believe it. The best way to change their mind is to show them how your economy changed when you invested in bitcoin. I mean, prove to them that your bitcoin investment is making you richer than them, your economy better. What they want is the result, when you have the result, they will believe you, or they will earn their own bitcoin without your help.",
