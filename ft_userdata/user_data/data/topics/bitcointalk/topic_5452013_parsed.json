The OS is CloudLinux and the CP is Plesk. When necessary, you can always upgrade or downgrade your plans. Domains are being registered using our ResellerClub account.Payment MethodsStripe (Credit Card: Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover & Diners) / Blockonomics (Crypto Currency: BTC)KYC PolicyWe believe that no hosting company has the right to ask its members for any documentation. We value our members privacy and therefore promise that we will never ask our members for any documentation. The other companies claim they require documentation to be protected against credit card fraud. To this end, we have enabled 3DS in our credit card gateway and have blocked any payments that fail to pass 3DS. If the members credit card does not support 3DS, the crypto currency gateway is always available.Abuse PolicyBy using our services, the members agree that they will not use them for any illegal activity under EU laws. We actively monitor our email abuse@papi.host for abuse reports, and if we receive a report, we will suspend the members account and take no further action.---ORDER NOW: WWW.PAPI.HOST",
