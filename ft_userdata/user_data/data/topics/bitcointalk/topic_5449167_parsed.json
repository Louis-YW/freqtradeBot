      "body": "There is a rule for technical analysis in trading, that is;the longer the time frame that you are analyzing, the more likely it is to be accurateIf you are trying to reason trades with any sort of technical analysis based on 1 minute charts, you should not rely on technical analysis. On that note, news isn't released on a minutely basis and fundamentals don't change over minutes...so you're left with on-chain analysis. On-chain data is not entirely relevant to the 1 minute chart, but there might be data there that might help to trade on this time frame. In my opinion, trading the 1 minute charts is the same as gambling. I believe that the same applies to any chart under 15 minutes. Even 15 - 60 minutes should be considered unreliable. Don't bother wasting your time and effort on trading by the minute. Make macro observations, spend your time on research, creating theories and adjusting your order over longer periods of time rather than trying to make a quick buck in the short term.",

It's not even to say because it's ignoring anything that happens under short time frames as invalid, but that if you look on all platforms, even the biggest ones like Binance, it's impossible to predict with reliability what happens in 60 seconds.Markets can be bullish but you see sell orders getting eaten up, sudden bot orders placing and removing orders so quick your eyes can't see. hundreds of orders can come and go in that 60 seconds. And all of it can be against the market movement.So yes, nice to see if you're gambling and betting on those things happening but that's nothing to do with trading properly IMO.",

It is very hard to even predict what to come next in that short period of time. By the time you predict the next movement, the 1-minute time limit is already over. At this point, if you really want to trade in that 1-minute specific time frame, it is nothing more than just gambling your way through. Depending on your luck, you could either win or lose. I have learned this crazy trick for trading. If you want to trade in 15 minutes chart, analyze the 30 minutes chart. If you want to trade on 30, then analyze the 1hr chart. This is a wonderful trick if you want to become more successful while trading. That way, you can get more time to analyze and come back to the previous time limit chart. The result will be more accurate, and you will face less stress while trading. It will become more fun that way.",

One for higher timeframe analysis could be a daily chart or 4H, second is for middle timeframe or current trend analysis 1H timeframe or 15mns, and last timeframe which could be 1 minute timeframe for your entry timeframe.Trading the 1-minute candle means you have to make a decision every minute since it paints candles for every one minute. BTC is highly volatile. Price actions are fractals. What you can see in lower time frame, you can also see at different of higher time frame just in different phase but in almost identical formation.Trading whether what timeframe you enter with is just a brass part of any system. If you know what you are doing, you are not gambling.",

I personally believe that you should do at least 15 minute intervals, that would be giving you a better understanding of the past and a better prediction for the future, you can go as high as hourly because that would be a bit longer term and not an intraday trading but at the very least you would be able to make trades within a week thanks to that.All of these are fine, anything in between 15 minutes and 1 hour would be fine, but when you go lower than 15 minutes, you are making a quicker trade and you may not be great at that if you are a newbie.",

If one is using a trading bot to automate the scalping technique, then well and goodHowever, 1-minute time frames are not good for technical analysis because the candle patterns are very unpredictable as compared to longer time frames. Most traders I have seen prefer longer time frames for technical analysis and to make informed decisions before opening positions.",

Because Bitcoin has biggest trading volume and other cryptocurrencies have smaller trading volume.With Bitcoin huge trading volume, you can trade with 1-minute chart and your orders will be filled if you are trading on a big exchange with good trading volume. In contrast, if you are trading Bitcoin on a small exchange, your order might not be filled within 1-minute by its low trading volume.With other cryptocurrencies, it is harder to fill your orders within 1 minute. Sometimes it takes too long to fill your orders. In addition, if you use very short 1-minute chart, you should not let your position opens too long because a trend can change and you will lose with your position.",

It is not the same for everyone.  Successful trading depends on good analysis. The person who is able to make good predictions by looking at the charts is able to trade more and earn more profit.1 minute chart is very useful for the person who does futures trading.  Because future trading is like a kind of gambling, from here it is possible to make a lot of profit in a short time, and if you take a wrong entry, you have to face a huge loss in a short time.  So in this case it is possible to take probability entry by following the 1 minute chart on the leverage trading",

Many traders trade in one minute, and one of them is known as a scalper. It's a quick entry and exit setup that takes only minutes.Trading in such time range is extremely dangerous because losses can occur in minutes.As a result, this method of trading is not suitable for beginners.",
