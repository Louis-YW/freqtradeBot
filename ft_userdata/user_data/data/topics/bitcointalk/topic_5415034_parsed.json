  "content": "We are going to be using Micheal Jordan as our case study :Micheal Jordan gambled away $5 million dollars in one night[1], he is a Billionaire, but that does not remove the fact that that's a hell lots of money to gamble away in just one night, you might want to say he is an adult and a Billionaires, and he is free to spend his money in which ever way he wants - understandable... Now, what about his son? Marcus Jordan is just 19 years old, he spent a whooping $50,000 dollars in one night in Las Vegas on gambling and drinking in a strip night club[1][2][3], the report shows he threw away $35,000 in gambling while $15,000 went into drinking alcohol and girls in the club, and do not forget that it is illegal to drink and gamble under the age of 21 in the state of Nevada where they live....The young lad even posted that night's expenditures on his Twitter account where he said , and I quote.... Quote\"Last night was stupid... 35K at Haze,\" the University of Central Florida sophomore guard said. \"Totals 50K something the whole day.\"but according to report, the tweet got deleted.This (from the articles) I believe happened in 2010, but I believe it's a fresh story for those of us getting to know this for the first time,What do you make out of this story, should we really allow our children to live such a lifestyle like gambling and night clubbing, most especially, when they are still under aged?Let's discuss about this..REFERENCESMicheal Jordan - [1] = https://www.pokertube.com/article/billionaire-michael-jordan-s-multi-million-dollar-bets-5million-craps-lossMarcus Jordan - [1] = https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/news/story?id=5513792[2] = https://nba.nbcsports.com/2010/08/30/marcus-jordan-tweeted-about-underage-tweeting-gambling/[3] = https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-basketball-news-just-like-father-michael-jordan-who-lost-5-million-in-1-night-of-gambling-son-marcus-jordan-threw-away-50k-in-1-wild-vegas-party/",

In Michael Jordan's situation, that kind of value to him might be a coin or he just doesn't care about it. Now, regarding his son, we don't know if Michael Jordan knows that his son gambled that amount or maybe He knows where He might also tolerated His son for this habit. Of course, if I were a parent at that age of my son, I would never allow my child to gamble like that just to enjoy his life. Other rich people should teach their children how to value money, and they should learn to work hard for it before getting it so that they grow up knowing and knowing how to appreciate the money they worked for.",

These set of people might fall or not fall at the legal age, yet they must still be restrained until they have the full right by law to gamble. I know that Micheal Jordan would have regretted what he did that night, and this could be reasoned by such story not repeating itself.And as a parent, I don't think it is responsible for any parents to allow their children to gamble until they reach the freedom and legal age where parents have no total control over them anymore. Even at that, parents should still be advising and counselling their children on how to live a good life, where gambling responsibly should be among.",

Yes, the consequences would be pretty light since they're rich a f, and this is where the responsibility of the parent comes. As other people have said, it's not even about gambling, it's about taking light of your actions since the consequences would be close to non-existent due to their family background. There's nothing to discuss here imo, it's just the rich acting rich, and nothing we can do about it, they're rich after all (and influential as well most likely).",

The fact that Marcus Jordan is underaged is not the main problem. His father isnt saint also. And we all did some creepy and close to illegal things when we were young.",

We should not blame the kids here rather blame the parents for exposing those kind into this kind of activities at a younger age. I'm not sure about if its more about their culture but I guess, if you have that amount of money and you didn't work on that at all it's easy to spend it. I know MJ already learned the lesson and now aiming for a more profitable investments, this incident happened years ago and that could be the biggest why they choose to be better.",

Michael Jordan's son, Marcus Jordan, who is 31 years old now, by the way, learned from his own experience at the early age(19) that overusing gambling and night clubbing isn't a good thing for you and for those around you too. Three years later, in 2013, Marcus graduated with a degree in hospitality management. And 6 years later, in May of 2016, he opened a high-end sneaker store named the \"Trophy Room\". Now he's dating a famous TV star, Larsa Pippen, and there are no news of him being a gambling addict. I think it's a good example of how you can learn from your own mistakes.",

The answer is of course no, but if parents openly teach gambling in front of their children, then inevitably it will be imitated by their children and will not be much different. Parents play an important role here, Michael Jordan, who is actually a billionaire who spends large amounts of money, is no longer a strange thing. The glamorous life has become a bad habit which at the end of his life will be a bit broken. Now imitated by his son, who is 19 years old and has spent a lot of money.
