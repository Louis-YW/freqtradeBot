But because it came from a shitcoin supporter, i am just hesitating...Need your guys opinions",

At least that's what mempool.space FAQ is saying. First it puts Fulcrum between the original Electrs and Blockstream's, and also tells:Quote from: https://mempool.space/docs/faq#address-lookup-issuesFulcrum requires more resources than romanz/electrs but it can still run on a Raspberry Pi, and it handles heavy queries much more efficiently. If you're having issues with romanz/electrs, Fulcrum is worth a try.You made me read a little more into Fulcrum and the official documentation writes about \"~40GB disk space for mainnet BCH (slightly more for BTC)\", which should be much less than I've expected. For that I do have space, hence I've just configured it for local use and fired it up. Let's see how it goes.",

      "body": "I've been running ElectrumX for a couple of years now, and it's been great.  Very fast and robust, I've never had any issues with it loading wallets with tons of transactions.Last year I built another node (mostly for experimentation and use with mempool) and chose Romanz Electrs for that one.  Now I have Mempool and LND tied into the electrs server, and it too has been running without issue for several months.  Electrs is a bit slower to load wallets with tons of transactions, but not so slow as to be bothersome.  In fact, it's barely noticeable, really.  I don't broadcast my servers for public use, they're primarily for my personal use so I've never encountered a scenario where they were cumbersomely slow.  I've played with EPS also, but I didn't care for it too much.  It would be okay for occasional use but not as a daemon for other apps to reference.One server you haven't mentioned is Blockstream Esplora, which is the branch of electrs server used as the backend for Blockstream's block explorer, and the one recommended by the Mempool.space developers.  I have no experience with it, but I've heard that it's more robust than Romanz electrs, but it also requires more resources.I've also never used Fulcrum, so I have no experience to relay about that.For personal use I would say Romanz Electrs is probably the most practical.  It doesn't need a ton of resources, it's easy enough to set up, and has been very reliable in my experience.",

Not small, but not too big.The first config had a lot of values on default and Fulcrum started trying to connect to a lot of peers after the sync.For a second run I've turned more things off, but Bitcoin RPC Explorer only just gave me errors.A third run was the lucky one.The first request for address info was very slow though. Afterwards (for other addresses, clearly), all explorer requests were fast.The fill up of wallet data in Electrum, afterwards, was also OK.The only problem is that for now Fulcrum data in on the SSD I've done the initial download with. Now I'll move everything to the HDD designated for the job. It'll make the things slower, clearly, but you've got the test you aimed for.Some recommendations for the config on the normal run:Code:tcp = 127.0.0.1:50001the rest of protocols - commentedpeering = falseannounce = falsepublic_tcp_port = 50001the rest of protocols - commentedDuring the initial sync I also had:Code:db_max_open_files = 80fast-sync = 8000Quote from: Jason Brendon on January 07, 2023, 09:01:49 AMof course, like i said, Fulctrum outdoes all the other alternatives. The only problem i have with it is it's made by a BCH developer. I cannot tell more. Optimal would be that maybe somebody does a really good look into the code. But I won't.I am still deciding whether to use or not Fulcrum for long term. It's nice to have so simple \"setup\" on Windows, but Electrs is already configured too.Speed is nice too. I hope it helps anybody. Maybe we get more feedback too.These days I'll add Fulcrum to that docu/install topic too.",
