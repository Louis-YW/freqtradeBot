Although, i always use my non-custodial wallet to send to the exchange not directly from any platform (e.g. gambling) to the exchange, for prevention purposes.What i actually think the reason why you ask this is because you are in a mixer campaign, well, same as mine.   We will see then when i receive the payment from the campaign since it will be directly from coinomize to my non-custodial wallet then to exchange later on.",

We would like to receive the Google spreadshoots (and the address) you're talking about. I think that would be sufficient to process your suspended and future transactions.IIRC, this happened back when KYC was not required (for selling only) so, I don't think this had anything to do with the transaction being suspicious. It was probably a procedure they had to follow with all of their customers.",

I never mix my coins and just sent them directly to my preferred exchange, but things might change depending on their policies. If they ask for personal details more than necessary, I might use a DEX or do P2P if I need to convert my earnings to fiat. Things might change if my government or the government where the exchange is legalized requires an exchange to block mixer transactions though, they might look for popular addresses and then block any tx related to that address. Either way, I think you can still mix or use coinjoin or just use other exchanges. CMIIW.",

But I've read before that exchanges are strict if the funds where directly sent from a casino/mixer to their (exchange) address.So, I think this varies from the exchange where someone sends his signature earnings if he's a participant of a casino signature campaign like directly from that casino account to the exchange. If it's on their T&C then that's already the rule. I don't know how they track but it's possible that they've got the sending address put into blacklist and recorded if ever they've made a test.",

Btw, who usually reports it, and in what way?The Theory they see is that the coins get out from the mixer going to the exchange which the exchange blocks it. If what they are saying is true, I think the possibility that your coins coming from DEX might also get blocked one day. What exchanges might require soon is that coins going into them must have come from a regulated platform or wallet. Whether it comes from a casino or mixer campaign, they might just ask casinos KYC all even those with a small amount of BTC in thier account.",

No matter whether the campaigns were mixers or casinos.Nevertheless, you should know that some exchanges - regardless of whether the coins are from signature campaigns - request a proof of funds for higher amounts. In particular, the European exchanges Bitpanda (demand even for very small amounts not bought on Bitpanda) and Bitstamp (for higher amounts ~10k+) could be mentioned here.We have already had a few threads in the German-speaking board about users whose funds were blocked on these exchanges (especially Bitpanda) - if you can't prove where the coins came from afterwards, it often gets pretty complicated. Most of the time you get the coins back somehow (after plenty of emails), but the account is usually closed.Just use DEXs and local Bitcoin trades to avoid any problems.",
