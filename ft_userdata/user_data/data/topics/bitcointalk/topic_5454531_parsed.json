  "content": "We’re excited to announce that we’re releasing Slide game in Blaze.com, so we welcome you to our seeding event for Slide which we would be releasing soon. For this seeding event we are following the same approach we had for Crash and Double. As part of our fairness we generated a chain of 10,000,000 SHA256 hashes where each hash is the hash of the hexadecimal representation of the previous hash. Being the last hash in the chain: 6fd019734e950fe220446305b812e6308d1d49f0f4de113a1e5cbb624be6417bScript to calculate Slide point:Code:const { createHmac } = require('crypto');const divisible = (hash, mod) => {  // So ABCDEFGHIJ should be chunked like  AB CDEF GHIJ  let val = 0;  let o = hash.length % 4;  for (let i = o > 0 ? o - 4 : 0; i < hash.length; i += 4) {    val = ((val << 16) + parseInt(hash.substring(i, i + 4), 16)) % mod;  }  return val === 0;};const calculateSlidePointFromHash = function (hash) {  // In 1 of 15 games the game slides instantly.  if (divisible(hash, 15)) return 0;  // Use the most significant 52-bit from the hash to calculate the slide point  let h = parseInt(hash.slice(0, 52 / 4), 16);  let e = Math.pow(2, 52);  return (Math.floor((100 * e - h) / (e - h)) / 100).toFixed(2);};// these will be the 10M pre generated rolls to be usedconst hashChain = ['random1', 'random2'];const gameHash = hashChain.pop();// It's the hash we're gonna be using of the result of a yet to be mined block on the blockchain #792,123const blockHash = '';const hash = createHmac('sha256', gameHash).update(blockHash).digest('hex');const slidePoint = calculateSlidePointFromHash(hash);console.log({ slidePoint });We’re gonna be using a BlockHash that hasn’t been mined at the time of this post, we’re expecting to use Bitcoin block 792,123, this to prove we have no influence over the outcome of the game. Please guys feel free to quote this post so this will be all set in stone. Looking forward to show you guys Slide very soon!",

I did a quick visit in your casino, it looks like that you are inspired by Stake because the overall appearance and features are similar to Stake. Is it true that your casino is operating more than 3 years already? I see it on your FAQ page that the information was made 3 years ago as below screenshot:One more thing, your FAQ is not even providing the specific information, above screenshot is just example about the question related to minimum/max withdrawal but there is no answer at all. You suggest users to check the payment method page, but the answer for that specific question is also not available in your payment method page.",
