So similar situation will occur in casinos soon and we should not also forget that some casinos doot require KYC from players and that is clearly stated on their terms and conditions same with exchanges some do not require KYC but those set of services is becoming limited this day due to government climbing down on none KYC compliance services.",

      "body": "There is a reason why most gambling businesses requires KYC for their gamblers which is to avoid gamblers to use their platform for money laundering. It can be avoided in some cases but if the casino is suspicious of your activity then surely the casino will ask for KYC to clear their suspicion on you through KYC even though you didn't do anything wrong in the first place or rather you are just depositing on their casino and gamble.",

There's no exceptions to this rule if the casino in the first place requires it. Well, that part has too many questions to be asked and debate to be tackle but in the first place the casino isn't saying it's mandatory nor the government.For dApps I think they're not yet conquered by the KYC stuff but I think in the future the government will be eyeing these kind of casinos.",

If a gambling site have good reputation, having more members, regulators will concentrate more on the gambling site and the gambling site can make KYC compulsory for their users. There are still new gambling sites that do not require KYC, but do not be surprised tomorrow if they request all their customers to get verified on their gambling site.Quote from: jcojci on August 26, 2022, 03:44:41 PMThe casino argues that the selection of KYC for users is random and not based on anything.

Some gambling platforms are not very strict in regards with KYC as long as they don't detect any unusual activity on your account whether it is VPN issue, Fraud issue, or even a possible log-in attempt on the account. However, there are some gambling platforms who are strict with KYC and some of them require KYC for withdrawal or any huge bet activity on the account.",

In the future, all regulated casinos will require that you be KYC verified in order to withdraw money. Personally, I do not like the idea that my personal information is in the hands of some authority, who could connect my personal data to my gambling activities, as this would be an invasion of my privacy. I believe that this opinion is shared by many people in crypto community.Quote from: jcojci on August 26, 2022, 03:44:41 PMAnd will this trigger crypto-based casinos that use wallet logins to develop better because they don't need to register as usual and only need to connect their wallets to the casino? Or do they also need to do KYC? Or for this type of casino can still be \"forced\" to do KYC?Ultimately, it's likely that a combination of both approaches will end up being used. Complete anonymity may be impossible as the centralized casinos and related companies require some level of individual identification to comply with KYC/AML laws. On the other hand, a blockchain-based platform might be able to provide a more private alternative for those who want complete anonymity in their transactions with the casino.",

Rules are rules, only if you don't like KYC just go to a non-KYC casino. You control everything before betting any further.I know most crypto gamblers don't like KYC, but nowadays casinos also have to adjust to the reputation and presence of government-detecting casinos. Then you will be given 2 options. First: the casino is closed or the second option is to follow and implement KYC to be free to operate. If we look at crypto casinos, they still give freedom and side to gamblers, namely with the rule that KYC requests will be requested when needed. Doesn't that sound wiser than registering right away and then you have to complete KYC to be able to play?If so which position would you choose?",
