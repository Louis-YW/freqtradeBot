Crypto newbies may not even be aware of how to look at a project white paper and identify if there are some tricky things with it. Newbies don't know fully well how to check the Twitter, Telegram, LinkedIn, Discord, and other social platforms of a project to decide if it's a project to risk their funds for. So newbies wasting their time on altcoins may result in the fact that they are just burrying their funds in a snowy environment that cannot melt when warmth comes. It is wise if newbies clearly stay away from altcoins. Even some experienced crypto enthusiasts sometimes get disappointed along the way when they try to take advantage of some altcoin pump and dump price manipulation.",

And one who is looking for an asset to invest in should stick to bitcoin only So it's really more sophisticated now for newbies to note the possible ways to avoid a scam project if they see one. I remember back when I was still studying the crypto space, my mentor would say that if I wanted to know if a project was real, I should search for their Twitter page and look through it to see how active their page is. I should also take note of how many followers they have and how many likes and retweets they have too. He told me to go on Telegram and search for the project's Telegram group or channel and see the level of activity going on there and how their group admins are responding to users that are asking questions there.I did as he was instructing me, and I was able to detect a few things. If a project is phishing, there are some questions you might ask in their telegram group, and they will automatically delete you from the group and also delete your question. The same thing applies to their tweets on Twitter and other of their social channels.You said it all @Zaguru12, some celebrities and influencers are even the ones helping these scam projects gain popularity on social media. I must say that I have fallen victim to altcoins in the past, and that's because I was a newbie and was not able to figure out all these things by myself until I became too exposed and also learned from the experience I got. For those reasons, I would not advise newbies to go into altcoins, but if they feel to do so, I had just say, \"trade at your own risk, you might get lucky.\"",

I think people buy altcoins because they think they already missed their window of opportunity for buying bitcoins, so they buy altcoins instead believing that they are buying at the bottom and they believe the altcoin will be as big as bitcoin in a few years. I doubt these set of newbies know what a whitepaper is, or even do their research to know if the project is legitimate.",

Hmmm, I think that's a great move if people are thinking like that because if they already know where they need to enter then surely they have some experience and they don't want to miss the journey.

That sounds a piece of good advice on the basis of entire savings investment but I have point here if someone wants to invest some of his money and he is dreaming to invest and make 10X of it on somebodies advice or motivation whether he is a good analyst or not I think as the experience of the past trend we can say yes you should invest but need a little patience as mentioned above you won't regret. Because need to take risks and invest some part of your savings I think it's worth to be risks because just saving is not going to help out you in the future.",

It's a common mistake because we all sometimes become greedy.But yes I would always invest especially in Bitcoin, a big percentage of your portfolio should always be Bitcoin. Not necessarily only bitcoin you could gamble a little bit on other altcoins in the market may be on the top altcoins that have a lot of potentials, I mean yes its altcoin but its high-risk high reward and it doesn't really matter since you only invest what you afford to lose at that token.",

I currently focus all of my energy on investing in bitcoin; I haven't thought about holding alternative coins yet, but I might do so soon.Some people actually got into cryptocurrency because they had heard about the upcoming bull run and had been advised to hold as many coins as they could.
