Sometimes I'd say Nigeria has it less when it comes to election violence compared to countries like Kenya, India and even Russia.  For the case of Putin, he served as president since 2000-2008 and resumed power in 2012 till date. And people suspect his rise to power was not a fair and honest one. Nigeria just has the badluck of always voting in the wrong sets of leaders the moment few currencies has exchanged hands. I doubt that Nigerians experience much coercion during election though.",

Politicians purchase high-tech weapons for young people running in elections, but they have trouble getting the weapons back from them afterward. resulting in a crisis after the election. Politicians are already recruiting lads to help them in their campaign for office in the upcoming 2023 election. The new electoral statute, which prevents manipulation and lessens electoral violence, was signed by Mr. President Buhari, which is wonderful news this time around. because the results of the election will be broadcast digitally.",

The reason for this is because the country lacks strong institutions that ensures that the constitution of the country is upheld. Elected political officeholders become emperors and despots because they are not checked by any institution. The legislature, executive and judiciary connive to loot the treasury of the country without any form of obstruction. The lucrativeness of these political officers now make politicians to do everything including instigating ethnic and religious crisis to win elections. They sponsor thugs that hijack ballot box or attack electoral officials because they want to win elections. Opposition or political opponents are intimidated and sometimes killed because they want to be silenced. Until politically offices in Nigeria ceases to becomes an avenue to become stupendously rich, electoral violence would not stop. If political office holders are persecuted and punished for the crime they committed during and after election, other would take note. The public especially the youth must also know that these politicians would never use their children to carryout these electoral crime because they know how risky it is. We must also take note that these politicians will also want the masses to be poor so that they can be easily used for these risky and violent electoral crimes.",

I will say that Nigeria Politicians are thieves in disguise and not politicians. This is known as abuse of power because Nigeria Politicians placed themselves above the law because the Judiciary is in their palm.",

They have a common ground they agree on and that is how to loot the people's money. In Nigeria, the set of politicians we have are career politicians. They have no other trade or profession except to be in politics and steal public funds. This is why it is called a dirty game in Nigeria. In this coming election in 2023, we should not make it a do or die thing. Just be obidient and vote wisely.",

Abdusalami Abubakar also believes that some electorates are to be blamed as they allow themselves be swayed by sweet talks and gifts, but hopes that the 2023 election coming up will be different.

We hope for change in the electoral process due to the advent of technology.",

Additionally, any commissioners found complicit in the repression and intimidation of opposition parties by state governors will be dismissed.It is documented that governors issue executive orders to stop opposition candidates from holding events or putting up campaign signs in their states. These directives are harmful to the voting process in Nigeria. Additionally, the police inspector general must take action to stop",
