  "content": "This will be a totally off-topic post. So I recently had the worst dream of my life, and I want to share it with you guys. I hope you don't mind.So the dream was a bit confusing. I was sleeping when I suddenly woke up and saw my family members around me. Then I checked my phone, and I saw a red trust or negative feedback from a Senior-ranked member. He stated that I was a bad member bur didn't give any valid reasons why he was giving me this negative feedback. I was totally shocked. I thought I was dreaming. So I checked to see if it was a dream or not. I checked my phone twice, the same as before. Still the red trust! I totally freaked out. I didn't know what to do. All I knew was that I didn't do anything wrong to get negative feedback. I couldn't solve the equation; what went wrong?Later, I found out I had two dreams. The main dream was me waking up, and my second dream was me checking the phone. I didn't realize that until I finally woke up. It was like a dream within a dream.I don't exactly remember what it's called. I think it's called \"False awakenings\". Meaning I woke up but actually didn't wake up.Has anybody seen the sci-fi movie \"Inception\" by Christopher Nolan? If anyone saw the movie, they would understand what I'm talking about. I don't have any words to describe the feeling. Now I'm just relieved that I didn't get any red trust.",

So, becareful who you connect with in real life else you continue to interact with them even in your dream. The harmful laptops could hack or take advantage of the weaker ones in the dream and that could affect the laptop when it's awake.If you struggle to wake up, you could experience the \"false awakening\" you mentioned. You need to be strong enough (GOD does this) to truely wake up or you wait for the right time to wake up. Becareful what you program or feed your mind with, and don't connect with harmful devices/people. Been long I watched movies except the short animated ones.",

      "body": "Here's a possible short story about a terrible dream I had:I jolted awake in a cold sweat—fragments of the unsettling nightmare still flashing through my mind. It had felt so real; the utter vividness of it was what I found most disturbing even now as I regained consciousness. In the dream, I had been backpacking through a dense jungle when suddenly I realized I was completely, hopelessly lost. The lush green foliage surrounded me on all sides without a trail in sight. I wandered aimlessly for hours, my dread mounting steadily as the sky darkened and night crept in. I began to panic as I stumbled through the pitch black jungle. Every little sound put me on edge. A branch would snap and I'd spin around frantically shining my dying flashlight—only to reveal more endless knots of trees and vines in every direction. Then out of nowhere, a huge snake dropped from one of the tree branches right in front of me. I froze in sheer terror as its slit eyes bored into me and its tongue flickered rapidly. My heart pounded deafeningly loud in my ears. Still paralyzed in fear, I watched helplessly as the snake reared its head back and exposed two long, curved fangs glistening with venom. Just as it struck straight at my throat, I woke up shrieking.I could still picture every tiny scale on the snake's skin and vicious look in its eyes. I shook my head in disbelief at how real it had felt; my heart was still racing a mile a minute. Needless to say, it took me awhile to shake off that horrifyingly vivid nightmare before falling back into a troubled sleep again. Here's hoping I have more pleasant dreams ahead!",

You'll only noticed that you saw something that nobody else sees. Then you keep woundering. Like me I have had couples of dream that I see myself in a strange land where there is alot of technology compeard to real life. Sometimes I will wake up talk to my wife and sleep, and wake up and told her I saw you in my dream and this is what I told you. She will laugh that I woke up and told her what I thought was a dream.",

OP’s reference to \"Inception,\" adds a twist to my dreams too after i watched it hahaIt's just fascinating how dreams can mimic reality and it leaves a lasting impacttonys even after waking up.",

If anyone saw the movie, they would understand what I'm talking about. I don't have any words to describe the feeling. Now I'm just relieved that I didn't get any red trust.Yes! I have and it’s definitely one of my favorite movies ever I am someone who has constantly gave too much thought about dreams what they imply and how can they occur so the concept itself of inception is interesting as if that was not enough, the actors in the movie were absolutely amazing followed by nolan’s amazing directing skills well anyway it’s quite freaky to “wake up” in a dream because it confuses you and will have you second-guessing if you are still in a dream or not for those who have not seen this movie I absolutely recommend it",

I guess it's normal for us to experience this lucid dreaming.And I think this happens when we're attached to something that's important to us and that's why they're projected in our dreams. Sometimes it's good and sometimes they're bad. The bad ones repetitively I've got was when someone tries to chase and kill me, I am awake but can't run. I bet that most of you guys also had that type of dream.",

When emotions are positive, forming a connection with our life, it gives a true boost of energy for the whole day, but when negative emotions, the feeling of depression will only interfere. There were also such dreams when you confronted the source of fear, sometimes it was possible to turn such dreams into more positive or inspiring ones.",
