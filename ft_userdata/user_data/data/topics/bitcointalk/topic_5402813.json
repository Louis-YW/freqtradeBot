      "body": "Here's why one would be interested in buying a Newbie account. There is nothing special about this account except that it was registered in 2013. This account seller may not know exactly how the account cannot be sold. By doing this, the account will get more tags and the reputation will go downhill. The owner of this account may already understand. Community members don't want anyone to think that selling an account is normal. This is because scammers can use this account for future scams. So it is better to be careful in advance.",

I hope he did not get REKT recently and decided to have a crazy idea of selling his account to get some quick cash. How could anyone have known about Bitcoin by 2013 and still have no idea about generating genuine income through it in 2022?I have also tagged the account seller.",

Given that it has a Unique name, and it’s old. Still, in that sense, the account seller overrated his newbie account with no much history.Maybe he should try NFTing it before the hype dies completely",
