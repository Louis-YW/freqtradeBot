They are taking them away from the hands of the people and what might occur is it will be the criminals who will predominantly have access to them.U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s re-election campaign is set to focus heavily on the crypto industry. Her disdain for the crypto industry isn’t new — the Massachusetts senator has been fighting to curb the spread of cryptocurrencies in the U.S. for several years. Her efforts culminated in December 2022 with the introduction of the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022. At the time, the bill was widely criticized both by republicans and fellow democrats, with the broader crypto and tech industries warning about the dangerous implications it could have.In February, Warren vowed to reintroduce the bill this year, which would require all decentralized entities to comply with rigorous AML requirements.Read in full https://cryptoslate.com/elizabeth-warren-says-shes-building-an-anti-crypto-army-in-new-campaign/",

If I were to guess what kind of person would look at this and want to vote for her, then I suppose those which live by the mantra 'misery loves company' fit her target audience perfectly.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general have no effect on the lives of those which do not use them, and even if they see in bitcoin a tool to obtain freedoms they neither want or need, they still do not want for anyone else to have them, so people like her can get a lot of votes despite that a proposal like this will bring no benefits at all to the ones supporting her.",

While my disdain of politicians is usually reserved for the extremist corrupt immoral fascist tyrannical republican party, Elizabeth Warren is right up there with them as a politician that I really don't like and she clearly picks fights she doesn't understand.I don't get why she is sooooo anti-crypto. I mean I know she thinks Bitcoin is bad because it uses a lot of energy and she isn't educated up on why Bitcoin mining is actually really good for the environment and the world. And I know there's plenty of scams in crypto. But like, she just hates all of crypto including Bitcoin and has zero interest in learning about it. I guess its just cuz she doesn't know anything about it and just reads the bad headlines about scams and stuff like FTX and doesn't care enough to really learn about the whole industry and just assumes its all scams and FTXes. It'd be like wanting to build an anti-internet army in the 90s. It's sad politicians like her are so uneducated on Bitcoin/Crypto that they 'want to toss the baby out with the bath water' as the saying goes. She seems to be someone who goes after anything that APPEARS to be bad based on media interpretations, and doesn't bother to learn beyond that.After such a pronouncement as \"building an anti-crypto army\" I would really like to see her actually debate industry experts so her views on the industry could get demolished in the public eye.  There's no strong voices standing up for the industry in a very public way so crap like this is just allowed to go unchallenged. It is VERY popular to malign Bitcoin and the industry as a whole, and generally the only response is people on Twitter condemning such attacks. We really need more public people actually educating the public and politicians on the benefits.",

Elizabeth has a slim chance of winning the election and as a matter of fact, her entire political career may be affected negatively because of her hate for Bitcoin since a large portion of the society already embracing bitcoin. The young voters will see Elizabeth as old fashion politician who does not have the wherewithal to mitigate through the process of adopting bitcoin and other digital assets into the traditional financial system as a lawmaker.",

No wonder that the radical left politicians want total government control and brutal regulations over all industries. This is hidden totalitarianism. Unfortunately, Warren will most likely win another mandate as a senator, but we shouldn't be worried that much. Anti-crypto politicians have been elected in the past years in both the Congress and the Senate, but this didn't stop mass BTC/crypto adoption in the USA. The US government might impose stricter regulations over the crypto industry, which is a double edged sword, but we definitely need the industry to get rid of scammers like Sam Bankman-Fried.",

      "body": "Well, this is not something new, as the history of Massachusetts represents its hostility against BTC and its decentralization. Why? That I do not know but back in 2017 Massachusetts showed its hostility to BTC but the number of BTC users was still increasing in that state. Like you can check the stats are telling truth, There are more than 800 registered BTC ATMs in the Bay State and there are more than 200 blockchain companies in that state which make it the 5th state in the most adoption of BTC list. But the question is why this senator is against BTC and it's decentralization. i think when they declare war against BTC in 2017 (which i mentioned above) they said in that warning to users that Quote “Bitcoin has also been the target of major hacks,” another sentence begins in rather treacherous territory. Bitcoin, as honest analysts know, has never been hacked. But third-party trust operations “at the exchange and wallet levels,” have, Mr. Galvin notes almost too late in the same sentence, failing to make an important distinction. As after this, FTX was the most famous token in Bay state but as Fall of FTX came this seems to look more true. But as we know BTC is BTC and others are alts if you will give space to other technologies and then ask BTC and its decentralization to halt then that's not fair. Maybe, there could be other problems too in stopping BTC like, \"Election is coming\" she needs voters and using those who are against BTC/crypto or at least encouraging those too who lost in FTX. As back in 2022, she failed to implement that act but now she is again in the field. let's see what good comes from this back she made some ambiguity statements which proofs her wrong. Well, what if she wins this time, just a curious question. then i think these companies have to leave doing business in the USA but that will affect the economy of the USA, as a great amount of tax is being gathered on crypto and the latest tax on NFTs will get them more money as many celebrities own millions of NFTs. But overall, i do not think so, it's going to happen.",

I was almost confused when I saw this post and the essence of the anti crypto campaign was not clear to me. I was asking who'll support this kind of campaign and how would it profit the people of the state? I know United States as a state that loves Liberty which means people have the right to do whatever they wish to do at the confines of the law. Mare looking at their campaign, you will understand that all the crypto enthusiasts will not support the said campaign and even people that arebnot into crypto my not be interested in the campaign. But as I have read that she was personally scammed in crypto. I now understood the reason for the campaign and maybe some people that were scammed using crypto and bitcoin as the payment gateway would also support the idea. That is one of the disadvantages we have in cryptocurrency. Whenever a crime is concluded using cryptocurrency as a payment method it is assumed that the payment method was actually the scam.",
