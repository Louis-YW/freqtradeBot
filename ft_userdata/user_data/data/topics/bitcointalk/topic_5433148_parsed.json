Quote from: Riocasino on January 05, 2023, 03:26:11 PMWhat about Trezor or Ledger nano They are good. With using a hardware wallet, you can be sure that your keys are always kept offline and your fund is safe. I would prefer Trezor over Ledger. Trezor is open-source and ledger is close-soruce.",

A software developer might sneak some malware into an upgraded version of their software, but with open source, software will always have a bit more transparency than closed-source, since any user can see the code and check for potential issues. That means other developers and users can check the source code for any potential issues or malicious code and alert the community. That's the benefit of open source software. Not only does it allow any programmer with the ability to improve upon the source code, it also means that there are many people looking at the source code for vulnerabilities and flaws to report. There is strength in numbers, after all, and open source projects are no exception.",

But it's definitely possible and definitely a risk.Quote from: Riocasino on January 05, 2023, 03:32:34 PMBeing open sources software wont allow other users to see if its infected i believe. Of course. Not every user can verify source code.

Owners/founders of most new altcoins for example build 'reputation' for a long time, spend money and time to make people believe them, but they take all the money of their investors when they have garnered enough. Mind you that once it is a centralized service, you can lose money as a result of the direct or indirect actions of the owners, if Binance falls for example, there's a high probablily that trustwallet will go down with'em.Quote from: Oneandpure on January 05, 2023, 06:24:01 PMTrustwallet most safety placed for saving assets due has own controlling with seed phrase than alternative way when saving cryptocurrency in exchange market.

The safest place for storing your funds/asset is offline/an airgapped device, trustwallet is none of that, it is closed source and an online wallet, it is pretty far from being the safest place to store your funds.",
