It's always recommend to read the T&C of a casino before doing any gambling activities on their site and you broke their T&C which resulted in your account getting banned. Now, it's Stake's decision to rather give you another chance or not so that's why I suggest you to contact their Customer Support to get some help, and any favor they do will be their good will. I would also recommend you to move this thread into a board that suits it better. Since it's related to gambling so I recommend you to move it to gambling board.",

      "body": "OP, you were banned for breaking the rules, you had several accounts that were expressly prohibited. You were aware of the possible consequences, now you need to come to terms with the situation and accept the loss of that money. You are doing an even worse thing, involving a third person in all this, a person who should provide personal information and thus accept the blame for the stupid things you did.Quote from: leonair on October 31, 2023, 01:23:30 PM$200 is fine and this is a good amount but a personal of a person if more valuable then $200. yes i believe stake.com is a big company and a reputable casino site However kyc is risky and when someone done kycs with his documents for other person then it is more risky.You are a newbie so how a person Trust you that after complete kyc you will pay him $200 where you has the full control of email so you can withdraw that full $1k.

Do you know that Stake does condone multiple accounts? Why do you have multiple Stake accounts? And how did you think continued verification would solve your problem?I think your concern and suggested solution are so out of place as you never told anyone whether or not you contacted Stake in this regard. Also, it's their representatives that should be able to advise you better. Did they tell you to identify yourself more or what?A little more information about this might be of help since I don't know how possibly anyone could help you verify your account better than you.",

It's always recommend to read the T&C of a casino before doing any gambling activities on their site and you broke their T&C which resulted in your account getting banned. Is it Stake's right to withhold the money from the banned account though? That's not the way it should be right if yes is the answer to my question because that's basically stealing someone's money with just extra steps. Now I don't care about the T and Cs of any casinos but wouldn't someone be able to take out their money without any problems? Can someone explain to me why casinos get away with this horrible practice and how is this a justified thing to do to people because that's still money stucked in a banned account. Make me understand why that horrible practice is a thing.",
