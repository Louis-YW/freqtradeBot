Also the 0.236 rarely plays out, it’s mostly the 0.382 and 0.618 and sometimes the 0.50Where we are now is a good area because it’s the 30000 psychological number.",

Also, I know 0.236 doesn't play, I never said anything about it.Was asking if we going 0.382 and bounce back or 0.5.",

I can say that it looks like it is at a critical support level and will either bounce to new highs or retest the previous support level, which appears to be quite low.",

If we think that it repeats the history, I can't tell that but I believe it won't happen again whether we like it or not, it remains unpredictable and we never where it goes exactly. We can project and draw a line to what is possible to happen but we never expect the market will follow in that direction. it was a headache if we check the market always...",
