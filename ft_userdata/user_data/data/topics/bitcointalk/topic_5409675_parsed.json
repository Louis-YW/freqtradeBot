And just like the news in the test net alone, it had a good impact in the price isn't it, we've reach as high as $1900 and probably be moving positive as well. So this is my prediction and hopefully we can reach $2k and sustain the run till next month.",

I think it will hit $2k and maybe go a little further to $2.3k-2.5k$. But after the event is over, it is not clear if ethereum will be able to maintain this momentum or will correct after that as surely many investors will take profits soon after, who bought bitcoins at the price below 1k dollars for the most recent low.",

I'm still wondering about this, isn't this a degradation for network security on Ethereum itself?, If it will degrade network security, it shouldn't have any hype and will have a bad impact on the price.",

I understand how it is difficult for Ethereum especially since there are billions of funds running on the Ethereum network, they must be careful.Speaking of the price, I believe yes, there's a huge spike for sure for this update, either pump or dump, because we still don't know how the update will go.",

That's also my rough estimates, any price above $2k will show success of the merger. I doubt though that $3k is possible, remember that we are still in the bear market and investors are going to be reluctant and maybe just looking for short term profit because of this activity.So let's see a $2.3k and then we will speculate if it can maintain that price, or most likely it won't and the price bouncing back down to around $2k.",

Bitcoin has risen only a little over 6 percent during this time. It is even possible that ethereum is now giving impetus to the growth of the entire market. It is predicted that by the end of this month, the price of ethereum may rise to $2,500. However, there will be an adjustment after the network merge. Even Buterin claims about the correction of ethereum. But anyway, better times are waiting for this coin.",

Look at the price now. It has been going up very fast and much more than that of bitcoin. It is because people are actually buying the rumor. Everyone is hoping and knows that others are also going to buy the rumor, hence they all are stocking up causing the price to go up. Once the merge take place and sell the news! Those who filled their bags earlier will want to take the profit and hence sell most of the Ethereum they have been holding causing the price to go down and go then through a correction stage!",

At the moment it seems like the price is consolidating slightly below the 2000$ mark, which is a big psychological barrier. I don't know if we will see more price pumps of ETH like this one, because the impact of that news is already gone now obviously.If the merge will successfully happen on the date that they have announced and if afterwards everything works as planned also brings the benefits that every user of Ethereum is waiting for, like lower gas fees, then i think the overall trend for ETH is definitely upwards.",
