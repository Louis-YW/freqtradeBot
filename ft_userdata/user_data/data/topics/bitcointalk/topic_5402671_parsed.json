  "content": "I am sure many of you have heard about the drama between MilkZ and Koil on this now locked thread. A summary of what happened is best provided by MilkZ himself:QuoteI have traded this user gift cards for a decent amount of time.  He goes first, no issues there.  We have not had a new trade for a while now because of my refusal to provide him positive trust.  As you can see he is VERY butthurt about it.Shortly afterwards, Koil was tagged by several DT users including myself.This flag is not so much about his trust begging as it is about his abuse and slander.Over the past two days, I have received very hateful PMs from this user (which I have subsequently reported) simply for tagging him for begging for trust which shall now be published here (it is strange that this user is now temp. banned yet for these remarks):#1:Quote from: Koil on June 13, 2022, 10:59:25 AMI never ever beg for any positive trust you blind autistic muslim nigger#2:Quote from: Koil on June 14, 2022, 07:27:33 PMkill yourself nigger  all of you are scamming scumbags:)Now I have a partiularly thick skin, but these unsolicited messages dropping into my mailbox every day are making me tired, so I blocked this guy from my PMs.I would like to emphasis that I had no correspondence on my part to Koil, and these were the only two messages exchanged.Link to flagProfile of flagged user",
