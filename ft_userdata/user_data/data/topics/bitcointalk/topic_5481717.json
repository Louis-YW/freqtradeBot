BlackRock CEO Larry Fink calls bitcoin an ‘index of money laundering’In 2023, on June, BlackRock filed for a Bitcoin Spot ETF.In 2024, he said.BlackRock’s Larry Fink says bitcoin ETFs are just the first step in the technological revolution of financeBitcoin is an asset class that protects you.When Jamie Dimon has enough brave to do the same?Bitcoin Spot ETFs approved, Bitcoin is not fraud. Where is Jamie Dimon?.It seems to take more time for Jamie Dimon to do so because he more regularly and aggressively talked about Bitcoin in the past. It's hard for him to change his statement publicly as it is like his public admit on his wrong thinking.Same for Peter Schiff.",

      "body": "This is often the case when a new technology is introduced. Especially when it happens in the financial sector where a lot of money, influence, and power are involved, it is understandable for those who primarily benefit from the status quo to resist. These people's criticisms are born out of being disrupted or even threatened. But once they will adjust to it, that they and the existence of their money-making machines are not necessarily threatened, they could embrace it. Once they realize that they could even make more wealth from it, they might join. Finally, if they realize that it is after all inevitable, they've got no choice but to adopt it.",

Maybe as someone who has resigned himself to what is happening now requires a change in belief. Not because they were forced to but they admitted that what they had done in the past had expired while Bitcoin was still holding up more than they thought.Actually I don't really follow what Jamie Dimon often says, his bullshi* isn't very useful. Maybe Jamie wants to be the rare person who continues to defend his argument even though in his heart he admits it.",

It means that back then he wasn't sure that Bitcoin could be a profitable asset for his fund but now he understands that Bitcoin is not only profitable for his fund but in fact a game changer in the world of technological revolution. Many ignorant people still consider Bitcoin as a scam but with the passage of time they will understand that whatever they were thinking about Bitcoin was totally wrong and they will regret for their ignorance. In starting many people considered Bitcoin as another Ponzi scheme now they all have huge holdings of Bitcoin. That's why they say that people change their minds when they understand the truth.",

No admiration on those people at any level.Even their way of adoption is questionable. They are now supporters of Bitcoin but in a unique way. Unique in the sense that they are not actually trying to push for Bitcoin's adoption as what Bitcoin truly is. They're pushing for Bitcoin's adoption as something else. Although they are not the ones who started it all. They're riding on it without necessarily believing in Bitcoin's essence. They don't share Bitcoin's most fundamental advocacy and spirit. Larry Fink for example doesn't believe in Bitcoin as a currency. He doesn't support it either. So why is he joining the community? It's because he can make money out of it. It's because he sees it as a new and rising technology that he can play with, that people can speculate on.",

No admiration on those people at any level.People could change the perception they have about a particular product. I am sure there are things you never believed in a few years ago that you find worthy currently. Also, these people are businessmen who focus on profit maximization, therefore they will be motivated to invest in any sector they think will give them high returns. The Bitcoin space is big enough to accommodate everyone interested and they are free to join. Some of them might have started investing in Bitcoin secretly like we saw in the case of Warren Buffett where a bank that he is the major shareholder invested heavily in crypto. The Oracle of Omaha claimed that he would never buy Bitcoin even if the price drops to $25 but it was revealed that Nubank in making so much profit from cryptocurency Investments.

A hack or any other negative occurrence will propel people to seek alternatives and self-custody is the only solution. I don't pray for such a hack because it will have adverse consequences on the market. Many people might lose their funds which will affect families negatively. However such negative occurrences are some of the ways of bringing organic Bitcoin awareness.",
