It is good having you here. Your platform seems more like a web wallet option and you are in possession of wallet private keys of account holders on your platform  which I do not think is feasible with me. I checked your website and found out no details about your license. From the settings of your project, it looks more of you likely conducting kyc in the nearest future why not state it clear about your kyc policy so that potential customers would see what they are signing up for so as to avoid having issues in the later. I am saying this as I have gotten lots of experience on this issue of kyc and lots where by a project from onset would state being kyc free but upon deposit of funds, they claim the transaction to be suspicious and fraudulent and start demanding for kyc documents and lots more which is not part of the whole terms and conditions when registering on the platform.I stumbled upon this \"To provide the Services, we may share information about you and your Coinremitter account with third parties. All the information that can be shared is what you give us while creating a coinremitter merchant account. There is always certain risk attached to it so kindly read our Disclaimer & Risk Warning\" and who are these third parties you are talking about why not state it clear so that we may know rather than keeping it a secret. Let us know who the third parties are.And lastly who are the team members behind this project?",
