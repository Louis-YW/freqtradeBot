Bitcoin transactions are irreversible The only thing you can do now is to avoid sending any more fund to your wallet and as mentioned above, format your computer and install a fresh operating system. Take note that if you want to be completely secure in the future, you should install electrum on air-gapped device. If you can't do that for any reason, it's recommended to use a hardware wallet.",

If the wallet was created with Electrum version below 3.4.4 and it's currently installed in your device or PC then it will give you the notice to download the latest version with a link if you updated it using the link it will lead you to a phishing site and then if you downloaded and installed it in your device/PC then your wallet is already compromised. Electrum.org remove the warning but a few months ago you can see this warning below on their website. Code:Warning: Electrum versions older than 3.3.4 are susceptible to phishing. Do not download Electrum from another source than electrum.org, and learn to verify GPG signatures.So before you install Electrum or update it make sure you always verify the Electrum to make sure you have the original Electrum installer. There are many people who suffer from this a year ago so be careful with any phishing sites. About your current case if the transaction is still unconfirmed yet I think you can double spend the transaction and transfer it to your new wallet.",

Therefore, even if the transaction in the question has been made with the fee rate of 1 sat/vbyte, it has been surely confirmed and there is no way to double spend it. Also, it was mentioned in the OP that both transactions (the one made by OP and the one made by the hacker/thief) have been confirmed.",

Now both are fully confirmed and i kinda dont know what to do.This sounds a lot like the behavior of that malicious version of Electrum that plagued the community around the end of 2018.  Do you remember from where you downloaded Electrum?  I'm not going to ask you to disclose any information you want to keep private, but I'm curious if you would be willing to share the address to where you coins were sent?  No big deal if not, if my suspicion is accurate, the coins probably just moved from there to a mixing service, anyway.I also encourage you to heed LoyceV's warnings and advice; back up what you need from the device, then purge the OS and reinstall it.  I also suggest that you read this post before installing Electrum again.[GUIDE] How to Safely Download and Verify Electrum [Guide]",

The two transactions:Code:ddcfe5fd98cf4418c926b0d9b61b8fdcc85f0034614b3c1a5530a7c821b357ab1d7e75d00847a550983185c6cd3ceb011f5ad5daefd81f62f38fef061482ff00were both mined/included in the same block (754092). You can look that up on mempool.space. No 10 min difference.Of course then that they have both same timestamp, as DireWolfM14 said.And this is usually automatic.Still, manually made transaction should not be ruled out, since one could have been notified when the tx was sent and not at the moment of getting confirmed, allowing (giving time) somebody spend the unconfirmed input (I expect the scripts work exactly the same, just faster), which will have the same result: both tx in the same block.",
