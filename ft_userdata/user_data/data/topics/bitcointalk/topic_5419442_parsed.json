I just do not think that anything bad could happen in the crypto world that would be crashing the prices anymore.Whatever suppose to happen in the bad ways already happened and crashed the price, from here on out it is going to be just pure profit.

They're market makers and movers and they know exactly when to sell and to buy. They are even used as market indicators if they've got something to say or give a hint to the market.And that's why when they're starting to do that, a massive sell-off happens when some sort of words have been said to make the people panic which is leading everyone to sell in a panic mode. While we're still in a bear market, we should have that plan that we must do something while we're still here because a bigger chance that might occur in the future that we'll never comeback again to this moment.",

Don't lose your hope just yet, there is nothing that guarantees that ethereum won't be 2k by the end of this month. I mean there is nothing that can stop it from being there. This is why I believe that we should not be too much risking at the current moment. I know that it’s going to be as decent as it gets, and there is a good chance it could be recovered, but we should not be really caring about the current situation, just focus on what you can do at the current moment and focus on that, buy as much as you can and hold.",
