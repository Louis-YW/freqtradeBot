Written by Andreas Antonopoulos, it is available online here:https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch09.asciidoc#merkle-treesQuoteMerkle TreesEach block in the Bitcoin blockchain contains a summary of all the transactions in the block using a merkle tree.A merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure used for efficiently summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data. Merkle trees are binary trees containing cryptographic hashes. The term \"tree\" is used in computer science to describe a branching data structure, but these trees are usually displayed upside down with the \"root\" at the top and the \"leaves\" at the bottom of a diagram, as you will see in the examples that follow.",
