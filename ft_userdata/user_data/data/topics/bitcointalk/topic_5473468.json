  "content": "Hi everyone.We can all agree that the starting of this year 2023 has been extremely good for Bitcoin and a few other Cryptocurrencies unlike last year 2022 that Bitcoin had an epileptic run and was literally struggling, making lots of people think twice about still choosing Bitcoin as their choice of investment.I remember being in a Facebook group where people were debating if Bitcoin would ever recover or if that was in fact the end of the world biggest Cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Inasmuch as I've witnessed similar events in the past years where Bitcoin walked down this same path I still couldn't help but have the thought \"WHAT IF\" What if this is actually the end of Bitcoin?What if I'm making the wrong choice still investing in Bitcoin?What if this, what if that...And honestly the Negative Vibes and tension in the air weren't really helping at all, but it appears as we all see now that Bitcoin has indeed recovered and taking a good turn now.So that brings me to the big question considering the current acceleration at which Bitcoin has attained.What will happen by the end of the Year? of course it's just a few weeks before the year runs out. Will Bitcoin ever rise again in the bottom weeks of the year? Or, will it crash just like in 2022? These are the big questions. I believe there's no way I'm the only one having these questions in my mind.Despite the acceleration Bitcoin has taken, we cannot elude the fact that Bitcoin in the past few months has been under pressure due to the high level of inflation that's hit emerging economies such as the US and other countries.And from what I learned the U.S. Federal Reserve has hiked the interest rates with a 25-basis point to tackle inflation issues.Although this isn't the first time Bitcoin is experiencing this kind of pressure, it happens almost all the time. So please I'd really need your contributions and ideas on what you feel or think would be the outcome of Bitcoin the remaining weeks of this year and most importantly, what would the new year have installed for Bitcoin?",

It is an opportunity to easily double your investment.I do not want to be too optimistic and tell you that the price will be above 100 thousand, but in every investment, base your profits on what is expected by a large percentage.",

I don't know when SEC will approve a first Bitcoin Spot ETF in their nation but logically, with approved Bitcoin Futures ETFs, they have no reason to refuse Bitcoin Spot ETFs.I know one more thing, a Bitcoin halving will come next year in April and Bitcoin will have a bull run with a halving. History will be repeated again and halving is a good catalyst for a bull run.",

I've been scared or worried a few times about Bitcoin but the reason I was worried was not \"what if this is the end for Bitcoin\". It was more of a \"how long will it take for Bitcoin to go up again\". I believe Bitcoin will always appreciate, it's the time that gets me worried. This makes me start asking questions like \"what if we don't experience another bull run in another 5,6,7 or even 10 years?\"But I've come to realize that, that's just my emotions talking. I still have those thoughts and emotions but they don't bother me like they used to. Quote from: Gormicsta on November 09, 2023, 10:41:39 AMAlthough this isn't the first time Bitcoin is experiencing this kind of pressure, it happens almost all the time. So please I'd really need your contributions and ideas on what you feel or think would be the outcome of Bitcoin the remaining weeks of this year and most importantly, what would the new year have installed for Bitcoin?The whole of the year I've maintained speculation that Bitcoin would get to $35k-$40k this year. Bitcoin is on $36k now so I guess I was right. Right now I'm going to be more bullish and speculate that Bitcoin would get to $40k before the end of the year. (Please don't make a financial decision or any decision at all based on my speculation. I won't be responsible for any losses  ) Before you agree with me please do your research and have a basis for your conclusions. With Bitcoin halving coming up next year I'm very bullish with my speculations of next year. If we're lucky we might see a new ATH next year. Next year would be a very good year for Bitcoin. It's going to be way better than this year. And one thing I've noticed about Bitcoin is that it's kind of like grows a thick skin with time. The economic situation that could make it drop to $10k in the past doesn't affect it much anymore. If something similar to FTX happens again, Bitcoin won't be as bearish as it was the last time. I guess this means it's gaining more trust among Bitcoiners.",

While it's impossible to predict the future, Bitcoin's resilience over the years suggests that it has the potential to recover from various challenges.Factors like inflation and interest rate hikes can affect the market, but Bitcoin has shown its ability to adapt and recover. It's crucial to stay informed, diversify your investments, and set realistic expectations. Always do your research and consider your risk tolerance.As for 2023, it's a dynamic space, and we can hope for the best while being prepared for fluctuations.

The Bible even states that your heart would be wherever your money or fortune is.You would concur with me that developing this kind of trust requires a high level of experience, therefore I imagine that when new bitcoiners read your comment in this scenario, they would say, \"Easier said than done.\"",

On this ground, Bitcoin have never had a better future than it is looking now: the growing awareness, the ever-increasing interest by big investors (probably through Bitcoin ETF) and Bitcoin halving billed to happen next year are all indicators of a beautiful future for Bitcoin. If rumors of ETF approval can cause the price of Bitcoin to soar as we are seeing of recent, imagine what will happen when the ETF finally get approved followed by the halving; this will mark a historic moment for Bitcoin.Furthermore, from the perspective of usage, Bitcoin have an amazing future. Following the legalization of Bitcoin by El Salvador and Central African Republic, many countries will surely follow that direction when they see the transformative impact of Bitcoin in those two countries. This will indeed lead to many innovations and startups cum used cases for Bitcoin. In conclusion, even when we cannot accurately predict the price of Bitcoin in the future, there are high chances that Bitcoin will continue to break new grounds while offering revolutionary opportunities and solution to people and businesses.",
