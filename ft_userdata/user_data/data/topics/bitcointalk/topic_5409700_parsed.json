But I 'd bet that most of the ATM in Australia would required KYC maybe due to your country's crypto regulation.Alternatively, you can buy bitcoin with P2P exchanges without KYC.- https://bisq.network/- https://hodlhodl.com/[1] https://coinatmradar.com/country/13/bitcoin-atm-australia/",

See here: https://coinatmradar.com/country/13/bitcoin-atm-australia/The best thing to do is to click through the ATMs at the location of your choice and look at the individual KYC requirements. These are listed on CoinATMRadar, see here:Source: https://coinatmradar.com/bitcoin_atm/54229/bitcoin-atm-general-bytes-brisbane-vapecloud-at-aspley/There might be some ATMs without any requirements.

Are there any that don't for the privacy freaks out there?I don't think Bitcoin ATM's are the best option for privacy if you want to exchange Bitcoin for fiat currencies, cameras are recording everything so they probably know your identity.I am not sure what locations are not asking for kyc verifications in Australia, so you would have to go and manually verify yourself because rules can change quickly.Best option for me is using decentralized exchanges like Bisq or p2p trading websites like LocalCryptos.Other members posted about Coinatmradar before, so I would only add few more websites you can check for Bitcon ATM's:https://coinmap.org/https://paxful.com/atm/locationshttps://www.coinatmfinder.com/bitcoin-atm-location/Australia",

More and more regulators want ID / KYC for these things. Why upset the regulators? Yes, you might loose a few customers, but dealing with issues or loosing the ability to operate the machines will cost you more.Not saying it's good just that it is.....-Dave",

Will they then intercept you on the street and ask you to hand over your smartphone, or will they follow you to your house/apartment and plan a burglary/physical attack or something else (blackmail) remains a question that everyone should ask themselves.",

They even used to have daily sell limits of 10k euros (without verification).I did manage to buy some BTC in ONE ATM in March this year though, just to try. Only 20 euros just for fun, and it didn't ask for ID, not sure if that was a limit threshold or because the ATM was a private access one. As Pharmacist points out, though, one must assume the camera is filming you.",

There are a lot of small groups out there that even if they don't have regular meetings do meet enough that if you are not in a rush you can probably find someone to buy from for cash.Not anonymous since it is F2F but it's a thought.One of many sites for people to find people with similar interestshttps://www.meetup.com/topics/bitcoin/-Dave",
