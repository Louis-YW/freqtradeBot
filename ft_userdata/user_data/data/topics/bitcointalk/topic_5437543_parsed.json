What might be the smart solution?If you want to save some Bitcoin for your children you don't need to create any accounts that are centralized controlled.All you need is to have your own Bitcoin wallet and seed words that are held in secure place, use hardware wallets, and than you can add additional wallets for your children.THis can be done simple with separate passphrase for each child, so they would need to have two things to recover their keys.First part is your seed words (that is the same for all children) and second part is separate passphrase known only to them.If you want to make everything extra secure than you can create multisig setup with your children.",

I always said here this valuable rule for storing your Bitcoin, \"Not your keys Not your coins\".",

Does that sound sensible?Trading Altcoins is way too risky than bitcoin not to talk of having them as saving. No matter where they stand at on the altcoin log now some of them wouldn’t last 5 more years. Terra Luna looked promising than some we had now but you saw what happened imagine some sort of that happening to any of your picked Altcoin. Stick to bitcoin or I would rather say do your research but don’t gamble on the children savings if truly that’s your aim of saving this funds",

Namely, create a wallet in electrum (after taking care not to compromise the key) and keep several copies of the btc address for receiving. Of course, write down the seed-phrase and save it in a safe place, and uninstall electrum wallet and all related files.To the extent necessary, send money to this btc address and accumulate it there. When the time is right, just give the seed phrase to your child.Also, I agree with Upgrade00 that one can't do without teaching the child (at least) the basics of bitcoin.

Because it means dealing with centralized platforms or DEFI, both of which have high chance of being scams or simply failing because they are not sustainable. Also \"crypto\" itself is not a good long-term investment that can last 18 years. Because the lifecycle of an average altcoin is just 2-3 years. And even high profile \"good projects\" like Ethereum lack the fundamentals that could inspire confidence in their long-term survival.So buy Bitcoin and hold it yourself, and when you child is ready, teach them how to use it and transfer the coins to them.",
