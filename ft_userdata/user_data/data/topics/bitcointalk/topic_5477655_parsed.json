  "content": "At first I thought by looking at my profile page, and finding the online column, this is interesting, I thought if I could see some people who were active (notif on) it would certainly make it easier, for example in a list like social media There is no fundamental interest, just my thoughts, worth searching for example https://ninjastic.space/search maybe it will be easy to see other contributors who are actively online, a nice thing, I think there are third party websites that are able to do this.Different functions indeed, because bitcointalk forum can reply anytime and free active, good quality threads including meeting community standards.I just like to think out of the box, if you don't find it don't take it too seriously, it's just fun.",
