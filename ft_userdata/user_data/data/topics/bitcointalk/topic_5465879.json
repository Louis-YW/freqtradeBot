  "content": "with 'compact block filters' another topic follows today, for which i would like to create and open this thread. as usual, i would also like to upload the corresponding slides and present them to you.this proposal with the tag (bip158) was created on 2017-05-24 and if i am not mistaken only implemented in november 2019 in the Bitcoin core 0.19 versionbip158 was the replacement for the 'bloom filters' (bip37), which were disabled in the same bc 0.19 release.QuoteThis BIP describes a structure for compact filters on block data, for use in the BIP 157 light client protocol[1]. The filter construction proposed is an alternative to Bloom filters, as used in BIP 37, that minimizes filter size by using Golomb-Rice coding for compression. This document specifies one initial filter type based on this construction that enables basic wallets and applications with more advanced smart contracts.https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0158.mediawiki  https://twitter.com/BTCillustrated",

      "body": "Good topic.  Although I recommend everyone run their own fully validating node, filtered nodes are at least the right way to do a light client.  Privacy can be improved even further by using a different Tor identity to download each block from the P2P network so serving nodes cannot build a list of blocks a particular entity is interested in (even if that list includes false positives).",

      "body": "Great work cygan. You should make a thread wherein you list every single of these animated slides. Compact block filters is the private way to go for the average user. It neither takes much time to synchronize. But, I have a question: do we have any data suggesting that the full node can de-anonymize the user the more the blocks they request? Or perhaps there is lack of privacy protection when the user's transaction is included in a block with very few transactions? I presume that for the former, if you request more blocks, the full node could analyze transactions that share blockchain connection.",

Your title should include the words \"for Light Clients\" to avoid that confusion.",

The user can then retrieve the filter for a specific block using the new getblockfilter RPC. Filters for the entire block chain currently use about 4 gigabytes.",

But, AFAIK, so far, only Wasabi takes advantage of  compact block filters when working in turbosynch mode. Correct me if I'm wrong and there are other light clients that use such BIP 158 technique.",
