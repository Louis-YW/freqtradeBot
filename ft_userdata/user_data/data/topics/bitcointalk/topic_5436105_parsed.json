But if you can not pump the fee, just wait, it is weekend already, expect the transaction to be confirmed. Even 1 sat/byte transactions still get confirmed during the recent weekdays but it can take long, just be patient.",

If you're in a rush, see if you can increase the fee (RBF), or send your change again with a higher fee (CPFP).Look at jochen-hoenicke.de for a fee-graph. For next time: if you would have paid 1.050 sat/vByte, your transaction gets priority over the ones who pay the absolute minimum (and it would have been confirmed already).",

Fuck this nigger coin, last time im using this shit You paid only $0.03 worth of bitcoin for your transaction. If you had set the fee rate to 3 sat/vbyte, your transaction would have been confirmed with less than $0.1 worth of bitcoin by now. You can get the first confirmation in many altcoins transactions much faster. But they need much more confirmations to be considered as final. What wallet did you use? Are you the sender or the receiver? As mentioned by LoyceV above, you may be able to accelerate the transaction using RBF or CPFP.",

You didn't pay 10$ for it and neither do we require to pay that much fee now with native segwit integration.Did your transaction get confirmed ? If you dont know how to accelerate, post your txid here or here and someone might help you speed up the process. And next time if you are in a hurry, pay a bit higher fee (most self custodial wallets will suggest you a recommended fee by default).",

      "body": "Although it is not common but when speaking of transaction confirmation it is a good idea to do a quick check of the transaction parents (or inputs) to see if they are confirmed or not. Sometimes you may pay the high priority fee but not see any confirmation because the parent is paying a very low fee and that is delaying the confirmation. In cases like this, you either have to wait or use what is called CPFP (Child Pays For Parent) which is where you increase your transaction's fee enough to cover the cost of both your transaction and the parent's fee difference to reach high priority level.",

Fuck this nigger coin, last time im using this shit  You will be sorely missed. Learn how the coin works before you use it. That's what an intelligent person would do. Understand what the mempool is and what happens when you broadcast a transaction. After that, read how a transaction is confirmed and which ones have priority over the others. To put it in a language that you understand: pay more than the minimum fee you cheap motherfucker if you want a quick confirmation, or sit your ass down and wait.",

There is no such thing as a transaction accelerator unless you have your own mining pool.As for the TX you mentioned, it was mined in block 762319 and it had a fee rate of 19.9 sat/vB .This transaction:https://mempool.space/tx/47481a61031dba23ab99cd6f87f0eedd4c50735543410c4b570d9c8589ff0d1dwas confirmed in the same block and it paid 17.0 sat/vB.So the tx didn't get confirmed by some accelerator, it got confirmed simply because the fee was enough to be included in the next block and just six blocks down the road in 762325 transactions with 1sat/b got confirmed.",

Of course, but that's why I was saying you need a mining pool, you can only claim you can accelerate that for sure if you have the means to actually got it confirmed. What most of those guys who pray on newbies tipping them for the \"accelerating\" do is exactly that, go to ViaBtc and try to get into the free slots every hour, they are basically doing just what the user could have also but even so nobody can guarantee they would be able to submit even one each hour when there are a hundred doing so.Lucius was doing this for free for a while, but he was open about what he was doing not claiming like others he has some hidden methods.",
