You create a thread for Newbies and Jr. Members to give them loan which is abnormal in the forum because at that level the users have not been reorganized in the forum very well and you want to provide services to those category of user which is also a suspicious move. But the part that bothered me the most is the part you are asking for donations for lending business. Who does that, that means you are not well prepared for the business because to deceive them. Because if you are ready for the business at least the capital to start the business must be there.",

This is an alt account of one of the Loan spammers, rejected many times & negatively tagged, so now he is trying to prove that someone trusts every Newbie.Just look at this, in which a fairy tale Lender is asking for donations, under the pretext of continuing with his service, while not realizing a single loan. Just another additional reason to consider the introduction of restrictions, Newbies cannot open new topics in the Lending section. It is simply pointless and futile because it will never happen.Quote from: Loansik12 on May 28, 2023, 09:05:04 PMIf u like my business donate to me to continue my loan service  my btc address : 1Nzx9Rmo1X4U1BDw3koykgpEnMnHPSX9RJ",
