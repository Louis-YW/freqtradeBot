  "content": "Hey guys, i'm looking to dive into Bitcoin mining but i'm having a bit of a tough time getting the last bits of information I need before pulling the trigger on a purchase. I've done my best to research this myself but I was hoping you could help me out with some final questions The miner will have free solar + very cheap grid electricity but regular power cuts, so I was wondering if anyone had experience with the miner switching off at least once per day for a few hours. The environment will also be quite high humidity. Will this make my project completely unfeasible, or can Antminers handle this? If so i'm looking at the S19 XP, but am looking to install some custom water plates and pump radiator/fan like these:https://www.lianliwork.com/products_detail/39.htmlhttps://www.zeusbtc.com/ASIC-Miner-Repair/Parts-Tools-Details.asp?ID=2316This is for 2 reasons, firstly the miner will be in a hot store room (30-35 degrees C) with no Aircon, and secondly to reduce the noise level down from 80+ decibel to around 60.I was originally looking at getting a S19JPro+ for this, however the water cooling boards available online all seem to be for the S19JPro or S19Pro. The companies above said they could make me a custom cooling board, but reading this forum that seems to be a bad idea as the S19JPro+ has individual soldered on heat sinks:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5449809.msg62158269#msg62158269So I'm also wondering if the S19 XP has individual soldered heat sinks, or if it has bolted heat sinks which can be easily updated to custom water cooling boards?",

[...]It is not that simple:For the longevity of the miner, it is better to have it shut down when it is cooled a bit. For that, the fans should run while the hashboards stop mining. You can use the \"Sleep\" or \"Standby\" mode on some miners. Although everyone will tell you, it does not matter - and they are right in general. Physically you will do your miners good, I can not tell you how big of a factor it is.I have experience in regular blackouts. You need to make sure that the miners do not get overcurrent. In my area sometimes the power goes on and off several times in seconds before it comes back. That fried several miner until I installed a switch, that keeps them off until you physically turn them on again, once the energy is safe again. So the message for you here should be, that you make sure your miners only get \"good\" power.Humidity is a problem, but it is more of a problem, when your ambient is cold and it condensates. I often have high humidity, but if the miners run and are hot and the ambient inside the room or chamber or whereever they are is hot, it should not be a problem. In your case, if you have them run with solar and they turn off in the evening, it might get cold over night and there might be condesate in your miners in the morning, if your ambient is too low. You can prevent this by having e.g. a miner run permanently to heat the ambient a bit. I would install a humidity sensor to check, so you can find a good solution for this.Regarding the heatsinks: I am courious, too. I have S19XP incoming.",

      "body": "I'm not entirely sure about the miner switching off during power cuts, but it's worth noting that Antminers are generally built to handle high humidity environments. However, you may want to look into getting a backup power supply to ensure uninterrupted mining.Regarding the S19 XP, I believe it has individual soldered heat sinks, which may make it more difficult to install custom water cooling boards. You could potentially look into other models that have bolted heat sinks, such as the S19 Pro, to make installation easier.Also, keep in mind that custom modifications can potentially void the manufacturer's warranty, so proceed with caution. Good luck with your mining project!",

      "body": "So many details that I will try to summarize, the S19 XP comes with 2 large bolted heatsinks,  regular power cuts are not good for miners, humidity is worse than heat and can really kill your miners.the water plates are a tough route, why not use immersion cooling instead? Have you looked into it? it would be a lot easier to do than water cooling, and nowadays, they sell those plug-n-play tanks which would make life a lot easier for you.",

I think if I was building a small farm the immersion cooling would make sense. For example the water cooling plates + radiator is about $500. For 4 miners it would be $2000. An immersion tank for 4 miners is $1700, but I couldn't find an immersion cooling kit for a single miner close to $500. Do you have a specific product in mind? I'm interested to learn but my Google Fu is failing on this",

If you switch them off locally, it is not a problem. Damages are possible, when they cut power on the whole line. Or on a general blackout.",

Or on a general blackout.Thank you Andartis, and for your post above. I should have clarified earlier but solar system has an MPPT inverter, so the miner will be behind that to protect it from any grid based power surges.The risk is that the miner with the rest of my house sometimes causes a breaker to trip, so I’m looking to install a load shedding relay/breaker for the miner, which will trip to protect the house. At the moment I’m trying to figure out how to either automatically turn a this relay/breaker back on after a certain amount of time.When you say if you switch them off locally, I was under the impression they didn’t have an on/off switch, you just unplugged them? So would a load shedding breaker tripping be a safe off method for a miner?",

As long as there is no sudden peak in current to the miners it should be fine.",
