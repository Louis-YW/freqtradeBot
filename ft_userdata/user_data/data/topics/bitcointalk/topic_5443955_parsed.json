Is it important? Yeah. As it gives you the motivation to do more. But mind you, in your search for merits while you post, ensure to be open to criticism as this helps you grow. To the b part of your question: yeah, you def need to interact more. (Intelligently, if I might add) as this helps to broaden your horizons and makes for more room to research and do better.",

Merit is needed to progress in the rank ladder, nothing more.Now higher ranks are able to join signature campaigns with higher pay so it ends up being a merit-hunting game for many users on this forum. After all who does not want some coins from discussions in this forum?Do read old threads, post regularly, solving problems and helping others, you will eventually gather enough merits to grow your account's rank. Obviously the merit sources are biased towards older users, but you can become a \"newbie of the month\" too.",

First you have to understand what you are good at, develop more on it and then start helping people solve their problems.
