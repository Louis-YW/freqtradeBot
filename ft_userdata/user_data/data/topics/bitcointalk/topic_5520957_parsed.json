He takes risk, he is determinant with his investment vision and plan, and most important he does not do anything wrong with other people who are outsiders of Bitcoin market.If people saw the party but by their own reasons, ignored chance to join it, it's their responsibility for their failures, not because of Michael Saylor.",

      "body": "The ones criticizing usually come from the traditional investment world, probably because Saylor keeps calling them out too. To be fair, what he’s doing is super risky, he’s going all in on Bitcoin, like converting company shares into Bitcoin, borrowing money just to buy more, basically doing everything possible to boost his stake in the Bitcoin market. But that’s his strategy, and people invested in his company because they trust his moves. And I think we we’re in the Bitcoin space too, shouldn’t we back him up? What he’s doing creates FOMO, and FOMO means a bullish market. Isn’t that exactly what we all want?",

There is nothing wrong with what they are doing [Microstratergy] but the problem arises when there is a competitor involved to create a negative atmosphere. I am assuming that this is a phase that Michael Saylor has already faced when he was questioned previously about his intentions to buy Bitcoin he said it was for the greater cause of the community and all others.He is doing what he sees best for him and his organization. He is one of the first entrepreneurs who believed in Bitcoin and now his beliefs made him one of the biggest holders of Bitcoin. Some had accumulated Bitcoin in the initial days, they are now the biggest competitors of his company as he won't be able to overthrow them with the quantity.",

But I think most are concerned that an individual/institution holds such amount of Bitcoin and in case of MSTR whose shares are based on debt leveraged. If investors starts selling their shares, they would have to start selling their holdings too. Though The impact is going to be for a short term. Not to mention, Saylor Promotes Bitcoin more as a store of value So those that still hold to the belief of Bitcoin as a medium of exchange than store of value wouldn't take positive with that .",

If not of that, why would someone who love bitcoin hate on someone who have been an integral part of the journey of the successes recorded by bitcoin. We cannot deny the fact that those buys from Microstrategy contributed in one way or the other in strengthening the mind of HODLERs and by extension, bitcoin itself. Many people also got the motivation to start investing in bitcoin massively following the successes recorded by Michael Saylor and Microstrategy.",

But I don't think anyone is bashing Michael Saylor personally. people are worried about too much of corporate cash flowing into the crypto market. Cryptocurrency should stay with the commoners like us. if corporates start buying into this market, it's just a matter of time they will gain the complete control of it. I believe that's what people are worried about. A lot of corporates are sitting on a pile of cash which they can indeed invest into various assets. Microstrategy has shown the way and there's no guarantee that other corporates will not join the bandwagon. I am sure you wouldn't like corporates controlling the majority stake of the crypto market in future.",
