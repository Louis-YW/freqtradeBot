Hope you got it in short and simple words haha. Make sure to follow my advice on bringing more questions together while creating thread it will increase your post quality as well.",

      "body": "Yes, regulation is among the key factors that affect the price of Bitcoin. The reason for this is that regulation affects the promulgation of Bitcoin adoption.  When the government regulation favors Bitcoin adoption, there will be an active adoption in that country.  And since the government is friendly, the regulation rules are also friendly.  This encourages start-ups and pro-bitcoins activity that will lead to Bitcoin adoption and this adoption will give demand to Bitcoin thus, the government regulation will affect the price of Bitcoin.",

      "body": "Maybe a bit, but we need to remember that its not the only factor neither. We are talking about just one part of it and that matters. I think its important to remember that we are at a global scale and this is a currency as well, sometimes we forget that its a currency and think of it just like its an asset, but its also a currency. This means that we are going to end up with a lot of volatility, so when one factor like this moves it up or down, another factor could make it balance and not move. Lets say a bad regulation news comes out and it will go down, then amazon may come out and say they will accept bitcoin and then price wouldn't move too much. This is why its important to remember its not just a single factor.",

Regulations by countries with bigger economy, like France or Germany could affect the price, but less than the countries like the US or China. China used to be the cause of FUD when they were regulating Bitcoin and eventually banned it, and since than the market forgot about China, but if tomorrow China announced that they embrace Bitcoin, you could expect a small bull run.",

When supply is more than demand, price drops and when the demand is higher than supply, you can expect price yo pump. Of recent, Tesla has been known to liquidate some of there bitcoin  hodlings and that been the reason behind some of the dump of recent and sadly, those who would take the bate will wish they didn't for gaming with a wealthy spaceX guy.The most regulations could do is about bitcoin's acceptance by most but somehow, bitcoin continues to gain popularity with Citizens of the world despite the many negativity which is circulated about the innovation. So yeah, its not regulation and its more of a demand and supply thing.",

Regulations are one of the reasons or key factors that affect the price of Bitcoin, we have many.Even though Bitcoin is decentralized, governments are still a factor here, especially when regulating Bitcoin.Most of the time, if there's big government involved in any bitcoin matter, price is always react, like for example announcing of banning Bitcoin on other country.",

This will the supply more than the demand,but if there is a good news on bitcoin by the government, it will encourage more people who are feeling unsafe to invest in bitcoin to adopt it. But it will only affect the price in a short run since bitcoin can recover from government regulations since no one can control the price for long. The whales can also make bitcoin price to dump just like we have seen what caused the recent price dump by the space X selling $353M worth of bitcoin.",

Price would go down because most people couldn’t hold Bitcoin and other investors wouldn’t be able to invest into crypto.If it’s a small country then nobody will care. It’s already banned in many small countries and doesn’t have an affect. But in general all of these regulations and issues with the SEC are not for crypto or bitcoin.",

      "body": "Oh yeah, of course. But this impacts the price indirectly more than directly. If the regulations are mostly inimical to Bitcoin's fundamental principles, adoption, growth, and potentials, then we'd expect the investors, business establishments, users, and other supporters to think twice. Many of them might not push through with their plans to invest or buy Bitcoin or accept it as payment. But when the regulations are in support of Bitcoin, then we can expect the adoption rate of Bitcoin to increase. Supporters would feel safe. Positive regulations boost the people's trust or perception of Bitcoin. They somehow acknowledge Bitcoin's legitimacy. They somehow assure supporters of a smooth experience. The sentiment would be bullish. That would mean money would flow in. When the regulations are negative, supporters will definitely be discouraged. But then again, with Bitcoin being decentralized, all these regulations can't actually do anything to it. The regulated Bitcoin industry would highly be affected, though.",

You can deduct that yourself just by thinking. Let me put this as simplified as i can:Ask yourself few questions:Would rules of the marketplace affect to how people behave in the marketplaces? Would fear of jail / sanctions make these people follow the rules? Would people be more inclined to buy stuff with low taxation in opposition to low taxed?Would banning some of the customers and marketplaces in general affect sales?Would people in general trust more to CEXes if they had more oversight and legal protection?Would institutional investors rather invest in regulated / serious market in cexes, rather than depositing their money to potential exit scams?Answer is yes to all of these, and they are basically same question as yours sectioned in different parts.HOW is it affecting to price depends on what the regulations are. It can be positive or negative.Imho there are more upsides with regulations than downsides, even when we are talking about just the price.",

Most of us care about our privacy and when it was regulated by the government, we gonna lost them all. But I don't think this would be the reason for stepping away from Bitcoin because, in the first place, regulations have also helped to minimize scams and fraudulent activities around.

But that won't happen anytime soon as governments are still not really friendly with bitcoin, they are still wary of it because they always think its decentralization will harm their centralized system.",

However, in my opinion, it is speculators and market participants who \"decide\" the Bitcoin exchange rate against fiat in response to regulations or news. And now, Bitcoin looks a lot like stocks and commodities.Strictly speaking, it is our needs that determine the value of bitcoin, but for demand to grow, it needs to be accepted and legalized by the government. Therefore, it can be said that regulation is the key factor determining the price of bitcoin. Bitcoin has been around for 15 years and many people know about it but many people still haven't invested or used it because they are afraid of government regulations and bans. It can be seen that regulation has a significant impact on the price of bitcoin, although many people will not believe and dislike this, it is clear that the government is the biggest barrier to bitcoin.",

Here, the factor influencing the bitcoin price is more the news background associated with the regulation it, and not the regulation itself and the actions of users (holders) of bitcoin. If they panicked after the ban in N-country and started selling btc, then this ban will indirectly affect the value of the BTC-price. It would seem that this is all nonsense, but it happens.",
