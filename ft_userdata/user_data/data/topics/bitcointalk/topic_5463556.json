Now, am sure this can be a good sign that eventually an ETF can be approved based in USA which can open up a floodgate of investments for Bitcoin - though indirect it would be. As to the concern that this ETF thing is just a tool of manipulation of financial institutions in accordance to their motive of profits, we have no choice but to just watch history unfolds right before our own very eyes.",

In 2024 or 2025 sounds like very good possibility as it is a very big news which should appear in a big bull run. We knows if history repeats, Bitcoin will have its big bull run after 2024 halving.",

Like it was meant to be disconnected from the current financial system and somehow people are busy making it part of that financial system. I don't get it.But specific people, mostly institutional investors, want to buy BTC but they don't want to own their keys, it is a risk they are taking, but maybe they feel comfortable doing it that way. One of the fundamentals of BTC is also freedom and censorship resistance, if these companies want to buy BTC and give people who want to buy from them shares instead of coins, then they can go ahead, their coins; their choice. It is almost similar to buying BTC and storing it in exchanges which a lot of people do, all of these are individual choices and errors and i don't think it makes BTC in itself any part of the current financial system.",

Why do we need ETFs, isn't this just going against the fundamentals of the Bitcoin itself? Like it was meant to be disconnected from the current financial system and somehow people are busy making it part of that financial system. I don't get it.I also don't like them, but maybe I can answer your question. People who invest in bitcoin ETF are people who usually don't do anything themselves. In case of individuals, those are people who don't manage their own wealth, but have managers to do it for them. Have you seen the movie about Madoff? He'd call people and get them to wire money to his fund just like that. -Hey man, there's an opportunity to make big money, but I need 10 million -Sure, I'll send it to you later. What's the profit? 15%? Not bad. These fund managers don't want to hold bitcoin for their clients and they know exchanges don't offer insurance, so they need a big fund to tell them it's safe to buy. If someone trusted were to offer trading and custodial services with insurance that the coins are going to be there a year later, they'd buy. Another typical client of these ETFs are companies, where the board cannot simply say that the CEO will now hold 5% of the company's funds on his personal laptop. What if he dies? Who's going to have passwords? So the obvious route is to have a trusted third party to hold it for them. At least if things go wrong they'll have someone to blame and sue for the loss.",

I doubt that these exchanges would hold bitcoins at all. Or if they would, he level of regulatory oversight would be so harsh that it would be impractical for a normal person to try to deposit their bitcoins.",

The demand for Bitcoin rose because investors believe that the approval of these applications will even trigger the bull run. That was why the postponement of the approval immediately affected the price of bitcoin. Approval of these ETFs will attract more investors to the market but it will promote centralization. It will be better for investors to buy bitcoin through conventional channels and not through untrusted middlemen. I know that the US SEC will be closely monitoring the activities and effect of the spot Bitcoin ETF on the European economy.",
