  "content": "According to world bank 1.7 billion people ranging from 200 million in China and India each, 100 million range in Pakistan and Indonesia, 45 to 65 million range in Mexico, Bangladesh, Nigeria etc. This shows that a lot of rural environments have no bank. Real estate, renting a building, is one strong marketing technique used by banks to garner customers in a place. And these stats proves that banks can't reach out to all rural environment. Bitcoin on the other hand, requires only a smart phone and internet connection  to send and receive bitcoin anywhere in the world; no buildings needed. It also opens a portal for users in high corrupt countries, 68.9% of 180 countries, to keep their funds safe. In Sudan for instance, Government once forced into people's houses to seize and destroy their treasures. Hence with 1.7 billion people staying unbanked, added to the increase of people who don't rely on banks, Bitcoin provides them with numerous options why they should use bitcoin for different purposes like sending money to relatives in different countries at a very low fee. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370892944_Bitcoin_Is_Full_of_Surprises",

And once you have that, people can send you money. And you could do your banking. You also have all the other 'bank like things' including PayPal, cash app, and so on for doing financial transactions.Do things like this exist in these other parts of the world that are undeveloped? If they do then Bitcoin / crypto is another answer it is not the answer. If they don't exist then yes Bitcoin and crypto will help these people greatly.-Dave",

Since they don't have accounts at banks, I suppose they must lack many other resources, what makes me believe internet could also be one of them.Moreover we need to know what is the educational level of those people and if they have proficiency dealing with electronical devices. As you mentioned rural areas, I think it's a valid concern, because usually such areas in third world countries don't have schools nearby or stores where they could acquire electronics.And even though they don't have access to banks, they must have access to paper money. So they are inserted on the traditional fiat system, anyway.",

There is barely anyone who uses bitcoins  and don't have any bank account. Even if there is the benefit of making transfers over long distance easily with bitcoins, not all your beneficiaries are using bitcoins yet, so they still need the banks sometimes. Bank marketers are also very hardworking, they can infiltrate these places where there are many unbanked and convince them to open up bank accounts faster than the story of bitcoin will reach them.",

The problem most of these physical entites like banks have is that having to spend on building banks, they still need to employ people to manage there and some these are challenges because it is most at times hard to get people to live in remote places like this. Other thing again is the fact that most of these rural areas hardly use the banks daily, the only go to them either monthly when they receive there salaries or wages or when they have issues. So putting in employees there would only be waste of resources by the banks.bitcoin actually solves all these issues since it doesn't need any physical entites but the problem is you need the internet service which are somewhat not available in these places or the knowledge which is needed to set up wallets or how to protect it. Also these set of people hardly trust anything that the government didn't approve, so adoption of bitcoin in these areas is still not feasible just yet.",

It’s going to take a while but mass adoption is coming, just make sure you position yourself ready. Your write-up is clear to me, however there is still a vacuum to fill about the unbanked issue; in my nation, those having a bank account represent for roughly 25% of the total population. The government is even attempting to involve them in the banking system, but they continue to deviate from it. Rural people think differently than educated people; the main reason they do not participate in the banking system is due to scammers; in my place, before you open an account, you must register for the BVN (bank verification number), which allows you to open an account with any bank of your choice. The fraudster obtains their mobile phone number and poses as a banker, asking for their information, which they will provide due to their lack of education.",

That's some unbelievable information, i am from pakistan and i do understand, many people prefer to send money to each other using phone number and ID card instead of banks, even somehow they find a cheap way to send money into Pak, without using Banks.Tbh, i think BTC and banks have direct relation with each other for example before entering into crypto verse i do not have any bank account, and when i started to earn some money and when i exchange it to tokens then i have to use bank's ATM, so for some time i used my friend's bank account, because i merely gets reward and when i do so instead of making my own bank account i prefer to choose my friend or any of my relative account.The point is, once you get involved in crypto you will make or depend on a bank unless you give highest priority to anonymity and do not want anyone to know that you are involved in crypto. And i do agree with your last statement and it was one of the main factor that convinced El-Salvador to accept BTC as Legal tender. Btc will open a lot of door for business but in my POV, for people to come in Crypto/btc they first have some knowledge of banking sector because that's how they will understand the benefits of Crypto (when they will understand drawbacks of banking sector in todays world)",
