It works simply. FIFA Fan Battle Club is a cryptocurrency platform that has its own internal FFB token. You have to apply to participate in the battle. Next, the standings will be formed and the date and time of your battle with the team of another fan club will be set. The battle will run for 4 hours. During this time, subscribers of your TG channels have to register on our website and link their crypto wallets. The team, whose fans will be more active and which will be the majority, will win the battle.Applications for the battle will be accepted from November 10, 2022.There is a great event coming up in the world of football. It‚Äôs inspired us to create our platform. During the World Cup in Qatar, we will host a campaign on our website: \"Guess the score\". The most shrewd player will receive 100 $FFB to his account.This promotion will become permanent on our website and will apply to all football matches. But the winning amount will be reviewed.Also we will add games to the metaverse: for example, ‚ÄúScore a penalty‚Äù, ‚ÄúGet a red card‚Äù. Plus there will be the integration of unique NFTs.There will also be added the ability for fans to bet on their favorite club in the FIFA Fan Battle Club tournament.üèÜToken Name: FIFA Fan Battle Token (FFB)üèÜTelegram: @FIFAFanBattle_ClubToken Address: 0xFA513749F65B6B7F2d2A0dDCc97Bd16EB1805ED3Fairlaunch Time: December 18 at 18 pm UTC ¬†- December 19 at 18 pm UTCSoft Cap: ¬†2 BNBLiquidity: 60%Liquidity Lockup Time: 365 days üü™Pinksale https://www.pinksale.finance/launchpad/0x3751AbBC854457902eD1CE72CDE145e29340Dc8d?chain=BSCüóíToken Address: https://bscscan.com/address/0x3883A20847C096b98fb0B26035a902734C49c86CüåêWebsite: https://fifafanbattle-club.comüîíAudit: https://github.com/Audit-Ace/Audits-Smart-Contracts/blob/main/_Fifa%20Fan%20Battle%20%20Audit%20Report.pdfüê¶Twitter: https://twitter.com/FIFA_FanBattle",

It is all about gambling for them, they create this type of fake project with fake teams and hope to have many victims who would fall. Without any further inquiries, it is very clear this project is not very legit and all those supposed partnerships never existed.",
