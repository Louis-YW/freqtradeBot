  "content": "Guys, Can you help me understand how you can earn crypto in Special Force Rush?. I just found out about it which is an old game I played before (FPS games) but this time it is an NFT FPS game and it is P2E as they said. This week I have been playing it for two times and I still don't get how would a person earn there. Anyone know about Special Force Rush NFT FPS Game?. It would be a great help to me if anyone knoe about it.Â  Here's their site https://sf.infinitymarket.net/. Please take note I am not one of their team members and please be careful as I don't know if it's legit or not since I have read some reviews that they have issues on their game and top up system.",
