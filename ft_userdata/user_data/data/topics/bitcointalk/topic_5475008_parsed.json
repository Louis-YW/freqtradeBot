Credit Suisse: $234 Million and USAA FSB Bank: $140 Million / Santander Bank UK: $132 Million / National Bank of Pakistan: $55 Million ...... so Crypto companies are not the only companies guilty of money laundering.... right.     \"Credit and financial institutions were fined almost USD 5bn in 2022 for anti-money laundering (AML) issues....\" Source : https://www2.deloitte.com/ro/en/pages/risk/articles/global-fines-amlcft-related-issues-increase-2022.html So they fine one Crypto company for $2B and fine Banks that were guilty of the same thing for only $5B for a whole year.... ) Is this a power play ...Coinbase vs Binance? Taking down the Chinese/Japan/Malta based company to boost the US based exchanges? ...or is this just the legitimization of the Crypto industry towards a more regulated (government controlled) industry?
