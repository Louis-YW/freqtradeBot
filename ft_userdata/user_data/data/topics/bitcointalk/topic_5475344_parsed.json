      "body": "Is there a chance to learn whether the Gambino Family still has the influence? Maybe the promotion wanted us to bet for Floyd which is very obvious that he'd win over someone who has very little experience in boxing. This is a very odd exhibition, this Gotti just wanted to fight someone who is famous but also wanted to display their mob influence. The answer to that question will probably have an effect on the result but just consider this exhibition a scam in the making. What story can you come up with before they even arrange this fight?",

This kind of exhibition match should have a handicap since Mayweather will gonna win all day long if we just compared skills of both fighter.",

The big question is can they attract sales on PPV and gates, Mayweather's performance on gates when it comes to exhibitions against lesser-known fighters is not attractive and your speculation is valid about Gotti getting the win, but will Mayweather agree to fix the match give Gotti a chance, people will doubt, Mayweather needs to protect his unblemished and he will not just just throw that record for the money.Mayweather choice of opponent is not good he should have negotiated with Pacman because this is what the people want, they want closure on their match because it's highly controversial because of Pacquiao's injury before the match.",

That drama they have made in the first fight, that wasn't enough to attract more spectators. It's obviously a mismatch, I don't know what's interesting with this fight that they even decided to put a 2nd boring fight, are they going to make another more interesting drama? LOL!",

This fight will be good to watch.",

LOL!The only threat to Mayweather here is if the mob rushes into the ring once they see Gotti is about to get KOed. But even if Floyd's one hand is tied behind him, he can still duck this guy's punches and counter to damage this man.But you gotta respect the man to make this fight happen. I don't know how much is on the table here but it looks like a distraction only to all of us. Just like Commudos organizing a Gladiator fights to distract dissatisfied citizens.",

So for sure there will be a lot of trash talking here again, even during the fight.I don't know why there is to be a rematch in the first place though, I mean having a brawl inside and even outside the arena after the fight is a disgrace. But we all know that this will generate more money as there is hype, but for boxing fans, I'm sure that they will not be interested in this kind of fight.",

Yes, going to be tricky because it doesn't make sense to have a rematch, or at least Floyd agreeing to it because of what had happened in the first fight. And if the Mafia as they used to be has power and influence in boxing as a whole, but will be the story this time?So this is obvious a money grab for both parties, not sure how much money they generate in the first fight, but it seems big that Floyd is willing to have it again and then easy $20 million for him in another exhibition. And for the Gotti's, what will be for them as a family?",

No way Floyd fights any fight only to see his unblemished record with a ding in it.  This match will be public enough to see if it was rigged or not.  My guess is Floyd will end up stopping him at some point in the match so it won't have to go to a scorecard.  Too many stats out there to give the fight away to someone who didn't win.",
