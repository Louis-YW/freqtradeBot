      "body": "I certainly do believe that after hardship comes ease. With that hardship you have a new perspective, an understanding to look forward to.That understanding with gratitude, happiness, and you can see that light through that dark tunnel. This can only be done with having an open mind and the effort it takes to get through it. Without one having that hope ease cannot be attainable.",
