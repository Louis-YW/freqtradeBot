It's your personal investment, after all, and you shouldn't have to provide evidence to strangers on the internet. Ultimately, the decision is yours, and you should do what makes you feel comfortable. Whether you choose to share or not, please don't let anyone else's comments or skepticism diminish the excitement and pride you feel about investing in your child's future.I believe that every parent should consider investing in their child's future, whether it's through Bitcoin or some other means. It's never too early to start thinking about financial planning. By the way, congratulations on the new addition to your family!",

Best wishes for your son. You will protect your wallet very carefully.And especially (OP) no one has asked you for any kind of proof that you are investing. It is your personal matter.",

I urge you to lock this thread and put the link to this topic as a reference for proof in your old post. Signing a message with your address is the best proof you can even convince people with here, or dropping your address just as Nwada001 suggested, but making that address public here is not really what I will advise you.",

No one even asked for the verification of his proof of investment. Coming up with this new thread and it's typically saying at some point that the Op is doubting his claims and as such thinks others are also having the same view... He just cast doubt on what he claims to have done, and just like you said, nothing can really prove if it's all a cooked-up story or not.Â I don't really know the motive behind why Op really created this thread, but I hope he gets it.",

We used to do some arbitrage between exchanges, but the price difference is so small.. that it was not very profitable. I worked in Africa a few years ago, when the Bitcoin price was almost $300 higher on their exchanges, than what it was on all the other exchanges, but only locals could access those exchanges.",

Those who don't believe you have a right to not believe you, but it's their problem, not yours. I'm very happy that there are such new parents that not only consider investing into their children's future, but also see Bitcoin as a viable investment option. It does make more sense to me than a classic save up of fiat which will inevitably devalue significantly, whereas Bitcoin can actually appreciate in value a lot. And even if at some point it becomes clear that Bitcoin is at the end of the road or that the value is already great, there's always an option to cash out, so the risk is truly not very high here.",
