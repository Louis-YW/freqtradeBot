  "content": "Hold on, hold on! Before you think we're scamming, please read this.So you propably heard of people selling wallet.dat files, right? And that they're fake if sold online, right? We decided to give it a shot and oh, surprise, it indeed was a scam (glad we didn't spend money).But we had already built a software to spread workload over multiple computers, allowing for faster processing time. So we thought about what we should do next, what the next step should be. So this is how we came up with the idea to use our available processing power for a good purpose. And, well, that's why you are reading this post right now!You're likely asking yourself how you can make sure you actually receive a valid password without us saying \"yoink\" and stealing it all. For that, you need to know what actually is inside of wallet.dat.Inside of the BerkelyDB of the wallet.dat is a hash (the password hash). It can, for instance, look like this:Code:$bitcoin$64$24b4a225bbf86972233aec387401b536ef1fe333fd18cf15d13e8fe1b1acfbe2$16$7363b105beaf4028$36762$2$00$2$00You can extract some values from it, in this case for instance:Code:Hash: 24b4a225bbf86972233aec387401b536ef1fe333fd18cf15d13e8fe1b1acfbe2Salt: 7363b105beaf4028Rounds: 36762 We only need the \"$bitcoin\"-hash, nothing more! So we never have access to the actual wallet.dat, which means we can't do transactions on our own.Cycling through the hash value gives us a realistic chanche to crack 8 digit passwords, even more if there is a hint from the owner. This is where we come into play.We have the processing power needed for the job, the only thing we are missing are clients. If you're interesting in being our first, then please dm us!TL;DR:- we can decrypt the passwords- we do not need access to the actual wallet for it- we do not charge upfrontIt works for basically all wallets hashcat supports",

But you should back it up soon, if the drive had windows on it then do WIN + R and type in %appdata%/Bitcoin/. Now you want to back up the folder \"wallets\" (zip it up and put it on a USB or sth).Quote from: STT on May 09, 2022, 06:10:39 PMbad phone with a battery now shaped like a golf ball almost. (...) very old version of imtoken and the OS was android 4 I think which apparently helps. Sounds doable. Never heard of the wallet software but as long as the password isn't stored as AES Hash (which I'd think is highly unlikely on an OS from 2011) but rather SHA or MD5 we should be able to recover it. Phone will likely run without battery too, but I'd back up all data ASAP.Both sound possible, so I'm looking forward to your dm!",
