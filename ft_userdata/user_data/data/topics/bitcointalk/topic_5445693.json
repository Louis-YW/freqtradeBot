  "content": "There is been low demands in the technological core about bitcoin wallets because people felt the price has not being well doing over time. I wants you to understand that the big banks and entrepreneurs are profits oriented ventures, that's why nobody wants to keep their money in bitcoin at this period of its lapses. The demands in bitcoin is really low in figures but not in values since no big investor's are pushing their money into bitcoin but when this saga is over the same big investor's will still wants to survive through bitcoin.There is no good investment can be overrated above bitcoin, be it economy, political or socio tourism. Government knew the value, that only the never wants the citizens to be independent. They should legalize the bitcoin as digital currency with easy exchange any currency in the world.Bitcoin will burst our bubbles and grow states economy on stable analysis and people can become an assets instead of liabilities. All this low demands is simply cause by government and barons who were supposed to give adequate support to the system. Bitcoin will remain bitcoin even stronger and better",

      "body": "I'm also confused about why OP is telling that the demand for bitcoin and its price is correlatively low because they're not. But I do agree with the latter part about what he said that it will be better no matter what happens. I'm not so sure if this is because after hitting $28k it didn't proceed too quickly to $29k which he might be thinking that it's going to happen so fast without any stopover. But let's come to that point that if it's looking low based on what he said then we're seeing that due to the major issues that these banks have shown lately, people are coming up with the idea that by having bitcoin, you have your own wealth with you wherever you are and there's no worry that it's gonna file bankruptcy since it's decentralized. Anyway, if by some little movements of bitcoin's price we're too discouraged to think that it's an actual decline, look where it has come from.",

But that doesn't mean there aren't any demands. Don't expect the centralized government to accept Bitcoin anytime soon. It's because they have no control of it. Slowly, but don't expect global adaptation to happen overnight. Each government has its own perspective on Bitcoin. However, I believe that investors are gradually entering the market, which is why prices are moving so quickly.",

And there were even predictions that it will get to $5000. This period has been a very good time for bitcoin and players in the sector are smiling after a long bear run. Although I might not be correct, but I am suspecting that just like the fall of crypto exchanges led to the drop in the price of bitcoin, the fall of banks might be the reason for the rise in the price. Op you should know that we are in a mini-bull run or a pre-bull run, so enjoy it  .",

How can prices rise if there is no demand?Well, if the supply drops even faster than demand, than the price goes up   I'm struggling to make sense of the OP's post. I think he most likely means that there's a growing demand expressed as amounts of money, but at the same time is dropping in terms of number of people wanting to buy bitcoins (i.e. number of new wallets?).Not worth discussing unless there's a source of data.",

Although technically we are still in the bear market, but having grown at the start of the year, for sure there is more demand right now as compare to last year. And regarding the argument that nobody wants to keep their money in Bitcoin, it already proven itself to be a good financial hedge, just like what we have seen during the pandemic crisis in 2020. It went down in March but later on went on a bull run, topping $60k++. So it's not a wise decision to think that BTC is not a safe haven specially with the Banking crisis that we are witnessing.",

If reversible transactions are the most terrible situation nobody want, with Bitcoin network, it is impossible because to have enough hashrate to attack the network, 51% of total hashrate will cost a lot for attackers.Moreover, attackers won't be able to maintain it too long because nowadays in blockchain, people have lot of efficient bots that can detect suspicious activities within seconds to minutes. Community will react to such situation very quickly.We can use Ethereum Classic attacks as example and Bitcoin is much bigger than Ethereum Classic.How many bitcoin confirmations is enoughhttps://howmanyconfs.com/",

So I don't think there was a low demand when it comes to bitcoin, because there are already a lot of investors that invested in it. And Where probably going to expect a lot of investors to join soon because of a lot of movement in the market, in just weeks the market price has a lot of movement and that is when a lot of investors try to make a quick profit.We already have momentum, and the market is slowly recovering from the bear market, it is just a matter of time because at any moment we could easily expect a skyrocket in the market price of Bitcoin.

If the government sees that there is nothing they can do about stopping people from the adoption or when they see that their fiat currency is worthless, they may have no choice but to key into bitcoin adoption so that they won't be left out.
