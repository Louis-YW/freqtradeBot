  "content": "What is Dusting attack?This is a common scenario in which an attacker sends a small amount of Sats to random Bitcoin wallets, which could be as little as 10 cents, 15 cents, or 20 cents worth of bitcoin. And by doing so, the attacker may now follow how you spend your Bitcoin, allowing them to figure out who you are, your identity, and how much Bitcoin you own. And this is dangerous because he hacker can now attack you and try to steal your Bitcoin if they know who you are and how much you have.We are only familiar with phishing attacks, in which you may be sent a phishing email. This is when you send an email that appears to be from a legitimate organization. You click on the link, enter all of your information, and now you have given it all up, and there is computer ransom where someone takes over your computer, freezes it, and possibly steals a critical document on your computer, and the only way to unfreeze the computer is for you to pay ransom. Bitcoin dusting attacks are the most dangerous of all, especially for those who use most Bitcoin wallets without coin control/UTXO management, since you're forced to spend whatever UTXO you have in your wallet, including the UTXO that the attacker sent to your wallets, and as a Bitcoiner, your privacy is important, and you don't want people knowing your identity online, let alone how much money you have, and sometimes this dusting attack is sent by the government authorities.Coin control/ UTXO management.Coin control is critical for privacy since it allows users to choose between a compromised output (UTXO) and a private (UTXO) when spending Bitcoin.  To protect your anonymity, avoid using Bitcoin wallets without currency control, as this exposes you to Dusting attacks. Methods for identifying dusting attacks and freezing compromised UTXOs from your private currency.Dust attack control in Sparrow wallet.1. A suspected dusted attacking UTXO is automatically identified in updated desktop wallets such as Sparrow and Wasabi wallets; these wallets are programmed to display a caution sign on an output (UTXO) less than 1000 Sats.  Most dusting attacks are motivated by greed, and most Nigerians fall victim to this type of attack because we believe so strongly in miracle money. If you find an unexpectedly small amount of output (UTXO) in your wallet, do not spend it; it is most likely an output (UTXO) attack.2. Click UTXO => right click on the suspected dusting attack UTXO => Freeze UTXO3. Now you can spend your private UTXOs without spending the suspected dusting attack UTXO.Dust attack control in Waasbi wallet.Goto settings => click Bitcoin => Dust Threasom ( You can adjust the amount of Bitcoin you do not wish to receive in your wallet since dust attack are always a low amount of Sats. Simple!But these dusting attacks also can be used for good. They can be used to track stolen Bitcoin and also track the spending of hackers.

On mobile, Bluewallet supports coin control.The Whirlpool is far better because you just pay a one-time cost to mix or coinjoin your coins, but having an unchanged mix returned to your wallet is quite unsafe if you do not know how to manage it. If you mix the unchanged coins or send it out with the conjoined coins, it will corrupt all of your coinjoined UTXOs. Wassabi only implemented dust control after their customers was targeted a few years ago; I'm not sure about their relationship with Chainaanalysis. Ps: I do not have Electrum desktop wallet but I will add it to the list. Quote from: Charles-Tim on September 21, 2023, 01:33:07 PMQuote from: Igebotz on September 21, 2023, 06:12:01 AM2.

The rule is to never spend a Dust attack UTXO, and coin control is the only effective way to do it.",

Sending your personal UTXOs to another wallet while freezing the dust UTXOs is another good strategy to cleanup the wallet too just as you said.

But if you still have doubt, you can use Whilepool.It's also worth noting that Whirlpool only charges a one-time life fees from a certain input address, and it becomes exceedingly slow after the first mixing because you're mixing on another input address fees, and the speed also relies on the pool size. However, the mix following the first is always slow and free. Most mixers do not store logs, but if you value your privacy and IP address, use Tor when mixing instead of cleannet.",

I can not advice anyone to go for Duckduckgo desktops versions (Windows and iOS) because they are still in beta version. For the mobile version, it can be regarded as a privacy browser, but not up to the way Tor can make someone  anonymous. Duckduckgo has Duckduckgo search engine which Tor is also using but it can not mask you and connect you with different nodes and different locations before routing your connection to the website that you want to visit like Tor does.",

Not all Bitcoin dust is harmful, sometimes wallets accumulate dust  because of change gotten from creating  a transaction .The major difference between small change in a Fiat world and UTXOs is that,  The more U TXOs are needed to make a payment, the bigger the file size of transaction and the higher the fees paid to the  miner who adds the transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.
