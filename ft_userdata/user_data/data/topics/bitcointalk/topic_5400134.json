As far as I've seen, the avatars of other members are displayed correctly.",

That is why you need to hard refresh it to clear those caches and download the new one. If it still does not work, try it on another browser or try it on another device. As you can see, most of us stated that it is already showing. It is just on your end (client side) that it isn't working. I do experience this mostly if I change signature campaigns. This is really what I do or I just wait for it to reflect on my end.",
