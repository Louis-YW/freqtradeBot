      "body": "If you are looking to trade fiat to bitcoin or vice versa, then currently the three best exchanges to use are (in my order of preference) Bisq, AgoraDesk, and HodlHodl. All three of these will let you trade peer to peer with other users without completing KYC or submitting any personal details. If you are using Lightning, then there is also RoboSats (Tor only).Bisq has the highest barrier to entry, but it is also the most anonymous. Rather than running through a website like every other exchange (which can then collect your device fingerprint, IP address, etc.), you instead download the Bisq software and connect directly to other peers via Tor. And of course if you want to keep your anonymity very high, then you'll need to choose fiat payments methods which reveal the minimum possible amount of information to the other party.",

I've done hundreds of trades, with dozens of different trading partners, across a number of different platforms. I have never lost so much as a single satoshi, because I take basic security precautions such as not using easily reversed payment methods and trading with highly rated users. Sure, I've had a handful of trades which needed dispute resolution, or I put my coins in escrow only to have them returned to me, but I've never been scammed or lost any coins.Conversely, it is pretty much a daily occurrence to hear about someone losing money on a CEX. Often it is simply a single user has had their account locked or their coins seized because of KYC issues, or the coins they deposited triggered some unknown algorithm, or something along those lines, but every now and then (although very frequently in the last few months) it is because the entire exchange went bankrupt or turned out to be a massive scam, and millions of users lost everything.I don't think at this point you can claim CEXs are safer than DEXs, provided the user isn't doing anything stupid (such as selling bitcoin for PayPal or some other easily reversed fiat methods to a brand new account).",

WHen comparing the risk of complete anonymous p2p the KYCed account looks less risky and I proceed with caution and also with persons of long good trading history no newbies and few months only account.",
