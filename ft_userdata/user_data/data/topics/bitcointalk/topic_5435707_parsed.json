Averaging are for professional traders.Right now I'm testing those on low time frames and trying to be over 50% in good trades. But I'm trading small money like you sad, it's stress free. Even like this is hard to stay over 50% adding bigger funds and more stress it seams almost impossible to be in profit.",

What the difference is, you can look at your trading style and adjust it like your risk that you take. Reduce your risk, don't stay in the market all the time, use stop loss also.",

But later on, I decided to use only RSI, MACD, MA and Fibonacci lines this is really my main indicators and mostly I just draw the resistance and support lines since some indicators are I don't want the way it draws.",

But as far as I know the index is never responsible for losing trades. Most traders lose their money by using wrong strategy and trading at wrong time.

I have learned how to trade myself and I had several failure just because of the wrong strategies that I was using before. Indicators are very important if used with the right strategy.

But that goes back to which indicators we think are easier to use and also to understand. The indicators mentioned become important to determine in which direction the market moves. Apart from the indicators, I usually also see candlestick patterns to determine price movements, this does look simple, but if we really understand the science of this, candlesticks are also very important for us to use as a way to determine movement.",

Also, it is good when analysed using a longer time like daily, weekly and monthly.Yes, I agree with you, that candlesticks are not simple, because there are, say, \"signals\" to form the next candlestick. Beginners might look confused and wonder how it works, I even recommend beginners to study candlestick patterns before entering into trading. In practice it will indeed be more difficult than it looks, but it is very helpful in trading, especially if we are trading for a short time or scalping.",

Confused doesn't mean you can't but it doesn't mean you have to force yourself and it's better to learn more first so you don't just waste money trading.",

It is a very serious business and career that if you understand and do it well, your future is guaranteed. Trade with analysis, get a jotter or book to relearn yourself, write things down and study important things. Also check your better trades that you have made profit in and compare your note to the times you have lost out. Always apply stop loss to your trade and you can reduce your losses that way.",

This can give traders an opportunity to buy securities before everyone wants to buy them, and to make a profit selling them when demand and prices increase.This is a part of fundamental analysis that can be used in cases like when there are rumors of a centralized exchange collapsing and some good news about bitcoin adoption.Disadvantages of this strategy include the lack of accuracy and the potential for missed opportunities if decisions are not made quickly enough.No one can time the market with absolute certainty, buy rumors, and sell news trading strategies are no different. There are a number of reasons why this strategy failed to generate profits for traders.",
