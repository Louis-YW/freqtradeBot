If they charge a hourly fee, it might discourage them to play because they feel they need to spend more money, another thing is they charge additional fee during withdrawal.",

It also increases the possibility that they migth come back at a later date. I personally would also prefer a set fee and not an hourly fee (to be honest i havent even heard of that before)",

Its always better to know what type of rake/fee the casino will charge for playing poker.Rake can vary a lot from casino to casino and also among different poker games. When it comes to poker there are a lot of different variants these days and the game is constantly evolving. Anybody that is playing poker regularly should have a close eye on the rake as it can take a lot of money from our profits. For example there are now some Allin or Fold games, where you sit with 3 people at the table and you either go Allin or fold. You spam a lot of games like that in a short amount of time and pay a lot on rake. These rake traps are very profitable for casinos and they will try to get you in these type of games with bonuses. Then there is the rake back features for regular poker players. In most casinos you can qualify for some extra bonuses or free sitngo games after playing for a certain amount each week. That's why I can make sense to stick to one casino and not gamble at multiple ones.",

I am not a huge fan of poker games but I believe this game is way better playing offline, it makes more sense playing offline and its a different type of game that stands on its own compared to other gambling games online, I just don't want to be so in to the game, I like roulette and other over poker and now I am thinking maybe I am missing the fun part of a poker game I don't just know.",

I guess the live events bring in a lot of public to the arena and those which get streamed on the air make a lot from the advertisements and the footfall. For the online casinos the first option is better.Slots and other EV- games are easier for the casinos to make money from because of the gamblers who are addicted to it will keep on playing and the house edge will continue to milk out the money. EV+ games like poker always need more ground work and stage prep from the casino's side.Simply put, the casinos do make a profit out of poker too, otherwise they would not be running it.",

That's how poker room owners also take their profit from players which is actually better in my opinion as a gambler because at least we are not playing against the house but more like renting the space of the house for the equipment, table, and of course the dealer. I don't know how they do it online though as I have not tried it yet but I believe it will just be the same especially because they are not using any equipment anymore.",

Casinos usually reward the top three players who accumulate the most points although some may consider the.

The Rake is usually fixed for the game but some casinos, will not take the rake, but will charge an hourly fee from the poker players. Its always better to know what type of rake/fee the casino will charge for playing poker.I thought you would go into more detail about the types of Rake in poker, but since you didn't, I'll go into these details because the rake in poker is not the same in all casinos. It depends on what you play, where you play and how much the casino charges and it is important to know the different types of poker rake.Pot rakeThe most common form of rake in cash games is the pot rake, already detailed above. It corresponds to a fixed % of the pot and is usually limited to an announced amount. Most commonly, the rake will be calculated at the end of the match, just before the pot is awarded to the winner of the hand.Dead dropThe equivalent of the pre-button bet in tournaments, a 'dead drop' is a fee paid each hand by the player in that position that is placed on the button before the hand begins.Fixed commissionA fixed amount that is paid each hand and does not change based on pot size or any other factor.Timed CollectionAlso known as a “table charge”, instead of charging a pot fee, a fixed amount is paid by each player at the table, typically collected in 30-minute intervals.Tournament FeesPart of the buy-in for a tournament consists of a fee that is collected by its operator. For example, if you pay $55 to enter a tournament, $50 will go towards the prize pool and $5 will be retained by the operator as a rake fee.No rake Occasionally there may be game(s) where no rake is charged.",
