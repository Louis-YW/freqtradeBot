  "content": "Hi all! I want to tell you about my unpleasant situation on Duckdice.io, I thought support would answer by mail, but they are not going to answer me at all and the chat was turned off when I wrote to it with a request to unblock my account.My nickname in DuckDice is 1sajjad9My E mail: usama_syed96@hotmail.comWhat happened:: Made a deposit on the 1 of March 499.2 usdt to the TRC20 wallet - 0x4d2b0349c14e18d176ae6ae753b6d8e743b46b1b584845b67403c902bdd67cefAnd also the second deposit after 8 hours, also on March 1, in the amount of 529.2 usdt to the TRC20 wallet - 0xa11f30a278479b845cb88bca3fc9554fe62ac14fee25ef2df44287eff76aa2a2I made up to 10 bets since my balance was just over ~$2520 and I decided to withdraw some of it. Withdrawal canceled, comment written: canceled due to KYC administrator, and on the side they wrote that I must pass level 2 verification.A couple of days later I write to the chat, they open an account for me for a day. I pass verification to level 2, write to the chat, put my funds for withdrawal - they don’t withdraw, they write to go through level 3, although initially they didn’t ask for it at all. I upload original bank statements that match the address in my profile and my statements in a row just get rejected and my account closes again. Why? For what? They don’t answer the mail, I’m tired of waiting and I’m writing this topic.Open my account for me and return all my balance to mesupport@duckdice.io @DuckDice.ioUPDATE:: : Funds returned in full, handsome guys, thank you all!",

If the user fails to do that then they won't release the fund a lock also if they wish then they may release only the deposit funds even if they can take a service fee from the deposit funds.",

Since the site does not impose identity verification procedures, users will choose it because they want to preserve their privacy.Let's imagine that two or more people are using the gambling platform using the same network, such as that they are using a public Wi-Fi network or even the same device if, for example, they are brothers using one computer in their home. The site can simply suspect that these accounts are owned by one person and the verification process will force those users seeking privacy to submit to the terms of the platform.On the other hand, a platform that does not verify the identities of users will open the door for minor children to practice gambling, which is a very dangerous matter, as we know .",

For example Binance's KYC/AML procedures are done via SumSub.I am currently waiting on more information regarding your case and will get back to you here once I have them.Kirito89,Duckdice Support.Edit : UpdateYou have received your balance in full, please do not proceed in oppening any new accounts with Duckdice.",
