First I will ask you to read through the pinned posts on this board (beginners & Help)  and then if there is anything you still have questions about you can go on and ask. Although to avoid having to repeat some questions that have already been attended to it is best you make use of the search button first before making any thread. Once you cannot find the answers to your questions then you can go ahead to create a thread on them. Read through this threadAlso there are rules guiding the forum so I would advise you take a look at some here.",

Make an effort to write your own posts rather than copying and pasting those of others.4. Feel free to comment or ask questions about any post you find interesting.5.

I recall that when I first joined the forum, I was even afraid to post, but I eventually realized that it was all about interaction. Reading some topics makes me laugh and brightens my day. However, in order to fully enjoy your time here, you must follow the rules. I have seen some members share links to relevant threads. If you break the rules, then be prepared to deal with the repercussions. One thing that is especially crucial was the fact that initially believed the forum was too challenging for me, but over time, I began to appreciate it and am still enjoying it.",
