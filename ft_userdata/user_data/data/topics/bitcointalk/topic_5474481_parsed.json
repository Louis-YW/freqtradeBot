What could be responsible for this?Not only in Bitcoin I have seen women but in many other fields I have seen women as less as we think. I have noticed them in the business side even they are a little behind from the men and thus they didn't have business ideas and are very less involved in the business.Bitcoin has a better value through which men had already earned many. The women will make themselves better if they work on the business side and if they achieved their success regarding the bitcoin matter.",

Most of them are product designers, community managers, advisors, ambassordors and Blockchain developers. If you go through most cryptocurrency white papers you will see what am talking about. When it comes to investment in Bitcoin I could attest to the fact that there are fewer women than men. I see women as receivers and not givers. This is why most women do not see any need to invest in Bitcoin, because they don't have any future ambition or are not investment wise. Most persons use Bitcoin as a store of value to pass down to heirs and their generations. And this is done mostly by men, not women. We have only few women who see the need to keep generational wealth.",

It was the based on the fact that at that time women hardly get promotion they deserve or sometimes its more like they put in the effort while the male get the reward and acknowledgments.Women has been helpful in the development of computer, the programming language use to instruct or interact with computers and even cryptography which is use in Blockchain.Coming to bitcoin, there's no gender discrimination, adopting bitcoin is individual preference, one of the oldest members of this forum is Foxpup and she is definitely among the bitcoin earliest adopters.Now I'm curious to know why she adopted bitcoin thinking it now.",

I will agree (re: \"keeping the house\") women are often more \"financially protective\" and less likely to take risks than men. Sometimes, keeping the house doesn't mean cleaning and Women's work, it literally means do not lose the house by messing up financially. From the start the Bitcoin Community has seen many more men present than women, it has improved in recent years.",

What could be responsible for this?Yes, there are more men than women in science industries and we see less men and more women in the art world. Part of the problem for this is caused by societal values and expectations, society determines the roles both genders play in the world. Women are naturally empathic, expressive and caring, this makes society place certain roles on them like nursing, teaching, interior design e.t.c It will be helpful if you added the source where you got the statistics. I would like to think there is a balance of male-female ratio in the tech industry.",

And men are highly risk takers in all life's aspects most especially when it comes to money and newest innovation that will certainly create positive changes in their lives. They want to explore everything that seems new to them. Second, men do not fear from losing and they want to risk even their hard-earned money just to be satisfied with the outcome. As many people say, no risk, no gain. The reason why men are more assertive in all they do and just love to be more independent more than women.",

It’s true women may not be interested in mining, nodes, pow or pos, Quote from: Rikafip on November 17, 2023, 08:35:47 PMAnother important factor is that women are generally less willing to take a risk than men, and since Bitcoin is pretty new and very risky, no wonder that fewer women are interested in it.Some would argue that women are more easy to convince than men therefore they can be easily convinced to invest in bitcoin than men. You’re a famous scambuster in the forum, who do scammers target more…men or women? I would argue that romantic scams, investment scams e.t.c victimize the women folk more than the men. Quote from: Rikafip on November 17, 2023, 08:35:47 PMQuote from: SatoPrincess on November 17, 2023, 08:35:26 PMthis makes society place certain roles on them like nursing, teaching, interior design e.t.c Even in societies that don't enforce those roles on women, they still rather chose them over more traditional male jobs.

Because women's have some limitations. They aren't like us; they could not take decisions on anything. Women usually don't want to take risks and don't want to lose something. They like to live in a comfort zone. As we know, to become Bitcoin investors, we need enough patience since there is a lot of risk involved. So they don't want to come out of their comfort zones, and they don't have enough time to research like us. They have to maintain families as well.

      "body": "I think we have to go back in time and follow a historical approach to it. When were women allowed to go to school, participate in elections, work and earn money? Women started participating in most crucial aspect of life few hundred years after civilization. Technically, their brain isn't expected to think like men do in these part of life. Women were told to focus more on house keeping and training children. Hence, in the growth of their brain, it'll take longer until women begin to take monetary risk like men. Same can be applicable to bitcoin, it's a new idea and before women begin to venture into it, more decades would pass. Although, I see women heading most crypto projects and organizing cryptocurrency conferences for women. And these women are mostly the few women we can see in the computer science department. For instance, in the university, the computer science department can have about 10 women and 200 men. And it remains like that across many other universities. Not all of them can understand software development, how would they involve in something they don't know about. Added with the fact that in the society women spend time with fellow women than men. Who would influence them to do what they're into today. A lot of female programmers, I've met, were influenced by their male friends or brothers. While the whooping number of female nurses were influenced by their mothers to study nursing. Hence, the point remains that you can't give what you don't have. Because their mothers whom they listen to and spend time with advice them on the career to follow, they'll definitely follow that route. Generations to generations it'll keep repeating itself, because of the long time denial women faced in the society.",

I think though there are women already like a CEO of companies related to crypto if I'm not mistaken. Women are said to be weak where men are more powerful and unbreakable. And with the nature of bitcoin that involves higher risk, men mostly want to engage in it because it creates a challenge for them not just to overcome the risks but to gain a lot after. They want to take advantage where there are opportunities, which I think women are quite slow when it comes to that because of their feminine characteristics that push them to act ladily compared to the very strong and aggressive men. But it does not mean that women are left behind when it comes to the success on bitcoin. As much as men have become more intense in achieving bitcoin sucess, women as well have become highly competitive as men.",

However, because of their societal power, women who invest wisely in bitcoin will contribute significantly to the expansion of bitcoin adoption. and Bitcoin investment will be the greatest investment for them if they want to stay at home and manage their wealth without stress.",
