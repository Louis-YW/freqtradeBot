  "content": "I don't know who needs to hear this but you need to get insurance if you have assets that are your source of income and it can be insurable. This may not mean much to a lot of folks in developed countries because they're familiar with it, but a lot (and I mean a lot) of people in underdeveloped countries don't care about insurance. I've read stories of people who were okay financially going broke because they have spent all they had to treat an illness for themselves, their children, or loved ones. I'm not saying insurance is our personal lord and savior, but it can help you in tight situations.Around November last year, I volunteered to join a local and small NGO that was taking food, drugs, and other supplies to flood victims.For context of how big the flood was, we used speedboats on roads and it was as though we were on a high sea.Experts gave lectures on how to prepare for a flood and not wait for it to be too late. Some of the people we met told their stories.We met one woman whose case I found very interesting. She had a farm; a fishery and a poultry farm. The poultry was much bigger than the fishery. The farm was so big and established it made her thousands of dollars monthly in gross income. The flood took her by surprise, she was able to rescue some feeds and animals, but she lost so much of it. Now let's ignore the fact that she was careless for not believing the warnings that a very big flood was coming because, in her words \"In my 56 years of being alive and my 17+ years of doing this business, I've never experienced the tiniest bit of flood\" Let's focus on the fact that neither her farm nor a single thing on the farm was insured despite generating that kind of income. Because of the damage we saw, the NGO started a campaign for the government to help these farmers with grants and loans so they can get back on their feet (but y'all know how politics gets). This allowed us to visit this woman at her farm. She's back on her feet, but it could take years to get back to what she was before the flood. If her farm was insured, it most likely wouldn't have taken her that long. There are many more people like this. A cab driver loses his care and he's back to square one because that's his source of income. Others get an illness that is expensive to treat and they go broke trying to pay for the treatment.A husband and father die unexpectedly and leave nothing behind, leaving the wife to struggle alone to take care of the children. This takes a family that was comfortably a middle-class family to a lower-class family. If you make money, get health insurance for you and your family, and insure your assets that are a source of income, businesses. Get a life insurance to secure your family's future.There's a saying \" hope for the best and plan for the worst\".",

Could be yes, it could also not and wise saying and usually the items that many people take are vital, for example education, health and business and are all stated in the insurance policy if the user wants and agrees. Well, maybe this also sounds normal. In the case of applying for a loan, if you have met the loan requirements, the bank will also cut costs for insurance if at any time the borrower dies and the automatic payment of insurance is covered by no longer a member of the family, for example his wife.But apart from that, problems are often found in the application, apart from the first thing being high premium costs, then the mismatch in prices and protection values and unclear claims which confuse users and this often happens and the worst thing is that the company collapses.",

If you have assets that are your source of income, it is also advisable, except if you have a very large patrimony in relation to those assets.

This is because it is well organized and insurance companies won't have to deny an insured or whatever was insured after you have been paying your premium.Like you said again, you mentioned politics. It is unfortunate that in most less developed countries, companies and government are not sincere to keep their own part of the bargain or contract and so that raises a lot of distrust. A reason that would have made the woman not to take the flood warning seriously. Although it is to her own detriment but to prove that your property was destroyed sometimes is like the cow passing through the eye of a niddle even in the midst of glaring and public evidences. Moreover, restitution and compensation takes ages. These and more would make an average person living in a corrupt country to rather put their fate to what they can do by themselves, more like every man to himself and God for us all.",

But not the one you're talking about. In fact, diversification is insurance. You talked about a woman's poultry business that she lost due to a flood. The first thing is that she relied only on this business. That is, she didn't have any reserves (a third-party additional business is immune to flooding), and also, apparently, didn't have any financial reserves, which is why she turned out to be practically destitute (if I understood correctly from the story above). Diversification of insurance reserves should be carried out in different locations (home, city, region, country and different financial institutions - bank, stock exchange, even though these are bad places to store your assets) and in different assets (business, money, securities , cryptocurrencies - optional).An insurance company is a commercial organization whose main goal is to extract money from you and give back as little as possible. I wouldn't rely on them 100%. I am sure that even with insurance, the victims of this flood would receive small amounts (compared to the money that would have been spent on monthly premiums from the insurance company for 5, 10 or more years). It is not every day that disasters such as floods occur in the same places. Or they would not have received anything at all as victims due to restrictions in the insurance conditions written in small print (the absence of this clause). Not a single insurance company as a commercial organization will work to its own detriment.The business of insurance companies is set up ingeniously: they collected 100% of the money and returned 10% to the insured. Essentially, this is money out of thin air that their clients pay. What's stopping you from becoming your own insurance company for free?The most correct decision (in the context of this forum) would be to prepare insurance reserves yourself in bitcoin. If part of the profit from the poultry farm were set aside monthly in a bitcoin, then, taking into account the rising price, this would form an impressive amount, which she so badly needs.",

It is because you don't know what's about to come and having it means that the word itself, you're going insurance to your family that if something happens to you unexpectedly, you have them insured with money that won't be a burden to them anymore when you're gone.I myself bought insurance last year and you can choose what type of plans you have. Life insurance, health insurance, asset insurance, anything as long as you can afford it. The type depends on your needs and what you think is the one that suits you. There are even insurances for the real estate when you're still paying the mortgage and if ever you're gone, that's going where the insurance will be used and your mortgage will serve as a paid asset already and your mortgage will be done in full by your insurance provider. That's how insurance works for those who don't understand it yet because they think that you're strong today and you don't need it and it's just another expenses. Actually, it's a way to protect your source of living and your family from unexpected situations.",

Why would you say he is right? I disagree with him. In some countries Insurance is a necessity and as far as i know i am certain that no insurance is not worth it. Insurance is like a safety net that helps protect you from big, life-changing losses. However, there are things i feel like not necessary taking an insurance on if you get unlucky. Like your tv, refrigerator and some home appliances that one can do without you could put hose money into savings for better purpose and wait till sometimes you can get them back. The thing is money doesn't work the same way for everyone. Losing $1000 might not hurt too much for most people, but losing $100,000 could mean selling your house, selling your cars, quitting school, or getting another job. The effect on your life is way more than just 100 times the difference between the two amounts. This is the reason why insurance is important. Instead of you losing so much you could gradually settle those things with time even if you have to pay more to the insurance company for there services, its better than pulling such an amount at a time for life issues.",

This may not mean much to a lot of folks in developed countries because they're familiar with it, but a lot (and I mean a lot) of people in underdeveloped countries don't care about insurance. I've read stories of people who were okay financially going broke because they have spent all they had to treat an illness for themselves, their children, or loved ones. I'm not saying insurance is our personal lord and savior, but it can help you in tight situations.Around November last year, I volunteered to join a local and small NGO that was taking food, drugs, and other supplies to flood victims.For context of how big the flood was, we used speedboats on roads and it was as though we were on a high sea.Experts gave lectures on how to prepare for a flood and not wait for it to be too late. Some of the people we met told their stories.We met one woman whose case I found very interesting. She had a farm; a fishery and a poultry farm. The poultry was much bigger than the fishery. The farm was so big and established it made her thousands of dollars monthly in gross income. The flood took her by surprise, she was able to rescue some feeds and animals, but she lost so much of it. Now let's ignore the fact that she was careless for not believing the warnings that a very big flood was coming because, in her words \"In my 56 years of being alive and my 17+ years of doing this business, I've never experienced the tiniest bit of flood\" Let's focus on the fact that neither her farm nor a single thing on the farm was insured despite generating that kind of income. Because of the damage we saw, the NGO started a campaign for the government to help these farmers with grants and loans so they can get back on their feet (but y'all know how politics gets). This allowed us to visit this woman at her farm. She's back on her feet, but it could take years to get back to what she was before the flood. If her farm was insured, it most likely wouldn't have taken her that long. There are many more people like this. A cab driver loses his care and he's back to square one because that's his source of income. Others get an illness that is expensive to treat and they go broke trying to pay for the treatment.A husband and father die unexpectedly and leave nothing behind, leaving the wife to struggle alone to take care of the children. This takes a family that was comfortably a middle-class family to a lower-class family. If you make money, get health insurance for you and your family, and insure your assets that are a source of income, businesses. Get a life insurance to secure your family's future.There's a saying \" hope for the best and plan for the worst\".In as much as it's of utmost importance we insure our investment or important properties, don't also forget that the lady has been in business for almost two decades, you wouldn't blame her for doubting that there will be flood, because she hasn't experienced it before.I believe for everything there is a first time experience, going forward she must have learned lesson. But most times insuring some of these business can be very expensive especially for starter business.",
