  "content": "This is now official. Lineal and unified IBF/WBC/WBO light heavyweight champion Artur Beterbiev will travel to OVO Arena Wembly in London, England on January 28 to defend his belts against local hero Anthony Yarde. This fight is supposed to happen earlier but was canceled due to Beterbiev suffering an injury. Earlier this weekend, Anthony Yarde won his tune-up with an easy 3rd round KO. Professional win-loss-KO recordsArtur Beterbiev:  18-0-18 KOsAnthony Yarde:   23-2-22 KOsEarlier quotes from the 2 protagonists in courtesy of Fightnews.com.While Artur Beterbiev owns 3 of the major sanctioning belts, the IBF, WBC, and WBO, the other remaining WBA belt was held by another undefeated Russian, Dmitry Bivol. Both fighters are confident to become the undisputed champion. They already mentioned that they want to unify their belts but it seems like TV networks are making it difficult for this mega fight from becoming a reality. Artur Beterbiev fights at ESPN and is promoted by Top Rank while Dmitry Bivol is with DAZN and promoted by Matchroom. But we fight fans are still hoping that this division will have its first undisputed champion in this 4 belt era.My personal take on this fight. Despite Beterbiev being 37 years old, he should be able to land some of his bombs on Yarde and score a stoppage. I think Beterbiev will be a 3-1 to 4-1 favorite here. Despite fighting in front of Yarde's popular British crowd, these former Soviet fighters are mentally tough. Rival promoter Eddie Hearn of Matchroom was quick to say that Yarde is a good guy but Beterbiev is a different beast and this fight will turn into a mismatch.",

      "body": "this will be a fight in which Beterbiev will win without having many problems, the difference between these two fighters is big in my opinion, this Yarde should have looked for someone else to fight, he is making a very risky move in the sense that he will lose because he chose one guy who's much better than him, he even said that January 28th will be his night, he'll lose in his city, the fact that he's fighting at home won't make him win that fight and I even believe that the odds for this fight will give Beterbiev a big advantage, I even venture to guess that the odd for Beterbiev could be between @1.18 to @1.30Quote from: fortunecrypto on November 20, 2022, 05:36:40 AMIt really is a mismatch, no one in the light heavyweight division can match Beterbiev's power but Bivol, Yarde can describe him as slow but he will not be too quick to duck Beterbiev's powerbomb, I expect Beterbiev to knock this guy out if Kovalev who beat Yarde can knock him down with a jab what more with Beterbiev's combination, of course, Beterbiev is a harder puncher than Kovalev.I won't even be surprised if Beterbiev submits the fight in a short time, I don't see this Yarde having much chance of winning or even resisting for a long time, this fight is already won by Beterbiev. I'll bet on Beterbiev if this fight is available at stake to place bets, even if it has a low odd I'll bet, I just add this fight in a multibet bet and I'll make a profit, this type of fight is good because the person can make some profit, since the difference in power between fighters is large so it is easy to predict the winner",

Yes Beterviev is 37 years old but this dude is one scary boxer. So I wouldn't be surprised if he wins by KO/TKO here and Yarde's chin not holding up against Beterviev's power.Yarde might give some test on Beterviev early on, but when Beterviev got his groove and combination, he will be hard to stop as he throw everything with bad intent.And probably sports bookies will favor Beterviev by a huge margin as far as the odds.",

But, seeing how Beterviev fight and destroys his opponent and knocking them down, we doubt that Yarde can give a fair and even competition.Probably Yarde will be just a gate keeper and B-level fighter. The 2 headed Russian right now, Beterviev and Bivol is the king of division. Even Canelo will have a hard time cracking this two champion in 175.",

And if Arthur wins here, seems that there are no worthy opponent except for this two to face for unification. But we should wait, again, with different promoters and network affiliation, it might be a hard road ahead, as there are many stumbling blocks.",

There is nobody in the lightweight division who can destroy the current Artur Beterbiev and crack him open, fellow Russian boxer Dimitry Bivol who holds the WBA title might have a chance but Anthony Yarde? He can bark all he want but nobody would agree with him especially after the fact that he already have two defeats in his record. Barking about slow and all yet he cannot even defeat Kovalev.",

If ever Artur Beterbiev will win here, there's currently no other fighter in the light-heavyweight division that can still be a close match to him other than the WBA Light-Heavyweight Champion Dmitry Bivol. It will be crap if these champions will still need to undergo another title defense before having a unification match. Well then, since Bivol just recently defended his title against Gilberto Ramírez, Beterbiev should do the same too for boxing fans to see their possible clash in the future (hopefully next year).",

Both of them have insanely powerful and fast punches and this is obviously going to end out by knock out. But being faster could actually be a key factor in this. It's hard to defend either of their punches with just arms very successfully, but if you are fast enough, you might not have to.There's no telling how much Beterbiev can handle before getting knocked out, as he hasn't been knocked out yet, but looking how Yarde moves, he can't just rush forward and dominate the ring this time. If Beterbiev wins, it won't be easy for him.",

Not just the Crawford vs Spence fight, there are a lot of great fights that didn't push through because of this issues. Hopefully, Arum and Eddie Hearn can sit down and talk on how they will deal on the network, who is going to cover or something that both networks will be involved in broadcasting it. So we shall see, Beterviev should win this fight, up to Bivol then whether to rematch Canelo.",

The recent KO win for Koykov is a statement of a great fighting skills, and that’s why they come up into this match up. This one can be more exciting, and for me despite of the KO win for Koykov, I still see Beterbiev to win here, he can still throw deadly punches for sure.",
