  "content": "WEB 3.0Let’s start from the start, So in the start of internet the purpose was targeted Communication. From there a journey to remove distances explore the digital world started. Internets First form was Web 1.0 then 2.0 came later and until now we are using it. Now after 2020 we discovered an evolving technology called web 3.0. Web 3.0 is all what we need in current era.Web 1.0 VS Web 2.0:Web 1.0 Introduction: In introduction Web 1.0 allows the Read Only feature. We can directly say that printed News Paper is a good example of Web 1.0 where user can read the information but they can’t interact with that information and they can’t put their Feedback. WEB 1.0 was a huge Success in digital world where Information sharing became easy.Features of WEB 1.0:•   Reading: Yes•   Pictures: Yes•   Videos: No•   Content Power: NoYahoo Search and WWW are examples of the WEB 1.0.Web 2.0 Introduction: I would like to say that Web 2.0 was a true implementation of the digital world. Web 2.0 gave us the Read & Write power. A massive number of applications there was founded. Point is Web 2.0 gave the content writing power to users. YouTube, Blogs, Facebook and true implementation of the Social connections is massive success of the Web 2.0.Features of WEB 2.0:•   Reading: Yes•   Writing: Yes•   Videos: Yes•   Streaming: Yes•   Gaming: Yes•   Content creation: YesGoogle is Good example of Web 2.o applications.Major Flaws in Web 2.0:Privacy:Privacy is a major issue with the Web 2.0. No doubt Web 2.0 converted the era into digital era and made the World to be accessible so easy but in WEB 2.0 Users became Customers for the Major Franchises. Data Manipulation started and Users activity on the Platform regularly tracked and then All the related data is used to sell products to the user. In other words you can say that WEB 2.0 risked the users Data & Personal choice where user’s brain always manipulated for a particular product using his History. User has no control on his / her Privacy & Data. Using AIs and Machine Language users profile always Targeted by different platform (Social Media).Dependency:Web 2.0 was a revolution in the Content world but it was too limited for the creators, Web 2.0 gave the freedom to the users to be the source of information but under limitations as if a user want to Create a Video he need a particular platform to publish his/her content and here comes manipulation. For example Google the only Web 2.0 Application Holding 84% of all the Content created by me and you. So point is there are a few option for the users to create and publish content we are dependent on the Google or any other platform. These Platforms allow us to publish our content and charge almost 40%+ commission on our earnings. It means the Middle man Platforms are reason for less rewarding content.Freedom of Speech:Social media is called by the name of Freedom to Speak but do you really think its freedom. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram allow the user to speak anything but not really. Using Manipulation these Platforms can delete your account / Post by no reason and you don't own a right to ask about it in most cases so that not the freedom of speech its freedom under control and this is done by Government Institutes.SEO:Search Engine Optimization is another issue with the web 2.0 products as the content creators and product owners need to reach their audience they pay millions of dollar for SEOs to reach Audience as Google manipulate all the searches around the internet, authors pay google to reach audience, due Central Body google Business owners and authors need to pay a huge amount of money to use the keywords to attract audience. This creates a biased situation for the creators the as if creator pays more on SEO he can reach a wider audience but natural flow of information got disturbedWeb 3.0 Future of InternetWeb 3.0 is a proper implementation of digital era. Web 3.0 is what users need a proper solution to the problems of the Web 2.0. Web 3.0 is a next generation of internet where privacy and Decentralization is main target to be achieved.

Most users don't want to use directly their own usage of the application/platform. Instead, they simply use a centrally managed platform that is hosted over centralized managed DNS and hosting.Do note that, most users are interacting with blockchain over third-party RPC API, which has the power to censor and block an users.",

But I think it's just pretty much of a hype although the market is no longer speaking for it as of the moment. And then, there's this part of me that tells me that I should be in it so that I won't be left behind if the web 3.0 really emerged and I've got some projects that I'm already in and invested while they're on the early stages. While the bigger part of me tells me that this is just another craze and the projects that I might be interested could go wrong since they've got no experience in raising projects that are successful even before.",
