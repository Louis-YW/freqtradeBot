Five years later, from 2019 to 2024, price is more than five-fold since 2018 ATH, and if we compare to 2019 price, it would be higher than x5 because in November 2019, price starts above $9,000 and fell to about $7,200 in late of that month.Peter Shiff and his company sells gold and has products related to gold. He knows that whole capital around the world is zero-sum, if more people are interested in and invest their capital into Bitcoin market, less people and less capital will be in Gold market.You don't have to convince Peter Schiff or change his mind, it's his business, but you can read this The bullish case for Bitcoin and strengthen your belief in Bitcoin, then say no to gold.Sometimes you can receive notifications from exchange applications like \"Bitcoin price dips below $98,000\". It's ironic and Peter Schiff likes it.",

If he is preferring the traditional markets, he can keep shot instead of saying what he does not know. As he always criticize bitcoin, the price of bitcoin continued to increase and getting to all-time high. I hope he will have change of mind now and know that what people support is what that will appreciate the price of an asset and not what is physical. He even criticized microstrategy last month which is uncalled for.",

Plenty of big names in the past were anti-Bitcoin at first but eventually came around and invested.Lots of people were skeptical of bitcoin back then and we can't fault them for it. Sure it may feel them stupid now but back then many of them didn't have enough evidence to completely trust bitcoin as an investment opportunity. However, if at this point and you are still skeptical of bitcoin I am going to have to say that that is already actual stupidity. Investing in bitcoin is seen as one of the most profitable opportunities as of the moment and if you still can't see why then maybe you are really not understanding the concept of bitcoin.Quote Even if he sticks to his stance, though, the Bitcoin market will keep growing regardless.Many big names can keep talking about bitcoin negatively but the masses understand bitcoin and see it on an objective point of view. So yes it will continue to increase in value no matter how many fiat loving and crypto hating names spread things about bitcoin.",

He’s not a high-risk taker like us, and that’s fine, but he should at least respect Bitcoin investors by keeping his opinions to himself.

Most likely, he’d lean on the stability comparison, emphasizing gold’s long-term reliability over Bitcoin’s volatility. And of course, he’d bring up the trust factor, gold has been a strategic reserve for many countries for decades, while Bitcoin hasn’t reached that status yet.",

Recently, you will see that he talked about establishing a Crypto Advisory Council. When establishing the Crypto Advisory Council, he mentioned that someone from the industry and someone who owns Bitcoin should be elsewhere.So, understand whether his views on the price of Bitcoin have definitely changed or may change at the present time.
