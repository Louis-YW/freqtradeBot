That is the same for every other coin including Ergo and Ravencoin although I agree they are somewhat better,in the longer term you only should keep Bitcoin in your wallet and no altcoins.I do this as although I am mining ETC right now I use pools that gives me payout in Bitcoin,that is the best one can do in these moments where the merge of Ethereum and ending of mining for it is imminent right now,we should all be prepared for some difficult days ahead but that we will pass them and then the sun will rise again for all us crypto lovers.",

However, since one block is generated approximately every 2 minutes, the halving happens roughly every 2.5 years. The halving event has reduced the block reward from 75 to 37.5 FLUX.It should be noted that Flux only rewards miners with half of the block reward. The other half is split between Masternodes, which means the current mining reward is 18.75 FLUX.",

Its misuse as a buzzword and trend by many companies, and especially people and companies outside of the crypto space, has led to many misconceptions.

Let's dive in!Is there any different between Flux and FluxEdge? Because I saw the Op and made research on the project and in coinsmarketcap, I saw that the project is doing well. And the price is $1.01 so I don't know which one you are talking about is it the same project? Though it is a good news to launch memecoin. And if your project was close and now reopen again then it is also a good news and I e thing is to maintain project for long term and I think the relaunching of the project will last. I have not used and was not aware of the project so I not have any good input for now unless you explain where you are launching the project. Is it in exchange or in the ecosystem. June 26 is just hear. Waiting to see the launch date. Please update us.",
