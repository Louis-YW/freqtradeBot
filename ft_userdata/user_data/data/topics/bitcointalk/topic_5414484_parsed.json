Agreed. It is head shaking why until know some people think this is news hehe. Jamie Dimon has declared that bitcoin would only be valuable in a dystopian world, he also said that he will fire any JPMorgan employee if they are trading bitcoin. However, last year JPMorgan gave their clients access to 6 cryptofunds hehehe.With little fanfare, JPMorgan Chase has started giving its wealth management clients access to six crypto funds in the past month.Source https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/05/bitcoin-jpmorgan-led-by-jamie-dimon-quietly-unveils-access-to-a-half-dozen-crypto-funds.html",

If bitcoin adoption reaches a high enough level, crypto will seriously compete with traditional banks.

It is also head shaking that just because NFTs have existed since 2012, it should not be successful and not grow to more than a $100 billion market?There are many scams, yes, and scams that are not only in Defi. They are in all of the cryptospace. Also, what is your definition of a scam? Is this any project that is not bitcoin a scam?  From this argument then we are no better than Jaime Dimon.Another head shaking comment to blame other projects because there are mainstream investors and bankers like Jaime Dimon who call bitcoin a ponzi. They will call it a ponzi because it does not create any value and to get profit from it, the holder must wait for new money to come in then sell it to another buyer for a higher price.",

He turned a static image of a five-word tweet into a digital file stored on a blockchain, and voila, an NFT was born. A few months later, the image sold for a stunning $2.9 million.
