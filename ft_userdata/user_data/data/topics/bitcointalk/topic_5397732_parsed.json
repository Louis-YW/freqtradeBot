But today, I learned another word. Maybe, not yet hitting in everyone's dictionary but it makes sense. Also, this is the reason why we need to remember to diversify our portfolio. So whichever will be favorable on the situation we are in, we can always utilize them according to our needs.",

Depending on how bad the situation is, Bitcoin might find itself facing slow adoption and low or even falling demand. Confronted with a slow economic growth, high unemployment rate, and rising prices, people will not only control their spending, they might also lose their savings, and even forced to sell assets which could include Bitcoin. So with a dire economic situation, Bitcoin supply may overwhelm its demand and cause the price to fall.",

So it might go down however when the fed goes in and starts printing money, people will buy stocks and crypto again due to inflation fears.So far it’s trading sideways and drifting slowly down. Much healthier than most other assets out there except commodities.",

Yea but its no so simple. Money was printed, it pumped financial economy (stocks, crypto) and than spilled into real economy making inflation. So inflation pump on financial assets was already in. Next 2-3 years of high inflation may already be priced in. Fed is now fighting with inflation highering interest rates sucking money from ... financial economy first than from real economy. So we see dump 50% of everything before FED doings will affect real economy slowing down inflatoin and creating disinflation. Unless Plunge Protection Team (PPT) will react. What will bitcoin do in such situation? We never have stagflation in history of bitcoin but i guess it act like sp500 on leverage.",

      "body": "Best thing to do during these periods is not to cut spending because if there is inflation that means you need to buy it today, in order to not pay for it a lot more in the future. A 100 bucks debt today paid in 120 bucks in a year is better than not spending that 100 dollars, and having to pay 150 dollars because of inflation next year.This is what we are living in right now, if you do not buy a thing today, you will have to pay a lot more next year for it, maybe not every nation has that high inflations but my nation does have that type of huge inflation. So buying everything right away, and then just paying the debt, is better than saving and buying next year.",

The time they'll realize they're screwed is when it's already somewhat 'too late'.",

The most normal thing is that bitcoin is useful in periods of crisis but it depends on many factors, and if we take into account that it is permissionless but many people leave it on exchanges or platforms that do not even allow you to withdraw it, as we were discussing recently on the Spanish board, it is not clear that it is going to end up behaving as we assume.",

Dude, you get merit from me because I learned a new word today, Stagflation. Now, regarding crypto and BTC as alternatives, I would argue that nothing mentioned will benefit crypto because its movement of it is still highly linked to the movement of the economy and the state of FIAT, and not in an opposite way to it, as when the economy is in distress, people tend to buckle down and not invest, and weather we like it or not, the majority of crypto investing is just because of investing itself.",
