  "content": "BITCOIN PRICE TODAYGood day house members and chairpeople (moderators) I just feel like telling the house and those who accomplish not know the current price of bitcoin and how much it worth today, Â but first I don't know where I should drop the thread and if the thread is not permitted to be here, please someone should help me move it. The price of bitcoin already shown in the picture at the awning and I know at any time it will be higher than it is now or it will be lower than it is, but if the current price of Bitcoin eventually reduces never sell hold until you are satisfied with the price before selling. For, I am thinking of opening a business for my wife with the tangible profits I have made from Bitcoin, I would have dropped a picture of my electrum wallet balance but I will not because I don't think is either advisable to do so.",

It's just that Bitcoin at the $20,000 level isn't worth selling. It is cheap. For me that's too low a price to let go of my precious satoshis. Bitcoin has been to $69,000. It can go back there for sure. Also, the halving is near. It's just around a year from now. That will bring in more profit.",

The 0.25% gain is a good sign for the market, bitcoin was volatile when the news was announced but in the long run, should positively impact the market. With this rate hike, I remain optimistic about bitcoin hitting $30,000 this month as well as it conquering other gains in this rally.",

Maybe the initial capital can be very large but I'm sure he can start with a minimum investment first while waiting for market conditions to really reach the peak of its recovery.And when the market can reverse direction and make a lot of coins, bitcoins and altcoins increase, including all my altcoins, that will be a huge advantage for me. This is where we must plan for what we want to do to immediately allocate the funds we have received or prepare the funds to achieve the plans we want.",

We should be still in the bear market, however, it seems that the bulls are coming back and has total of it right now.And maybe we can go back to the price around 2022 again, or at least when we thought that the bull market is over.$30k will be the next resistance and to some extend I'm thinking that if we can get to $35k-$38k, there could be some correction along the way.",

The power of bitcoin and what it stands for is generating strong confidence again. 30k is really a big range with a lot of pressure, but I guess bitcoin will break it before the correction happens.",

How do you mean the price of bitcoin is high while the satoshi is weak? isn't that the same?That is in accordance with the target of your plan to sell bitcoin before the price drops and the profits are used for business. I think your pattern is pretty good where to build two businesses in real projects and one business in bitcoin to continue to start accumulating again.After your wife's business is going well, then at least you won't have any more pressure to sell bitcoin in the near future, in the sense that you have to wait for ATH again, I know that everyone's mindset is different in taking profits, it's better to wait some time for bitcoin to rally again.Just keep the bitcoins you have now and build that portfolio again.",
