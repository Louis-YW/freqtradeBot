  "content": "I have found and read through numerous threads on the forum about the spreading of bitcoin awareness and adoption by many forum members. Two of the widely used methods from this threads that I have read are; Class room teachings and using bitcoin as a payment method for ones business. This is a great way to increase bitcoin adoption spread to others, but isn’t this done at the detriment of the advocate’s safety and privacy? One of the main aim of bitcoin from its inception by satoshi is not just to protect our money but also to protect the user. Therefore by spreading bitcoin awareness in countries or communities that it’s government are against it, should be done cautiously. Because once the government decides to take strict actions against the users, some of the advocates that spread it publicly or use it in their businesses will easily be traced and could be convicted for breaking the law, and I don’t think even Satoshi will appreciate that. I feel like bitcoin should be spread in these kind of communities secretly and cautiously to avoid exposing our privacy and hampering our security. It should only be thought to people that show interest and not going to schools to teach them because that is like breaking the laws of the community or country, and bitcoin or Satoshi himself is not have law breakers or criminals as it’s users or advocates just like how the media and government portrays it. So before spreading bitcoin awareness, first of all take care of your own security First. If you can then leave the advocacy for that period. Bitcoin Uniqness will surely pave way for itself like it has been doing through the years.",

Such individuals might immediately be a soft target of criminals. As Op said, there is a need to uphold security and privacy. There is no need to engage in open bitcoin awareness in a country where the coin is banned. Some of these laws forbid not only the use of Bitcoin but the spread of information that promotes it. Engaging in bitcoin awareness in such an area is dangerous and could lead to severe punishment. We are encouraged to engage in the promotion of bitcoin but it should be done considering the laws of the land. And bitcoin education is not by force but by choice. Bitcoin awareness and adoption will keep growing as the currency becomes more influential in the global financial system.",

How is teaching others matters to your bitcoin privacy, if you need to teach others then it's your own personal obligations to ensure that the environment you're using allows for that and the government does not kicked against bitcoin or cryptocurrency in that your country, you teach people or not, bitcoin is fast moving in adoption and cannot be stopped, not even the government, if you choose to let people know you're into bitcoin, that's your personal decision and that doesn't increase or reduce where bitcoin has gone to as at today, don't also accept bitcoin for your payment if your government banned it uses in your country, but if you completely understand how you can go private with bitcoin transaction then you can accept and don't make it public.Quote from: EL MOHA on July 19, 2023, 11:48:36 AMSo before spreading bitcoin awareness, first of all take care of your own security First. The security begins with the kind of wallet you used, it must be decentralized and not a centralized online wallet, we must not advertise ourselves for what we do when there's a regulation against it from the governing authorities, then we must know to take security measures very important without the intruding of a third party in knowing our security measures or keys.",

Officially, Bitcoin is allowed as a legal tender only in the following countries: SourceHowever, a large number of countries (e.g. here in Europe) support Bitcoin as an indirect means of payment via crypto-credit cards. For example, you load an account with a payment provider (Bitpanda, ...) with cryptos of your choice and receive a card with which you can officially pay - at least where credit cards are accepted.

In these countries, however, any (technical) adaptation of (blockchain) services will probably be banned immediately. I am afraid that in the countries concerned, the legislative possibility must first be created in order to be able to think about an adaptation of cryptocurrencies in the broad mass.",

Taking my country as an example, the CBN instructed all commercial banks to freeze bank accounts of individuals linked with crypto activities, but it didn't say it's a crime for holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in my wallet. There's no law stating that I would be arrested for wearing a Bitcoin branded tshirt, using a Bitcoin sticker on my car, accepting Bitcoin as payment in my local business, or hosting a crypto seminar. So looking at it from the legal point of view I cannot be arrested and I don't think anyone as been arrested for the above mentioned.",

Just do your part at your own comfort as you can never convince people to believe about bitcoin forcing them to learn especially when their concern is not to break the law made by the government. In fact, this forum alone is a good outlet to spread awareness as we welcome a lot of newbies that are interested to learn about bitcoin and how  it can be used in the real world.",

Because if the teaching place is carried out by opening open classes, and for example the rules in that country strictly prohibit bitcoin. It is certain that if the person who opened the bitcoin class gets caught by the government, they will definitely be given sanctions or penalties according to the rules in that country.But if, for example, you open a bitcoin class in a country where by law and the law does not prohibit bitcoins, it is certain that from a legal perspective, it will be safe.

If you can then leave the advocacy for that period. Bitcoin Uniqness will surely pave way for itself like it has been doing through the years.The issue of security must definitely be prioritized when opening a teaching about bitcoin. Because the spread of bitcoin always raises pros and cons, because bitcoin still sounds foreign to some people. So it's not just a matter of rules and laws that must be considered. But the matter of views, and the reactions of the people around must also be taken into account. Because if the results of the spread of bitcoin awareness bear negative results among the people around, it is certain that people's views will change towards the person who teaches bitcoin.",
