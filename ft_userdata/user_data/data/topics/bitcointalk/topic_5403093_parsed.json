      "body": "Liquidation first. Trader and gambler capitulation next. Then, miner capitulation.After all, anger and depression must be next phases. We are still in panic phase and depression will occur together with miner capitulation. A long way to go.Anyway you should not look at short sighted picture. Let's envision what will happen next 2 years, in 2024: next halving; US election are two big events. 4 years cycle with possibly 2 bullish years and 2 bearish years. When bullish and bearish ones start, we don't know, let's wait.",

Where do you think is the bottom? The discussion of bottom is taking over in this bear and nobody knows for sure where is bottom.Quote from: Robert518 on June 18, 2022, 01:23:41 PMThe market, as I understand it, will then reverse and begin to rise again. So, what exactly happens to cause the reversal?Nothing is new with bitcoin. Reversal will definitely start somewhere but not certain where. However, I look at a higher time frame spike to see how the reversal could start but that may be a correction either. The next month candle should be a signal if there will be a correction or reversal.",
