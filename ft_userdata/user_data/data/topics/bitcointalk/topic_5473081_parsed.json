  "content": "Maybe I'm writing wrong here, but I assume that on this board are new and old people can gather, maybe in gambling only a handful of people, I realize that gambling threads are one of the requirements for gambling signature campaign participants, at least 5 posts per week must be fulfilled, it's like a requirement to be completed, so that weekly missions are worth paying for, more easily new people may not be there yet on gambling board.Maybe the user rank up here are accepted on siganture campaign (judging by the signature used), I congratulate you, because it is not easy to make such gambling posts with many visitors and in quality assessments.I've been asking myself for a long time, even though I made a reply in the thread but there are obstacles that I want to ask. Look sir, I don't see pined in gambling discussions, the question is whether the rules are the same as how to create quality links on other boards? including how to write, sources, and how to get the information must be attached? or how do you think about matches? Or is prediction carelessly? there are rarely any sources on any prediction. Please don't misunderstand sir, I just want to learn from quality sports commentators like you and write about it, because the game will continue to be held in all cities and countries in all circles, also in this forum the contribution of signature campaign games is often held, enlivened with signature mixers, signature memes and other siganture. Because these are the facilities and advantages of the forum as a source of income for users in the bitcointalk forum in general and each person has the right to apply.There is nothing wrong with learning to be active on all boards early on for anyone, right sir,? to participate in future campaign needs for those who are eligible.Your answer will hopefully motivate all ranks on this forum including the new ones.",

      "body": "Writing rules are the same everywhere, if you wants to copy paste something then add quote tags and provide a source link otherwise you might be banned, a recent case indicates that. And just to clarify I don't make any posts in gambling discussions because I don't gamble but most of the discussions in Gambling are not always related to gambling but about sports too like Cricket which I love to discuss but I still don't make any post there and contribute in cricket discussion also (due to some reason I don't want to disclose).But I have to say, the posting rules, ethics, and norms are the same everywhere, if you wanted to reply under some thread then it should be a good one like not pasting, or rephrasing, or it would be good to remove grammatical mistakes from it.",

      "body": "For none gambling habit or idea its quite hard. So if you are gonna join in campaign that involves posting on gambling its quite not appropriate unless you are prolly into gambling sites. Its absurd that some posting on gambling just to get the required quota on signature even though they dont have knowledge on this field. For me stick to non gambling signature if you are not really into that cause youll pressure yourself too much.",

      "body": "The most important step in making quality posts in any board is to have an interest in the topic of the board. Do not join gambling related campaigns if you do not have an interest in the gambling board, same goes for any other board, always align with posts that comes naturally to you.There is no sticky for the gambling discussion board, but here's a detailed description of what to do;\"Discussion of sports games and other gambling-related topics which are separate from games and services themselves.\"Combine this and general posting etiquette and you'll be good.",

      "body": "That's a challenge you have to decide that you must overcome. I believe that of you put in additional effort to follow up with the discussion in the gambling board, you will see some threads you can contribute something a bit reasonable although it might not be as reasonable as you would do if you are replying or creating a post in a board you are very much familiar with.  It's a challenge that I'm also facing but I just look for some thread I have some knowledge on and give my own contribution to the best I my knowledge.There are times it might require me to search out for some information on the thread I intend responding to and I will just do it before making my reply.For now I am not strong enough to start up a thread in the gambling board so I just stick to making replies pending when I will have anything reasonable to share with board.",

Even people who never used a gambling app.My suggestion is: be a legit user. Use many different gambling platform.  Write reviews of the apps you tried. Try to make money. Share your win and losses. Research about how to make money. Look for different tools. In the end, be interested about gambling, read about it and learn about it, and share. There is no other way imo.",

Or is prediction carelessly? there are rarely any sources on any prediction. If you read the threads created to discuss the rules of the forum, you will see that there wasn’t any distinction what so ever as to where posting rules are applicable to so this means every board Carries same rules. Anything that could get banned or tagged on other boards will still apply to the gambling boards. The reason why you don’t see much of a link in that board mostly in terms of predictions is because they are just speculations by the poster and not a copy and past but if is the later you see the link been attached but if the posters doesn’t tag it and he his busted them plagiarism rule is applied to him. My own suggestion is when posting on gambling section just be on a thread that you actually engage in. Even if the thread is just one you can all your posts there other than visiting other threads that you don’t have engage in. If you’re a football fan still to its thread most especially the league you watch most",

      "body": "Look OP, it seems like you're not really getting what this is all about.  The way you're looking at it is off-base.  You gotta take some time to actually understand how things work here before jumping to conclusions.  If you wanna be a part of what we've got going on - the forum, the campaigns, all of it - you should probably focus more on learning the basics first instead of making assumptions out of thin air. I mean why make such a fuss out of this? Its not that complicated.  There's no secret formula, but common sense plays a big role.  You want in on a signature campaign, you just follow the rules, don't spam, an d make relevant and informative posts.  As for writing in the gambling section, it's the same – provide valuable input and follow the board's guidelines.  No reason to overthink it and go on some huge rant over nothing.",
