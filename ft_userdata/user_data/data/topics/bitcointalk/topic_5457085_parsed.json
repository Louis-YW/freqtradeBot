So I just follow his advice even till now.Now, after analyzing the market, I was sure that once the $27k resistance will be broke, then BTC could easily reach above $28k plus there were many sentiments are in favor of crypto. I was expecting this boom in market previous week but previous week market went into correction and touched 24,900$ well, that was a good time though and many big investors from USA bought many shares of MicroS strategy which is equals to indirectly buying of BTC. The point is, currently I do have 90% surety that market might touch 29,500$ if something more positive came up like the new EDX exchange proposal by USA and other market sentiments will keep this spike up maybe it touches 29,500$ after a little correction. Let's see what happened next.",

If the green should only be considered as the best time to enter the market, I think it won't always be a right decision. Not always. Green is the best time but if you can identify the end of red to the beginning of green then you are good to go. The indicator that can determine this I think it is RSI because with RSI you can determine overbought or oversold thereby making your decision. Also you can use MA to support RSI on that.Quote from: Y3shot on June 21, 2023, 12:06:47 PMGoing into the market when it is green is just greedy sentiment for trading. How? When the market is green, that is suppose to be the right time for possible profit if you do your research. What matters is how long the green will last before the red appear. Of course there are different timeframe, 1 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 4 hours, Week and months. So depending on the time you are trading, the longer the time the better the chances.",

The market operates 24/7 and there are buyers and sellers who interact with each other through exchanges. A wrong position of trader A can give a good chance to earn profit to Trader B. If buyers are wrong, sellers are right and vice versa.QuoteSome traders feels when the market is red it is always a wrong time to get into the market to trade.

All traders are greed because they chase profit but if the majority of traders are greedy with Green candles, they are buying and longing, if you are calm enough and smell like the market will turn over soon, you can sell your bitcoin or open a short position.",

Going into the market when it is green is just greedy sentiment for trading. some traders most especially newbies don't do analyses before entering the market, they don't really know the appropriate time to enter the market, all what they follow is the market color, when its green they believe that's the best time to enter and when its red they believe that's the best time to leave, but not all green is the sign of bullish moment.Quote from: Y3shot on June 21, 2023, 12:06:47 PMSometimes when the market is red it can also be a good time to enter the market if carefully watched.  Not all green ends up with profit and not all red ends with loss too.Traders needs to learn when is the right time to enter the market and not to judge when to enter with a particular signal.  Signals are unprecedented and may change faster than it's expected. Also why do you have to wait for market to be green before entering the market, when the market is red which is the appropriate time to enter, but you didn't enter but the market start turning green you think its the best time to enter. when the market is red, you are suppose to enter the market and wait for when the market is green so that you can sell and leave the market.",

There could be many reasons to why some don't buy when the market was low such as maybe they were not being informed or maybe they lack much financial help to make an investment at that particular period of time, we can see that there are many factors which could serve the reason since not everyone has the same opportunity as others has to be among the early birds for adoption or investment with the use of bitcoin.Quote from: Y3shot on June 21, 2023, 12:06:47 PMOne of the challenges of some traders is that they don't know when is the right time to enter the market.I don't think any experienced trader will have this as a challenge because they would have been so used to the whole system except for the newbies in trading bitcoin, who will have to go through the normal procedures of learning on the right timing to buy or sell bitcoin with respect to the market.",

That's why we need to learn about technical analysis for proper trading. Sometimes we see a bulltrap in the market and many users enter the market at that time by doing emotional trading. We have to wait for the best time and must focus on chart, if you see a good support level and a stable price then you can enter in the market. Always we must remember that we must be aware from FOMO, FUD and emotional trading. And should never trade against the trend. It's better to put a stop loss from a little bit lower level of Support Zone.",

Right time is on the time that we are seeing reds but you cant blame out people on why they had missed on doing so? It is just because on the time that we are really that dealing up with a bear market or something that we called that the price is really that too low, then we would be thinking that the market might even dropped even more on which means that there are two things on which i do really believe on, on why people do miss out on buying coins on these best time. 1. Fear,anxiety,hesitance and other correlated emotion2. Trying to chase the bottomThis is why. on the time that we do see greens then this is where we do really decide on accumulating on which it is really that something not that right.You should have done it earlier where the price are still low and not on the time that on increased pace.",

But I just think some are just more encouraged to buy when prices are high, maybe because they think the price will continue to surge high so they immediately buy hoping they will instantly make profits from that. Well, some may be taking profits but as far as I know, most of them have lose and were not able to recover their capital since after they bought, prices have immediately dropped low and have no clear targets when they will start to recover.",

To me, when the market is showing a red line, it signifies for you to buy and accumulate more and also not the right time for one to exit the market. The green sign only depicts that you try and earn maximum profit as a short time trader before it turns red. And it is also not a good sign to buy, it might just be hype and it won’t last long. The fall might be greater than the rise, and will affect badly most especially the short time investors.",

Going into the market when it is green is just greedy sentiment for trading.To be honest, when I first started investing in cryptocurrency, my emotions told me to buy when the price was rising since it appeared to be rising further. But, unfortunately, when you buy while the price is already up, there is a high risk that the price will fall down below your purchase price. However, this does not imply that you must buy while the price is falling; in fact, this is a bad idea as well. According to my observations in the market, the optimum time to buy is when the weakness of the red candlesticks begins to show up or when the candlesticks begin to sideways.",
