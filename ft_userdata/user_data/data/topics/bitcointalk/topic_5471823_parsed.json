Will it die a slow death ?Instead of looking forward to the opportunity it brings that comes with risks, why not look for other cryptocurrencies to find better opportunities. I personally view FTT as a thing of the past although it will probably still have its supporters and FOMO every time there is new favorable news but overall it still has a lot of potential to lose money. To say it is dead is completely wrong, but can trust be rebuilt after so many problems have occurred? Its collapse has already been exposed, so there's no need to get too involved with it. They still have a lot of things to do if they want to come back. In the immediate future, they need to resolve legal issues, lawsuits, and assets lost users on FTX.",

Specifically for FTX cases, they aren't greedy but simply swindle the money. That aint greed, but pure criminals.And you are here comparing the wrong things. Bitcoin was built purely decentralized way, you cannot compare it with cases such as FTX. Now, back to OP, FTT has something to do with the embezzlement of the funds, so there won't be any future. Some recent news FTX wants to restart its exchange, but I believe even if it happens, they won't gain traction.",

Isnt that ftt is alreadt dead but a lot of users have failed or lost money with that and some also gained a lot from it. I think its better to look for a new one to have a better start of an investment which you could monitor. You dont want to invest on a project with bad history of its founder.",

Too big a dirty spot on the reputation.You can lose your money without even buying FTT, but choosing any other altcoin as an investment. Because there is no guaranteed profit in the cryptocurrency market. But by investing in FTT, you will have more chances to get a big profit than by investing in another altcoin, since the chance of restarting FTX is very high.",

They defrauded people and deprived them of their funds during the bear market bottom. If someone had $100,000 there and planned to buy BTC @ around $20k, today they would have $75,000 in profit alone, which FTX deprived them of. even if they give back what they stole, they will not give back the \"potentially lost benefits\". people have already had their funds blocked for a year. This is damage that cannot be swept under the rug. This stock exchange will not recover and 400 mln $ marketcap is way to much for such a swamp.",

And rumors of FTX revival circle around. None of them will be true for obvious reasons. FTX is a tainted name synonymous to fail. No one serious would touch to any of that.And obviously FTT will go even lower after that. And then there will be a time when no CEX even want it because volume will dry out. Then some people will dca it insane amounts and pump and dump it on some dex, because those are only ones left to trade it.That's how i see it playing out.",

I can't say whether FTX will be rebooted or not but the chance is still there. https://news.bitcoin.com/ftx-debtors-evaluate-bids-for-dormant-crypto-exchanges-revival/That news said that various parties were interesting to rebooting FTX exchange site. FTX had also become the second largest exchange site last year. Some parties were also seeing it as an opportunity to revived it again. The price of FTT will be so stable till there will be a good news that will be coming from FTX. The relaunch of FTT will obviously pump FTT back again at the top. There are still ongoing negotiations to recover FTX. I hope all will be going so well. FTT investors could get what they deserved back again.",
