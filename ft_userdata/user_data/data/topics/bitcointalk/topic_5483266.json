There is a BTCPay Server[1] if you want to accept payments in Bitcoin.But if you mean a payment processor called Electrum, I found some of them when I searched on Google, and I think they are scam. In any case, there is no connection between them and Electrum Bitcoin Wallet, and there are better alternatives, so do not use them.[1] https://btcpayserver.org/",

Please be more specific as your question does not make any sense. Electrum is a Bitcoin wallet that is available for both mobile and desktop, it does allow its users to use LN and make payments over the counter, there is a tutorial available in the forum about it. You can refer to this thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5259973.0, the images have some issues but you would get a lot of information on how to setup and use it.",

I'm not sure if you're talking about another kind of \"Electrum\" that processes payments. And what do you mean by using bitcoin to buy less legal things? What are the examples of those? Drugs? If yes, then that's not considered less legal, that's actually totally illegal lol. Any currency can be used to buy and sell illegal stuff though, so that kind of thinking towards bitcoin is an old misconception.",

Bitcoin for me is a protection of my assets for a possible retirement plan.This is for sure, most of us are bitcoin investors and we are looking for profit, we are not looking for another means of payment. But many people do not dare to admit it, they always say that they consider bitcoin as currency but they have never or have never used bitcoin for payment. Many people here, like you and me, are trying to accumulate bitcoin to make as much profit as possible. But if you ask them, they will tell you to use bitcoin as currency, not to use it as an investment and lose its original purpose   . Nowadays, it is very difficult and rare to find someone using bitcoin as a payment method.",

I remember the advice I gave to my friend when he opted to buy a car with Bitcoin for his wedding, I was like man what the fuck bro, why would even think of spending that much BTC @0.08btc on something that's loses value over and he immediately taught same too and paid for car with fiat instead of his precious Bitcoin.",

I do not understand this part of your question I know that you are talking about electrum being a payment processor which it is not that famous for there are other payment processors more well-known and specifically designed for that function than electrumNow what do you mean by buying less legal things? You are buying illegal products with bitcoin? Or you think it is illegal to use bitcoin as a currency? Because if it is the second one then it depends on your country’s rules and regulations if your country has no problem with cryptocurrency and your merchant is even accepting bitcoin then you do not need to worry at allI do not understand what “than btc is so popular” mean though English might not be your first language and this shall not deter you but please work on your sentence construction",
