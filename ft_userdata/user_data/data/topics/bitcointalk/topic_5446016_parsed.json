      "body": "Hi, is it possible if you can provide more pictures of your team under this project? I have noticed that under Censis Team, three (3) photos were posted but you failed to provide for their respective names. In addition, I am 80% sure that at least one or two of these people are AI generated photos due to the overall outlook, layout, imbalances, and disproportion angles they contain.Check the reference below: FIRST PICTURE:The collar of the shirt is not the same- as you can see there is a black line on the right side as opposed to none on the left side. Glasses are a bit off which looks like it was placed unnaturally. SECOND PICTURE:Teeth are not proportionate and there are like hair particles on his bonnet. THIRD PICTURE:This one somehow looks natural but I still have my doubts since there are hair particles everywhere.**Take this with a grain of salt but you are required to at least show further pictures and proof of their identity. Failure to provide otherwise will compel me to create a scam accusation against this project as this constitute prima facie evidence of false advertising. If anyone could also check the veracity and identity of these pictures, please do so.",

Nothing about the time members. This is a wallet application you want people to keep their funds and nothing about the team info. I will not download the app talkless of using the app",

The censis wallet is not active here it looks outdated or something and that will be troubling if someone eventually download and use it, money will hang. OP, should do proper findings as regarding to what to feed the public especially investment and wallets.",
