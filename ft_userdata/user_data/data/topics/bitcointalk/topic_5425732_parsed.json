We all experience loss, it may be the death of a loved one, a pet or a big sports game, failing in a job interview etc. Whatever negative things you experience in life, it’s important to keep your head up & never give up. Human beings are resilient, we can suffer a lot & it may not feel fair but we can fight back & succeed if we put everything we have into doing something.If you lose money trading or gambling you can make it back, just take a little time away & come back swinging later.",
