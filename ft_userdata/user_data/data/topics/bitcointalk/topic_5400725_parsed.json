They have enough time to prepare for the finals, its their advantage but of course Celtics are fresh from the win and that could be their advantage as they still have that momentum. I would like Warriors to win the championship again, I'll take that odds.",

Whatever the betting odds, I'm still confident on taking the Warriors, but not gonna bet with a handicap, I'll take the odds on what the bookies are currently offering. If this will go game 7, it's going to be an epic series, but like I said, I'm on the Warriors.",

So let's discuss guys, what team do you think will win and why?Got warriors for this because Celtics have 2 legit shooters while GSW have 4, also if we look at the system we can say that GSW have this and their players adopt it very well so I guess the same with other people telling that GSW will be the champion this season I will agree to them and also they already defeat Boston on regular season so most provably the pressure is less on their side for that.",

It will likely be a close match 'till the end. The Celtics have beaten them a couple of times with an overwhelming lead so that they can win this.  I'm going with the Celtics this time.",

Well,  fans knows what team to defend because the Warriors have been here before and they were successful most of the time in the NBA Finals, now that they are back, they might take the opportunity to win that trophy again.",

Warriors have the advantage of playing in home court first. Because of this, I wonder how strong they will be able to start the series. On the other hand, I started to think that playing in home court doesn't change too many things anymore. These teams are both very capable teams to beat each other in any case. I hope that the series can end after seven games. My favourite team are Celtics in this series.",

Also that line for over/under will be rough. Celtics are good at defence while Warriors are deadly in attackYou feel it will be an easy win sake of the home-court advantage? The last game Goldenstate Warriors had with Boston Celtics was in 1963-1964 season when  Golden State Warriors were the San Francisco Warriors. This will be a big time revenge for Boston Celtics even as the play away and has you highlighted they have won several times in away games in the playoff so there is possibility Celtics give their all to win",

So let's discuss guys, what team do you think will win and why?Warriors will get it done in 6 or less. Celtics have overcome odds to beat the nets, last year's winners and last night the heat. But is jayson Tatum the best player, could argue wiggins is on the same level. Defensively I think celtics have the edge, smart is excellent but often he does try and be too much of a hero. Horford is a smart player but does he have the clutch gene, I don't think so. Brown can't handle the basketball and although they have done exceptionally well, I don't think they have enough to get it done. If your a basketball fan what more can be said about Kerr and the backcourt duo of curry and Thompson. I expect a clinic from both players.",

The Warriors last Finals appearance was on 2019 against the Raptors and they were defeated that same year.As for me, I already expected that the Celtics will be the ones to survive and to advance towards the Finals this year. What I didn't expected is that the Miami Heat forced themselves a Game 7 because I expected that the Celtics will close the series in their home but Jimmy Butler carried the team and went on beast mode.",

So let's discuss guys, what team do you think will win and why?Besides experience and home court advantage, the Warriors also have the best 3 point shooter in NBA history, and have to be anxious to prove that while injuries held them back the last 2 seasons, this year they're healthy and still the best team in the NBA.  Boston has been building for a long time for this moment too, but in today's NBA that's built on 3 point shooting, you have to give the Warriors the advantage here.  I'm looking for Tatum to have some big games in this series, but ultimately I think Klay and Wiggs are going to be able to lock down Tatum and Brown while Boston has no answer for Steph.  Should be a great series.  I wonder who Marcus Smart will be guarding...",

The core players are intact and as we can see on this team on how well they do execute in terms of offense and defensethen you could really tell that this isnt something that other teams cant beat up.Speaking with shooters then Warriors does have more but although im not really that underestimating or looking down on my fav team celts but i would hands down on Warriors for this time and odds arent that bad imho.",
