The downside is that the bull run does not come with the halving but several months or a year after.Quote from: Rruchi man on September 29, 2023, 07:24:36 AMI imagine that every miner is also hodling bitcoins and will still benefit the other way from the halving. Am I wrong? Is there anyone amongst us who is strictly a miner that depends on the rewards from mining as income to sort expenses and is not hodling any?All miners invariably hold bitcoins since they are competing to win the mining reward. They need to cover operational cost regularly which will be affected by the halving.Quote from: Rruchi man on September 29, 2023, 07:24:36 AMHow should miners prepare for the halving?I imagine there will be a temporary drop in hashrates if some rigs close down due to high operational cost and a halved reward. This will balance out after some time if the market enters a bull run.Although I expect they will be preparing for it and have already started saving from their current gains.- Jay -",

According to the above report, it will be equal to avg cost of mining, which varies greatly from one mining pool to another. Therefore, we cannot say that the price of 30,000 is profitable for everyone, and according to  technical analysis, there are no major resistance levels after 31,900, so when it is broken This level we will reach ~38k-42k easily.",

If you are forced to immediately sell your coins to cover mining expenses, I think you shouldn't be mining.

Bitcoin mining is no longer profitable for individuals and I couldn't care less about how big companies prepare for the halving, except philipma from this forum. By the way, my assumption is that some miners sell hardware before the halving happens, put that profit into bitcoin or altcoins till the new miner is released by Bitmain or another company and they immediately buy it to mine and profit as much as possible till the difficulty increases further because of new, improved and more powerful miner.",

The rewards are halved, bitcoin will become more valuable, which means more people are going to use and transact with it, which means extra money for the miners. Will it be enough to cover for the profit that they are losing when the halving commences? I'm not sure myself it could depend on what rig they have and all other factors, but when the halving comes everybody wins so it's not like they are going lose a lot of money in the process. Besides, this has been a 4 year thing which will happen until the final halving comes in about 2140, so they better have prepared themselves for this eventuality.",
