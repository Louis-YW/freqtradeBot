That's why we still uses Tor or mixing services. However, Tornado Cash was hunt down and put down for good. But there will be others going to replace it. And we still have bitcoin mixer that we can used so that no one can trace us.Not sure about the criminals though, for ordinary crypto enthusiast, we really have to think on how to be private in this crypto world. Maybe privacy coins and just like what I said, mixers as well.",

As long as governments still want to control their citizens, they will strictly monitor the existence of these projects and take action when needed, just like what happened with Tornado Cash. As we know, cryptocurrency is still controversial in some countries, and they still try to fit in and be able to walk along with the government's policy. We're compromised. I think it's really difficult for an absolutely anonymous and private token or coin to develop in the real world. But, fingers crossed, technology is always developing. We'll see in the future.",

I agree your sentiment about this kind of people being paranoid for there crypto since there is no way for your wallet to determine ownership by others unless you are posting it voluntarily in the public so that everyone knows. The government will not do background check on our account if don’t do something wrong against the law. This paranoid guys make crypto worst since they are making crypto privacy complicated that always results for the law to become stricter and more regulated.",

Anonymity significantly increases the risks in the cryptocurrency market. Therefore, reasonable regulation of cryptocurrencies by states is necessary and useful.On the other hand, states cannot allow significant amounts of money to circulate on their territory that they cannot control. Therefore, cryptocurrencies will eventually either be regulated or banned.",
