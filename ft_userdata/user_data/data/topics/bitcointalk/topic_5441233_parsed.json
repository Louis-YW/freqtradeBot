I am unsure of your current progress, but I suggest that you consider having the book reviewed by seasoned experts in the field before its publication. This feedback will provide valuable insights and ensure that the book is accurate and informative.As an example, while browsing through the available content, I came across page 30 where I noticed the following:\"On 17th November 2009, a public forum at www.bitcointalk.org was bornand founded by Satoshi (he was head admin until almost 2011).\"I checked the Whois info for the \"bitcointalk.org\" domain and it seems like it was only created in 2011.
