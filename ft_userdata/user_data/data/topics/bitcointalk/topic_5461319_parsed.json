I don't know about this experience because I've never done it, maybe there is a pressure part when they are gambling if they don't win then they have to pay back the loan from other money, but for me there is definitely a pressure that is felt even though they will say it's the same as no interest on the loan.",

You might be right to an extent, but I have few people that I know that have collected loan on this forum before. I know four people that collected loan on this forum before, only one person used it for trading, the remaining three people use it for life related things which is neither trading nor gambling. Let us leave that alone because it is not even the main discussion. Borrowing money to gamble is stupidity. A responsible gambler will never do that.",

I mean gamblers don't have to worry if they lose their bet. because they have income that can be used to cover loans.although such a practice is not really encouraged. but in reality, most likely all that was done. if gamblers already have funds that they can use as backups to pay off loans, such as the salary they will definitely get at the end of the month. then there will be no pressure in the game. it might be different when the borrower doesn't have the monthly or weekly salary to do that. so in thinking of gambling, he can't afford to lose.",

Not at once, but as I continued to gamble with it and all got lost to gambling.Someone can borrow money from anyone, including several agents for gambling capital, this is possible, but I can say that this is not a good option to choose from. Someone who is very confident in himself or with their luck will not hesitate to seek a loan, addiction has stuck to them and emotions have moved under their subconscious. I have felt in this position when I ran out of money because of gambling but my passion and emotions kept pushing me to keep doing it, so there was no other way but to borrow money to raise capital and as a result you may already know that in the end I lost again. That's enough, and I would never suggest someone gamble using borrowed money, or purposely borrow money for them to gamble. There will be a lot of pressure that you feel when gambling using borrowed money, and if you can't stop it immediately then one day you will feel how it feels to be in debt.",

I tried it before where I loaned money in order to gamble and the end result was the expected- my debt increased and I extended my loan in order to answer for the expenditures it costed for me to gamble.At the end of the day, this really boils down on the reason on why you gamble in the first place. If you are chasing for profits, then expect losses at the same time due to the nature of it. If you gamble for entertainment, then the value on how much you bet is somehow irrelevant.The lesson is here is to AVOID gambling using loaned money as the result is something that can further pile up and increase your debts/loan in the future.",

This is exactly what I’m thinking when I create this thread. I was tempted before to ask loan here just to gamble while waiting for my campaign salary to come but the interest rate discourage and your situation is exactly what I’m thinking whenever the loan money starting to burn on bets while you are thinking on how you will repay again the loan plus interest rate.Pressure is really high when you are on the brink of losing while you don’t have enough money to pay the loan on time once you lose the loan amount.@Oshondy, I totally agree with you. This is why I created this thread to get an insight on how user that doing this feel during actual game. If they feel pressured on gambling or just normal because we have different take on how we handle pressure and gambling.",

Debt implies risk and borrowing to play casino games implies a very high risk, whoever does so plays with fire.In poker there are also those who get into debt calculatedly, for example people who are good and are banked to play higher levels or at tables where there are fish with a lot of money but they do not have enough bankroll to withstand a bad streak of the level. Then they make a pact with someone who does have money and bankrolls them, taking a percentage of the profits. It's not bad, but I generally prefer to avoid any kind of debt.",

This is the main concern and problem with the loan money as you are overridden with emotions and due to that you are more likely to lose. Also it become impossible for you to enjoy the gambling because the only thought that surrounds your mind is to win and return the amount to the lender.",
