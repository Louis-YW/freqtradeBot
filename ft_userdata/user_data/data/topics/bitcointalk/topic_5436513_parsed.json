No manual intervention? This is also a good feature but not something new as well.You should think of something else if you want to claim that you're the best online casino. I'm also waiting for your response to AmoreJaz's question. What's the point of automatic conversion?",

Actually, I have created accounts both on Freebitcoin and on Stake and neither of those have asked me for documents during the registration process.One can have one's account ready to go in just a minute, so I am afraid this feature which has been mentioned in this thread is nothing special. A casino needs more than shifty account creation to compete in this market.",

I think this is what your Deck infographic means when they connect blocks of the jigsaw puzzles. It's quite tricky to do this since the casino is collecting more data than just the KYC documents.",

Gamblers always want to get their results instantly and they want to get everything easily.  So no one here will be interested in gambling to get MCL tokens using MCL tokens. kyc is not a big problem if a site is trusted and easy to use.Quote from: MCL.io on January 23, 2023, 07:42:22 PMQuote from: AmoreJaz on January 23, 2023, 07:22:14 PM Yes, there is an option to convert your MCL token back to the currency used for deposit. At the moment, MCL Token is listed on STEX, IDEX, and Hotbit. Other trading platforms will be announced soon.STEX, IDEX, and Hotbit completely shit exchangers. Hence the token listed in these cannot be considered as a potential token.  And when it comes to gambling with them, I doubt any potential gambler would gamble here",

Will you never ask us to do KYC?And preferably, your casino has main coins in addition to having your casino token coins so that crypto gamblers can have alternative coins for depositing.Before I forget, you should change the link above to Code:https://www.mcl-token.io/ because the link you provided becomes Code:ftp://https//www.mcl-token.io/.For the list of games, I think you can add other gambling games if you feel the need.",

And irrespective of testing, the KYC would be asked right at the registration time. This should be the norm for companies online that deal with money. I could only suspect desperation when casinos would not ask for the KYC at registration, while some are criminals themselves and they use the susceptibility of the internet to do as they like.They are such who might ask for the KYC later, while some might disappear with customers' money over time. And for the new casinos, they are truly not to be trusted, one should proceed with extreme caution.",

Better have an assurance that you will get your withdrawal, rather than waiting for days just to get it.What I have noticed here is that, reputable casinos or bookies in the forum have no problem when it comes to withdrawal even big ones.So are you going to take a risk for a small casino that you think may hold your withdrawal for no reason?But in any case, if you are utilizing your own casino token, should find more trading platforms so it won't be too difficult for your users to trade it with other currencies.",

Same experience or situation that had faced up or for sure for most people who had been dealing with crypto online casinos which most or all of them arent really asking for some KYC on the time that you do make outsome registration.These things could be found out on the time that you do win big or something that increases up your limits or trying to claim some bonuses which do requires these verification.You wouldnt really be that much minding if  ever you would really be that sending out those information if you do trust up the platform you've been dealing with.So far i havent sent one since im just a small fry gambler. hehe",

Will you be asked for KYC like other casinos?but actually even though you will be asked for KYC later when you want to withdraw a big win, it doesn't matter because it is as natural as other casinos. most importantly for small amount withdrawal i think no KYC needed.and a suggestion to the OP, if you really intend to market your gambling project it is better to create a single thread in the gambling section and respond to all the questions everyone here has. it would be better than you create a new thread with the same goal and leave without any more answers.maybe my advice you can consider.",
