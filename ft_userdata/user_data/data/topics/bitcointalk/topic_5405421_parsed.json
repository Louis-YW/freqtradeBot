  "content": "A unified system that brings together everything finance without restrictions. Virtual cards, physical cards, virtual bank accounts and many more, all in one system.Development of this system has begun and am happy to tell you that this is about 80% completed. The whole development budget has been taken care of by me.I need partners who would like to join me on this, this is not those shitty ICO projects we have around, this is a real FinTech platform that is ready to compete with the big players out there. I have a group i have created for interested partners, we shall discuss more there if you wish to join me on this.Regards.",

They're essentially banks where your stake in the bank is determined by how much you have invested there.Of course I don't know if there are many international companies like this (except for stocks).",
