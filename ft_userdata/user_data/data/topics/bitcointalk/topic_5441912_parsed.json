Lost private keys = lost bitcoins = a minus to the supply or amount of bitcoins in circulation. ¬†If Bitcoin supply is less than its demand the price of could go up. ¬†Satoshi once said: ‚ÄúLost coins only make everyone else's coins worth slightly more. Think of it as a donation to everyone.‚ÄùThat üëÜ always makes me uncomfortable. I actually hope it's possible to recover lost coins in the future with something like biometric. A very decentralized and secure biometric system tied to owner's coins should do.",

Just ask Erik Voorhees, who lost 2.6 million dollars worth of Bitcoin following the collapse of his mining operation back in 2013. If you've ever had access to someone else's wallet, or even just read about a cryptocurrency-related hack - then this article is for you!",

      "body": "If the private key is not lost, there are other ways in which cryptocurrency can become inaccessible, such as if the wallet owner dies without passing on the private key to anyone else. At such cases, the cryptocurrency in the wallet becomes permanently locked, and there is no way to recover it. So, important to note that the loss of private keys and inaccessible cryptocurrency does not mean that the entire Bitcoin network is useless. In 2023 and later, Bitcoin is still a viable and valuable currency, and there are many individuals and businesses who continue to use it for transactions and investments.",

Why God does care about the lost wallet and bitcoin ? Have lost 2 of my wallets having bitcoin inside(though only a little amount back then but today? those amount are seriously big) this is also the reason why nowadays I made sure to keep saving my wallet keys completely secured and will never be forgotten (like what I did in the past)and you are correct also that those bitcoin being lost are useless and cannot be recovered forever.",
