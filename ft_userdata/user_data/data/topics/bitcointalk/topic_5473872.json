I got ideas about bitcoin and bitcointalk forum by watching YouTube videos, I registered account in this forum to know bitcoin better and by studying daily regularly I was able to get better idea about bitcoin today. I had a hard time with one thing at first, because I live in a country where Bitcoin is still illegal, I didn't get any idea about Bitcoin from anyone. I am currently 30 years old, if someone had given me an idea about Bitcoin before 2010 or 2020, I would have made a lot of money investing in Bitcoin today. Luckily I came to know about Bitcoin 2 months ago by watching a youtube video. If I hadn't seen this YouTube video, I still wouldn't have got the idea about bitcoin. When I got the idea about bitcoin, the price of bitcoin was 25k to 26k. If I had invested in Bitcoin when it was 26k, I would have made a lot of profit today. I did not invest at that time as I did not have a good understanding of Bitcoin. Inflation in our country is increasing day by day. I didn't put all the savings I had in the bank, I bought land a few days ago for $10000. I still have $5000 in savings I bought bitcoin yesterday for $1000. I have another $4000, I will buy $100 worth of bitcoin every 15 days.The only reason I am posting this today is that I bought bitcoins from kucoin exchanger. I learned bitcoins are not secure in bitcoin exchangers. I chose a hardware wallet. Now my problem is that when I try to transfer bitcoins to hardware wallet, I see a fee of 0.0005 bitcoins, what is the reason for the high fee? A few days ago, it seems that it was 1-2 dollars. Fee will not be reduced? If the fee is not reduced then I will withdraw with this fee.",

It's a centralized exchange, you don't control wallet on Kucoin and you pay for their service. Services like exchanges, casinos and other companies have set their fee for withdrawing. If you want to transfer them in your hardware wallet, you have to pay those withdrawal fees but once you get them in your hardware wallet, you'll have a better control of your funds and you'll set fees on your own.I suggest you to use mempool.space when setting fees manually. From your post I think that you still have to learn a lot. You are more than welcome to post in beginners help section and hardware wallet section if you have any further questions about how to use hardware wallet.Btw which hardware wallet do you use? Ledger, Trezor or more advanced ones like Passport?",

Im not sure if theres an exchange lower than that but basically fees are incurred in trading and withdrawal on onchain crypto exchange. For that fee I think its fine already, cause theres no way you could lessen that unless the network is not congested and can process with a bare minimal fees.",

I hope you are aware of the risks of Bitcoin before investing. It will be much better if you hold long-term bitcoins. Because Bitcoin is a very potential coin and its future is very good. But of course you should since you have bought large amount of bitcoins and decide to buy regularly so buy a hardware wallet and keep them safe there. The increase in Bitcoin transaction fees is due to the sudden increase in the price of Bitcoin and more transaction requests than before. But it will come down soon today it has come down a lot already because 2 days ago it was $10-12 per transaction but today it is less than $3",

Fee will not be reduced? If the fee is not reduced then I will withdraw with this fee.Your choice of going self custody of your bitcoin is actually a great idea. For the past 1-2 weeks now we have been experiencing a high increase of transaction fee, in fact it is coming down right now because it had gone pass the 100 sats/vbyte mark before. The reasons is because of some ordinals and inscriptions that are feeling up the block size and are paying high transaction fees to get their transactions into the next block. With the block size relatively limited you need to pay high fee too to get your transaction confirmed. At the moment the fee is around 65 sats/vbyte which means that the fee set by KuCoin is extremely high and you can’t customize that because it is the standard charge they set, if the bitcoin is actually in other wallets I would have advised you to wait till the the mempool gets less congested and the fee is lower but since it is an exchange I wouldn’t want you to risk it and leave your funds there so I will say you should take the loss and just move your funds, $1000 isn’t a small amount at your place now and will be risky to lose it totally to exchange collapse or anything Note: you have to look at the address you’re withdrawing from KuCoin because I just saw that they have suspended the withdrawal of bitcoin to native segwit address type (address that starts with bc1q) and only have just the nested segwit address type withdrawal available (address that starts with 3).",

Kucoin is a CEX and they will ask a fixed fee except the mempool is really full and the current fee in Bitcoin on chain overtake their fixed fee, they will increase their fee (again it's fixed).Bitcoin fee is high because of ordinals spam.",

You don't need to regret that you were not aware of Bitcoin a long time ago because is still in it's infant stage. Since bitcoin is illegal in your country it will be great to learn how to keep your bitcoin private to avoid persecution from the government. Using a decentralized wallet and avoiding centralised exchanges will help protect you from government invasion of privacy. QuoteLuckily I came to know about Bitcoin 2 months ago by watching a youtube video.

Bitcoin price will definitely go up especially if the spot ETF is approved but buying now for short investment is risky. It could be profitable in the long run but projecting to make a profit in the short term might not be advisable. Buying Bitcoin using DCA is okay but the current price is high to target short-term profit..QuoteThe only reason I am posting this today is that I bought bitcoins from kucoin exchanger.

You can also consider suspending the transaction until the mempool is less congested which will help you in avoiding this high fees. Keeping your funds in a hardware wallet or a good decentralized wallet like Electrum is also okay. But never keep your funds in centralized exchanges because many of them have people to lose money.",

Is it that your country Currency is dramatically devalued? That is too much. In my country that is 10 million so I was imagining how many plot of land s did you buy with that amount of money. Buying of bitcoin has nothing to do with inflation. Bitcoin is not part of the inflation issue. So if you she the money you buy and if you don't have the money then you wait till you get money. Bitcoin can be bought with $5 and above. And you can use non custodial wallet to secure you funds. If you don't know how to use hardware wallet then Electrum wallet is very good for you to use and keep your coins. Yes the fee of bitcoin is like bitcoin itself.

Fee will not be reduced? If the fee is not reduced then I will withdraw with this fee.First of all, welcome to this forum. I hope this is not another made-up story. Recently, Poker Player created a thread asking for a board for made-up stories only. Anyways, Kucoin has had this fixed withdrawal for a long time. I don't know for how long, but usually CEX withdrawal fees are fixed no matter how much you withdraw from there. So this 0.0005 BTC is fixed. There is no way to decrease it. But once you transfer it to your wallet, you will be able to control your Bitcoin. You can control how much you want to pay as fees. I use Electrum as a daily wallet and for storing Bitcoin too.",
