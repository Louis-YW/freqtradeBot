Hi and thanks for your reply friend ¬†I know about that. but think its easier to just have a thread for tips where you can share all leagues instead of only one specific league & sport, here you can share bets from all leagues & sports combined, witch is how many people put their bets togheter.¬† For example I want to play and give tips about a double with one game from La Liga and one from Premier League.. many people will miss it out if i post in a specific league.This is just about give some betting tips no mather league or sport to all the other people on the forum",

But, it could be interesting to explore both options and see what works best for our community.",

Every one has his or her own unique way of playing to win. Another thing is the time of playing which varies from all some people believe in playing at a particular time with a particular pattern or way of paying which is quite different from the others.What I will advise you to do is to develop yourself in gambling on a particular game and do take note of times and of your Winnings so as to know when to play, your mood and reactions to your games at wins.",

Here I totally agree with you, friend, because following the tips or predictions given by other people is not necessarily successful and when we experience defeat we will definitely have disappointment and of course we will blame those who have shared tips or predictions with us.It is better to bet on sports matches that we understand in terms of teams and games so that it makes it easier to be able to make your own predictions.After all, making our own predictions is a way for us to add insight and experience in sports betting.",

He was correct about the under 2.5 goals, but he was wrong to predict Napoli to win. So the conclusion @OP lost his bet. The second bet he was predict Inter to win, but the result was draw. Again @OP was wrong. Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on April 18, 2023, 07:38:09 AMI think Napoli will win tonight and iit will be few goals in London. (under 2.5)Chelsea cant score and i dont think Real will push forward.Chelsea FC - Real Madrid = Under 2.5 goalsSSC Napoli - AC Milan = Napoli 3.34x @ Stake.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on April 19, 2023, 06:10:49 PMInter - Benfica today.I think Inter will win, they can play more relaxed with two goals up, but I think since Milan did go to semifinal, I think Inter will do whatever it takes to reach that semifinal to. This have giving dem a extra trigger to advance with a Milano-derby. I think its good odds that they winning the game tonight for 2.15X[/quote",

I think that is reasonable from your explanation. If you can monitor, follow up and give like above average predictions for your bets, you will have more bettors checking you out but if you are below expectation then you will be sure to go off very fast because every bettor have different prediction sites that they visit.Regarding the discussion of where this thread belongs, I think the mod will eventually take a decision to that Quote from: Nrcewker on April 20, 2023, 02:41:37 AMI think it‚Äôs not a good idea.
