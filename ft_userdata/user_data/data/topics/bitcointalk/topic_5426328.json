People is speculating that Bitcoin price will be pump due to its technology. This speculation gives value to the Bitcoin, the higher the expectations equals to the valuation of Bitcoin. This is same with other assets like gold, silver and real estates. People is the one defining the value lf the things based on its usability, availability and cost to generate or mine it.But If you are asking the specific people whoâ€™s buying then you are asking an impossible things to be answered here.",

Don't forget every time Bitcoin has been successfully mined, the difficulty will increase and it will affect with the calculation.Bitcoin price is really determine from the demand, how much anyone willing to buy Bitcoin? someone can buy Bitcoin with discount or premium price.",

The reported price is simply the price of the most recent trade on an exchange, or an average of most recent trades across different exchanges or over time. The precise source of a reported price depends on who is reporting it.",

Even managed to get some bitcoin along the way but sold it right away. OP is a typical nocoiner who came here to make some $$$ Quote from: udayantha11 on April 09, 2018, 11:08:52 AMi have done lot bounties 100+. but only paid 50 or low. but some bounties gave me equal to 2500$. so thats a big deal to me so i always motivated to do bounties.i would say for beginners , Do not give up. always try bounties. at least do the twitter or FB bounty In one post he claimed to have made over 10k from shilling shitcoins. Can't quote cause the thread is locked.OP was also recommending people to buy XRP in June 2019 because \"it's #3 coin and the future of banking\"  If you did that you'd be at a 50% loss for the last 3 years, despite the 2021 crypto bull run.",

He didn't even wear clickable signature, you did lol. I think it's more appropriate to say you're the one who come to this forum to earn since you're joining the signature campaign and want to become a campaign manager. As I can see he never participate any campaign since 2021 and post without getting any payment.",

It all happens in the market and the market consists of mostly of centralized exchanges, half a dozen of them are the main ones with more smaller exchanges and also altcoin exchanges that list bitcoin/fiat markets. There is also decentralized P2P markets (DEX, OTC trades, etc.) that don't have the same direct effects on the price but they indirectly affect the supply and demand equilibrium.",

Like any other market in the world, bitcoin is subject to supply and demand on the market in which it trades: The more people want it, the more expensive it becomes; less people want it, the cheaper it becomes. No one person or company determines bitcoin's value nor can we trade it in one place only; each market/exchange determines its price based on their set of rules. If you want to know the current price of bitcoin, you have to look at an average of all the exchanges where it's being traded. If a BTC is sold for $17,000 on one exchange and $16,500 on another, then the current price of bitcoin is likely somewhere in between those numbers. Price trackers like preev and others rely on this method to generate their information.",
