Heil Satoshi!We trully live in a bizarre world nowadays   I've read a lot of bullshits about cryptos, but this one is amoung the winners.I thought I had heard the worst when Greenpeace attacked the Bitcoin network with the slogan: \"Change the code, not the climate\".So according to them, Bitcoin (and altcoins ofc) creates financial damages to many minority investors because they don't have the knowledge to assess the risks associated with crypto.In another words, Bitcoin makes them loosing money because people are lazy to learn where they're investing in...L@@k at FTX and co...QuoteWe have observed that the volume of, and activity around, crypto assets have grownsignificantly in scale over the last five years with very large fluctuations in value.Many investors recently have suffered significant losses as a result of theirinvestments in crypto assets. It is estimated that these losses have been more than$2 trillion.1As a result of targeted marketing, a significant amount of these losses have beenborne by unsophisticated investors, including many minority investors seeking rapidinvestment growth without the knowledge or information to assess the risksassociated with such investmentsAndQuoteWe believe that virtually all, if not all, crypto tokens are securities and that they, as well as the platforms andcustodians dealing with them, are subject to regulation under the federal securities laws to protect investors.Accordingly, the offering of crypto asset securities and the platforms trading them should comply with theregistration, disclosure, anti-fraud provisions and other investor protector provisions of the federal securities laws.We think it is very unfortunate and disturbing that there are legislative proposals to carve crypto assets out of thefederal securities laws and undermine investor protection.The SEC should continue to be aggressive in bringing enforcement actions against companies that are violating thefederal securities laws in the crypto space, including, issuers, custodians and those acting as unregisteredplatforms that offer trading in crypto asset investments.https://www.sec.gov/files/20230406-iac-letter-cryptocurrency.pdf",

The minority investors are living in ancient times, it's their fault that they lack proper knowledge about this innovation. It's responsibility of governments to teach them about this technology rather than blaming it as racist. Risks are involved in every investment even stocks are volatile and can cause huge damage to those minority investors. Any investors whether a minority or majority should learn the basics of investing whether it's in crypto or any other financial asset. Risk management should be thought to everyone, no matter where they belong, but unfortunately no governmental institution teaches those skills.",

As Same hing happened to me as I wanted to buy Bitcoin at 27800 dollars and it remained at that that price for almost a lot of time and than I decided to wait and it suddenly shoot up and that was not good for me. As I am saying that we should be very careful for theses Bitcoin momentums.",

There are minutes and hours set to buy and sell in trading. And once you pass that stipulated time you can not buy again and sell again. And also seen the OP Topic, bitcoin is not fully racism but to some extent. Why bitcoin is not racist yet because it cut across the whole world and everyone who come across it can participate. Therefore it is liberal and welcome all to it. And why I would also say bitcoin has an element of racism because bitcoin moves with dollar. Bitcoin payment is determined by dollar rate and not Fiat currency exchange rate.",

Many consider BTC to be a speculative asset, due to unpredictable price fluctuations, an investment asset that has a lot of risks, without doing deeper research on the system and how it works. Things like this can make bitcoin's image damaged and look scary for people who are starting to invest in BTC.Even though if you examine more deeply about the ins and outs of bitcoin, in terms of usability, in terms of security, and in terms of potential, bitcoin has a lot of potential that other assets don't have. but the problem is, many people see BTC from a negative side, without seeing the positive side of BTC.And those who comment on the negative side of bitcoin are not only from ordinary people, but one of them is also an influential person, who also comments on the negative side of bitcoin.",

Should we maybe give people back the money they lose investing in stocks because they're \"vulnerable minorities\"? This dude is delusional! How can 2 investors be treated differently just because of race? If there's such distinction, maybe the SEC should create a fund that will cover their losses? I have a better idea! Maybe the FED should stop trying to make people lose jobs and make them lose 6% of their savings a year, because that's what devastates poor minorities, not their occasional crypto investments.",

I said ok, but that's will cost. hehe. I know, that's some next level bullshit. In this way the stock, bond and every other sector life is racist because some are making more money and some are not.
