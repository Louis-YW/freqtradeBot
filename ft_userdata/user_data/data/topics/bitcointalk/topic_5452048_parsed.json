Is this a bug?It's not a bug and you can probably still keep older Electrum version (as standalone or portable) in some cases when you need to send transactions without RBF, or just use alternative open source wallets like Sparrow.Having latest updated version of Electrum is better because they fixed some bugs, but with recent interface changes many people decided to stick with old versions a bit longer.",

What is more annoying, RBF is off for payments to LN, so it is not like they just deleted piece of code.There are also other annoying things in the latest releases (modified UI -> \"hidden\" settings, unconfirmed transactions are merged (!!) etc.).",

I just wonder why, if I have used previous version and had my setting saved, it was ignored and new version by default enables it.I don't know if that's a bug (that setting being enabled regardless of the previous setting) in versions between v4.4.1 & v4.4.3but to test it, I tried the latest version with a fresh config file and Electrum started with \"Batch unconfirmed transactions\" turned off by default.To check if they moved the setting to the wallet file which could cause Electrum to ignore the previous setting,I've enabled the setting and checked the freshly created \"config\" file if it added a \"batch_rbf\": true, line, and it did.So it's still saved in the config file, and with the test above, it's disabled by default.So if there's a previous setting, it shouldn't change by itself. (unless it's a bug in 4.4.1 or 4.4.2)To fully test: Reproduce the issue by installing v4.3.4, disable the setting, close, update Electrum and see if it's enabled.",
