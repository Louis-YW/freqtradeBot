  "content": "Something caught my eyes today as I was going through the homepage of this forum and paying attention to how it is divided into various boards. I discovered that the one written 'Other' which includes Meta, Politics & Society, Beginners & Help, Off-topic, Serious discussion and Archival, there is only one moderator for them all. As if that is not bad, that moderator who happens to be Miningbuddy has not been active for over 4 years now. He was last active in April 2018. My question is how does the forum get over shit posts because I do not see alot of it there. I know Meta is out of it and can take care of itself for no one dare make spam posts there because of the huge number of reputable members who post there. But how is shit posting controlled in others? Secondly is it not long overdue to get new moderators for that part of the forum?",

I understand that it is difficult to add new mods, but an inactive Mod ends up being a risk as well.As I said, he was removed as a mod a long time ago. Theymos just hasn't removed his name from there and only he can do that. It's the same with the Press board.",

But I think it would be better if the board had a dedicated moderator so that the global moderators don't have to deal with too much reporting which in essence can reduce the burden of moderation.While it's true that global moderators can be active on any board, it might be good to get a replacement for an inactive moderator. Of course this is just my opinion on the situation although so far there hasn't been much pressure to get a new one or maybe we don't know.",

I do not think that should be possible. Even though without Miningbuddy the global moderator is working tirelessly. Shit posts are still deleted every day and night. Threads have been moved from one board to another by the users that are moderating these boards the OP mentioned. Though, to reduced the work load of the global moderators, new moderators should be selected to moderate  these boards by different moderators.",
