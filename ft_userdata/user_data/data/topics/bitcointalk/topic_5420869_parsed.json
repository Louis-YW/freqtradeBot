      "body": "I really enjoyed Black Panther 2 and was especially impressed by the graphics and the action in the film. It was also heartwarming to see how the cast pay tribute in the movie by honoring the passing of the original black panther and actor Chadwick Boseman. My initial thoughts were that maybe the cast would not be able to emotionally work hard to pull off a great movie. However, I was surprised to see that everyone worked hard in the roles and really felt like I was able to connect with the characters. With that being said, I really enjoy that the movie included black females in leading roles. Which I feel brings more awareness to the film industry because it shows that women can also have leading roles in movies.  I also was happy that the movie had a diversity of cast members.",
