Looking at this the screen this is a binance wallet which is a centralized exchange and that‚Äôs the least of place to safe your coin because the keys doesn‚Äôt belong to you. I will advice you look for a reputable bitcoin wallet and in my opinion electrum is that wallet. Create a the new wallet yourself and don‚Äôt let your colleague do it for you and then keep the secret phrase safe in an offline place. Then move the coin from this exchange to the wallet. If you do not have basic knowledge of this then you can ask on the forum and you will be guided. Going forward please do not post screenshots of your holdings as it dampens your privacy. You can also edit your post and remove this one. Also if you‚Äôre planning to add more bitcoin to your holdings then you might need to set up a cold storage like purchasing a hardware wallet. You can continuously keep buying bitcoin when you have the fund never wait for any price retracement as that will be a wait too risky if it doesn‚Äôt fall back Here is the link to download an electrum wallet  https://electrum.org/#home",

For security, I think as long as you don't give your password, PIN, or account password to other people then everything is fine, but if not, I suggest you move to a new wallet. If you already have a lot of Bitcoin, I recommend hard wallets like Trezor and other hard wallets, they are very safe and difficult to hack.",

If (when) you can afford it, hardware wallet would be even better solution as it would give you another layer of protection and if you plan to be into bitcoin for a long run, getting one should be one of your priorities.",

The fact that you've allocated an amount of money to buy an asset means you have the will to continue investing in crypto. This may be the start of your journey, but remember, you're not just going to buy and sell; I think you know that you need to hone your knowledge and skills in terms of crypto currency or bitcoin if you want to focus on one currency only for the time being.I guess you should move your holdings to a cold wallet rather than a secured wallet if you will just hodl an asset because storing it on a platform like Binance is unsafe. I mean, just to make sure that your asset will be untouched secured. Im not saying that Binance is not a secured platform; its just to make sure that nothing will compromise your asset.",

Electrum wallet is definitely good if you can keep the seed phrase very safe. There are also many other wallets that you will get to know if you are active here regularly.

What kind of wallet is that, do you mean Electrum?There are software wallets that you can use to store your BTC by having full control of the seed phrase, you can also use hardware wallets by purchasing but these cold wallets are the most secure way.Quote from: Stalker22 on January 31, 2024, 09:54:15 PMQuote from: Bright0515 on January 31, 2024, 09:28:17 PMbut starting from this month of January I have gotten a new job that pays me 5 figures a month ~Five figures a month you say?
