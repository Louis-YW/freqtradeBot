Those coins go for 1.1 at best.Maybe in an auction setting.  I know there's no way I would even consider an offer that low for mine, but to each their own.  The last 2 Casascius coins I sold had premiums of 220% & 50%.  At 10% I would assume the offer was a joke.  I'd rather peel, claim the alts, and sell the peeled coin than deal with the headaches of making a deal, shipping, etc. for that small of a premium.",
