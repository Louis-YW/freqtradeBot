Nate has a huge fan following and i still feel that UFC did not take full opportunity of his popularity till he faced Conor for the first time.",

I am hyped too as I am a big fan of Nate Diaz and I know he will not be faking anything about this fight even if it's just for entertainment purposes.We know him as a good crowd-puller so I bet there will also be a lot of fans that cannot wait to see this type of action. He may be better at MMA but his stamina, toughness, and endurance might give him an upper hand and a win in the sport of boxing. We will see.",

He also wants this fight besides making money, probably he wants to raise the flag of MMA fighters defeated by Paul. But I doubt Nate will win against a young big boy here.If just for once  Nate throws a big swing down Jake's balls. An intentional one. I think it will be enough even he Nate ends up having a bloody face. That will still be fun for a meme.",

And his habit to keep hands low, not to go and finish his opponent (but rather slap and smile) will play really bad when Jake hits him. This is gonna be sort of a Jake vs Askren fight, where a almost pro boxer meets a guy who wrestlers most of his career. Dont know why Nate even signed for that fight. Short on money for his own promotion?",

But his main skill was to be able to eat a lot of punches and still stand. Against 185lb that will be difficult to use face as a shield and counterstrike. Imho Nate is to clumsy in fighting stance, the amplitude and angles of his strikes were what he was able to surprise his opponents with. To be able to do that against a boxer. I dont think that gonna end well. There is no use speaking about how Nate could KO Jake. His only option is win by points, but does not sound that judges gonna give Nate a win that way.",

The chin of Nate Diaz is so strong that it will bring down your confidence about how strong your punches are. Nate is not the boxer type entirely but I know he could certainly outbox some of the boxers in the industry. Speed doesn't really go that far, power may also be just the same and Nate could train more to enhance in that field. The age difference might be the bigger problem here. It will affect the stamina of Nate especially if he is fighting for 10-12 rounds. End it quick if he can, or score as much as he could at the early rounds.",

It's a little stiff for Diaz to face Jake, my analysis, Moreover, yesterday Jake bet 191.5 pounds and plus only lasted 8 rounds, against Diaz, I believe that this time Jake will not give Diaz a chance, I believe many boxing fans have placed bets for Jake this time, even though only in 8 rounds. I have no doubts about Jake, because I often watch ridiculous and brutal acts when he is in the ring.",

I think it would be still paul. His experience on alonger length of fight would be his biggest advantage over natr who only fought for few rounds in the octagon; we 've seen such thing happened for a couple of times when to fighters came from different comfort zones. Ofcourse if it is power and agressiveness then that would be with nate but that is not something to determine fights in boxing which requires a fighter to move more and do more. A mcgregor vs mayweather scene? Outcome possible but performance? I doubt.",
