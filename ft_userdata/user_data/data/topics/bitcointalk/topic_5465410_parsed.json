  "content": "First of all, thank you to the guys SideHack and Kanoi for their hard work on the ASIC sticks and the dev side of things. It has been a fun small project for me to get the software up and running on the hardware and I’m now mining some SHA256 crypto’s. The main question to this post is.When it boils down to maintenance on the stick, it’s understandable they use the BM1397 ASIC chips to process these mathematical puzzles and I would like to know whether these chips can be upgraded with certain deviations of the 1397 or other models supporting SHA256 algo? Will they need new drivers? Or are they just incompatible with other chips?",

      "body": "You can only interchange between the BM1397 ASIC variants because the CompacF and the R909 were designed with the BM1397 ASIC chips. The variants are BM1397AG, BM1397AF, BM1397AH, BM1397AI, BM1397AD. However BM1397AG and BM1397AI are commonly used and available. Some say that the BM1397AI is better than the rest and hence more expensive.No need to change any drivers because they are all BM1397 ASICs.You cannot use BM1366 ASIC (Antminer S19 XP) in your CompacF or the R909. You need to redesign a new circuit board and components for it to run. BitaxeUltra board by Open Source Miners United uses the BM1366 ASIC. It's an open source and you can make it yourself.",
