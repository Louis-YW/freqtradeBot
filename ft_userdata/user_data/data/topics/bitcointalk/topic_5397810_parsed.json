The auction ends when no higher bid is made in the 10 minute extension period. For example:* last bid at 16:49 => auction ends at 17:00 => higher bid at 17:01 is invalid* last bid at 16:51 => auction ends at 17:10 => higher bid at 17:09 is valid and wins the auction if no higher bids are made before 17:19* last bid at 16:51 => auction ends at 17:10 => higher bid at 17:01 => auction ends at 17:11SHIPPING: Based on location and shipping preference (bar is located in the EU)",
