I would say gambling is 90% luck and 10% technique. You can be a very skilled gambler, but without luck you are doomed, anyway.",

Strategy will just make you gambling in controlled manner but it doesn't help you to increase your chance of winning since the game is not affected by any strategy due to its randomness.",

You might be lucky at first, but casinos or other gambling sites will be lucky in long term. Just have fun while gambling and do not use more than an amount of money that you can not afford to lose. Gambling is not a way to make money.",

Even when you feel like you're on a roll, always remember the house has an edge and eventually, your streak might run dry and you may \"go out of luck\". There are games like poker and blackjack where some skill and basic technique come into play, but again, a lot of it boils down to luck (I mean, who knows which card you'll draw next, right?). Yeah, strategies can help to an extent, but never forget the unpredictability of the game. If someone says they know a \"strategy\" that will always let you win, he is lying.",

I doubt that if you are looking for money in the casino then you will get crazy losses because your psychology will go wild when you face the casino to get money.It all depends on luck, unless you play poker and others that require skill, then there you need skill to win.It should be remembered that apart from that you need to have the ability to manage money and manage your greed, if you have good luck but you have greed within you then luck is just a story for gamblers who are greedy in terms of victory.",

I think we shouldn't think like that because the risk of playing gambling in casinos has more chances of losing than winning.Casino is a place for fun, you better think so. Most people will spend more money in the casino than they earn money. Unless you are a professional at analyzing football matches, maybe you can make a lot of money there, but I'm not sure luck will always comeIf you gamble on a sportbook, there is no pure luck there, you must have good analysis to win. If playing slots, in my opinion, there are no tricks that can be done, as far as I know, if you have spent a lot of money on slot games, they will distribute the jackpot. But even if you get the jackpot, chances are that your lost money will not come back from the jackpot results",

If you're into slots then you would be needing loads of luck to win there but in the case of sport betting you need skill and also the knowledge of the sport you're to place a bet on because you can't just log into your gabling account and start to wager on teams that you know nothing about it reduces your chance of winning unlike when you're familiar with the sport and also the players in that specific team.So in a way you would be needing both of them (depending on what you're into).",
