You can reset it by holding the IP report button for 5 seconds until it bleeps then release then set up the unit again and check for changes.",

      "body": "in fact, the improvement is there (just a parameter in reality), but the improvement is lost by their regulation at 70c on the chips, they heat up more, and therefore consume more...this can be circumvented by blocking the fans at 100%, but, oops, it seems that it is disabled in this firmware... so unplug the 4 blue wires from the fans to block them at 100% to cool it down.. .But, another but, there is this parameter that you can't change without touching the firmware: --bitmain-voltage-compensate <arg> Set bitmain miner voltage compensate in low temp (default: true) , so if detect low temp, he rise up voltage for heat up this :sTo see... to try!",
