  "content": "Crotama is the first memecoin in the Cronos chain to be listed on CMC. It reached an ATH of 4.1M and the following post will outline what our plans are for the coming weeks with timelines.Play2Earn GameSo to start of, the P2E game is finished. We plan on releasing it when CRO hits a higher price as our MC will be higher then as well. The reason for this is because we already have two forms of passive income already available for investors; NFT + token staking which is inflating holdings already. So the P2E game will be out when CRO itself hits a higher price and we will do a huge marketing push to accommodate it.XY Finance IntegrationThe XY Finance dAPP/Swap integration will be completed within the coming days. For those who are unaware about what this means, it basically allows investors to buy Crotama using any coin from 6+ major chains. This means increased user accessibility which is extremely bullish for us. We are in constant contact with the team and at the moment they are currently perfecting it to provide the best experience for our investors. Currently a few more finishing touches are being made e.g slippage adjustment functions. We should expect it early June, a matter of days!NFT Roadmap + Multi-chain mintingWe are currently perfecting the updated NFT roadmap. This includes having World Cup special batches and other surprises too. I'm personally excited about the World cup NFTs because Crypto.com is one of the major sponsors for it, so the publicity we will get will be great. Not only this, but we will be implementing multi-chain minting. This is something NO project has done yet and we will be one of the first to implement. This means you'll be able to mint our NFTs through some of the major currencies such as BNB,ETH,CRO and more. Crotama merchandiseThe possibilities of Crotama is not limited to just Cryptocurrency. We will be branching out to making merchandise to build a strong community together. We believe word of mouth is a powerful tool, so we will be releasing hoodies, wolf plushies, mugs and more. We also have something special planned for this so stay tuned. The next time someone asks you where you got the hoodie from, tell them the story of Crotama and how it is the biggest meme coin in the Cronos chain.Special AnnouncementWe have a special announcement coming up very soon. It's something game changing and will definitely set us aside from every other Cronos coin and set us up to be the biggest project in the Cronos space. We are currently finalising a lot of things behind the scenes to ensure we can build it perfectly and all I can hint at right now is that our project is about to evolve in the best way and I'm so excited to announce it soon. Crotama is going to be unstoppable despite market conditions, the best ecosystem on Cronos already with a lot more comingMarketing UpdateWe have a lot of paid marketing which is rolling out slowly. We want this to be a sustainable growth where new investors come in and observe how we are as a community and project. This means more YouTube videos will be coming out, Telegram posts and Twitter. The above mentioned utilities will also be accompanied by its own marketing push as well, so the coming month is going to be very busy for us all!",
