Assuming he have posted the transaction hash, what's the difference? I'm a bit skeptical about the chat logs where the @OP only show one picture, it seems the representative have accuse something before or next of the discussion, but the @OP not want to show it.",

Do you think OP is here to promote Duelbits? At first, accuse them of scamming a significant amount and then say they released his withdrawal. You did not mean that, especially when wearing Duelbits signature and Avatar. I do not think Duelbits will promote their casino in such negative ways  Or maybe you want to say that either Stake or Rollbit hired him? @OP, it does not look like you are in minus at all. It seems you have withdrawn over $2.1 Million and deposited less than that. Also, I am not clear what the support said to you. He was asking you to wait, and they will update you. Since the decision is not final yet (They did not block or freeze your account), You cannot say if they scammed you. It might be a security check-up because you have won a lot. It is common for a casino to investigate user accounts when users win significant amounts. They want to ensure the user is not taking any unfair advantage to win. So, give them some time and wait until they finish their investigation.",

I know it's frustrating but it would be best for you to have some patience, from what I have seen here on this board there are times casinos take a week to reply or make a response after getting the KYC they ask for.",

So, give them some time and wait until they finish their investigation. I also think that it is a security check-up since withdrawing $2.5m in a day in 5 tranches landing on different addresses may trigger the AML alert on the system.  Also, 4 of the 5 requests had been processed and the last is still under investigation and both @OP and the support staff are under communication.  The account is still not restricted according to @OP on his other thread so I think Duelbits is doing their best to conclude in a just manner.  Investigation takes time others even took months once tagged with possible money laundering but I hope this case be solved soon.Also this:↓↓↓Quote from: John Abraham on June 01, 2023, 07:12:04 AM He was asking you to wait, and they will update you.

      "body": "OP it is unfortunate you are having all these night mares as  i can see the figure mentioned by you is quite voluminous and i also believe it is likely amongst the reasons why they are taking their time to conduct their due diligence because no one would want to be at the losing end when it happens that there are sketchy traces involved in such transaction. However, I will urge you to be calm and patient to hearing from them  to knowing why they  had taken such  actions against you. Come to talk of it, the casino in question is a well known casino with good reputation onboard this platform. So i have no doubt about their system and how it works but be rest assured that your funds will be given to you after the investigation is conducted and there are no faults on your path.",

      "body": "Hi, I took a glance at your gambling profile and accounts history on the other thread and would think you are a high roller. I can understand that you're frustrated and angry for the delay as high rollers are usually benefited certain privileges in one form or another. I am PMing duelbits' representative to notify them about this thread so they can attend to it. I'd like to ask you to give a little bit more patience as duelbits is currently not online and it might took time for them to notice my PM.Meanwhile, as you have raised a scam accusation, I'd like to think that it'll be best to lock your other thread on gambling section as it will make things harder to track if someone create simultaneous threads. The lock topic button is at the bottom left of the page.On a lighter note to brighten the... mood, 40kk is better known as 40m",
