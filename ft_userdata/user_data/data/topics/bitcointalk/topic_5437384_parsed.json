The reason wey we no know about am be say e no too get too much engagement and our people for here no too dey watch the NPFL and are more current with the leagues in Europe. But na we go hype our own to make am popular too. Another reason be say we no too get plenty viewing channels where dem dey show the matches even if some of us dey interested in football and will love to go and see our favourite teams play. Thank you for providing us with channels we can watch the matches from and also where we can get real time updates about them. As the new season wan start, we go try follow engage to make the thread busy for gambling board too.",

Among the rest that are football lovers,most of us don't like NFL because it isn't as classic and upgraded compare to the European leagues due to poor management and corruption. I no dey even watch their match wey I no go fit place my bet. So a lot of us that are football fans,prefer to watch the common and strong leagues where we can place our bets and enjoy the fun.",
