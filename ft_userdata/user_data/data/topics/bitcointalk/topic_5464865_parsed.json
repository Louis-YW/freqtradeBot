But, there are partnerships that these projects can enjoy with these exchanges if ever they'll offer it to them and they oblige. Or, if the exchange sees them as a good and potential coin.By that, they can flee with the fee but AFAIK, they need to give an amount of share of the token that they're working on.",

      "body": "To answer your question, it is a no. Partnership to a platform will be required in order to list a token. Therefore Â it is safe to say that not all good tokens will automatically be listed on exchanges. Maybe popularity of the project, paid partnership, or is it just those/that exchanges are choosing to list a token because they saw something from it which is more likely having relation to a token or project's popularity and demand from its investors.Exchanges won't mind picking the best ones but rather only those which have a volume will be listed to most of the exchanger platform. At the least, listing to a known exchanger, would benefit the token or management behind it as well.",

Theres a fee but there are projects that are listed for free and exchange can gain advantage on this due to their indemand capability to have huge volume. Meaning there are lots of people that trading that coins and big exchanges favor that, see most airdrops projects that get listed surely they are free of fee.",

Most new coins, as long as they pay enough (and probably pass some number of requirements that the exchanges will set, just to filter out really, really bad ones) can get listed in an exchange. You wouldn't see shit coins popping out otherwise. It's also kind of hard to determine what \"good\" means in the first place, if it was price then how? It's new. If it's the volume of trading, then again, the same answer, it's new. So you can only rely on what they can show, which is the project details and white paper, which align to imo, the requirements that exchanges set as, well, \"required\". I reckon exchanges just accept new coins to take money, then just delist them if they fail to pass a certain mark, as you've said.",

I was curious why someone will give such an advice to people. When I was a newbie , and had thought that once it is listed in an old exchange, that everything will be OK with the project.

      "body": "Listing and delisting cryptocurrencies is an activity that needs to be monitored by a regulatory body, otherwise it will turn into a door to corruption, as exchanges can blackmail developers by removing it or forcing them to pay more money. Developers may exploit it by withdrawing liquidity, creating a fake pump and reaping more profits. Both developers and the platform may agree to manipulate the price. Especially if the currency is listed on a limited number of platforms or arbitrage between several platforms is difficult.We cannot consider it as a criterion for investment, but it can be said that the currency that is listed in a few exchanges is a scam and at best a bad investment that should be avoided.",

Investors should not base their decisions solely on the exchange a cryptocurrency is listed on. Instead, they should conduct thorough research into the project itself. Also, It's Important for investors to diversify their cryptocurrency portfolios to manage risk. Projects that lack consistent development updates, fail to meet milestones, or demonstrate a lack of transparency can lose investor confidence and may eventually face delisting from exchanges.",

Listing on a top exchange never guarantees that a project will not turn out to be a scam. Among the latest such projects are terra and ust. No one would have thought that such a big scam would happen. Or for example, in 2017 there was such a project bittorrent, which at that time was traded on all the top exchanges.",

If you were talking about low tier exchange site and you do need money to be listed there but the different method when it comes to the major exchange sites. The major exchange site has very strict requirement to be completed first before you will able to list your token there.
