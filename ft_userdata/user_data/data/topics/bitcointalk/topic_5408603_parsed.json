I don't expect anything good yet because I fear to not be overly disappointed if a new leg down happens. And by my calculations the crypto winter is not over yet.I genuinely hope that I'm wrong and we get back to better/more comfortable price range... but I don't feel we're safe/there yet.",

To predict the monthly price can be very difficult because a month is still short to make a proper prediction this time around. But the market has reached its monthly oversold position and the relative strength index is around 32 out of 100, which indicate a market price to be in the upside direction. But this is just a little analyses and I can be wrong. Even if I am right, I am not expecting an significant bull run.",

I think  before the end of the year we'll already be more than $25K. I look at this like the time when we were in the Feb-March 2019 where price was $4300. So climbing up to$25K and then back to $21k again. But we have different analysis of the market though.If this is like a manipulated market just as many people are seeing this, the big players are making the price up where the we poor can't and shouldn't afford it.",

I am not saying that it isn't impossible, of course we may fail to get there, people could definitely make a statement about why it wouldn't reach there but that doesn't change the fact that it could also be start of a big bull run and we could reach high prices too, there are reasons for that.So, we shouldn't be shocked to learn that crypto is not something that is predictable, I mean it could be 20k in a week or 30k in a week and both are equally possible. Still, I expect something favorable to be happening in this August month due to any of billionaire or institutions.",

Some crypto media sites spreading negative news so maybe I think this is sort of movements they made so that they can move the market downwards on next couple of days. For now will wait before more good things to come before entering since for sure we can spot best position unlike buying today.",

What is clear is that there is still the potential to increase Bitcoin again this year.",

The decline wasn't seen rapidly in the price but that's around the point when the whole thing started turning bearish, everyone was first anticipating a correction, then a period of equilibrium, then Terra went bust, slowly 30s were hit and the panic spread completely.Three is the need for something major to start growing again but growing on real things, not sporadic pumps like are happening now and are pretty short-lived.Quote from: Fara Chan on August 03, 2022, 03:27:52 PMBitcoin was in the correction stage in early 2022, the recovery that occurred only revolved around the price that was not so high, this is a sign that the correction has provided an opportunity for bitcoin to restore the connected price, but to understand further, Bitcoin is now not fully bullish for the month August.Correction?If in early 2020 we had a correction, then what was May to July 2021? A correction to the same price?There was no \"correction\" as there is no correct or no real price or price brackets to be held, it was just people dumping their coins, simple as that, and now hopefully the ones that sold their coins have the funds set aside to fuel it back up instead of fueling their lambos.
