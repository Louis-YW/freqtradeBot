Is there a reputable pool for staking? I was going to do ethermine but they don't allow staking from the USA. I'm not gonna sell unless the prices goes way up again and I'm fine with just holding it but I'd like to earn interest or wherever if someone could help point me in the right direction.",

And that is gauranteed and very low risk compared to keeping it locked up on an online exchange. Anything less than 10% and its just not worth staking or yielding anything crypto related due to the risks involved.",

It is bullshit. Or you must buy coin at lowest price but who knows whats lowest price? Mining was good thing.Generally with staking the highest yields are the most volatile coins. So you might get 100% APY on some random altcoin however if it losing 90% of its value then you are not out ahead.ETH staking is better because its a high market cap coin like BTC. It most likely won't lose 90% value in a few months. The issue is that the staking rewards are just way too low right now. When it reaches the point where you can put it in a bank savings account and invest in some bonds which is iron-clad safe rather than stake it with an online exchange for similar rewards, the former makes more sense.If the rewards grow to 10% a year then thats a different story.",
