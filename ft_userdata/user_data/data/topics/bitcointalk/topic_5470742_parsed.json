As a man when the money keep flowing in do not forget to make investment because the little things that gives you money today might stop functioning at anytime and you may back down to level zero were you can't stand again or be able to have that chance to be receiving such amount of money that was flowing to you before. So keep investing than buying unnecessary things.",

I'm not looking for solutions, I'm merely asking, something for discussion     When I was younger I usually spent my money on unnecessary things. It was normal to follow new trends and upgrades in technology. It is common then to change my entire clothing because I think they are outdated or not in vogue. My friends always compete on who will get the latest phone or other accessories, so you have to work hard for sometimes months just to get a device that you don't need. I was easily influenced by friends and lived a life to impress others.    But my experience over the years has made me more prudent in my expenditure. Now one has to take care of a family and plan for the future. I don't spend money on luxury or irrelevant things anymore because I have to follow my budget strictly. I rather spend more on education and other investments than waste them on clothing or phones like I used to do in the past. Investing in the future of my dependents is more important than pleasure. If spend money the way I did before, I will have to borrow to survive.",

I'm not looking for solutions, I'm merely asking, something for discussion  Sometimes I have to sit back and think about this also because I always find it difficult to save money, and the stream of spending the money is opening almost every day, probably because of my level of earning.I do find it difficult to invest because once I invest in something else, the return has not always been favourable. Only the Bitcoin investment I make through DCA is there for me; others just look like I am growing money to spend another day. I was then told that I have to start overlooking some expenses that are not compulsory in order to save some money. I will start doing that by being stingy with myself and some people. I do give money for no reason to see if that can work.",

We do know that its not really that holiday on everyday on which you could make money and this is why its really that something ideal that you should really be saving up something for the winter days. It did really make a huge hit on the time that i havent already making decent income or something earns that on crypto space which i had realized that i had wasted too much money and really missing out lots of opportunities for me to make a business or investment on which it would really be making me survive somehow.Just like on what said above that it is really that normal for a human being on having those kind of approach or feeling on the time that you do have tons of money then it would really be just that normal that you would really be spending like a mad man or there's no tomorrow. On the time that people would really be experiencing some financial problem then this is where realization do kicks in.",

In that light, when you are talking about such spending as unnecessary, well from what I have explained, I don't consider it wasteful or unnecessary. In fact that is a more prudent way to plan if you can do that. At least some little domestic things can be purchased in that manner like food stuffs, utensils, clothings, personal items like soap, fragrance etc.However, surely there are unnecessary spending which careless living is part of it. Some people are funds of losing there money either by misplacing it or sending out money wrongly because they are hopeful to get another tomorrow but tomorrow is not always certain.

No wonder we have levels of clothes and other stuff with a price from cheap to very expensive like that of Loius Vitton, etc. They have the same purpose but the prices aren't the same. And there is nothing wrong with this as long as people are not trying hard to go beyond its limits.I remember when someone borrowed money from me. Every time I tried to collect it, there were excuse after excuse. The lamest excuse I received was when the borrower and her daughters could not pay me because they spent the money enhancing their skin in a dermatology clinic.",

The money will keep flowing in, but at some point, the opportunity might cease or things might change to cause the financial flow to reduce from what it used to be. At that point, if it was someone who was judiciously managing their finances, saving, and investing, they would not have any issue providing for their needs, but if it were someone who was mismanaging his money during the time when it was supplouse, then he or she might find it difficult and that very moment that the cash flow will cease.I am not in the category of people who run into purchasing or spending on less important things, even if the money is plentiful, I still go along with my budget.",
