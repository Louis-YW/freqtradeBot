I would say holding bitcoin had taught me lots about security because the fundamental principle in holding and holding for long is on a secure storage. While seeking this knowledge I get to understand that the best form of saving money is you yourself been your own bank and not trusting custodian wallets or exchanges. Also the best form of storage is offline because once it gets online you never might know what will happen to it.",

Makes you rethink what money is and who gets to control it.  Crazy stuff. I totally get what you are saying.  It is pretty crazy when you think about how so many people spend all their time going after money and stuff, but they dont really give it much thought beyond its basic use.  But then you start looking into it more, especially with the internet today and you come across all this news and info about problems with how money and banks work.  Its like a lightbulb moment when it hits you that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin could maybe completely change how we look at and use money.",

Second, Bitcoin teaches us how to properly manage our own savings in the future. I used to just want to know what Bitcoin is, but while I was learning and studying it, I didn't notice that I was discovering a lot and knowing that I didn't know that I was doing it.Everything that Bitcoin can do is the opposite of banks because here our money is put at risk where anytime they can freeze it and hold it, unlike with Bitcoin, which is not like that, but instead we ourselves are really in control. The best thing about this is that even if it is hidden in our wallet, the chances are high that it will also give us good savings in the future.",

There’s a popular bitcoin phrase be your own bank, this four words have a deeper meaning than meets the eye. It means you get to be in control of your money but that’s not all. It also means that you’re now an institution(bank) and what do banks do with money? They trade it, multiply it and make profit. Now it’s your responsibility to do all this. That’s the power of bitcoin.",

Banks have problems, but most people are satisfied with them, because those problems arise rarely and often just get solved.

The main driver of the fiat system.Certainly, the potency of the banking sector becomes exceptionally robust when it collaborates with the government to generate profits. The parties that can now challenge the banks are, in fact, the public as a whole. However, when a seed of rebellion sprouts among the masses, aimed at initiating a revolution in the world of banking, the government suppresses it.It's truly a meticulously structured financial monopoly, and the government provides evidence that the system it has crafted can sustain a nation. I still cannot envision whether the mass adoption of Bitcoin or blockchain technology will genuinely propel a nation to new heights or potentially lead to adverse outcomes.We regard Bitcoin as something beneficial and even highly suitable to replace traditional FIAT currencies. Nevertheless, we've never experimented with making it a national currency, which leaves me pondering about its potential repercussions.",

The Bitcoin system is a little bit complicated. You have to read about wallets, transactions, exchanges, blockchain, security, etc. And you have to be also familiar with government policies, institutional investors, and other trends in the industry. Before now the responsibility of understanding the financial system was delegated to banks but If you have to be your bank then you need to perform the functions of banks. Before now most of us only knew about depositing our money in banks and withdrawing it with no understanding of our privacy or how the bank benefits from our deposits. But this has changed because of Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin does not solve all problems from governments and central banks. It can make some effects but can not be big enough to change the society and financial problems. Even governments and central banks with a lot of power they have, to regulate society, finance, economy, can not make everything they want. Because the society has many components and only one or two changes can not fix everything and all problems.",

And we learn as well why the rich become richer and how like the majority of us here, average joe player in the market, can really be rich and take advantage of bitcoin's lifecycle (bull and bear run), and take advantage of it. I'm not into the blockchain technology though, I mean of course it's good to learn how and what it is, but individually, it doesn't matter though. What matters is how we should protect our assets, our wallets so that we won't get hack, and BYOB (Be Own Your Bank).So now we are looking forward again to another bull run and hopefully everyone is already ready with their accumulation.",
