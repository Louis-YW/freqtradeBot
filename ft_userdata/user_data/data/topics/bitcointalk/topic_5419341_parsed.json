      "body": "I think that this forum thread belongs to the Gambling Discussion forum. Anyway, those are some really wise quotes and proverbs about gambling. I don't agree with the \"Money won is twice as sweet as money earned\" proverb. It's quite the opposite actually. Many gamblers should read those quotes everyday.  I also like the quote \"In a bet there's a fool and thief\". It summarizes perfectly the current state of the sports betting industry.",

Thank you so much for calling my attention to this, i actually thought i made this post in the gambling discussion board, turned out i didnt take proper notice.its moved now to gambling discussion board, thank you once more.Quote from: swogerino on November 04, 2022, 07:35:10 AM hoping to recoup lost money is what ruin gamblers.This very proverb nowadays for many gamblers is a true story,because how many addiction cases have just started because of some newbies in gambling that lost money and wanted to recoup them by spending more money in gambling.I think is the proverb which should make us all think and to impact us that hoping to recoup lost money is the number one fatal mistake that in most cases leads to addiction.I totally agree with you, thats a very powerful quote (or should i call it proverb) which sure do stand out from most of others, this proverb does not apply to gambling alone but also to trading, ive never tried to chase after my losses in gambling but ive done so in crypto trading and the end result was that i ended up even more rekt than i was when i recorded the first and second loss..its a proverb gamblers and traders alike should really learn from.",

      "body": "Nice quotes no doubt.... It's sounds as if some of those professional gamblers are mostly aware of the intricacies in gaming but, they keep persisting, due to.....due to what?? Greed? Luck? What really gives them the guts to keep playing a loosing toss, hoping it cuts...? That looks akward to me.!It's always nice to Begin but, quitting an addiction that's been mixed with a strong will of passion is impossible. If a gambler can't quit gambling for this same reason, then it'll be much advisable for 'em to adhere to those quotes because if the rules are misused, the loss becomes magnified.Sandra 💇",

      "body": "Quotes are something if you would use it but it will remain just a 'saying' or belief if you won't put it into action. My quote as a gambler is \"Deposit a dime, lose a dime\". It has something to do with limiting oneself to being too greedy. If you have 100$ to lose for a week, never try to continue and add an amount 'coz once you broke your own rule, that is when addiction and greed take over. Gambling is a good leisure activity if you can afford it, but will never be a good source of profit (as many of the gamblers are doing). You cannot rely your daily life from the profit in gambling. Indeed, there will be times you'd win big time but most of the time, losing is more anticipated unless you are on a gambling game wherein you can manipulate the odds of winning such as sportsbetting wherein a player could analyze winning and losing team, but adding an amount to your alloted gambling money, is still a no for sure.",

      "body": "Some of the quotes have deep meaning, some meaningless to me, some contradictory, some encourage you to continue and keep trying, others to take your winning and go, or if you loose, you still ont need to try again. One thing is obvious that they were all inspired by personal experience or on hearing the experience of other people. There is a quote that supports any situation you are in, If you almost won in a bet and you are having double mind about continuing to play or to quit, there's a quote to encourage you to try again, and the one to encourage you to stop, at the end you actually make the decisions you want to make.",
