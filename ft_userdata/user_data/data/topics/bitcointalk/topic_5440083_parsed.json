  "content": "Hi, Im a 18 year old owner of a upcoming PvP crypto Casino, the casino is almost finished, but we are still looking for investors for the hotwallet and other costs like 2 new game modes we are planning. This might seems sketchy because im new to this forum but im known on another forum (ogu.gg) https://imgur.com/a/fcwV1it will confirm it if you are interested. If you are interested in Investing contact me on discord or telegram for more information about the project. By investing in our Project you will receive an amount of % from the casino. We already raised 800$ but are still looking for investors to launch as soon as possible. The current games are Crash, Shuffle, Cups and wheel but we are currently working on Plinko and Mines. The site has VIP system, provably fair, live support, phone verification, chat trivia, races, affiliate system, coupons. We need 5k to get everything started. By investing you will of corse receive admin rights on the site/admin panel. The team has experience in PvP crypto casino with cups.gg we use the same script as cups.gg as a basis but ofc everything changed to our site preferences since we have the same developer but we are working on adding Plinko and mines to our site at the time.https://Bigspins.netContact: Bigspins.help@gmail.com",

But it didn't go well for a lot of reason including trustworthiness.You should wait few more years before diving into this, save money for the project and then launch the project. That would be best approach I think.",

You are not even sure if you could get an investor here even if you be transparent like telling which 2 new game modes and the link to your casino. But who knows.It's one cold welcome message but you are still 18 though, I bet you have tons of teen friends who can chip in. This way you all literally know together, maybe even neighbors for a long time.",

To mention he is a member of ogu.gg forum isn't enough, because most members of bitcointalk aren't part of that community, so they don't have an account there to check OP's reputation and probably won't create one solely for that purpose.",

I don't think anyone here will be interested to invest to a casino that has not even completed it creation. Even your age you mentioned is not even encouraging to own a casino company, because at that your age you supposed to focus on reading your school books if you are in school. Op you did not mentioned the % amount the investor will receive at the end of the deal and that is also wrong and If the $800 is for the start up then you can manage it with just a game. And you add more games to the $800 only one person will win it all and you will run as lost. So if you really want to run a trust casino go and take loan.",

QuoteThis might seems sketchy because im new to this forum  Yes it does. New, young, inexperienced guy and already asking for money without showing any achievements. I wouldn't hire you if you came to my home asking if you can cut my lawn. I'd have to see your gear first and I'd know if you're for real or full of shit. QuoteWe already raised 800$ but are still looking for investors to launch as soon as possible.How much do you need? Are you trying to start a casino with only a few hundred bucks of your own money? As an investor, I'd expect the owner to have at least 50% of the total budget. If you came to me asking for it all I'd offer you a beer and walk you out the door.",

There’s a lot of scam here so it will be very hard for you to get an investors for casino that has no info. Provide complete details of the casino, drafts of terms and proof that will show how we can trust you our money is a must for a user here invest on your casino.Thank you for hitting the nail very hard. You see OP wants investors for his upcoming casino which has no details about it. Why hiding the details of the casino if you are looking for investors? Which investor do you think would pick interest in this offer of yours with you withholding the details from the public which does not make any sense. As long as you want investors, it is no more a private investment and therefore it is required that you make the details public for investors review otherwise you will be seen as one with ill motive or tagged a scammer.",

It's going to be hard to find a good reason why they should invest here instead of a reputable casino.A few reasons I can think of on why someone will invest here is that this was still a fresh casino and we know that a lot of people are hunting about it. The games are also exciting, it was PVP. Many gamblers want to earn a profit so they mostly play on skill based games because skills can matter the most on there so this PVP based casino is perfect for them.Only the reputation is difficult to prove here but the team can do something about it like they can do a KYC so that investors can report them if ever they will run away with their money. If the team is doxxed, they will be discouraged to do a shady act because they can't run or hide anymore.",

Or just a link Hello there, and welcome to our forum!I think it's great to hear that you're working on a PvP crypto casino, especially at such a young age. It's always inspiring to see young people taking initiative and pursuing tangible goals. However, as you mentioned, it's important to ensure that potential investors feel confident in the legitimacy of your project. While you mentioned that you're known on another forum, it might be helpful to provide more information about your project and your experience in the industry. From what I've seen, your focus up to this point appears to have primarily been centered around selling gaming accounts. Have you had any prior experience as a developer, and do you have any tangible projects or examples to demonstrate your skills?",
