More or less it's value was supposed to go up as FIAT value goes down.Since Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency designed to give us complete control over our assets, no government regulatory agency or financial institution may regulate or control the Bitcoin price in the same way that they do for FIAT currency.Quote from: worldtraveller321 on June 13, 2022, 08:40:20 PMWhat am I missing here? I can't say but you need adequate trust and knowledge about what exactly the meaning of Bitcoin is, in order to give yourself hope that something will surely come our way somedays once we believe in Bitcoin and keep Holding our Bitcoin for such time.Quote from: worldtraveller321 on June 13, 2022, 08:40:20 PMor is the best yet to come?Â The best is yet to come because many investors have placed their faith in Bitcoin by investing large sums of money in Bitcoin; small investors are also waiting for the best time. I have the impression that the journey has only just begun because Bitcoin has a long way to go before it is accepted globally as a means of exchange.",

Bitcoin is doing well against inflation on long run, that is what matters. About the currently situation you can be sure bitcoin has total conditions of recovering and hiting a new ATH at some point futurely, like it has already happened before, while the same can't be told regards fiat currencies which are constantly losing purchasing power within time.",

What we're experiencing here is completely against it. Just think of a person investing $27000 yesterday and today it is $22k. So, the limited supply makes it a hedge against inflation and this isn't effective all the time. The recovery happens for sure, and now the market is getting more dependent on the traditional market.",

Now the governments are soaking up all those excess dollars to try to rein in the hyperinflation they caused. Bitcoin was $3000 when covid hit. Why wouldn't it go back to $3000? I'll be nice, $6000. That sounds more reasonable. $22,000 is still way too high. And as for ethereum: the protocol makes no sense until the transaction fees are fixed.",

For example ever since 2018 all altcoins without exception lost their value for example the biggest shitcoin of all times called ethereum has been sitting at half of its 2017 price against bitcoin. It was only bitcoin that not only went back up but surpassed its previous ATH.QuoteBitcoin was supposed to be here for our survival. Now it is becoming just a digital number on a computer screen that never had any value all along.That's your view because you bought bitcoin to become rich. Otherwise bitcoin is exactly as it was back in 2009, a decentralized censorship resistant currency.",

Bitcoin do can hedge against inflation, but you shouldn't expect all on all situations Bitcoin price will always increase. Bitcoin price are determined between demand and supply, you can't control the demand since it's depends on all traders/buyers.If you don't believe Bitcoin can hedge against inflation, you can do research how much Bitcoin worth on 10 years ago and right now, compare with how much USD worth on 10 years ago and right now.",

Now it is deflationary as mining reward halves every 4 years, but if the demand for BTC is not maintained then price will fall. Thats what is happening. You also have to look at mining power which I suspect would be reduced these days with random regulations and of course energy price inflation. At the moment we also have a lot of companies ready to liquidate their Bitcoin due to sudden depreciation of its value. This is just gonna keep pushing price down. There is no easy way in life to make money. This is true for Bitcoin. It's not some magic thing that will keep going up and up and up. It's an asset and buying it has risk, crazy risk. It's up to you to take that risk.",

But the reality is not so simple, there are many factors that determine Bitcoin's price, and fixed supply is only one of them.As far as I see this for me the theory is simple. People have more money to invest they put more money in Bitcoin, people have less money to invest or in the extreme case, they run out of it they no longer buy coins but sell them. Inflation just accelerates things, everyone was saying in an economic crisis with an incoming inflation rush for real estate, I've seen with my one eye how this did NOT work a decade ago with everything crashing around.Yeah, everyone says to buy when there is blood on the streets but what happens when that blood is everywhere because everyone is dead? Easy to say cheap coins, let's buy but with a lot of people afraid of what happens next month it's for many cheap coins or food.Quote from: Despairo on June 14, 2022, 04:35:18 AMCan you pointed out to me where did Satoshi said Bitcoin was created to hedge against inflation? Satoshi didn't say a lot of things about bitcoin but people like to fantasize about what it was created for, in reality, it was just a p2p currency, ironically enough, almost everyone ignores the actual purpose it was built for and seeks to reinvent it by adding a ton of things no currency will be able to solve.But it's understandable, a lot want to be millionaires by holding 100 satoshis, you've got to market the shit out of it.",

If you truly have bought Bitcoin years ago, even if you have bought around the last ATH $20k you would still be bullish with the current price.I would have also thought you understood that every financial market has its Bulls and bears and Bitcoin and the general crypto market are no different so don't expect that because the financial markets are going down means Bitcoin should continue to go up however if you do look at the cryptocurrency market or Bitcoin in particular over the past 10years vs other financial markets then you would see the difference in ROI within this periods.
