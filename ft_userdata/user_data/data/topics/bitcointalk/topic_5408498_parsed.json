If no, then what makes you think this is the last time such a thing happened, and we won't see such an issue again in the near future.USDT's \"depegged\" or \"repegging\" has nothing to do with people's trust towards Bitcoin or Ether.",

The trust by people can come once the market can be even better. it doesn't even need to see USDT to repeg into the fiat value again. it's not how crypto market was working. I think that you shall see that from another perspective as well.",

So for me, I'm still comfortable using USDT. usdt is the main stable currency in the market even before, There's no main stable currency in the crypto. All of stable tokens were the same. There's no different between any stable token. These stable tokens backed by the same fiat money but the only thing make those different were developers and transparency. Stable token didn't give huge impact to the crypto price. The collapse of stable token may give the different impact as most of people are holding stable tokens during the bearish market but it's not like what you have said above. There are some slight differences between stable coins, the majority peg their token to a fiat currency in a one to one ratio and this is the way they hope to achieve stability for their coins, however other stable coins try to achieve that stability with the use of an algorithm, however it would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of stable coins, just the volume of USDT is higher than the volume of bitcoin and ethereum together, so without a doubt there is demand for them and they have positively influenced this market over the years.",
