What mostly interests me with Bitcointalk is the opinions of other people, giving me different points of views and all that.Quote from: SeeBiscuit on August 16, 2022, 12:53:09 AMPersonally, I've been reading through old posts of legendary and hero members like books essentially, some posts dating back to 2013 and stuff.Just a heads up that high rank doesn't automatically mean knowledgeable. A lot of hero/legendary members only got their merits from the initial airdrop.",

This old thread [1] about struggling to keep the Wikipedia page up in the early days is pretty surreal. There's also a little \"dad joke\" in there about the specific editor that issued the deletion (supposedly an expert on glaciers) being an \"ice-hole\" Quote from: SeeBiscuit on August 16, 2022, 12:53:09 AM{...} What have you guys learned since joining? {...}So much stuff! This can be a great place to learn, especially if you're not in a rush and read more than you write. It's a bit of a mixed bag though, and there's a lot of \"quota\" posting so you have to get used to picking out the good stuff and ignoring the bad.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=652.0",

Since I discovered here, I have been hooked to it and the loads of information available. For the younger generation, writing ad reading here would need some getting used to, but when you settle in, you start to build good community habits and understand more how a forum works.I have learnt a lot. School and work keep me away, but whenever I got some free time, I log in to learn some more and write a few of my thoughts.- Jay -",

Then I was introduced to this great site and just then, I discovered I knew virtually nothing more 'bout BTC than its name and the volatility of the price and lastly, the market structure.Overtime, in here, I have been thoroughly, pruned to become a cryptographical type; the forum is more or less a platform where people ain't denied thier prerogatives, people ain't molested for ignorance et most importantly, everyone is left to thier own discretion.That's the same reason why we have alot of wise, trustworthy fellows in here and we also have alot of shitty-head trolls; cus Knowledge in here is willful. The more you try to learn yourself, the better. some Peeps don't really care even if this is the best place they'd earn them( unforgettable experience/ knowledge)Look, I just hope you stay cool and follow the right path so you could achieve Major; rank-wise, knowledge-wise...trust-wise etc... welcome onboard!CheersSandra üë©‚Äçü¶±",

I thought that Legendary were experts then because they had been on the forum for a long time. But they weren't because there were quite a number of them who rank up to Legendary just because make post and qualified to rank up without any good qualities.Quote from: hugeblack on September 24, 2022, 07:08:41 PMLearning comes with constant questioning and development.Of course, knowledge exists because of learning and experience exists because we have been directly involved in this forum.",
