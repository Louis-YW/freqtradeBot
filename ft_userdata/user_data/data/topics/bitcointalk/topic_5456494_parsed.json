  "content": "BlackRock is set to have a signed collaborative agreement with the exchange Coinbase on Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) to allows the use of thier  Spot trading market values for proceedings of their services with their investors, but it's to recall that the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) in US have always oppose any attempt for the use of this same bitcoin ETF grant over time and on the same time granted many applications in time passed for Bitcoin Traded Fund over many institutions. QuoteIf approved, the Bitcoin ETF would open doors to a new wave of adoption and provide investors with an unprecedented opportunity to participate in the Bitcoin market through a regulated and accessible investment vehicle.https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/blackrock-nears-filing-bitcoin-etf-application-leveraging-coinbase-custodyWe could notice that the Security Exchange Commission (SEC) have been the one saddled with the responsibility to monitor the affairs of Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and we hope to see their grant and approval on BlackRock and not a turned offer decision, BlackRock believes this will lead to a rapid business development it has created and served an avenue for them to deliver best with it's clients and investors over Spot Bitcoin ETF it's going for.",

So it’s not exactly the same but for us users it doesn’t make a difference.SEC has been rejecting these ETFs for years so why is this a big deal? Well because it’s BlackRock which is huge in the industry and they wouldn’t waste their time if they knew it wouldn’t have a chance at getting approved. Also since it’s a trust it has a better chance of getting approved.",

Well i may not be in total support to your points raised here but also, if we are to give it more of a closer look, we should be able to derive one of two facts out of this, some have already said that it was at the cause of the move by BlackRock on Spot Bitcoin ETF that revived the market abit from going more downward below $24,000 which resulted that it experience a steady rise of about 1.3% surge within the 24 hours of when this news came in, that catapulted it resistance to $25, 700 as at yesterday's market price, but let's keep on being anticipated for more things getting unfold through this.",

The Trust seeks to reflect such performance before payment of the Trust’s expenses and liabilities. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple means of making an investment similar to an investment in bitcoin rather than by acquiring, holding and trading bitcoin directly on a peer-to-peer or other basis or via a digital asset exchange. The Shares have been designed to remove the obstacles represented by the complexities and operational burdens involved in a direct investment in bitcoin, while at the same time having an intrinsic value that reflects, at any given time, the investment exposure to the bitcoin owned by the Trust at such time, less the Trust’s expenses and liabilities.this means the spot wont be exact 1:1 with bitcoin. it will vary slightly. much like how stable coins are never actually 100% 1:1i do laugh when they sayQuoteInvestors may purchase and sell Shares through traditional securities brokerage accounts, and can avoid the complexities of handling bitcoin directly (e.g., managing wallets and public and private keys themselves, or interfacing with a trading platform), which some investors may not prefer or may find unfamiliar.funny part is that investors buying shares need to manage passwords portfolios and interfacing with a share trading platform.. as for if blackrock should be using coinbase as the custodian vault.. well the same story is for grayscaleif enough businesses mention their desire to trust coinbase it pushes the SEC to not try to destroy coinbase. because if the SEC tries to destroy coinbase directly causing business costs/losses. the businesses can then sue the SEC",

The Sponsor will base its determination on whatever factors it deems relevant, including but not limited to, the Sponsor’s beliefs regarding expectations of the core developers of bitcoin, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies, as well as the actual continued acceptance of, mining power on, and community engagement with, the Bitcoin network, or whatever other factors it deems relevant. There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork, and the Sponsor’s decision may adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result.

In the event of a fork, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, determine which network it believes is generally accepted as the Bitcoin network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network, and the associated asset as bitcoin, for the Trust’s purposes. The Sponsor may decide to cause the Trust to sell any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency for cash (including, as determined by the Sponsor, in the case of a fork, the asset that is not generally accepted as bitcoin, or in the case of an airdrop, the airdropped asset) and distribute the cash proceeds or distribute them in-kind to DTC, and registered holders of Shares are entitled to receive such distributions in proportion to the number of shares owned. However, the Sponsor may instead determine, in its sole discretion, to permanently and irrevocably abandon such Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency for no consideration. In the case of abandonment of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency, the Trust would not receive any direct or indirect consideration for the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency and thus the value of the Shares will not reflect the value of the Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency.",
