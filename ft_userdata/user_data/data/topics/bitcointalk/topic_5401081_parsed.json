Please post here or PM me if you have any and willing to do a deal! Thanks~I've got a couple of my 1g coins left, which were also created by DobZombie (same maker as the coin sought above).  I see these coins selling for enormous markups on eBay, so they've become a bit of a sought after item.  Anyway, good luck with getting your coins and if you haven't already, try reaching out to DobZombie as he does pop his head back in here every couple of years to see how the community is going.   [WTS] NastyFans 1g .999 Fine Silver Collector's Rounds (2013) - 0.001 BTChttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=273629.0[WTS] NastyPool 1g .999 Fine Silver Collector's Rounds (2014) - 0.001 BTChttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=728063.0(I know you already know this Todamont, but posted here for others who might be interested.)",
