If that happens. we'll be heading back towards the era of the scaling debate which lead to the creation of Bitcoin Cash (BCH).I think the possiblity of nodes rejecting Ordinals transactions, it is unlikely to happen as these transaction are still valid according to the Bitcoin protocol. However, it is possible that nodes might prioritize other types of transaction with higher fees to maximize their profits, which could result in slower confirmation times for ordinals transaction. In terms of the potential for a hard fork (UAHF), it is difficult to say whether or not it will be successful or if it will ruin Bitcoin. Hard forks can be contentious and can lead to a split in the community, as we saw with the creation of Bitcoin Cash.Quote from: Abiky on May 09, 2023, 04:23:28 PMDo you think the new hard fork will be a success? Will it destroy/ruin Bitcoin? If not, why?In terms of success of a hard work will depend on several factors, such as the level of community support, the technical capabilities of the new protocol, and the ability of users to adapt to the changes. It is worth noting that hard forks can be risky, and users should always exercise coution and do your own research before joining in any new network.",

Will it destroy/ruin Bitcoin? If not, why? Your input will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much. I don't think this causes a scaling debate. Everyone already knows you don't scale on-chain. I'm not saying Bitcoin necessarily never increase block size. If there is a fork for some other reason for a needed upgrade to Bitcoin I wouldn't mind a 2x or maybe even 4x block size increase cuz its not like the 1MB (or 1MB + segwit I guess) size that Satoshi happened to implement way back in the day is the perfect size ya know, it's just what he decided to put it at at the time. There are reasons to want a bit more txs in the blocks in the future like when newly minted coins go close to zero in a couple decades, but scaling bitcoin is not one of those reasons because you don't scale on-chain, you scale on higher layers. But I don't think block size alone is a reason to fork, and if it is done as part of some other fork it should only be done once because there is no point in actually trying to scale with block size increases.Anyway, block size increase wouldn't do anything to stop useless crap like NFTs and tokens from spreading, it'd just give them more space to fill up. So that's not even a solution. A solution would be a code change to prevent this sort of non-vital data from being crammed into txs. Some people would say thats censorship but of course it isn't. Nothing about bitcoin was about cramming any old data you want into the blockchain, bitcoin was made for sending money (satoshis) around. Other uses are fine as long as they don't inhibit the sending of money, but this whole ordinals/inscriptions/nfts/tokens nonstop does inhibit it so it is an exploit that should indeed be fixed. I don't know how or what that fix would look like, I see some people say you can do it and some people say it can't be done. I assume there would be some way to do it.And BCH was a different kind of fork than what you're talking about here. Here you're talking about a fork to fix a caustic unintended consequence on an upgrade, a fork to actually upgrade and replace the current spam-attacked chain. BCH was just a toxic group of people who wanted to turn bitcoin into a centralized altcoin that they control - and they got their centralized failed altcoin and bitcoin kept on going.",

I know every day thousands of Bitcoin transactions are going on, as many are buying and many are also selling, and for those people buying and selling, it may be a necessity for them to either buy or sell or spend their Bitcoin, and this high fee just made it a bit messy for some to carry out Bitcoin transactions, although it has reduced so much as of today compared to what It saw yesterday. I just believe this will not continue like this for a long time, and if it does, there will be a lot of FUD, but a lot of people will also adopt and only spend their Bitcoin when they necessarily have to, which will be more of an issue for some who want to invest in Bitcoin newly. For example, some newbie who wants to buy $100 worth of BTC for the first time, would spend like $20 in fees (it's crazy, right?).I believe we will cross the bridge soon.",

I'm hoping the spammers targeting Bitcoin with useless NFTs move to other chains with plenty of transaction capacity to handle anything they're thrown at them. Fees on BTC will rise to a point where it'll become economically unfeasible for spammers to continue flooding the Blockchain with Ordinals inscriptions. We just need to be patient to see great results in the long run. In the meantime, I'd suggest you use an alternative cryptocurrency with lower fees to avoid \"breaking the bank\". That is if you're planning on spending BTC every once in a while. Else, keep on \"hodling\" until the tide is over. Who knows if there will be brigher days ahead for Bitcoin? Just my opinion",

Instead, it is due to the 1MB block size limit and the increase in the number of users willing to transact on the Bitcoin network.Secondly, the creation of a new hard fork (UAHF) requires a significant amount of time, effort and resources to be spent on developing a new network and mobilizing the community.
