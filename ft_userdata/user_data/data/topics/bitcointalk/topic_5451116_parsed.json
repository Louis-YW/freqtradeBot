School is basic, it helps you to sharpen your skills. I thank that it is better to learn theories first before practicals. Therefore in school you can study more theories about your skills before going into it practically.",

It is the absolute best place to hone your social skills and learn to be a good \"people's person,\" someone who just gets along with everyone. Try to see the value in every different subject, and learning to think critically to solve problems translates to everything meaningful you'll do for the rest of your life. School is underrated among today's entrepreneurs.",

      "body": "I strongly believe it is more important first to go to school to learn and obtain the necessary skills for the career that you want in your future. It would not surprise me if a young kid was so gifted and talented in playing soccer that he did not need any school means he will not need it in the future. School is more important because you get to learn the basic skills that you will use in daily life for example reading, writing, and math. Even if you were taught the skill of hunting, fishing, and farming at some point you will have to you the skills taught in school to even do business. Today the majority of office or administrative jobs require you to have a high school diploma or even a college degree. If you do some type of general labor, or construction jobs do not always require you to have any type of schooling. However, these types of jobs are very hard on the body because they will require the use of your body by digging, picking up, pulling, walking, squatting, and constantly doing repetitive movements that will eventually take a strain on your body. This is why our parents perhaps did not have the opportunity to go to school and get a degree. Always encourage me to go to school and get a degree and get a good career so that I will not be miserable stuck with a job that would not make me happy.",
