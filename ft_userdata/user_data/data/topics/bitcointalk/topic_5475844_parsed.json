      "body": "I had a look at the pool, I found some interesting claims, such as QuoteToday, pools operate like custodial bank accounts and have the ability to decide who can and who can't use BitcoinIsn't this how mining pools have always been from the get-go? what has changed? why does Luke think it's a recent development of some kind? in fact, before the Chinese government banned mining, 2-3 Chinese entities or perhaps people had well over 50% of the hashrate, furthermore, at that point, not only were mining pools centralized  -- the physical location of the hashrate origin was pretty damn centralized (which is still the case now, except it moved from China to the U.S).QuoteAs for censorship, it is no longer a matter of actual resistance but merely if and when the pools choose to do it there are 11 entities who decide what transactions go in (or stay out) of almost every block, and simply the 2 largest can impose censorship on everyone else with 100% success. The first part is correct, although I doubt that at any point in the past, we had anything more than 11 large pools, however, the second part, 2 largest can't have 100% success in censorship, the two largest pools today own 55% of the hashrate, to make it easier to understand, let's just say the mine half the blocks out there, and thus their censorship success rate would be 0%, on average, every other block is found by someone else (not antpool and foundry), so there is always a 50% that you may need to wait for the 2 blocks to get 1 confirmation.Obviously, it gets worse the more these two grow, even worse if they take in the 3rd largest pool with them, so ya, more pools will always help, however, I just dislike the sales pitch.Now back to the pool itself, I see that this pool is not PPS, and thus, I don't see it going anywhere far, I sure can't be teaching someone Luke about Bitcoin mining history, but history shows that anything non-PPS is very likely to fail.",

I see it at 118.2 Ph/s from the top of the 1st page and from the list of miners.Also, looking here https://ocean.xyz/blocktemplate you can see the TXs that they plan to put into a block if they find one. So you can check the individual TXs to see if they have BRC-20 in them.-Dave",

      "body": "By the way, you all should definitely give a watch to the presentation of OCEAN:https://youtu.be/_PH5sKrkzZY?t=14527The panel and discussion about the pool start around the 4 hours and 2 minutes mark in the video. Jack Dorsey, Luke Dashjr and OCEAN's Bitcoin Mechanic spoke and detailed what makes the pool unique. Well the first 4 hours also had a few interesting parts but it's not directly related to the pool. I can try summarizing since I watched the whole thing. Basically barefoot mining has put on an old hydro plant to put mining hardware under 100% clean energy. So a partner/supporter of the initiative is putting his own hashrate towards the pool, we can assume that's the bulk of the current hashrate that was switched on recently. Jack Dorsey who also spoke, he seems to be a major backer of this project financially. Then there was a lot of talk about how to get \"pleb miners\" on board in order to decentralize mining. Basically the best idea centered around integrating chips as heating elements to utilize them efficiently and desirable on a home environment. To make that feasible though more durable and more open chip technology must be made available. Jack Dorsey also revealed that his company Square has an ASIC research unit!? Predictably there was quite a bit of talk about how much Ordinals suck. Although at no point in this presentation was it explicitly stated that the pool will be filtering Ordinal transactions out of mined blocks. You should really watch the video and read the contents of the website for stuff about the pool in order to better understand technicalities around the pool and why it's superior and helps in decentralization. Although I must mention one downside. Looking at the website's FAQ section, the minimum payout is 0.01048576. For so much talk about pleb miners, a payout threshold that high is kinda disappointing. Perhaps it would be technically feasible to decrease to a lower minimum dynamically. Hopefully that'll get looked into in the pool's future.",

Back of the napkin math is about 60 days at 100 TH/s so someone with only a single miner would have to wait a while to get paid.That gets into opportunity costs, are you better off loosing whatever % with a FPPS pool then waiting on your BTCObviously, everyone will be different, but it's something to think about.-Dave",

Oh , the irony , the guys that are crying out loud about censorship are those censoring others . What a joke ( didn't expect something else from Luke and Jack tbh  ) .Good luck to the miners that decide to join them and burn money .I would like to see if other pools will reject their block in case ocean pool hits the jackpot .

Mr. Luke has repeatedly called Ordinals an attack on bitcoin and had developed his bitcoin client to run without broadcasting them as a node. I think it's good that such choice exists though, because so far all other pools were mining ordinals without consulting their miners at all. Interestingly though, OCEAN has mentioned that miners will be able to propose their own block templates, being one of the first to do so. So miners on OCEAN could easily propose their own block templates including ordinals no problem if they wanted.",

So Luke isn't alone in that. Surely plenty of miners would probably be on board in creating block templates that would not include Ordinal transactions. But the thing with mining is that it has nothing to do with individual (person) support. It's all in the hashpower. OCEAN has promised create infrastructure which would allow their miners to create their own block templates. And so far AFAIK there wasn't a pool that actually gave miners the opportunity to say no to mining ordinals. Once that update is released on the pool I guess there wouldn't be any reason for there to be any blowback. It would be purely the choice of miners to exclude ordinals from the transactions they confirm with their own hash.",

It is still custodial no matter what, the custodianship only ends when you receive your payouts to your wallet, and it starts again right after the first hash you submit, so the pool will always be custodial of something, be it your hashrate or the actually sats.Currently, the pool would find a single block every 12 days, so in terms of custodianship, it's worse than all PPS pools, and it doesn't matter how much hashrate it gets, any PPS pool could outpace it in that regard, a PPS pool could start paying out every time they find a block or even every hour for that matter. so what gives?You would expect that these devs would have created a truly decentralized mining pool, but no, just make another ordinary pool as if more pools will solve the problem, what happens when Luke gets a warning from the authorities and is forced to censor certain transactions, is he going to fight the government over it? creating a single point of failure is not going to solve censorship.",
