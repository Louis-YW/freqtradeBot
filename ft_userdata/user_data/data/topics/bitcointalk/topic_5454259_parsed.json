  "content": "Beterbiev is staking the three titles he is holding against the very dangerous Callum Smith Both fighters have a very good knockout percentage with Beterbiev boosting with 100% knock out but Callum is also known as the guy who can deliver a good fight he is younger and more experienced than Beterbiev I'm sure Callum has learned a lot from his only loss against Canelo and he will use it against BeterbievSo who you got in this fight?IMAGES FROM box.live",

      "body": "Although Smith is a good boxer, I don't think that he can upset Beterbiev here. I mean we have seen how Beterbiev's power and the only fighter that we are interested of him fighting next is Bivol for the unification fight.No offense to Smith, this might be just another tune up fight for Beterbiev, stay busy fight before they can see if they can get Bivol next. Although the plan for Bivol right now is to rematch Canelo. But maybe down the line we might see Beterbiev vs Bivol. But currently, Beterbiev might stay active so that he won't have the ring rust because he is not getting any younger as well.So I voted for: Beterbiev by knock out",

So we might see 20 out of 20 knockout.",

      "body": "Callum Smith may have an edge when it comes to experience but Beterbiev can take punches and at the same time has power in both hands, I see Beterbiev chasing Callum, and when Beterbiev hit him with body punches the next that will fall is the head.Beterieve will go to the body first then next to the head while he chases Callum because Callum has the height and reach advantage he will use it and do a hit-and-run method as he did in his match against Canelo.This match is very predictable unless Callum goes toe-to-toe which is very risky for him because Beterbiev can easily take him outI hope after this fight we'll have an all-Russian match between Bivol - and Beterbiev for the undisputed light heavyweight championship.",

Therefore, it is Callum Smith who will be facing the very dangerous and undefeated Artur Beterbiev who holds and boasts the 100% KO rate.Smith might have a very decent knockout rate with over 70 percent but if we compared it to Beterbiev's, that somehow much lower and forgive me if it will make me sound that I underestimate Smith, but against the 3-belt champion? I seriously don't see this fight ending in the challenger's favor nor I don't even believe that this bout will be decided in hands of the judges.",

Arthur remains to be the best in this division and the only true test for him is another Russian in Bivol.",

Maybe this is some sort of a tune-up for Beterbiev before his promoter Uncle Bob finally agrees to a fight with Bivol for the unification. He may be 39 or 40 at that time so no more reason for Top Rank to still hold on to Beterbiev as he will be very old at that time.If indeed Bivol vs Beterbiev will push through, this would be interesting as it will be dubbed as \"Battle for Russia's King\"  .",

But I come in peace  just kidding. That said, I'm both supporters of Bivol and Beterbiev, and I surely want to witness a unification fight between the both of them but unfortunately, that just cannot happen for now because the sanctioning bodies is not inclined in making it a reality because of Bivol's situation.QuoteDmitry Bivol Will Be Blocked From Undisputed Fight Against Artur Beterbiev.

Thank you for this information. This has been rumored since 2022 when Bivol was chasing Beterbiev for a fight. However, everyone did not take the rumor much seriously and it was probably what started another rumor. Beterbiev is avoiding Bivol hehehehee.In any case, it appears what prevents Bivol vs. Beterbiev is again politics.

From what I've read was that before they would give it  a green light they may have to make sure they have another dog to replace the losing one. A new breed of fighter shall emerge first among the ranking. They couldn't just afford to throw big shot fighters like Bivol or Beterbeiv under the bus wihtout prepared replacement. Same thing they didn't make Crawford and Spence happen yet.The bookmakers can decide the odds whoever can possibly win. More than likely Beterbeiv.",
