  "content": "Just came across a comment that made me aware of FLUX. I had never heard of this project up to that point ( they were comparing it to Helium in that it has real world utility ) and I'm a pretty informed investor, so I realized this could be one of the best plays for the next bull run. I think it did something like 11,000 % gains late last year so that should get your attention. Of course you can expect it to be super volatile, but that's what you get with such an explosive token. I know there are a lot of great projects at incredible prices these days, but one thing I look at is token performance. Algorand for instance, one of the most clever, most innovative projects out there, with big partnerships and amazing technology, has had really mediocre token performance... even in the past bull run. It didn't show me anything, other than great potential. With FLUX the technology is great, but token performance it's right up there with the best I've ever seen.",

With FLUX the technology is great, but token performance it's right up there with the best I've ever seen.It already has marketcap of 135 million. Going 100x would take it in this market over ADA and Doge, making it highest layer 2 token in coinmarketcap (if you don't indclude stablecoins, which you shouldn't).Now, since you consider your self as pretty informed investor, why would it go there? It was made in 2018? It's listed in binance, but what does it have to offer that others don't? Just that \"technology is great\" doesn't really sell it to me. Not that you would need to sell it, i am just interested.",

So tell me, experienced investor, how do you justify the capitalization of $ 18 billion on this token? What userbase do you expect with this capitalization? what volumes/profits will the project generate then. And finally, what distinguishes this project from the 10,000 others listed on CMC that it deserves to be in the top 5? What is his technology so good at? and even if it is so unique, how sure are you that no one will come up with a better alternative until then?Or maybe you just shill your bag?Quote from: sesterceshop on August 08, 2023, 07:02:24 AMimpressive historical token performance-90% from ATH is what you call a \"impressive\"?",
