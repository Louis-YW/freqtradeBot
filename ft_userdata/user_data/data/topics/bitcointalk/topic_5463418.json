  "content": "HI,Vendor Coin has been in existence since the 8th of November 2021. https://www.vendorcoin.online/We have had many trials and a lot of work has gone into getting us this far. This is to start a very brief introduction to us and to publicise the fact that we shall soon be going live with upcoming exchange listings. Here is a 3 point overview of what we are about...(a) – Payments We are developing an App which will be available on the Apples ‘App Store’ and ‘google Play’ next year. This App will be multi-faceted and enable a whole raft of innovative and useful features, which will include the following :We are aiming to programme the App in such a way that it will enable ANY Cryptocurrency to be transferred to it using your wallet and then there will be an automatic process of exchange that happens in the App whereby the minute any Cryptocurrency hits the Apps wallet, then that particular coin (whatever it may be) will be automatically exchanged for Vendor Coin on an appropriate Dex (such as Pancakeswap (for Binance), Uniswap (for Ethereum) or Trader Joe (for Avalanche) etc… The App will link to a database which will include a list of approved merchants. These merchants will be able to use the same App to accept payments from customers in Vendor Coin. In return these merchants can offer customers who pay in Vendor Coin special discounts (which we will reimburse the traders via the marketing wallet (of which a small percentage of all transactions will be forwarded to). The App will also contain a specially designed Dex that will automatically swap Vendor Coin back to BNB’s (and eventually) FIAT cash!. We are also working toward this Dex swapping any other Cryptocurrency to vendor Coin (using a hop function similar to what is on pancake swap).Put quite simply here, this App is an ambitious project which aims to eliminate all barriers between IAT currency and Cryptocurrency and make all transactions in the real world using any Cryptocurrency with traditional equal with FIAT means of exchange. Vendor Coin will be the Crypto currency of the system which will bridge the gap between FIAT payments, services and other Crypto assets! People are already used to paying for goods using Cell phone contactless payment systems, so this is the next step in that direction. (b) – Vendors Vendor Coin will act as a payment mechanism for all kinds of merchants… Such as:To this end we are also aiming to be listed on the following merchant trading platforms (which will also accept Vendor Coin) Tradesmen (electricians, plumbers, kitchens and bathroom fitters, roofers, etc), Retailers (suppliers of computer hardware, software/firmware & antivirus protection), & Service providers (such as: web designers, IT specialists code writers/ programmers). nowpayments.io woocommerce.com shopify.com(c) – Vending Machines This is based on the Bitcoin ATM machines in America which were popular in the early days of Crypto. In those days, you could go and input either cash or a Debit/Credit Card and receive either digital Bitcoin assets or an actual Bitcoin ‘coin’. We are going to expand on this idea and progress it to a more natural and organic conclusion. That being for all types of vending machines to accept Vendor Coin as a method of payment. This can be done via a simple software upgrade to the units ECU and as the ‘Internet of Things’ is becoming more and more prevalent; it would be easy for us to track trading volumes in real time. This enables the usage of Vendor Coin to be correlated to the exchanges automatically, which will in turn have a positive correlation on the price (resulting in an inevitable green candle stick up trend).Thanks for reading,All the best!",
