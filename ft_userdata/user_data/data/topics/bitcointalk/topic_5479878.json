I don’t even think that he knew that they’ll be such volatility. While we enjoy and reap the fruits of it, let us not forget that it was actually built as a currency. Let’s not forget the pizza story that happened on this forum… it was meant to be an example which we should follow and walk in.",

People keep the dollar in their bank accounts as a means of saving for the future, that does not mean others are not paying for goods and services with the dollar. In my country, many people have become millionaires by simply holding the dollar, which experienced explosive growth against our local currency. That people are even holding Bitcoin and profiting from it is a good indication that Bitcoin is doing very well in line with the purpose of its creation.",

As Bitcoin keep improving we'll achieved it been widely use as a currency more as satoshi wanted but this is a process and we have to believe in the process. Bitcoin is still a currency but it's features are making it more appealing as a store of value (investment opportunity), that doesn't mean Bitcoin has stopped been a currency. As more countries adopt Bitcoin and more companies recognised it as a payment option, the use of Bitcoin as a currency will increase. You don't expect people to use Bitcoin as much as you have loved when there aren't enough institution to facilitate that.Bitcoin hasn't deviated but its assets quality is what is been focused on and things would be different in the future when more adoption comes onto the industry and businesses that using Bitcoin more frequently. For the meantime what I think is important is for Bitcoin to not die. It still been relevent is a positive thing and gives room for more development and improvements.",

Bitcoin is more of an investment rather than a currency system. But that's what the mass wants. That's how a free market should function. When an innovation is launched and made it available to the mass, it's the public that decides the course of it. That's exactly what happened to Bitcoin as well. Also, looking at the current situation of the transaction fees, Bitcoin is just not competitive enough to become a currency system. To be a currency system, Bitcoin needs to be cheap and fast, which is not the case. So take it as an investment only!",

You are not discussing the real challenge of bitcoin, we have more other than it been speculative assets since Satoshi left it to be open for everyone.Bitcoin isn't longer for Satoshi, it's  now a big digital currency for the world  but the debate of mempool is never ending. This boiled down to the fees and I'm just curious why some BIP(bitcoin improvement proposals) where rejected and they allow bitcoin transaction mempool to be spam. I want to be convince otherwise that we have many other people from miners that love this crazy fees. It's the bitcoin community that are complaining but miners are enjoying everything they ever wanted in this cost of transactions. It still baffle how they stylishly even allow segwit for people to cut down fees only to be spending this huge fees when Satoshi whitepaper has vision and it's clearly stated and yet we want adoption.",

So Bitcoin has turned into more of a digital gold for investment than something you'd use to grab your morning coffee like cash but isn't that good news? It created something more.  It may be true that everyone's jumping on the crypto bandwagon not to revolutionize payments but to make quick millions but i think it is something to celebrate. Maybe it is just disappointing for those people who initially envisioned a widespread alternative to traditional payment systems.

We get network congestions for breakfast almost every week and if we're looking to expand bitcoin's reach this could become even more common in the future, is this really what he wanted?

And the reason people want to own it is that it is a hard currency and therefore increases in value over time - which was part of Satoshi's vision for Bitcoin. You can't just skip straight to people using a currency when barely anyone has the currency, because you need enough people owning it and therefore accepting it for people to be able to readily spend it. Using it for payments is literally the last step in the evolution of a organically adopted currency. Bitcoin is still just very far from that final stage.And not sure why you are mentioned other cryptocurrency as they have nothing to do with Satoshi or Bitcoin.",

It can only be found on Wayback Machine, I add a description of this book which can be found at the beginning of the book, written by Valery Chalidze himself, who died in 2018. (1938----Entire book - PDF // Entropy Demystified: Potential Order, Life and Money (2000)https://web.archive.org/web/20221004134003/http://www.worksofvalerychalidze.com/uploads/1/0/2/8/102863812/entropy.pdf---About This Book (Valery Chalidze // 2000)Although the concept of entropy has been under discussion for one and a half centuries, its philosophical depth has still not been properly explored and it is still one of the most complicated and controversial concepts of science. Its application to the study of social processes has started only in recent decades and no doubt this trend will continue. The author’s first goal in this book is to provide those who are interested in social studies, but not familiar with physics, with a comprehensible explanation of the concept of entropy. The value of the knowledge of entropy for the social scientist is at least two-fold:Entropy is characteristic of a level of disorder in any statistical system and for this reason can be successfully used for the description of the communication process, music or economic activity as well as the behavior of inanimate matter. In this use, one is dealing with the order and disorder of a system independently of physics: entropic characteristics can be used no matter what makes a system orderly or disorderly, be it the laws of mechanics or our manipulations with symbols, like the alphabet letters of musical notes. The example of the use of the entropy concept as a characteristic of any statistical system is the well known Shannon’s Theory of Information which found its application not only in the technology of communications but in biology, linguistics and other areas.Whenever we are dealing with matter and energy be it heat machines, biology, economy or the use of natural resources, we must take into account the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the level of disorder (entropy) in an enclosed system can not decrease and that one has to spend energy to decrease disorder in any part of the system. The processes of life and social life are characterized by increasing local order, but are still subject to limitation as dictated by the second law of thermodynamics. This brought scientists to the development of the physics of open systems thanks to the ideas of Schrodinger, Prigogine and others. Now we understand that the world is a place where destructive tendencies coexist with creative forces.For many decades the traditional topic for passionate debate among scientists and moralists has been whether we are masters of our behavior or whether and to what extent we follow biological prescription - instincts. In this book, the author tries to go one step deeper, to the following inquiry: what are the inevitable consequences of the fact that we are built from matter, and how much our willing - together with instinctive - behavior is defined and limited by the laws of physics? Limitations imposed on life, social life, economics and the use of environment by the second law of thermodynamics are particularly interesting.After an extensive explanation of what entropy is as a measure of disorder, the author shows how entropy can be used as a bulk characteristic to measure order. He introduces the concept of potential order, which characterizes the ability of an open system to become orderly or to create order in another system. Potential order is a property of fields of subatomic particles and atoms which provide for the primary organization of matter. It is also a property of complex molecules within the living cell which provide for the organized behavior of living entities. Further, human will and economic enterprise possess potential order to increase order around us, be it material order or the creation of information.The author is showing that the second law of thermodynamics is fundamental in putting limitations on certain automatic behavioral patterns of all living creatures - including humans - such as entropy lowering activity and self-isolation from the disorderly matter surrounding us.The entropic approach permits the author to do further inquiry into the connection between physics and economics. It is well known that the ideas of classical mechanics provided the basis for the development of mathematical economics since the time it was established in the nineteenth century. In recent decades more economists started to realize the limitation of such an approach and started to connect economic thinking with a thermodynamic approach as well as with systems’ theory.The concept of entropy in relation to economics and sociology was under discussion in the works of Faber, Georgesku-Roegen, and others. More authors started to see the deep analogy of economic development and the behavior of a thermodynamic system. After all, human activity, which is the subject of economic study, is a local entropy lowering process and it is exactly physics which can permit us to see the unavoidable limits of this activity.The author shows that the low-entropic component of an economy, which is the order producing activity of people, should not be treated in theory the same way as the purely energetic component. On the basis of this, the author shows the limitations for the use of variational calculus in economics, discussing particularly the maximization of utility function.In his analysis of the monetary measurement of order and potential order, the author shows that some important problems connected with the evaluation of goods produced by economy, inflation and monetary policy come from the fact that the same measuring device—money— is used for both—the purely energetic and low-entropic components of the economy.// This message could disappear due to censorship //",
