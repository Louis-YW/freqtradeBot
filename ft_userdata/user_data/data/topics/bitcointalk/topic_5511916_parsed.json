Does it make the Bitcoin transactions instantaneous? What is changing? What's the point of such conspiracy theories if these do not change anything for better? The real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains a mystery. I am sure a large number of the community members do not want Satoshi to be revealing his/her real identity for good. Let's respect that!",

There is nothing special about buying a domain and joining Twitter. How does that prove anything? Out of the many theories that have been proposed, there has never been a strong case for Jeff Garzik being Satoshi. You woke up after almost three years of inactivity to write this nonsense.

Satoshi identity is better been a mystery, don't wanna be a caller of doom but hopefully he has headed to the beyond.If not, remain unseen even after leaving the world. Yes, Satoshi is from the Eastern Part of Nigeria  Well the thing is that, some people are just very inquisitive in nature and maybe they believe that helping to reveal or find the real identity of Satoshi would help solve a few problems, or maybe make them a notable figure in the history of Bitcoin as the man or woman that discovered or revealed the identity of Bitcoin creator after he went on a self imposed exile and disappeared from the surface of the earth. But in reality, this is just a total waste of one’s precious time (well except your time ain’t precious to you) because Satoshi’s identity being revealed still wouldn’t solve any problem in the network, but is likely to eve create more problems. So people should just take a chill pill and calm down from this whole discovery shit.",

Later, the forum got its own domain name, but due to this history, bitcoin.org and bitcointalk.org have traditionally been linked, and for quite some time Cøbra and I have together managed the domain names. However, Cøbra has never had much involvement in bitcointalk.org's operation, and I haven't involved myself in bitcoin.org for a couple of years, so the linkage between the two no longer really made made any sense. If it is as simple as you thought, Cøbra can be Satoshi Nakamoto too.",

By this privacy and safety approach, it's impossible that Satoshi Nakamoto will appear and publicly claim as a Bitcoin founder. It's impossible.For two other types of people, the first type is people who claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto. They are Faketoshi, it's clearly.Another type of people, who deny to be Satoshi Nakamoto, in my opinion they are not Satoshi Nakamoto too. Because if I am Satoshi Nakamoto, I don't appear and make any denial, that only put me at bullseye.",
