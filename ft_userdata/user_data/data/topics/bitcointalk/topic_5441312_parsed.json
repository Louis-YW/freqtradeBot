What if peter obi finally wins and goes contrary to the needs of the citizens (Nigerians)1. There are 18 candidates for the presidential seat, including representatives and senators. Why would you favor a particular candidate? And with 87 million confirmed voters, all possibilities are possible.2. Nigeria, despite being the largest African country by population and using a democratic voting system since 2019, does not suffer from a worsening economic crisis and security unrest in the north and center of the country due to the activity of armed terrorist groups (Boko Haram, for example). I am not surprised that any party seeks to manipulate the results, especially since in the period leading up to the elections, attacks took place on polling stations, security headquarters, and candidates.3. I don't think anyone can answer this question, including Nigerians themselves.",

If the masses agree to vote for a particular persons as choice of representative, then let the aspirants exercise fate on the fact that they trust on their capacity. If you think you're the best candidate let the people decides not by using thugs or criminals to sabotage election. *Obi will win if the people truly vote for him,Â  his party should be at active in monitoring the process.*Inec are human beings that's why the need to be monitored and followed up*Obi will not betray the country, but we can't expect him to be perfect.Â Change of government is for everybody to adjust, if the masses do not frustrate his government then we all can see a better Nigerian.",

But laying the groundwork for 'after' should be done before, right?People vote for a candidate because they like what he said, his platform. If they didn't like it, they wouldn't vote for him. Note that I am talking about real voting here, not about something like forcing only one candidate to be running, which is some kind of dictatorship behind the scenes.What should people do before the election? Make the platform a candidate is running on to be a literal contract between the people and the candidate. Then, if the candidate is elected, he has to do what he said in his platform/contract, or a penalty. What penalty? Death/execution. Let me say it again.The candidates' platforms are contracts to do the things the candidates say in their platforms. If they win, and don't do the things written in the contract in a time specified in the contract... death/execution. Now, there might be exceptions, like life in prison with hard labor, if the newly elected person can't complete his contract on time because of outside interference. The details of how to handle the contract need to be worked out by the people.This needs to be enacted into law. It will eliminate much of the election 'sinner' from doing things other than what the people voted him in for.",
