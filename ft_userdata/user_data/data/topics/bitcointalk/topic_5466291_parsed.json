  "content": "There are many traffic exchanges, where you can spend your time in surfing member webpages and promote your link/webpage. In practise one visited webpage give you one visitor to your site. But in most traffic exchanges you just waste your time - no one is interested to buy something from your webpage.Use different strategy - not to try to sale through your webpage, but to find possibilities, also in Bitcoin/altcoin market.There is one traffic exchange, with really many active members, so a lot of surfing pages. You just surf daily - spend 15 - 30 minutes. And then time by time you find something, may be in 2% cases - find good possibilities in crypto, site promoting, marketing etc. Good antivirus software needed too.Can ad the link to this traffic exchange in this thread, if forum members are interested.",
