      "body": "I think the safest way to buy crypto hussle free is via P2P for now. Most Big/Old centralised Exchanges support P2P with different kinds of coins. I use MEXC Global exchange everytime because Its faster and easier for me there and its supports most of the coins I do buy. Also, withdrawal fees are very cheap there. Maybe you should give P2P a try.",
