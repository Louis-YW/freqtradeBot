I bet you they are definitely smart enough to think this, in fact I will say smarter but one prevents them from doing it which is greed. Do you think the government aren’t aware of the inflation problem associated with fiat currency and the problem to solve it? They do but they use this inflation to either weaken people’s business growth and to boost there’s through other means. Another advantage bitcoin has over fiat is the freedom and privacy that comes with. This one is the most powerful thing the government or say politicians do not want its citizens to have. A free man is seen as a threat to their ambitions and with the privacy bitcoin overs they wouldn’t be Able to place surveillance on the citizens which is something they can not afford to lose",

I know this is not exclusive to my country only.Unfortunately,  what you are suggesting is akin to the authorities handing over their power, their authorities and the very thing that enable them decide \"who gets what, when and how\". Imagine government allowing Bitcoin to flourish,  lifting all restrictions and limitations placed on it and allowing citizens to decide what they prefer. Do you think many will not choose Bitcoin? Do you think that their is much the authorities can do stop inflation? If there was anything to be done to stop it, some countries would have done it and inflation will not be happening across all currency. As long as they have the power to print unlimited supply of fiat currency, inflation is bound to become a recurring decimal. The authorities thrive by the control they have over the financial system and anything that threatens that power will be resisted or at least forced to conform to their terms and conditions.

Ignoring Bitcoin is like ignoring someone who comes to take your land, resources and even your wife. How can you ignore something that you cannot ignore? There was a time my country threatened to ban Binance because they complained that the money people have in Binance was bigger than what they have in their bank accounts. People were practically saving their funds in Bitcoin and USDT rather than in the banks and this was affecting the banks in terms of lending power. Bitcoin cannot be ignored even if they try.",

It relates not only to economics but also politics and politicians prioritize their career than benefits of citizens and they have power to use central banks for it. It's naturally for politicians to use such power to print more money as temporary nurture for economy but in a long term, it is harmful. Their national fiat currencies will lose purchasing powers but politicians usually don't think longer than 4 years or 8 years.QuoteIn the second approach, by simply ignoring Bitcoin or avoiding direct confrontation through over-regulation or restriction of its use, Bitcoin would just remain in a corner and not emerge as a significant threat to the financial systems.They can create more laws, regulations and barriers to prevent Bitcoin adoption growing more. They are more seriously to control centralized exchanges, Peer-to-Peer marketplaces and they also are trying to create a kind of competitive currency (CBDCs - Central Banks Digital Currencies) to get money flow of citizens into their controlled flow.They will somewhat succeed with the efforts with power they have but I have rights to make my decision from many choices and I believe technology will be developed more. Governments will always go behind their citizens in technology developments.",

If the criterion you are talking about is only a bad/weak national currency, then how do you explain all those who invest in Bitcoin in countries like the US or the EU - unless their currencies are also bad like your national currency?The problem of your country is not actually what the majority thinks, it is the corrupt and incompetent politicians who create an atmosphere of financial instability and a bad economic environment. This leads people to look for some kind of alternative, but not in the sense that you are trying to fix the financial or political system, but that you are trying to make a financial profit for yourself by investing in Bitcoin.Quote from: Davidvictorson on November 28, 2023, 01:09:55 PMIn the second approach, by simply ignoring Bitcoin or avoiding direct confrontation through over-regulation or restriction of its use, Bitcoin would just remain in a corner and not emerge as a significant threat to the financial systems. ~snip~I don't see that Bitcoin is a threat to the financial system anywhere in the world, especially not as a decentralized currency considering that most people use it exclusively as an investment to make a profit, so I wonder where the danger is for fiat and any central bank? The biggest danger for bankers and their servants (politicians) are the so-called stablecoins. If most of the powerful countries of the world were to unite in causing serious damage to Bitcoin, all they would have to do is ban all CEX and declare all transactions illegal.Quote from: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/11/30/stablecoins-pose-serious-risks-to-financial-security-ecbs-lagarde-says/While noting stablecoins are trying to fix those issues and could drive added innovation in payments, they \"pose serious risks,\" Lagarde said. \"Using stablecoins as a store of value could trigger a large shift of bank deposits to stablecoins, which may have an impact on banks' operations and the transmission of monetary policy,\" the ECB head added.",

People have known bitcoin and theirs nothing you can do that will make someone who knows bitcoin very well to try to avoid bitcoin or ignore, even though the country lift a sanctions about adoption of bitcoin their is some people who will embrace bitcoin with another system of manipulation.",

All hope is not lost for Nigeria but not until all mind becomes one there is never going to be a real change, when the poor ones start saying no to the people in power that's when things will start to take a turn, right now money still buy some people, in fact a lot of people, this is what is dragging down all sense of justice and growth in the country.",

I know this is not exclusive to my country only.The first policy you're trying to talk about cannot fully have it implementation or effect because fiat does not yield interest.But Bitcoin yield interest with time. So even if you put the economic infrastructure in place, in a bid to stabilize the country's currency, it won't still affect the adoption of bitcoin in Nigeria. For every economy in the world inflation is bound to take place, the level of impact can either be determined by the effect your government tries to put in place to control it. So whether there is inflation or not, it doesn't negate the fact that fiat has its own deficiencies which in the other hand gives Bitcoin its own advantage.",

Of course there isn't a complete fix for fiat currencies, since they operate in an inflationary model, where money is constantly printed to keep the economy under control, but in extreme cases like the one we see in Nigeria, I think it's pretty possible to make the situation much better through an economical reform or plan introduced by the government and central bank, supported and elaborated by specialists. It has already happened in many third world countries and worked nicely, including my country, Brazil, where inflation was also out of control by the 90's decade, and got significantly better since then through the 'Plano Real' economical remodeling introduced in 1993-1994.In every cases, I don't think you should feel so bad about it, because at least it's an opportunity for Bitcoin to shine and get more acceptance in your local community.

I can see the info about Nigeria, but these issues aren't universal.Some countries have major issues with fiat, like hyperinflation or just high inflation. But there are many examples of fiat currencies that have been doing quite well for a long time (if 0-5% of annual inflation is considered 'well' because that's the aim of many fiat currencies). Moreover, some would say that the problem of fiat is that it can be printed and destroyed at a whim of authorities. Others might add that the key issue of fiat is that it is no longer backed up by truly valuable assets. So, according to different people, fixing fiat would mean very different things.As for ignoring Bitcoin, I think it's already pretty common, as active opposition to Bitcoin is an approach undertaken by a minority of countries. But some cannot allow themselves to ignore Bitcoin because they see it as a direct threat to their control over their population (as is the case in China).",

Bitcoin is an alternative to fiat, and it's a matter of choice for an individual to adopt it, it is decentralized while fiat is centralized.
