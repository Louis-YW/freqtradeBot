When I say that your crypto portfolio should have more than just Bitcoin, I'm addressing Bitcoin enthusiasts who want to make short-term gains while staying invested in Bitcoin as their primary asset.Here are a few reasons why:• Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and its price can fluctuate wildly in the short term. This can make it difficult to generate consistent profits by trading Bitcoin alone.• By diversifying your portfolio with other cryptocurrencies, you can reduce your overall risk. Some altcoins may be more volatile than Bitcoin, but they may also offer the potential for higher returns.• Some altcoins have specific use cases that could make them more attractive to investors in the short term. For example, some altcoins are focused on developing decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, which are becoming increasingly popular.If you're a Bitcoin enthusiast who wants to make short-term gains, I recommend that you consider diversifying your portfolio with a few other altcoins.

It's quite the opposite, you totally increase the risks you are taking in order to raise the profitability chance of your investment, because as you said, altcoins are much more volatile than Bitcoin (in every directions, upside and down). And there are no chances an altcoin performs well, while Bitcoin performs poorly. Keep in mind Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency which drives this market in every directions, and altcoins just follow its movement or tendency.

Let me explain Bitcoin is considered the most reliable one, when you mention that volatility volatility is not only based on the market price an asset will be considered more asset it lacks transparency and with a maximum of the alts you'll face transparency or supply control issues.Bitcoin is far more reliable, when it comes to diversification it is a good thing for better financial planning and asset management but when you are only in alts with a diversified portfolio you are in a reliable scenario, with Bitcoin if you only hold Bitcoins, the risks in more controlled range, when we look on the long scale.The hype and recent market price appreciation ne'er decide the reliability, but History also does, of the narrative, potential does, sentiments does, adoption rate does, utility does, transparency does, decentralization does, the community does and Regulation does.In the realm of decentralization, transparency, community engagement, narrative strength, widespread adoption, regulatory compliance, and overall potential, Bitcoin stands unrivaled. It outshines any other asset class when considering these crucial aspects collectively. There's hardly a contender that can match Bitcoin's prowess in these key dimensions.",

Quote from: R100K-Martin-Lunger on November 09, 2023, 03:52:24 PM• Bitcoin is a volatile asset, and its price can fluctuate wildly in the short term. This can make it difficult to generate consistent profits by trading Bitcoin alone.The recent bitcoin price changes disagree that bitcoin is very volatile even though that’s how it is said to be. But bitcoin is the best less volatile cryptocurrency out there bar stablecoins. So since match bitcoin price has be revolving round $25k to $35k, os it doesn’t fluctuate wildly as you said, it is the attribute of Alticoins.Quote• By diversifying your portfolio with other cryptocurrencies, you can reduce your overall risk. Some altcoins may be more volatile than Bitcoin, but they may also offer the potential for higher returns.You’re not reducing any risk mostly that of losing when you accumulate alticoins, just have you have said they are very volatile so how do they reduce risk when they can fall just any time. I get they can give you huge returns on short time scale but at what risky. If you’re looking for an investment stay with bitcoin and add other investments assets Like gold, stock or invest in real estate as portfolio diversification, stay away from risky investments like Alticoins. But if you are in for get rich quick scheme then Alticoin is your bus top",

It would be useful for BTC-enthusiasts to know which altcoins you have included for diversification purposes. And also, it would be good if you tell us about the short-term profits you received on altcoins. In our area, before teaching someone, it is customary to demonstrate by personal example what you teach others.I can say this.Almost every altcoin I owned turned out to be crap. My example turned out to be negative, for the most part. Therefore, based on personal experience, I would voice the opposite recommendation - not to connect it with altcoins. So, which of the recommendations is the most correct? Yours or mine?",

I don't think so!  They can totally make bank - some altcoins go supernova.  But their swings are insane too.  And many are straight gambling versus more solid choices like Bitcoin and  so i don't think loading up on altcoins shields from volatility... probably makes it worse.  But hey, with great risk can come great reward right?

You can always use a leverage trading if you want to increase your profitability in short term instead of diversifying in altcoins that is more risky due to volatility.",

Some altcoins may be more volatile than Bitcoin, but they may also offer the potential for higher returns.Yes, it's true that most altcoins can be very volatile, but same way is such volatility likely to be either in profit or losses,  because most times, if you are unlucky to buy an altcoin, you may end up losing all your funds if it's value drastically fall to zero, and same way are you likely to make massive profit if it's value drastically skyrocket in price. Henceforth, that is why to me, I always see altcoin investment as another form of gambling, at which you should invest only an amount you can always afford to lose in an altcoin. Just as same way Bitcoin is the best alternative for investing our future funds instead of leaving in been kept in the bank who's value likely to deprecate with time.So in a nutshell, altcoin has a high volatility whereby you are likely to make huge profit or lose within a short while, unlike Bitcoin which has a slow volatile nature.",

BTC and ETH should be in your portfolio without a doubt but the others may change. Either way owning more than 5 different crypto will increase your chances of catching a shitcoin and shitcoins are the enemy of our portfolios. Imagine btc going full bull but your portfolio isn't going anywhere because the shitcoin you have is taking a nose dive. Nobody needs that crap. Safety first, gains later.If you want to gamble you can always create another side-portfolio and put your shitcoins there but never ever mix it with your main stash because these shitcoins will absolutely infect your main dudes.

      "body": "Honestly OP, after much lived experience in the crypto space (just a few days from 10 years since I first got into it!!) I can say nah you really shouldn't.In the past ten years basically every mistake I made was trading with my bitcoin, deciding to diversify with some of my bitcoin into altcoins, selling my bitcoin, not continually buying bitcoin, or messing around with altcoins.Ethereum is definitely something worth having as it basically represents all of Crypto (Crypto being different than Bitcoin). And by staking ETH you can make some income.But the altcoins in general are extremely risky and you never know when will go down or up or stay down permanently. But they all go toward zero against Bitcoin long term. Sure its nice during an altcoin season if you make a lot of gains, but those gains will never stay long term.For people who want to make short term money there is always trading. Even here I'd recommend just trading Bitcoin and Ethereum. Altcoins can offer much more gains in trading but then when the altcoin you're in plummets while Bitcoin and Ethereum keep going up and you have to either take heavy losses or wait on the trade for months while BTC and ETH keep gaining that's a sucky position to be in.So more realistic hot take:Be 100% Bitcoin, or split between majority bitcoin - minority ether. Generally stay away from alts unless your investment strategy is based on being lucky, which is never a good strategy, cuz it may give you some short term outsized wins but generally long term losses, or at least losses against what you could have made with bitcoin or btc/eth only.",

I have not seen till now how you can be free from altcoin risk. Altcoins can't even be trusted to survive, let alone not. So it can be argued that altcoins offer less risk than bitcoin. Rather, the claim that Altcoin is safe is wrong; it is a different thing that Altcoin gives a high return along with high risk.

If it's not volatile, how can you make a profit? Even some of the altcoins that are said to be stable are not that stable. Having a diversified investment is a good idea, but when it comes to crypto currency, using volatility as an excuse for multiple investment options is wrong. Besides,  you can never tell which altcoin is best for investment and which one is not, as altcoins have a greater risk when it comes to playing safe. So if I have any advice, one should have a separate wallet for bitcoin where they can stock their holdings, and if they are altcoin lovers, they should do deep research before making any move to invest in them in order not to run into these 1-3 month projects that are just there for quick profit, and at the end of the day, investors are left to suffer for their mistake. Bitcon still remains the best when you want to talk about safety, and if you must choose an altcoin, you can go for coins like Monero, which is also a privacy coin and has been here for a long time too.",
