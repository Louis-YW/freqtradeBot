We will manage and wait till all this ends since we can't force the government to take a decision, even if a court orders them to, they don't give a listening ear to it.",

I want to as what are we to do make sure we end this starvation and scarcity of money in our country.Just try and adjust to minimize the way you are using cash and always use more of transfer for your transactions. You should also adapt to this new change because I see that cashless policy has come to stay,even after the elections there might still be limited cash.I just hope things go back to normal after the elections so that life will become easy. I just pray the policy helps to get rid of vote buying so that we can all benefit from these sacrifices. This is an opportunity for Nigerians to make the right choice.",

The Naira scarcity to be precise has left many Nigerian hungry. Many families are starving, most people cant afford two square meal. The only solution i think that will help solv the present situation is by voting the right person. And also pray that our votes count. Religion and tribe should be out of the picture when casting votes. Nigerians needs a leader who pays attention to the poor masses not just on the rich men. A leader who will provide job opportunities for the youths.Nigerians can achieve all this by voting in the forthcoming election.",
