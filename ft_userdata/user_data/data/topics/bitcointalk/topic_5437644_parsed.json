  "content": "Somewhat of a lurker on this forum but I have built up (and recently rediscovered) my collection of Polymerbit notes built up over the last several years. I haven’t decided if I would part with all these yet, but I’d be interested in finding a rough value and if there would be any interest. As I’m sure there are more knowledgeable people here although I have done some research. The error notes are the 1/10 Eth ‘Bitcoin Document’ and the 2 mBTC triangle.http://<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/98607596@N07/52663098760/in/album-72177720305679540/\" title=\"D9543F1C-7020-449B-A1AA-1DEF3C46CD45\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52663098760_e481227bf1_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"D9543F1C-7020-449B-A1AA-1DEF3C46CD45\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>http://<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/98607596@N07/52663098870/in/album-72177720305679540/\" title=\"0BAE3472-0A65-411B-B16A-3E128287E053\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52663098870_352d96f634_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"0BAE3472-0A65-411B-B16A-3E128287E053\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>http://<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/98607596@N07/52663155218/in/album-72177720305679540/\" title=\"6C5E8213-E132-4535-83F8-049A46351B5D\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52663155218_d1e7b5a40b_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"6C5E8213-E132-4535-83F8-049A46351B5D\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>http://<a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/98607596@N07/52662661386/in/album-72177720305679540/\" title=\"2B924458-C588-45FF-8A3D-D86732FC4687\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52662661386_281af76522_z.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" alt=\"2B924458-C588-45FF-8A3D-D86732FC4687\"></a><script async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>",

      "body": "From the Polymerbit notes collection I built up in the last years you'll find retail-prices (= upper limit) for some of them here: https://www.coinsofnakamoto.com/collectibles/notes/Some notes are worth just 10 bucks (like the garlic & via notes), most notes are between 20-30 bucks (like the LTC, ETH, 1776, bees, triangle, 1/10th, 1/20th, Test & Custom).The Monero note was sold recently here on the board and from what I see just a few could be worth more, like the blue 0.1 BTC note... see link above!I bought most of my Polymerbits in bundles, averaging at about $25 per note of the notes I see in your pics.I can't tell you prices for the notes I'd be interested in (red 1 BTC, violet 20, orange 100, brown 200, blue 10 MBTC... sry for the abbreviations used) but I wouldn't pay more than the $25 per note already stated, maybe $50 for the red 1 BTC. But that's just because I like it and I don't have it yet.Edit.Of course: price estimates are for unfunded notes.",
