  "content": "Cryptocurrency token with seed sales, private sales, public sales usually have vesting time and unlock schedule.Each round of token unlock after a vesting time, a new supply of token will be available and circulated on the market. These newly unlocked tokens can cause a new sell pressure on market.If you invest in such tokens which have unlock schedules, you must know when each unlock round happens and have plans to avoid price dumps on market.Two websites I know of and want to share:- Vestlab: https://vestlab.io/- Token unlocks: https://token.unlocks.app/- Team finance: https://www.team.finance/- Messari.io: https://messari.io/- Coinmarketcap: https://coinmarketcap.com/token-unlocks/- Cryptorank.io: https://cryptorank.io/token-unlock- DefiLlama: https://defillama.com/unlocks- Dropstab.com: https://dropstab.com/insights/vesting- Tokentrack.co: https://tokentrack.co/",

Because you need to upload or listed your project for the information, meanwhile to get the fastest resource you can just ask to their group.Or most the time, the project have \"Tokenometrics\" information for each schedule token unlock.",

      "body": "Quote from: ryzaadit on December 15, 2022, 05:50:07 PMWhy not just ask official resource?Sometimes projects will delete their tokenomics months or years after they successfully raised funds and token price was dumped because of bad tokenomics or sell pressure from GameFi, NFT, Metaverse gamers.If you are a follower of one project since its beginning or before its token fall, you can know about its tokenomics. If you are late comer, you might not know about it and might not find it on their website.QuoteOne of the less advantage about these site, not every project is being listed on there. Because you need to upload or listed your project for the information, meanwhile to get the fastest resource you can just ask to their group.It is like Coinmarketcap or Coingecko, takes time to be listed there.I know those Token Unlock Schedule websites are smaller than Coinmarketcap and Coingecko, their information need to be double checked. It's certainly that third party websites should be used carefully and with cross checking.",

      "body": "Useful site for people who gamble on newly launched tokens. Maybe useful as well for people who didn't have a chance to buy during seed rounds and just waiting to scoop up some at a discount when developers starts dumping causing panic to some retail investors.Probably a good source also for people waiting to review the project after all tokens are unlocked.",

In addition, the discussion there has also been going quite well. You can see the topic I mean here. I mean, before you create a topic, make sure the topic you want to create has never existed before by typing keywords for the topic you want to create in the search box.",
