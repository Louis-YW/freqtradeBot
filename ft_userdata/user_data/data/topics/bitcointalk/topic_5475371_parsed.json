      "body": "Where do you live? Of course buying it won't have significant gains on you and that's why it's not yet taxed. But when the time comes and you're about to sell, there's the gain that you have to declare.I'm also confused on this. But what if you have sold and you're in losses? Are you still going to provide some tax on it based on how much you've bought it since you're at loss? Much better to consult an accountant on your area.",
