  "content": "Hello.I tried to import the priv key of a bech32 address into a newly created wallet in Electrum, however, the address imported starts not by \"bc1\" but by the old \"1\" address type.This Electrum wallet is offline and has no internet connectivity. How can I make the bech32 address type to show up in Electrum instead of the old p2sh??",

It is planned, but not implemented yet:https://github.com/spesmilo/electrum/issues/7544QuoteSomberNight commented on Nov 17, 2021Yes, naturally we plan to add taproot support.Initially only singlesig wallets with keypath spends will be implemented.To be able to create watch-only versions of these wallets (required before we can expose it to users), some wallet-refactoring and wizard changes are needed, as we don't want to extend the current x/y/zpub scheme. Most likely some form of output script descriptors should be used.No ETA, but it is on the TODO list.",
