I wonder why 10k is not enough for you? Are we talking about dollar here right? That’s a lot of money already. Will try to look at your old post and see your strategies, that’s a good result especially on a market situation like this.",

I see you making over 100k in the future.I recommend getting a tradingview account for your next trading adventures. that way you can show everyone your predictions and on tradingview they make it impossible to delete your trading ideas, that way everyone can see that you are indeed an impressive trader who knows what they're doing.Best of luck to you!",

I guess the mentality of not being limited to that 10k made it a lot comfortable to work with it maybe? Like compared to a person who only has $1k to invest, pretty sure they'd have much more stress involved or would probably take longer to actually reach the same amount of profit since he'd probably do this with a lot less risks involved.",

Meanwhile, the last time you shared your position was last August 26. You're not trading daily? Where else do you post your entry and exit calls? In TG? I'm already inactive in trading for like a couple of months because I always end up losing all my profits and sometimes some part of my capital after days, weeks, and months of hard work.   But if you're sharing your analysis for free I may try to copy trade. And of course, if there are profits then I'm also willing to share it.",
