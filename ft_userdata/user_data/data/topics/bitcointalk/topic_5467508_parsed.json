I only make posts on topics that I like, I also don't like making long-winded replies or using AI tools to make posts, my average reply is only 500 words, sometime when you see posts that are too high quality, you have to be suspicious, what is that based on the member's thoughts or derived from AI tools.",

They try to hide their fishing works with long posts and try to confuse campaign managers with their long posts.If I manage a campaign with 20 participants for each, have 5 campaigns, reading all of those posts if they are all long, is painful. So I will likely accept long posts as quality posts and those post fishers will get payments with no issue from post counting.QuoteNo offense to the users who like it vanilla and doesn't prefer using bold or italics in their posts however it just gives a better clarity to what as an OP, you want the user to focus on.

Most users believe that quality means writing a long post but it is totally worthless and also a wastage of time. Long post writes only when you have a good topic and a large number of information and numerics so in that term you should arrange them in an order.

It's easier to read and people will absorb the meaning more quickly. However, there are several things that sometimes need to be explained to strengthen arguments, such as examples, definitions, terms, and so on.So the length and shortness of a comment/post depends on the argument being built, we definitely know if the post is extended or not",
