  "content": "This we really be of  help to the nation and  to everyone, How about introducing bitcoin as an IT course which you can find him some institution icicles or bitcoin I have been it’s own institution, After the duration of the learning, the course is certificates will be issued to the students by BITCOIN.We have a lot of online courses online program which people participate an an IT course. If bitcoin we have such program going on online that is certificate will be issued to the students I as a  graduates it’s would be a great one.I have been to several online courses like the IBM, which is the CasseraExample here is the link of the Coursera website which offers courses to students across the world, https://www.coursera.org/So guys, what do you think it is certificate program has been introduced. It may not be easy to understand.But with time everyone may get use to it.Would it be great if a certificate programs is introduced on behalf of bitcoin.",

There are also some learning which someone can go for like the one offered by Micheal Saylor. But know that bitcoin is not an institution or organization. But to invest in bitcoin does not need any professional study, anyone that learn price history about bitcoin can analyse and speculate what could be the further price of bitcoin.",

And in most countries certificate are so important that it is sometimes recognized more than skills. But I think practice knowledge is more important than certificate, therefore I don't think a Bitcoin certificate would be of great importance. Bitcoin knowledge can be acquired through personal studies very cheaply. But I am not insinuating that some courses offered on Bitcoin in some institutions is not important. They can also be very useful.Another question would be who would issue the so-called Bitcoin certificate? Institutions that offer courses on Bitcoin and blockchain technology can give certificate that is backed or signed by these institutions. There might never be a Bitcoin certificate because most important actors in the Bitcoin space are anonymous.",

At this point, I think the ops must be confused about some facts that have led to such an exaggerated statement. We are fine with just Bitcoin being the best alternative to fiat and also as an edge against inflation but to say Bitcoin should become a course of study will take some time to achieve even though, there are already some online Bitcoin courses but this is still limited and not in government-approved institutions.",

Not saying that I'm against it, but this could be the next trend specially that blockchain technology is also making it's way to several sectors and industries not just in IT.",

It doesn't always reflect how good someone's knowledge about Bitcoin is. It also cannot guarantee that he has good skills in trading, investment, or mining. And we cannot use the certificate to apply for both online jobs or RL jobs. So, the certificate looks to be useless. If you want to be a good trader, investor, or miner, you need a lot of experience besides learning from any sources. That's the only thing to do, it has nothing to do with the certificate.",

(I know alls know that, but to give continuity to my idea).So, this is how our society works, they look at what university you come from, where you did your postgraduate, doctorate, etc. and they hire you, they trust a lot in the paper, its seal and if it is endorsed by an institution that is approved or registered for such purposes.And in that sense, companies like IBM, Microsoft, Citco, among others that I know, give certificates, and they do not need the government to certify them to have an approval from an employer, but when you are advancing academically and you need to register, for example in a certain career to not take a certain subject that you master, so you save time, a certificate of this type is not useful to you, the reason!, the company may be well recognized but it does not have a government seal or is not registered with the government to issue certificates officers.And if you go abroad (e.g. emigrate), they do not apostill documents that are not certified by government-registered institutions.The point of all this is that there is no \"official\" (Governms) institution in the world that officially certifies knowledge in bitcoin, in fact I do not remember or I do not know if El Salvador with those courses that were mentioned in this same board are endorsed by the government Salvadoran.In any case, the point is, what  such a thing is useful to peoples, because for the legal level we are talking about, the knowledge of bitcoin is empirical and therefore does not need any body to approve it, so this type of  \"courses\" help to many people who want to start building formal academic knowledge, which is technically called an academic curriculum, and is the support of the \"curriculum vitae\"BtW, We have a thread on our board where we analyzed the job offer at the region, and was not zero (0%) aleast with the requirement \"knowledge in cryptocurrencies\" and some very specific ones in \"bitcoin\", the job offer exists .So in a world still dominated by old bureaucratic schemes surely someone with a paper that says \"Cryptocurrency/bitcoin course\" can have a chance. That is, if he could actually do it like in something that the OP mentions, then it works.Now do not confuse taking courses for work, with the idea that people to use bitcoin have to take a course, they are two different areas of focus.In any case it's just my pinion with 2 sat.",

In my humble opinion this BTC certification can only be useful for someone who wants to offer their service to a BTC related project online, most times when you want to get hired by a BTC or crypto project to do some work for them, they usually ask if you are skilled in BTC and crypto too, maybe showing them your certificate and providing other forms of previous experience may help to get the person hired, it is not required now, but this is the only benefit i can see of this certification.",
