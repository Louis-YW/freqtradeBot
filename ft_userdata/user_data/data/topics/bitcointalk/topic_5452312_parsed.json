  "content": "After the first one that @alegotardo posted HERENow they have discovered yet another big sports betting fraud scheme in Brazil, it's like the part 2Â  The repercussion in Brazil is such that CBF has already asked the Federal Police to investigate.So far there are 16 defendants involving players from the A and B series of the Brazilian championship.Including the most notable so far is the Santos player Eduardo Bauermann, who has already been removed from the team and will probably be fired.Here you can check the news in English: https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/brazil-prosecutors-charge-16-alleged-soccer-match-fixing-scheme-2023-05-10/Some even considered paralyzing the Brazilian championship, but this has already been ruled out by CBF, which is working together with FIFA to investigate more efficiently.It is absurd that this kind of scam still happens because it harms almost everyone: the bookmakers that have no way to predict this attitude and lose money, the teams, the fans, and even us honest betters who analyze to make a bet. It is a time of great expansion for bookmakers in Brazil, it is very important that all those responsible are punished so that the industry can continue to grow and prosper honestly.",

There is no way you will know, but the only thing that makes me believe that bigger leagues are safer is because they are well-paid. Higher payments get rid of bad intentions and bribery in sports.",

We can even see from their past history that they have won the World Cup, until now they have succeeded in producing many great football players, so it would be a shame if there were many players linked to cases of sports betting fraud there.It is possible that you are right in saying that they do not get enough salary or benefits so that they dare to risk their careers to participate in sports betting scams.",

It is no longer passion and enjoyment to all players, to some, money matters more. Would it be worthy betting on these games still? I'd say yes. I agree that not all players are into bribery and some are still passionate. But the bottomline is, not a single player would dictate the match outcome so hopes are still there. Even with other sports, I agree that such thing is also evident. But what is our option? To not bet? I disagree. Atleast, I do still enjoy my gambling experience inspite of the idea that results might be rigged. I somehow accepted that fixed matches are existent in sports industry just like with other sport tournaments.",

Maybe start a campaign where they bring in some Brazilian football legends to add their voice to it because it is killing the love for the sports in Brazil and may even affect how scouters see players from that region.",

It all comes down to the politicians making this possible. I would not be surprised if the latest betting fraud in Brazil filled up some politicians pockets up to the brim. If they really wanted to fight this kind of corruption, they could easily do so. They would only have to look at other countries as an example. But I doubt it will ever happen. Too many bribes in the wrong hands.Seems sad, really. Seeing as football is a national treasure for Brazil. You would think they would treat it with more honor and reverance...

I don't know how true that is, but there is some truth in it. I think it's the same in sports - no one will promote something that doesn't bring him money.
