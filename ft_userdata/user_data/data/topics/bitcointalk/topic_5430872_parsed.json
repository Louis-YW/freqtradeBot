Sometimes classic tools used for liquidity regulation appear not to be effective enough. Programmable environment, which itself crypto space technically is, can help gain an extra fine-grained and more explicit control over liquidity in the fields where classic tools may fail.The main purpose of the Mega Swapfield project is to have such control over liquidity of its tokens (Mega tokens).The project is intentionally made simple in its core. Its technical basis is designed as constant, immutable and self-adjusting at responding to any possible situation on the market.With the help of the project, market participants themselves can take part in market liquidity regulation. Though this might seem to be relevant only for small and medium markets, the project still aims to be finally adopted by the large market through the time.The project was plotted as experimental. But however, it is totally unique and still remains one and the first of its kind, and it creates the unprecedented opportunities for bringing the design of programmable market environment at another higher level.Unlike an ordinary market which liquidity is self-regulated without such a hard outside interference, Mega Swapfield, at some point, can be considered as a life hack of a very special type. But, like any other market, Mega Swapfield is a part of the global market too, and also its full potential and wide variety of possible use cases are yet to be discovered.Initially, the project is highly unbiased in terms of economic value to be associated with it onwards, because Mega tokens are just plain tokens which are initially not strictly linked to any economic value except themselves. Also to add, the whole project idea is very new to the market.That is why the economic value of the project is expected to exponentially (or at least gradually) grow during some period of time required for its assimilation by the market. The more Mega tokens are involved in the market life, the higher is their economic value.PROJECT STRUCTUREMega Swapfield consists of 3 components:Mega Swap Fund (or, for short, Swap Fund)2 tokens: Mega Merger (MMT) and Mega Splitter (MST). Or simply, Mega tokens.MMT and MST can be easily swapped with each other through Mega Swap Fund at the constant swap rate of 1 MMT : 100 MST.Tokens held on Mega Swap Fund balance can be swapped in and out of it at the constant swap rate. It also guarantees that they are swapped only at the same constant swap rate on any other market (i.e. not only through Mega Swap Fund).Initially (at the moment of smart contracts deployment), Mega Swap Fund has 1/5 of total supplies of MMT and MST on its balance. As token swap means “give an amount of one token and take a corresponding amount of another token in return”, decreasing balance of one token leads to increasing balance of another token, therefore Mega Swap Fund always has the same whole (MMT+MST) value on its balance.Mega Swapfield is a system which is both autonomous and fully controllable, and has a simple yet sophisticated mechanism of Mega tokens liquidity regulation. It provides that all Mega tokens in circulation are exceptionally interrelated in terms of their total liquidity.Its approach consists in dividing the circulating supply into several separate volumes (zones) which are proportionally different from each other in size, and individually regulating each one’s liquidity.More on Mega Swap Fund technical details can be found in smart contract verified code on polygonscan:https://polygonscan.com/address/0xfd801acbaf54bb28482baccc6c22bea20f6552ec#code",

Because our discord is not ready and available yet.Also to add, LiquiLevels was cancelled and replaced with Mega Swapfield.tbh LiquiLevels was just a trash joke...So, Mega Swapfield is our first project now.",
