  "content": "It's that time of the year again... and it's at least as good a time as any to reflect on both the good, and the bad; to think about how we can do better in the future; and also to... forgive. Regarding that last one, we've decided that for a limited time, we will be considering unbanning users previously banned for plagiarism.This is not a blanket amnesty. We take plagiarism very seriously. Not just any banned account will be unbanned, not all sanctions will be lifted, and we'll be watching the unbanned users like hawks.Here are the requirements:You must have been banned already for an extended period of time, at least 6 months.You must point to at least 1 really good, constructive post you've made.A ban on wearing a signature will be added, equal to at least 2 years minus however long you were banned.How to apply:If you already registered an account to post in Meta for a ban appeal then simply reply to this thread.If you didn't register another account send an email to this address: amnesty_2023_7ecwa@bitcointalk.orgExample info to include:Code:Username:Constructive post:We will post all of the unbanned users in this thread. Hopefully in the future we'll look back on this as proof of the value of forgiveness and second chances. (Otherwise, maybe we'll look back on this as a reason not to do it again in the future.)Enjoy the Holidays and Happy 2024 everyone!Edit: We've received 17 requests by email so far.Here are the unbanned users as of yet:kokoskaEugenarMerit.s",

Once we start making exceptions for people it just opens up a huge can of worms and then everyone else who's had a ban will come out of the woodwork and complain it's not fair to them and people who are banned in the future will use this case as an example why they should be given another chance. PM theymos or cyrus and make your case to them and maybe they will remove it. I'm not against second chances but there needs to be some consistency so it's fair to all. Hopefully signature bans could be issued in cases like this instead and people can keep their accounts, but at the moment I just wish people would stop plagiarising content so these bans aren't even needed in the first place and it's truly a sad state of affairs that they are.Quote from: theymos on February 24, 2019, 03:57:17 PMThere's been no policy change. redsn0w wasn't permanently banned due to several factors which made me think that permabanning him would be a net negative for the forum. Nobody is banned strictly because of \"the rules\"; it's always handled case-by-case, but almost always, plagiarists deserve to be permabanned.If you think that a ban should be ended, make your case in a new topic from a \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective.Quote from: Hatchy on December 12, 2023, 01:30:33 AMI'm aware that some banned users try to appeal by creating new accounts, although not all of these accounts are unbanned.Because they don't deserve with a second chance so their appeals were refused.QuoteWhat I'm wondering is if this means that banned users are still using the forum with new accounts because that seems to be the only way they can receive this message and request to have their old account unbanned.  If they have alts, they can see this thread with their alts and will try to make grave jumpers from their banned accounts.",

There are/were sufficient cases where the banned users either bump their appeals, send us PMs from time to time, talk off-forum to other members about their forum account, etc. There are several legit ways banned users could find out about this thread. However, I suggest people circumventing their ban through another account to try and come clean about everything.Quote from: tranthidung on December 12, 2023, 01:30:40 AMThis change gives people who committed plagiarism and got a permanent ban, a third chance, not a second chance.Not really. That would imply being pardoned and repeating the offense. The possibility of appealing a ban from the \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective did indeed already exist - IIRC signature bans were added in support of this back then.This thread acknowledges the possibility of an appeal and also provides a more clear guideline, all wrapped in a Holiday spirit fashion.",

Alt accounts created after ban is just to make ban appeal and continually bump the thread outside that is ban evasion, so basically those with that alts can still read this message if they are still coming online and I think this leniency is actually meant for them not for those have left here permanently Or who knows if this is even communicated to them via the email that sent them their ban message, as that’s the other media for communication between the user and the admin of the forum. But overall there is no need to worry about those that have left totally. This is for persistent people trying to get back there account and I think they might see the message but hopefully before this festive grace elapses",

There are a handful of helpful users who got caught up in that, their forum careers extinguished by a bot. They may have only plagiarized once or twice, and hey everybody makes mistakes and has moments of weakness. But I emphasize this was only a handful of the hundreds of accounts that were banned by the Plagiabot.Quote from: nutildah on May 23, 2019, 04:06:28 AMHow do you feel about the idea of statutes of limitations on plagiarism cases? I think punishing somebody for a one-off offense done years ago (talking like 3 or more years ago) is a bit too stringent and the current plagiabot running around is a bit out of hand, leading to the banning of people for a mistake committed in 2014. Maybe the query or the rule should be tightened a bit. Just my opinion.",
