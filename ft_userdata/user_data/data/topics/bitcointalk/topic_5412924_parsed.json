      "body": "Hi,You simply paste the URL of the Youtube video you want to download in to the search box and press the download button.Another way to download Youtube videos is by removing the 'ube' from the URL of the video you want to download and press enter, eg. \"https://www.youtube.com/blablabla\" becomes \"https://www.yout.com/blablabla\". It's slower but IMO it's easy to use when you want to quickly download a video.Hope this helps.",
