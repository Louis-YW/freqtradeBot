As we all know most established and new casinos come to bitcointalk to launch their ANN thread and carry out signature promotion campaigns which can be regarded as ads in a sense. If ads should be banned will their promotion in Bitcointalk also end?",

If ads should be banned will their promotion in Bitcointalk also end?I believe that ads are the right of any business so long as the country whose through its IP is being used to send the ads allows gambling. Once the country could be entitled to taxes generated by gambling, it should be able to relax its stance on gambling companies as it would be so unfair for them to disallow promotion for what they are collecting tax for. A website, app or platform should be the sole decider if they would allow or reject gambling ads, some are even doing it without any issue.As for it affecting \"bitcointalk,\" it will surely do if this is general, after all, all these sites come here to promote what they offer.",

If it was a world wide situation which seems impossible for me that would have been a different ball game but since they're only restricting it for those in Australia then it will have effect on bitcointalk whatsoever One thing I have noticed about this life is that different countries will have different opinions about something. As some government do not want gambling ads all over the sites and places their country people are visiting which is pertaining  to their country, other countries will regulate gambling ads instead in different ways. Some countries will not even regulate gambling ads at all. With what I have seen, it will not be easy to stop gambling ads on this form, this forum is banned in Russia, but Russians visit this forum most because the IP restriction can easily be bypassed and not that gambling is banned in the country.",

Only what can be effective is for a country to ban gambling directly. The gambling sites on this forum are not even providing gambling services to people in the countries that ban gambling. But as for gambling ads or gambling promotion, that is not going to work. People will always visit this forum as long as they have their VPN and Tor on their device.",

All that means is that gambling ads will only be banned in Australia and as far as I understand, that only includes TV ads, not ads places on websites and even in that case, they'll only be able to restrict local, Australian websites, not other websites. So, bitcointalk and casinos that promote on bitcointalk can feel safe in case Australia bans online gambling ads on websites.",
