  "content": "The decline of the cryptocurrency market means that a prolonged bear market is coming. It means making money in a bull market and cryptocurrencies in a bear market. Recently, AEX Global launched an innovative financial product that guarantees users principal and interest- Smart Savings. The up to 18.6% APY attracts the interest of many investors. So how do you know if it's right for you? This article gives you the answer from three perspectives.1. Up to 18.6% APYWe compare AEX Smart Savings with other competitors in two aspects: Coin types and 180-day lock-in period. The APY of AEX Smart Savings is higher than the average.Considering the DeFi Pool's declining returns in the overall market, AEX's management team has developed a new financial product that is more profitable and stable. In a detailed study, it was shown that by using coins to purchase mining rigs and generate revenue in coins, and adding specific share options to hedge price fluctuations, Smart Savings achieves greater DeFi mining revenue and smarter quantization.2. Ultra-high securityNothing is more important than security when investing in cryptocurrencies. You can assess the security based on the following aspects:Reputation: Since BTC38, the predecessor of AEX Global, was founded in 2013, the company has been securely in business for nine years and therefore enjoys a high reputation worldwide.Compliance: AEX is committed to safe investment and stable asset growth. It legitimately obtains crypto licenses and ensures compliance in terms of linking with fiat currencies to protect users' assets. Now AEX Global has obtained MSB licenses in Canada and North America.Transparency: funds raised by AEX Smart Savings will be used to purchase mining rigs from the world's largest mining rig manufacturer, Bitmain, through our professional asset management teams to mine in New York, California and Texas. At the same time, AEX Global will develop a real-time visual data display to ensure that any user income is fair and transparent.0 Risk: AEX Global takes measures such as option hedges to avoid the risk of lostÂ  revenue and extreme market conditions. It also helps Smart Savings realize the prospect of guaranteeing users' principal and interest.3. Low-threshold and high-yieldAs the DeFi Summer trend declines, it is becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary users to participate in on-chain mining and mining with rigs. And mining rigs are costly as users have to pay for the price and maintenance as well as high electronic fees.With AEX Smart Savings, users don't need to further understand how mining rigs work, they can start mining with one click. And AEX Global bears all the risks associated with maintaining and operating the mining rigs.You can see that the minimum investment in Smart Savings is beneficial to users. And the assets it mines are hot and recognised coins.Currently, several hot coins, including stablecoins, are available in Smart Savings. Since the number of coins is limited, users should hurry to participate. Considering that the product is becoming more and more popular and the hot coins are often fully subscribed within minutes, AEX Global's asset management team will soon add more mining farms to offer global users even more attractive and innovative financial products.Conclusion Aiming to solve the problems of the current market, AEX Global provides users with the easiest and safest ways of mining to increase their revenue while reducing the associated risks. With the above benefits, AEX Smart Savings is very suitable for long-term cryptocurrency holders and those who want to try mining. Users who buy BTC/DOGE via spot trading and join Smart Savings will receive a random gift worth $28.8-888!",
