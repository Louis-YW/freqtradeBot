  "content": "One of the reasons Russia gave for invading Ukraine was that they want to stop the expansion of NATO along the Russian border. But today Finland which shares about 1,340km borderline with Russia has formally joined NATO. Kremlin feels that the acceptance of Finland into NATO is against the security and national interest of Russia. And in a few months, Sweden might be the next member of NATO which will indeed be a blow to the aspiration of Russia to push NATO far from its borders. Do you think Russia made the right decision to attack Ukraine because it wants to protect its borders?https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65173043",

Keeping in mind Trump was critical of NATO and the role of the USA in it, one must wonder how convenient would be for the Kremlin if Trump got his second term.",

I wonder if Putin realizes how many loyal Trumptards are rooting for him and eating up the Kremlin \"Russia is the victim\" nonsense.Is it because Trump only says nice things about him, or because he got Trump elected in 2016?  Or is it because you're rooting against the US because you would happily accept your country losing if it meant you got to watch Biden lose.",

Russia would have sought other means to reconcile her difference with the nation's neighbor. War was a political and military blunder because Russia thought the war will be short. There are some external influences from wars that are uncontrollable. Both Russia and NATO should drop their pride and accept that they wished that this war didn't happen.

The Warsaw pact was a socialist/communist version of the NATO, so the table was served for the cold war.In the end, the Warsaw path ended up collapsing and NATO prevailed. One must wonder what would have happened if the West decided to disband NATO after the cold war, nonetheless we could argue they were visionary enough to stay together in the case of the establishment of authoritarian regimes in China and Russia, which ended up becoming a reality.Still, it is interesting to see people from USA and Europe verbally defend Russia, knowing that any Russian doing the same in their motherland would be imprisoned.",

If Ukraine had done this, they would have kept millions from fleeing, and they would have had a whole lot more people to join their military, and more people to manufacture arms to fight Russia.Oh, don't be naive. believe me, the only ones who want to leave the country so they don't end up as soldiers are the Russians. For example, just last year, about 170,000 (data from January '23, now it is certainly much more) Russian citizens immigrated to my country. It's like a smaller city, and it's mostly young and financially independent from the home country.",

Nobody wants to encroach on Russia.  They have lots of nukes.  Russia is encroaching on Ukraine.",
