Also, if the OP can check around in this board and look how each casinos launch their site. At least get a better understanding on how to properly introduce a new casino to the community. But if he will not come back that's fine. Not a loss in this community.",

Probably he is the casino owner/promoter/all-in base on the domain choice and lack of experience on marketing. Probably he is offering a mediocre crash game that he bought the script online then promoting here his unfinished casino to hoping for an early exposure.I'm not keeping my hopes up high on this but I will be happy if my assuption and his casino is a good addition to trusted casino available here in the forum.Either way welcome to the forum OP!",
