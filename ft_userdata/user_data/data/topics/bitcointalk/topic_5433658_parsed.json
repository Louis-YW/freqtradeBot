Those YouTube channels that has a huge following are mostly tricked by these scammers offering some sponsorships and they'll send a link where these content/YouTube channel owners has to fill on the phishing link that they've made.And that's how the trick goes.When they've taken full ownership of the channel and before the owner retrieves it back, they'll play an unstoppable live video of podcasts or interviews and the title is like a giveaway but we know it's a scam.",

Back then there has even been an incident where mass hackings of twitter accounts, especially those of notable celebrities and personalities were held. Afterwhich posts like the ones you mentioned surfaced from these accounts which twitter took down eventually, but not before the scammers got away with a couple hundred or thousands of bitcoins at the time. That lone should serve as an evidence that scammers use their brain but they choose their victims, because schemes like these will not really work against the informed investor. It's just like the concept and logic behind the Nigerian Prince email spam.",

Why would anyone who supposedly want to go a giveaway using cryptocurrency want someone to first pay to a certain address and only then would you get double the amount. That‚Äôs a very poor idea for a scam and the scammers didn‚Äôt think much about it. Sadly, a lot of people would still fall prey to this and would send some coins to the address to get double the worth back. I think the use of Elons picture is a nice touch as it would lead ignorant folks to believe more in the scam. I think people who would fall prey to this type of scam are either gullible or greedy or perhaps, both.",

      "body": "I'm sorry to hear that you came across one of these scams. It's important to be very careful when dealing with cryptocurrency, as there are many scams and fraudulent schemes that target inexperienced users. One of the most common types of scams is the \"giveaway\" scam, in which a scammer claims to be giving away a large amount of cryptocurrency for free, and asks users to send a small amount of cryptocurrency to a specific address in order to receive their \"reward\".However, these scams are simply a way for the scammer to collect cryptocurrency from unsuspecting victims, and there is no actual reward.It's always a good idea to be cautious when dealing with cryptocurrency and to do your own research before sending any funds. If something seems too good to be true, it probably is. There are many resources available online that can help you stay safe and avoid scams, so it's a good idea to educate yourself as much as possible.But I really don't understand how YouTube can allow such misleading advertising on the platform.",

It's Kinda reviews from other so-called clients that got paid. When I took a close look, I realized that those reviews were smoothly done by copying &pasting -- nothing new was said -- it was simply some mere repetitions. I had to ask a question on how we were supposed to mine them BTCs when we send some amount of real BTCs to the provided wallet address: they were so dumb to the point of saying just the same things they said earlier and none was close as an answer to my question... There and then, I realized it was a big SCAM. This happened 5 years ago though...hehePLEASE, don't dare give a trail to anything related to that, it's a major SCAMSandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",

I watched the address for a while out of curiosity if people are dumb enough to send them money but they didn't. It's a shame that people get caught by this low level scam. It's like messaging those fake youtube accounts on telegram that comment everywhere asking people to contact them because they have a private investment opportunity.

      "body": "The problem is that scammers use verified accounts from Twitter, so they have the seal. Twitter users see the name Elon Musk with a seal on its side, leading them to imagine it's a legit giveaway. After all, that is the purpose of the verified accounts, right? I don't think it's all exclusivity of people's stupidity, but also a clear signal of Twitter system's flaws.There is a black market of verified Twitter accounts which feed this kind of scam attempt and unfortunatelly the platform doesn't protect users from it. People are by themselves and must always question if the offers they are seeing around aren't too good to be true, before blindly going for them.",
