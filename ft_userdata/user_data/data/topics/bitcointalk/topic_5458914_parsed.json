You might find an Electrum server that will finally answer your requests within a reasonable amount of time.Some public Electrum servers even punish huge requests with throttling.Shutting down your non-responsive wallet might have causes corruption which further delays or confuses your Electrum. Consider to be more patient. By restauring your wallet from the mnemonic recovery words you should always be able to recreate your wallet fresh. With a fast and responsive Electrum server an address history of 3000+ entries shouldn't be a big deal.For better privacy I recommend running your own Electrum server and in particular Fulcrum which has a considerably better performance than most smaller Electrum server implementations even on such weak devices as a Raspi.",

I am sure that this problem is related to the synchronization so I guess you can keep waiting until the wallet syncs completely even if it takes a few hours and consolidate all the inputs into one or a few.Did you try to restore the address on other wallets apart from electrum? As others mentioned you can go for bitcoin core but since you are talking about doing it on laptops then I suggest you to go with Running the node pruned so your wallet significantly reduces the storage space required to store the blockchain compared to a full node wallet.",
