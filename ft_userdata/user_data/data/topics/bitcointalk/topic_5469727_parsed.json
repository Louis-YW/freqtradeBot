If little amount of money is used, trading emotion can be overcome. You need to also mention the strategies of using low amount to trade and ways of having low risk trading experience. You did not mention anything like not to leverage. There is nothing like averaging mentioned.",

If I am not wrong every successful investor makes multiple income sources apart from trading which gives them the freedom of trading by making better decisions in tough situations.In case if you are facing more loss while doing trading then just accept that you are not yet equipped for trading.",

To navigate these dangers, traders must educate themselves, practice sound risk management, and exercise discipline in their trading activities.If a person is going to start any work anywhere, he must have some knowledge about it, this is not specific to trading, it should be in every field of life we want to work in. While in trading, a person should be more serious as compared to other fields because the risks in trading double at a time. Fear of loss increases in trading as compared to other fields. Also, if someone didn't keep back up support for his trading, he must have been suffering from all these pains.If a person makes himself ready for losses, over-trading, for decision-making, chances are higher for getting a profit instead of going into loss. If a person is financially strong enough to invest and has the ability, if he might lose some, it doesn't matter for him because he has strong backup support for it. This might be a plus point for the traders who are strong in the financial aspect, they would be better traders at a time.",

Volatility will not be a disadvantage if you will trade in long term and not through short term using futures trading that will incur you an instant loss by hitting your liquidation margin. Many traders in crypto keeps using the futures trading feature despite the known facts how volatile the market.It’s true that there’s a huge profit margin once positioned correctly but crypto markets often have price swing that commonly hits both side(low and highs) that can trigger your liquidation price once near to the current price. Holding crypto specifically Bitcoin in long term will remove this volatility risk since Bitcoin price moves in consistent upward movement since the beginning.",

The bad part is that personalities of some kinds are not able to admit their weaknesses, so your piece of advice can be in vain.I'd say that, in general, a good way to learn is by yourself: you can read about trading and it can be useful, but until you don't see what is it for yourself you'll lack real knowledge on what that practice implies. The best approach, for me, would be to test with very little money for a while, while you read about it or take classes, and most importantly, try to comprehend the reality underneath the TA, FA and whatever pseudoscientific analysis: that trading is, for the majority of users who don't have (illegal) inner knowledge, it is no more than a other way of gambling.",

You may want to come up with solutions to all of the problems mentioned above. As you just wrote in the last paragraph, we should educate ourselves in the following domains to overcome those problems:While you can also write down solutions or ways to adopt to solve those problems and not face losing,As that would be more helpful to read for us and for newbies too. I consider myself a newbie too, but not to the newbies of this forum (who really are newbies in real life too), because not every person is totally a noob while having the title of the newbie.Besides this, your post content is really refreshing and a good reminder for all traders.",

And obviously, when they make a profit it is also big one. But as I was saying they could also make mistakes even after all of that expereince. I have seen many Youtubers doing live trading and they have some experience too but in the end, they make some simple mistakes and end up losing the profit and the capital both. Quote from: goxcraft on October 09, 2023, 06:26:31 PMA friend of mine is a trader. Sometimes he would share his thoughts with me. From his perspective, he thinks long-term trading is the best. Although it can be time-consuming, it is less risky than short term trading. Currently, he is holding a lot of BTC, hoping to profit big after the halving. Let's see if he is right or wrong.Sentiments of the whole market changed due to the halving event. As you may be aware, the number of BTC holders is increasing this time and making new records. Do you really think those who are holding right instead of making trades will still hold their funds after the bull run? No. They will not hold anymore, their sentiment about the market will change, and they will start to make trades again.It all depends on the market situation, and the traders and holders, collectively called investors, will become one of them at a time and will try to adapt to the changes in the market to make more profit. And right now the time is to become a holder to earn some good money out of the halving period.",

It's about time you guys stopped seeing trading as an adventure. It should be seen as a profession or at its worse definition; a business. When we do this, our mindset towards trading will definitely change. Those who go through college or any form of tertiary institution will do all they can to obtain a certificate by attending classes and doing course work but will be quick to skip learning process to acquire a set skill that will guarantee them food on the table when it comes to trading. Why spend all that years struggling to acquire just a paper but can't burn the midnight candles to master the art of trading. That's the rhetorical question anyone who's serious about trading should adjust to.I read all that you listed and I want to affirm that trading is a serious business, not just a haphazardly done stuff. But of course, there's nothing in life that doesn't come with risk. So, why should we expect trading to be an exception?",

But some people simply can't fight because of the risk of destroying their mentality. Those who are serious will keep trying, because they learn from mistakes and don't give up.",
