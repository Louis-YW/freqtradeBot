Aside that many countries now operate on cashless policy and this advanced citizens still find a way to adapt so if eventually Bitcoin get full adoption this same citizens will adapt. Just like they are getting scammed through fiat and majority learn to be more careful with their fund the same will apply when Bitcoin finally get adopted",

What are your phrenic conceptions?Adoption does not imply that everyone will have it, use it, or invest in it. Adoption allows more people to have an alternative way of saving money. We humans only do and participate in things that will not stress us out while also making us a lot of money. If the elderly are unable to use it, they can continue to save with fiat local banks or even gold.",

      "body": "There's plenty of the older generation using Bitcoin. I know, the stereotypes, and as with most stereotypes there's a element of truth to that. I know the transition will be difficult, but that's what humans do. We're actually extremely good at adapting, even though consciously, we don't like change. Call it evolution if you want, eventually if Bitcoin is successful in mainstream adoption, most people will have an incentive to learn, and therefore will learn. Alright, as Charles-Tim says; it's not actually for everyone. Think of people who aren't very good at security, I personally don't recommend those people to be responsible for their own wealth. In fact, that's why I say that banks will, and probably should always exist. So, while it's already a security concern to allow a third party be in charge of your money, it can help certain people who have no concept of security whatsoever. Honestly, that's a quite large portion of the population too.",

I don’t know how exactly this will be implemented, but I think that storing btc and sending it will become easier and more accessible. In principle, this is no longer difficult to perform using smartphones and qr-codes.The difficulty of using btc arises not only in the elderly, but also in people at the very dawn of their lives. A lot of people in the world don't know how to use a PC, not to mention owning bitcoin, creating wallets and so on. But this line is gradually blurred thanks to smartphones.Probably, in the future it will be so that not everyone will have btc.",

I mean, even exchanges have been known to scam users. Even the big ones. So, there's a potential to lose Bitcoin at any point, and then there's the issue of losing your seeds, and private keys. Which, by the way due to certain conditions, the older you get the more susceptible you are to it. There' also issues like getting physically hurt, and sustaining brain damage. Like, there's a ton of things that can go wrong in your life, which ultimately means you lose your Bitcoin. The benefit of banks is that this can usually be verified, and recovered since it's tied to your identity. Bitcoin isn't, so you statement isn't exactly correct, even though I do get your point. If Bitcoin were to become mainstream though, trading with Bitcoin for goods would likely have to happen for those that use it.",

I am from India and money transfer does not take a lot of days but seconds as we have UPI. I did try my level best to teach her how to transfer money, which she was unable to do. The reason behind it was that she had to go to a lot of screens(only 3) and enter a password. Before Bitcoin or any other internet money was invented it was simple for them as they just needed cash to do any transaction. At the moment it is so difficult to understand for older people in my country that you can pay pennies using a mobile phone. it is really hard for them to understand a simple digital transaction why force them to use Bitcoin? Let them be as they were when life was simple and without any obligation.",

They make a simple app to use that bridges the bloated user interfaces of the current many online-based services.

If you stop being cautious, you can get malware or fall for phishing and lose your coins.
