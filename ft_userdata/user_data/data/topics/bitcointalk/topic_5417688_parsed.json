I read a comment on Reddit about a guy that lost his keys to hackers through a keyboard hack, is it in form of Trojan or Malware?.Its possible for hackers to monitor your computer activity through some malware and even possibly get access to your private keys. And even if they fail to gain access to your private keys they might still be able to change your wallet address (this is for users that do copy and paste wallet address). Some trojan/malware could be able to change the wallet address to the hackers address and if you proceed with the transaction without noticing the change of address that could lead to you losing your funds. This is a thread created by @loycev explaining how to lose you funds by copying and pasting  How to lose your Bitcoins with CTRL-C CTRL-VHere's also another case of clipboard malware Warning! Be careful when you copy and paste bitcoin address from Electrum wallet",

What he meant was if it were possible that privkeys were lost to some phishing site, just for either saving an auto display passphrase or however... In their external keyboards?!Though, I learnt that there are a lot of softwares that could be injected....but still, this will need the hacker close by. Hacking is not that an easy process though, but let's be careful out there; when it comes to the software part of navigation.Sandra ðŸ’‡",

I read a comment on Reddit about a guy that lost his keys to hackers through a keyboard hack, is it in form of Trojan or Malware?.There are many ways in which your private key may be compromised and intercepted by hackers, but if we are talking about keyboards specifically, then the most common ways to achieve that is either through different keyloggers or clipboard malware. Keylogger may register all the keys that you press on your input device and send to a hacker specific sequences of keystrokes that look like a random private key. It can also be used to steal other personal information, such as passwords to your bank account, email, or an account on an exchange. Clipboard malware may steal the information that you put into the clipboard by pressing Ctrl+C. It either filters and sends your private key directly to a hacker, or it can replace inserted information with anything the hacker wants. For example, it can detect that you copied a bitcoin address to send coins to, and this malware just replaces this address with the hacker's one.",

As the saying goes, \"live and learn.\" Being paranoid, I learned a lot about the possibility of hacking wireless devices, and as you can see from the articles, everything can happen even without the fault of users. An attacker can be in the zone of our Bluetooth device in order to carry out one of several attacks. Therefore, despite some convenience of using wireless devices, it is still recommended to work with a wired keyboard and mouse, which I changed at the speed of light.",

I read a comment on Reddit about a guy that lost his keys to hackers through a keyboard hack, is it in form of Trojan or Malware?.Just stay away from malware. One of the best way you can stay away from malware is by not using your device to access what could give your device malware. Examples are clicking on ads and unauthorized emails which can lead to a means malware can be installed on your device. People are just accessing online as they like without avoiding ads. Also other ways are the files you transfer from another device to your device which can contain malware.There are different types of malware, a Trojan or Rootkit are malware that can be able to steal information from your device. Malware can be used by hackers to monitor the activities on your device, the apps you click on and all what you are doing on your device can be revealed through malware. If you store your seed phrase or private key on your device, or you are using an online wallet, this type of malware can be used to compromise your computer and reveal the seed phrase or private key. It can also be used to know your login details through the password saver or manager on your browser.Malware like a well designed Trojan horse is capable of revealing your 2FA. You device can be monitored. Keyloggers can be used to know what you typed from your keyboard (but not able to know the ones you input through virtual keyboard which is the reason some wallet has it)I will advice you to know how to prevent yourself from these malware which is simple and most important.",

Until they are caught in the act by AV software, they can carry out their malicious activities without being detected. All it takes is one bad software or email attachment to infect your computer with malware that could cause serious damage. In order to avoid these kinds of situations and make your Bitcoins or other cryptocurrency even more secure than it is now, first you should use a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is similar to a software wallet, but unlike it, hardware wallets cannot be easily hacked (as of yet) and they are also immune to keylogging software. In a nutshell, hardware wallets are one of the most secure ways of storing your Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies for many reasons. The main reasons for that are that a hardware wallet can not be hacked remotely and, like I have said before, it is immune to all keylogging software and other malicious scripts. Of course, you may bring your hardware wallet with you wherever you want and you will always have instant access to your Bitcoins and other altcoins stored in it.",
