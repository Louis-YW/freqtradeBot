The \"Gold Bless Bitcoin\" movie has been uploaded and you can watch it here for free:Watch Now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4xuRZYLpgkAs per IMDB, the summary is: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32881100/plotsummary/God Bless Bitcoin asks the timely question: How do we fix our broken money? Through in-depth conversations with bitcoin and interfaith religious leaders, the film exposes the broken, unjust, and immoral nature of our current fiat-based monetary system, one that is intimately connected to the military industrial complex and the propagation of war. The film also shows how and why members of the poor and middle class feel a financial squeeze even when they work hard and lead fiscally responsible lives. God Bless Bitcoin ultimately suggests the ways in which bitcoin can present alternatives to our current system that are more just, equitable, and peaceful.This covers quotes from all of our favourites, such as Michael Saylor, and many others. What was your favourite quote from the movie?",

Added literally zero to this discussion in a meaningful way. Did you even watch 5 minutes of the video or just glance the title and that's it?",

Those centralized authority in charge of the control of the financial system traditionally as it is will never want to agree to a world of equitable and just financial system that bitcoin is offering. The power they wield will ultimately be taken away from them and that's not what they want, they don't want that transparent type of fixing, because fixing it is equivalent to giving you and me that freedom that they regulate through the fiat.",
