I specifically posted this from an account that has more than 100+ bounty campaigns running, writed links to a channel where you can identify me and offered a bitcointalk guarantor.Well, if you spent a minute of your time, you would see that I have a negative trust due to the fact that some projects refused to pay out tokens to participants, and not because I deceived someone in the deal. Secondly, you can open my channel and see how many bounties I have launched and roughly calculate my income. I am ready to provide the buyer with data on earnings. I am also ready to use the bitcointalk guarantor. Your post looks like you should just post without thinking.",

That is, for you, the review of some person is already proof? You are too naive. Believing every review without checking the activity is beyond stupidity. I hope you're not affiliated with the law enforcement.Regarding the guarantee - I indicated that I was ready to provide my income for confirmation.\"because you want to get your money now\" - in my opinion, I specified that I was ready to accept parts through a guarantor.As I said earlier - Your post looks like you should just post without thinking.

Believing every review without checking the activity is beyond stupidity. I hope you're not affiliated with the law enforcement.Your trust summary suggests that you have a track record of promoting obvious scam projects without conducting any due diligence, and even continuing bounty campaigns despite being alerted of their fraudulent nature by other members. This shows that your primary concern is your own financial gain, with little regard for the well-being of others.

Unprofessional activities- If user complaint about his scam promotion, This manager decide to ban themPromoting questionable or fraudulent projects without conducting proper research is not a good feature of any serious business because it undermines the credibility and integrity of the business.
