My confusion is that alot of people in this forum have said mining sites are not good and are mostly scam sites but this site am given looks good.I don't know what makes that website looks good when they,1. Mention fixed return and daily rate on home page. Any real miner know there's no guarantee on mining world due to few factors such as unexpected coin price and difficulty change.2. Weird title on it's package (such as \"Bitcoin Mining (April Fool's Day)\").3. On \"Media About Us\" seciton it mention many popular brand such as CoinBase. But when i try to searchCode:site:coinbase.com \"happyminer\"on Google search, google return not result which indicate they are lying. So i'd say the site looks very bad and personally i wouldn't trust them.",

If someone offering you a passive income without any risk involve you should start to doubt about it. No investment can assure continuous income to their investors and most of the time those scammers use such word to make things good on their platform.Better not to invest on such thing and focus yourself on altcoin trading since this is much better than those mining investments.",

Surely someone with \"deep knowledge about cryptocurrency\" would know this is a scam as it is pretty obvious you would only need to rely on one's common sense. Just saying because scam DMs are pretty rampant where someone pretends to be doing you a favor when they're actually luring you to a lion's den.A common characteristic of ponzi scheme/scams are the extremely high profits as that would mean it's unsustainable. 3% daily is 90% monthly and 2% daily is 60% - these rates are in dream land. On their FAQ, they're advertising this as entirely risk free investment and there is no such thing, every investment has risk. And as pointed out above, if we apply this in actual mining, the more reason it doesn't make sense.",

Stay away from it at all costs.Some Redditor asked them a question about their hash power and what he discovered is pretty interestingQuote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScamBlacklist/comments/120hdqz/happyminer_is_legit_real_mining_or_fake_scam/Here's one of the answers from their support bot:\"As ASIC are the most energy-efficient miners, we use them since they dominate the market. Our hash power can reach 471700 GH/s, making us one of the leading providers. Furthermore, our mining farms are equipped with state-of-the-art supercomputers and cooling systems that are extremely efficient.\"So their entire mining operation is a measly 471.7 th/s and yet they offer physically impossible returns? (For those who are unfamiliar, the profit from mining bitcoin at 471 th/s without even subtracting any power or maintenance costs is currently about 35 bucks a day, that's something someone would have in their garage as a hobby)Ofc email support never answered to explain to me how this math works for them.You can use this calculator to see how much their hashrate which makes them the \"leading providers\" bring them per day even at zero power costs - https://minerstat.com/coin/BTC",

Maybe happyminer is in that stage where they have not scammed but I would strongly recommend staying away from cloud mining sites as 99% of the sites don't mine in real. They just collect money, and keep the cycle of payment running until one day they just close and run away with your money.",

But looking at 1-3 stars review, i found some interesting things such as,1. They forbid multiple account registered from same IP address[1]. While it's normal at first glance, they do not consider ISP could assign same public IP to multiple customer[2]. But without additional information, we don't know which one (reviewer or happyminer) is lying.2. A reviewer claim happyminer is pyramid scheme scam, but happyminer response is they have mining cart certificate[3]. Personally i find such certificate is useless and it's not valid proof they actually have miner.3. Few reviewer point out some shady action/behavior done by happyminer[4-5]. While happyminer deny those points, those review got verified status from Trustpilot[4-5].[1] https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/64755e5bfe7895bcbee377e6[2] https://superuser.com/q/1621681[3] https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/646c3b752c60455e72c0d666[4] https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/6453cfc29f1c61e0b83d59aa[5] https://www.trustpilot.com/reviews/641249810fd3fbe65416e740",

Possibly, most of the reviews about the website might be right because I have no doubt organization recruit people to go give positive feedback on their review pages so that people would see it to be realistic and genuine and that is the scenario there days.

On opening the website in my browser, I immediately discovered that it is a pure Ponzi scheme from the landing page. It is not as easy as you think for one company to be able to mine all the coins and give return appropriately. I mean you can see Bitcoin mining, you can see mining of several other coins. What is the relationship between mining bitcoin and mining altcoins in the same website? That is a ponzi scheme looking for a sheep clothing to cover their real colour.",
