But it does not make me good to say this but I did not accomplish that many of them.This is why I try to pass this down onto my nephews. If we want to accomplish something we must work very hard from a young age. There is nothing going to come early for us in this world, we must work hard and do it more then other people.",

Just like the quote that I've read before that if your dreams aren't making you scared of how big they are, they're not dreams but just mere wish.Quote from: Aisha_jay on October 11, 2023, 05:55:47 PMDreams are like the stars in the sky, shining, brightly, and full of possibilities. By setting valuable goals, you're not only turning your dreams into reality, but you're also giving yourself a clear path to follow. So, what are your dreams, and how will you turn them into reality with valuable goals?Like franchising restaurants, having my own set of companies like literally group of companies. How I'll be able to make them into reality? I don't know but I'm just doing everything that I can to achieve things little by little.Maybe someday in the future that there will be better people than me that will be the help to achieve my own dreams. They're like the connections that someone needs to pursue their businesses.",

There is a difference between dream and wishes.dream is when you have passion for something and have sleepless night over it until it's Achieved or dream are that which don't allow you to sleep according to popular saying.. But wishes is just a kind of exaggeration or what you want to be probably didn't work out.dreams can only be achieved if you work towards it, but failure to work towards it, it becomes a wish.",

You sayed big dreams are impossible but in my opinion big dreams motivate person a lot to get a good achievement. Suppose you are here and your dream to be a rich person and you are continuously doing hard work for achive your goals. End of the day you achive a place which beacose of your big goals. If you don't have big goals did you do that much hard work. That's I'm try to say that completing big goals age kind of dream but doing hard work for achieving goals and that helps you to achieve a good place in life.",

Dreams are the blueprint of your future self it depends upon your willingness to go through hardships and fulfill these dreams, the more emotions, perseverance and focus you give into this the more possibilities will be in achieving them. Never give up and stay through the path. We are just passerbys in this world make the best out of it. Hardships and trials are there to make us stronger, and make the DREAMS sweeter.
