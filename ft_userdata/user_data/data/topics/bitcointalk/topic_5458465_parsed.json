Twitter blue tick is for sale to anyone who wants it now. And that explains why new projects with as low as 2k followers now carry blue tick. As for telegram, a project or individual has to be solid before he gets the check. But it is also for sale.",

Nah. It's easy to get verified especially on Twitter when it has been taken by Elon Musk, you pay the monthly and you'll get that verified badge check. That's why I don't think that even there are some projects that do have verified badge on social platforms, that won't be a matter to me if I'll be choosing one to invest. There are even legit projects that don't have those badges and yet, they're more legit than of those that has it.If many are encouraged to invest on those projects, I don't think that's a good factor for someone who invests in projects by just having that standard.",

Twitter since Elon Musk take over have gone through a series of reform and a lot have changed getting a blue badge is now easier as long as the team can pay the fees, Â but it doesn't mean anything in terms of project guarantee or security of investors funds.

Because they can afford to pay $8 for checkmark? It doesn't matter to me at all if someone pays for it or not, i am looking at the development rather then silly optics.It seems so silly to fund that platform anymore, it actually used to work well for cryptos, now it's just pointless.I am not sure what are the requirements for verified telegram channels, but it's essential point that or something we should be focusing on.Only improtant thing in telegram is that we should always double check the real @nick anyway when we are talking to someone.",

The thing is, there's no way to believe in an altcoin project, their whitepaper is usually filled with fake/unrealistic promises and more often than not the project owners are basically launching the coin/token to make themselves money. Having said that, take altcoin investments as gambling, thus invest with just the money you can afford to gamble with.",

We know that investors would really be mainly or commonly be checking out these mediums when they do make out some DYOR before they would be investing and on the time that they do saw that those accounts are verified then it would really be creating that kind of impression that this must be legit therefore i would invest but you should not.You would really be needing other factors which needs to be checked out because as long you dont able to see or know those devs and their Roadmap and WP then you cant really make out assurance that those promises that they had been saying would really be followed.",

Because of this, Twitter's credibility has decreased drastically, where many have deviated from its original purpose, which has caused several influential people to also leave the platform since it was acquired by Elon Musk. Everyone can conclude with only the subscription badge requirement it is a big loophole of twitter being a hotbed for scammers.Since I'm seeing more and more fake altcoin verified accounts lately (they do airdrop spamming tweets on their phishing sites), I personally find Twitter to be getting annoying.",

Just look how they deliver their promises to their community and also how the updates going since maybe from that there's a chance that they can be a legit platform. But for now seek for multiple information about them rather than trusting them for just like that.",

Does that mean these projects can be trusted?In fact many are encouraged to invest in any new project following this.What is your opinion on this matter?How much is the blue tick now in Twitter? 8$ per month. That's 96$ per year only. Anybody can afford that amount.Any scammer who can have 100$ in their pockets can just buy that blue check for a year just to show to the public that they're legit, but in reality they're con artist, and just patiently waiting for some newbies that would fall into their trap.I just hope that a mere blue check mark isn't a sign that they're trusted therefore you will invest into them. It's just a blue check, nothing more, nothing less especially now that the chances of getting that blue check is higher now because you only need to pay.Having blue check = projects can be trusted. If you really want to invest into new projects, many here said some tips that will help you, but for me, I'd rather invest into old, and established coins, and tokens rather than investing into new projects.

I also know a few reliable and big companies that don't have a verified Twitter account because they don't want to support the recent changes of Twitter with those payments.In the end you always need to be willing to take a pretty big risk, if you want to invest in crypto, especially in very new projects.
