  "content": "Many people find difficulty to find Bitcoin seller, from whom they can buy Bitcoin. May be for small investor it is easy buy from friends or aquentance. When some one want to buy large amount of Bitcoin it is difficult for them to find correct seller and a correct and secure form of transaction methods which they can complete the transaction. In this regard need proper research and decide diligently from whom you want to buy Bitcoin ?  If you are buying very large amount for corporate investment then you need a Bitcoin company who sell Bitcoin in bulk. You might get a discount price. If you are buying smaller amount then you can use Bitcoin Exchange. It is also wise to buy Bitcoin Peer-to-Peer with a good transaction method. For buying Bitcoin securely need a solution  and guidance. Therefore, you can make anonymous announcement that you want to buy large amount of Bitcoin then some sellers will  owe to your contact and you can chose from whom to buy. If you are selling Bitcoin because you need cash then you can create an account with any Bitcoin exchange and transfer your Bitcoin to the exchange for selling. It risky for seller if they want to sell a large amounts of coins. So they need and intermediatory platform or Bitcoin deal making agency to conduct the transaction. For this purpose I have setup an Ofshore Bitcoin transaction platform. It is completely anonymous and secure for both party buyers and sellers. My platform is fully competent with legal transaction criteria. Therefore it protect the sellers and buyers from get scammed. Always buy or sell Bitcoin to known person is better. But in corporate level you need a solicitor to conduct the commercial transaction. Even though there is transaction fees as well as legal fees but it is secured. For further information join my thread and learn how to make secure Bitcoin transaction ?",

To find out the truth you need to do a diligent research. There after you can make your judgement. But still you could be wrong if your research is not fully completed.",

It is very same like Mt.Gox. Bitcoin was designed to make P2P transaction but for secure fiat payment for purchasing btc need a competent legal intermediatory for corporate bitcoin transaction. OTC is good way to make transaction but customers or big investors need full information and complete satisfaction for their trade. Therefore a proper intermediation is require for that transaction where the sellers  ot buyers  do not need to send their funds to an exchange like that of Mt Gox to get scammed. Therefore a better option is better than the Binance. You have no clues of the future of Binance. I am a digital Monk, and I do have complete knowledge about everything Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency. If I want to buy Bitcoin it is better for me to buy from friends or known person. If I want sell my Bitcoin, it is better for me to sell it from my own wallet to some one who want buy it, instead transferring my btc to exchanges to get scammed.",

I seriously doubt that as your claims lack credibility. You haven't shown much knowledge of the subject so far, so it's hard for me to believe what you're saying. I think your comments are misguided and don't make much sense.Quote from: DigitalMonk on August 19, 2022, 11:41:31 AMIf I want to buy Bitcoin it is better for me to buy from friends or known person.

Sending bitcoins to random people on the internet is like a game of Russian roulette, but instead of having one bullet out of six chambers, you only get one empty chamber and five bullets in your gun. You have a high probability of getting scammed.",
