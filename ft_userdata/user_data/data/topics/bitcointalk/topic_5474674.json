The fact that you have the possibility of withdrawing physical money from the bank can dismantle the ponzi scheme with bank runs. But as soon as the physical money disappears and only digits remain, they can continue to inflate the scheme as they please, as well as manipulating the use of the money with CBDCs.That is why I think that in this forum, apart from raising awareness of the use of bitcoin with privacy, we should use cash in our daily lives as much as possible.",

That is a reason deduced for countries that feel the threat of their currency that has suffered inflation and in trying to make situation less critical, there came the creation of digital phase of fiat (CBDC).

Keep this in mind next time someone says anything about bitcoin. I read it a while ago that the total money supply is enough to buy the whole world (I mean everything/every asset and everybody that exists in the world currently)  more than 10 times over. Your post confirms this information. It is out of hand so badly now they don't really know what do to anymore. If they stop printing, people will lose their jobs. If they print more, the inflation will rise even more.This is more like about being honest but then there is another problem emerges. If \"Central Bank A\" does its job honestly, then the other cunt \"Central Bank B\" will print money out of thin air to cover its ass. In the end being honest equals to being stupid in a game where everybody is a crook.It is a race to the bottom and we are not there yet. What comes after trillion? Wake me up when the US national debt becomes a quadrillion USD.",

Keep in mind that fiat money is actually central banks' IOUs.By knowing that, in my eyes all those numbers actually don't mean much: a country (or entity) abcd can make as many trillions of xyz coin as they wish as long as it doesn't affect too much the international relations (eg EU countries usually have an agreed max inflation allowed/politically discussed) or the population doesn't start riots because xyz worth today much less than yesterday, hence they actually see they are being stolen from.All the rest we see is complicated operations to hide from the common plebs that they are trying to \"create value\" out of thin air... by actually stealing that value from everybody involved in using those IOUs.And yes, I've chosen the name xyz for the currency to not fool everybody about its \"value\" or \"price\". So when one uses a country's currency, he actually (blindly or even unwillingly) must trust that country's central bank that it will not be eroding (stealing) too much of the initial (at the point of acquisition) value of the currency.Quote from: alani123 on November 19, 2023, 03:35:25 PMKeep this in mind next time someone says anything about bitcoin.

Physical money is only required by the common people like you and I. But when it comes to government, they use paper bonds and Bank guarantees. It is a simple piece of paper that guarantees the transfer of value from 1 entity to another. That's how literally it works everywhere in the world. It is not a matter of big concern because the value of your Fiat money is guaranteed by your government. So it is not required to have 100% of fiat money printed and ready to be used.",

The government does not need to print more money to make its value go up or down. They can just decide on their own and as civilians, we can't do anything but to accept it or protest against it. If we go to protest against it, The government in power might fall. They don't want to lose that power and for that they do it in a way so that they can still have the power and manipulate the civilians.My point is, if the value is gone and it is decided by the government, then not only 85% but the 100% of the money will become useless and there will be no existence. Just because those who are in power are less in numbers, they are afraid to lose their power. That's why they show all these formalities of printing money and other causes for printing money.
