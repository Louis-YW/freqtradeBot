  "content": "Hello,The question is in the title. I just want to know if I can do this since I am thinking about opening an important topic as I see it. The problem is there is some sort of group of casino promoters (more or less scammy), who throw themselves into any topic, start posting nonsense messages and merit each other on their messages. In some way, they \"cloud' the topic and prevent people from having a honest conversation between people who just want to communicate between each other.",

So, you could try getting your reasons write and be sure to do actual moderation on the thread so as to prevent spamming.Other than these, your free to create your Self-moderated on the gambling board and other boards with exceptions to those stated by Z-tight and should you wish to remove the self moderation, moving it to meta and back does the trick.",

Best to edit the new post into the previous reply.I had gone through the thread and understood that some members misinterpreted the idea of the incentive you offered, to get users support or oppose the flag.It's not still enough basis to moderate and delete such comments for me. Engaging and clearing up the confusion is a better approach imo.Having a topic to be self moderated in the first place could discourage lots of users from replying to it.",

I saw it earlier today and wrote the following post in it:QuoteBut you are forgetting about one important detail. That detail or TOS paragraph is even visible at the bottom of your screenshot. The maximum payout for any bet is capped at €100.000. How do you expect to win €200.000 if the TOS you agreed to says that the casino won't pay out more than €100.000 per bet?If you make pre-match bets on final outcome - TEAM A, Asian handicap -0.5 - TEAM A, who will win the rest of the match - TEAM A... it's all the same. You are betting on the same outcome, meaning all wagers pay out if TEAM A wins. You can't try to trick the system by earning more money from TEAM A's win by making multiple different bets that are all basically the same just different markets. Since OP didn't like what I wrote and doesn't prefer the truth, he deleted my post lol. But the thread isn't even gambling related, it's about a reputation issue and because of that it shouldn't even be posted in that sub-board.",

Seeing that your cries over not having received a payout of €200.000 didn't work in the scam accusation board, you decided to create a self-moderated thread in Gambling and delete comments that you don't agree with and which proves you wrong. Like the fact that the screenshot you posted shows the paragraph in which they explain the maximum payouts per bet.
