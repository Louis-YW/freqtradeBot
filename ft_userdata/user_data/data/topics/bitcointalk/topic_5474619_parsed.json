Have you ever noticed how it's so hard to come across positive news about the economy, whether it's in our own country or globally? It's genuinely disheartening. Every time we read, watch, or discuss something related to the economy, it's all about inflation, recession, debt, bankruptcy, companies downsizing, laying off hundreds of workers, shareholders firing CEOs, and the company's stock taking a nosedive. Can't we just catch a break and have some good economic news for once?",

Fortunately, we have an outlet like Bitcoin to protect our own finances. Governments mismanagement, wars around the world, pandemics, earthquakes, all have a bad impact on the economy. Without confidence, companies hesitate to make new investments. Unemployment and inflation rise. In such a world, it's pretty normal not to get good news.",

If it’s positive news, most people won’t want to read it. I heard it’s a psychological thing.Recently however most of bitcoin news was positive however, especially with the way the etf process is going.

For the lower middle class there are no perfect economic conditions. The crisis, the onslaught of the online market, imported goods which are increasingly being adopted by the public, have resulted in the neglect of locally produced goods which should be preserved and developed to increase the country's economic income, but are instead denied access.",

It may seem like things are going on that are bringing stress to the economy, but instead of dwelling on the negative atmosphere, choose to look at things with positive eyes. Perhaps partly due to people choosing a quiet life, I feel that even though it's sad that many people are having difficulty in the current social context, it would be better for them that we each individually pay attention. Likes to do positive things to share with those around me.I often remind my friends that the news we encounter every day is very important, it unintentionally directly affects our emotions of the day. So to easily read news anywhere, you need to be proactive first, choose new and useful things other than information about the main field that people are doing to diversify their lives.",

Because, you know, you can get killed for saying otherwise.And yes, I have seen somewhat positive prognosis. While the global outcast is that the economy will weaken in comparison with 2023, in my country, the inflation is expected to decrease, which is a relatively good thing.",

I believe economies across the globe with stable but we will need to just give it some time.",

Stock market gains, GDP growth, big companies are making more profit than ever, but that doesn't reflect on most of us, the cost of living is higher than ever before and it's hard to keep up with that with \"old salaries\". My/our wages are not rising as fast as prices are rising, and that's why we don't feel the good economic news. The inequality between the poor and the rich is increasing, just look at the number of billionaires and how their wealth is bigger every year, while the number of poor people is rising. That's not good, and I am not sure is there a way to reverse that.",

I would blame capitalism for this mess but our local politicians are no lesser than them. All these are happening due to unequal wealth distribution and lack of transparency and people's whole life has been taken as hostages for mortgage and this applies to developed nations, developing nations and third world countries as well. A radical changes has to be brought it system to bring transparency which should guarantee basic amenities for all. It's really difficult to get out of this mess almost equals to impossible hence it's better we prepare for our survival the way people did at ancient times.",

Although in my country, I've gotten used to how bad the economy is suffering that I don't usually listen in on the news since I know it's going to be a repeat of what I know or something worse, so I rather do something else with my time. Most countries are being plagued by inflation and news outlets just seem to exacerbate the situation. For me, I won't say they are the cause since they're just doing their jobs. With how the world is shaping up, it will be hard to get good news, and not just about the economy alone.",

It is only when they do bad.

You're right that we need to take a break from these negative incidents in the world but I think that if there are even good news, we don't notice them for how little they are. That's why I have noticed like a month ago when I always get to watch replays of news globally and checking on what's happening with the news and current events but just as how you are disappointed with them, it's actually what it is and they were not lovely to watch and hear. But with what I know just as how this market works, if we're at the bottom this time then by tomorrow we might be at the top and the same goes with the economic news, it may be down for the most countries but there will be a time that it shall recover.",

Some people say that the years of moving forward are not sustainable in the eyes of others. Investment in infrastructure development and job opportunities are expected by many. After the Covid-19, the developed countries have tried hard to overcome the economic recession but the developing countries are going to fall into the economic crisis due to the current global situation. I don't know if we will get any good economic news in the current situation. However, one positive aspect is that the price of Bitcoin is increasing.

If millions of people did the same, then it would have a very positive impact on everything, and even on the economy.I'm sure there are a lot of good stories globally, but as someone already mentioned, bad news sells much better, and the media are exactly the ones we can blame for favoring bad news at the expense of good news.Did you know there are websites that only promote good news?https://www.positive.news/https://reasonstobecheerful.world/",
