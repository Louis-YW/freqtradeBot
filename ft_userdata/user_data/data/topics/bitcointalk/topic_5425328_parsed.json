  "content": "I don't know if this kind of topic ever existed because I've looked for it everywhere even on the oldest page but can't find it. I know the world of the internet cannot be separated from scams, why can this happen? that's because there are still many people who don't realize that they are walking under the control of the deceiver.- after doing some searching on google, I finally concluded that there are a few types of scams that are common;➥ [1] Phishing ScamQuote\"Phising\" the word comes from the word \"Fishing\" an English word which means \"fishing\". In accordance with the meaning of the word, this mode of fraud uses methods to lure its customers via electronic mail- I'm sure almost all Gmail or email users experience this, don't ever click on random links sent to your email, ignore it➥ [2] Money Mule ScamQuoteMoney mule is a type of cybercrime using theft method in which fraudsters will transfer a certain amount of money illegally. This method occurs when the fraudster obtains the desired amount of money from the victim by asking him to open a bank account and manage transactions- I personally have never experienced anything like this, but you should be suspicious if someone has deposited a large amount of money in your account, don't be too friendly to new people.➥ [3] Sniffing ScamQuote\"Sniffing is a mode in which criminals usually target the victims' devices,\" The targeted devices include laptops, computers, or smartphones or smartphones. \"Usually they get the information on the device via a free Wifi network,\"- always make sure the internet network you use is safe, and always activate anti-viruses that can detect networks if you use public wifi.➥ [4] Pharming ScamQuotePharming is the activity of redirecting users to fake web pages, even when someone types the correct website address into their browser application. This condition can be done if the pharmers get access to the stored internet address information. In their implementation, pharmers use a DNS cache poisoning strategy to collect data in a DNS cache database. For information, DNS cache poisoning is a technique to enter or poison the cache on a DNS server with incorrect information.- this is one of the fraud tricks that are often done by cybercriminals, keep marking the sites you visit frequently.➥ [5] Pig Butchering ScamQuoteThe term \"pig butchering\" actually comes from the custom of breeders fattening their pigs before slaughter. In these cases, scammers \"fatten\" their victims with sweet promises of investment before taking their money. These scammers usually use fake identities and build personas as people with glamorous lives and many attractive photos.- many scammers in crypto use this trick, people who use this trick should burn in hell, like the CEO Luna and the CEO of FTX sammmmm dammmnn➥ [6] Social Engineering ScamQuoteSocial engineering scams use psychological manipulation to get people to take action. Unlike hacking, when criminals attack weak parts of computer systems, social engineering scammers prey on human weaknesses for their criminal activity. In most cases, social engineering scams aim to trick people into providing personal info, downloading an attachment, or clicking a link. Their goal is to defraud or somehow harm the victim, in most cases financially.- Why is being anonymous or pseudonymous important? so people don't hurt you.➥ [7] Spoofing ScamQuoteSpoofing is a fraudulent act carried out online through various internet and communication channels, such as email, website, SMS, even IP addresses. Spoofers usually impersonate well-known people or organizations to trick you.- do not trust 100% with someone who offers to help you, still research first.Lastly, are words of wisdom from an inmate in my country!Quote\"Crime happens not only because there is the intention of the perpetrator, but also because there is an opportunity. BEWARE! BEWARE!!\"a nice word from @mk4Quote — be smart, don't be careless, and be skeptical at all times.stay safe everyone",

      "body": "Thank you for serving me a reminder of what the cyberspace criminals use to lure their victims and ultimately scam them, the best way to avoid scammers is never to be greedy, and don't trust people you don't know, and remain anonymous as much as possible. One thing I like about cryptocurrency is that it thought us about privacy and some of the coins like the Bitcoin network promote privacy which is why one can hold millions of dollars in Bitcoin without any third-party knowledge about the funds. And if criminals do not have any information to work with, there can't find a way to scam you, both offline or online. So we are encouraged to stay as anonymous as possible and never trust any stranger or offers in PMS or boxes.",

If there is one thing I learned from scam busting for years, it is that there is nothing that is free in this space. They may claim that they have free services of BTCs on their disposal but on the other hand, you are required to provide your personal details + private keys that would definitely equate to you being scammed on their end.At the end of the day, always be doubtful about the things that you see claiming to give free BTCs. Prevention is always better than cure and never risk your personal safety with what scammers are claiming to give you.",
