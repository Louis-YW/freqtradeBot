The exchange rate history is available at two archived pages: first, second. Their last known exchange rate is $0.005472/BTC on 2010-03-02.On 2010-04-25 the market price is established again at $0.003/BTC, using the daily volume-weighted trading price of the second Bitcoin exchange, BitcoinMarket.com (PayPal USD trades).
