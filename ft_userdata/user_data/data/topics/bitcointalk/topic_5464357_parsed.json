  "content": "Picture a coin with an actual digital layer to it, almoat like a Google watch sort of device or something as the obverse. As a bonus this coin can tell time and have a time locking mechanism to unlock the funds to any finder once a certain date is reached. But it's made of pure silver or gold like an old pocket watch apart from the electric components and has the ability to produce a hologram of the public key. This can be achieved maybe with a black background and color image and an additional plastic component to create the hologram. This would also be a new take on the hologram, instead of the little shiny sticker it would be an actual projection, how sick would that be?! Just having some fun ideas here and wanted to concsptualize it, don't mind me lol",
