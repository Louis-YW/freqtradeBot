Some people may have slightly lower percentage or higher percentage, but they must follow the rules and strategies they have on money management. If gambling more than that, it is becoming addiction. If you have a relationship, like girlfriend or wife, gambling can affect if you are not able to meet your financial needs but spending most on gambling.",

It is even worse when the gambler is not living up to his responsibilities as it becomes convenient for the partner to blame his woes on gambling. As a matter of fact, I have seen females saying they cannot be in a relationship with an active gambler who have refused to stop because they see gambling as a sign of irresponsibility.  Well, I do not completely agree with this but the attitude of a lot of gamblers actually add credence to this claim.I have always advised that gamblers should imbibe healthy habits that will not make gambling interfere with their responsibilities. Developing a plan that covers the risk, style of play and targets will go a long way in addressing some of the bad gambling habits that send wrong signals about gambling to people.",

I’ve even seen this first hand with one of my personal friends growing up. It’s a weird problem to have a family member constantly losing their money gambling, but it’s a common one. Some people just shouldn’t gamble.",

I believe your title should have “gambling addiction” and not just “gambling” in it. Gambling in general does not affect any relationship the only time gambling becomes a problem is when the bettor fails to control their activities and eventually starts practicing gambling habits that are not healthy for example, accumulating debts to gamble, not managing their bankroll properly, chasing losses, and eventually getting addicted to gambling… those are some of the things that could lead to an unhappy relationship but if the person is disciplined and able to keep good practice then it won’t have any effect on them or their relationship.So I don’t think it’s safe to generalize it, like I stated earlier.",

This communication breakdown can prevent couples, friends, and associates from working together.Anything that you do can affect your relationship. Even small things that are not your fault and that you have absolutely no control over. I think that if you are a gambler and an addicted one at that, then your spouse should try and help you heal from your addiction. However if all their attempts prove to be fruitless in the end, then obviously at that point I would not be the one to blame them of leaving the relationship. There is only so much another person can do.As long as one does not drag down the other or hurt the other, that is a healthy relationship and it does not matter how anyone else views that spouses gambling behaviors. It only becomes a problem if it is a problem to the spouse.But gambling addiction, just like alcohol addiction, does usually become a problem.",

Why did I say that? Because if you are gambling too much, you will definitely become addicted to it, and it will be uncontrollable in the long run. So you can see that by doing this, you will start experiencing financial problems. When you have used all you have to gamble and you don’t have money to gamble again, you will surely start meeting these people and start taking out loans to gamble, and there's no possibility of getting the money back. For your wife, what will make you lose your relationship is that you won't be able to meet her needs again, and she will feel she can’t cope with you again and choose to leave.",

The key in a relationship, especially a household relationship, is communication and openness so that the relationship can be maintained and remain harmonious. And we need to know that casino owners never force someone to visit there and online gambling agents never force you to play on certain gambling platforms. They only invite and suggest, not force and the rest is up to us personally.So it is the person's bad behavior that is the cause of a relationship breaking down, not gambling. Because there are also gamblers whose relationships are safe and remain harmonious even though they gamble frequently.",

If you would be caught up with your emotions while gambling we can expect nothing less for being frustrated, irritated, and stressed. There are even instances wherein a family is breaking alart due to the problems created from being to fed up with gambling, in particular with debt and overall cashflow in a household. What makes gambling a bad thing is simply addiction. It just so happened that everyone is prone to it ‘coz we simply have our own feelings with the gambling or betting outcome; you win, you’d want more and if you lose, you’d want to take get back with your losses while being unconscious that it is becoming bigger.Gambling is a fun activity because it could teach you how to manage risks in life, better. you’d be able to realize that not all things can be succeeded by hardwork. Lastly, you’d be aware that there are things we cannot always get such as jackpots.",

I used to often lie to my wife about my habit of gambling on weekends, but as far as my gambling was still within normal limits because I only gambled on weekends, the rest on weekdays I worked and spent time with family but on weekends sometimes I spend a few hours gambling on sports betting or casinos.But it messed me up hiding it was a mistake, so I was honest with my wife and in the end she was the only person who knew I often gambled but with a certain budget limit so she also limited my budget for gambling so it didn't exceed the limit and indeed I used The mindset of gambling is just to have fun, not for anything serious and chasing jackpots or big money from gambling, it's just a bonus to the fun that I want from gambling. it all comes back to mindset and the wrong mindset is those who gamble to make gambling a source of income. My advice is to be honest with our partners because they can protect us from things that go beyond the limits.",

Sticking to your plans can be very hard at times but it's possible if you avoid becoming addicted.I believe that if you can maintain control gambling can be a form of entertainment especially if you're interested in sports betting.

Addicted gamblers cause problem in every aspect of their life. Gambling is a simple game of luck. It cannot cause harm in your life. But if you addicted into gambling, then it's a problem. It's very similar to other addictions like drinks or smoking. Till the time you do it under control, it's not going to cause harm. But once addicted, you face issues. Gambling is same. Controlled gambling is fine!",
