From my little knowledge about the project, it is good for investment long term, development of the project is gradually ongoing by experienced team,  ada has been around for some time now, so i believe it is a safe investment. You can also stake your ada while you wait to see how big and valuable it will become in future.",

It is a high potential asset that once gave tough competence to ethereum. Maybe with the upcoming bull market it will reach big. So, making use of all possible down market to buy good volume of Cardano is a good choice.",

If you're asking if it's the right time to invest, this depends on your situation and capacity. It's always good time to invest when you have money ready to buy this or any coin that you want to whether the price is high or not, as long as you're capable.",

Just my two cents. 'coz if the token you are investing your money with has only potential and not having stable demand, I guess it would be a bigger gamble. If it is for short term, trying other coins would generate bigger profit.",

Im not even feeling doubt if the bottom price like that must become the right time to invest in the crypto.

Buying at the bottom bacame your main consideration. as we can't tell when will the bottom happens, one can slowly buy in every dip in the market. ADA is a promising platform as they have real product to offer. but when it comes to being heavily invested on this project, one should know the target plans of the dev team and if they are keeping up with it. what i am seeing here is that ADA is not the same with these pump and dump coins. they are actually building and growing their network, so you do have a chance to get your profits later on.",

Some said that this coin is actually very potential and has different utility os that this will be worthy. But on the other side, ADA also has big wekaness and that is why this coin is commonly undervalue. Thatis why rather than investing in a coin in which still confusing, it is better to invest in the exact coins that will really have potential to rise up. The most exchange of altcoins are only Ethereum or with BNB. But never forgte about the investment on Bitcoin, it is a must to invest even in the bearish era.",

They have so much money that they don't need to put in the extra effort.ADA we still have hope because the developer is still working hard and always has notice of his delay. I think ADA is still worth the investment.",

Why don't you go to the coinmarketcap and then try to see that? How good cardano is? If that was not a good coin and then cardano will never be considered as the top coin. People know cardano so well and any big coin is worthy for long term investment.

ADA was very popular among the smartcontract users and so many updates have been giving very big improvisations to the its protocol. This time so many dapps are starting their journey use ADA blockchain. Investing in this coin is the same like when you are investing in ethereum. ADA is likely to be a very strong competitior for solana in term of smartcontract blockchain for layer 1. Ethereum is still in another level compared with ADA and solana.",

It can be seen that ADA is one of the top coins on CMC, so it can be said that this is a coin worth long-term investment. Same old advice when investing in altcoins: investing in altcoins is always risky so you should still do your research before investing, ADA is suitable for long-term investment, should only invest with idle money, and do not a loan. Long-term holding is not easy; you have to make sure that to be profitable, you have to hold for many years and during that time, fluctuations will cause your assets to depreciate. But not yet sold means no loss and only sell when the target is reached or has made a profit.",
