We have reviewed the submitted documents and found that in order to complete the verification process we need to set up a Skype call with you.And !!! After skype call i recived now new message -We have thoroughly reviewed all the information you have provided and we regret to inform you that, unfortunately, we will not be able to proceed any further until the actual source of funds of the transaction in question is provided.The question is, are you okay? Do you accept documents and then reject them yourself?Unblock my account, I provided everything I could - photos of documents, bank statments, there was a dialogue on Skype and etc.And now it seems that in order to steal from me you have decided to cancel the document, which you have already matched?What should I do?https://www.reddit.com/r/hitbtc/comments/10l4cc0/hitbtc_and_kyc/",

You could try legal action, i think they're based in Hongkong.Yeah, good luck with that.  Who even knows what their laws are as far as what crypto exchanges can and can't do; plus you'd have to hire a lawyer that's willing and able to sue a company of questionable legitimacy in Hong Kong, and unless there's a huge amount of money involved here, it wouldn't be worth it.I got scammed by these jokers before, but it was for a laughably small amount of an obscure altcoin (Curecoin).  The only reason I created an account with HitBTC was because that coin wasn't trading anywhere else.  After that I started hearing more complaints about their shady practices--but never anything about Skype calls.  That seems odd to me.Anyway, good luck to you OP.  I have a feeling you're going to be shit out of luck, but I do wish you the best.",

This is very demeaning of hitbtc to have get themselves involved in such a mess.  At this point, i think i am done with them. If I may ask OP, how long have you been trading with them and also, were you able to go through their terms and conditions before fully getting registered on their platform? I see no reason why they would not allow you withdraw even after verifying you. I think you   should start uploading evidence and engage them in  words and  maybe legal actions as you have said earlier. They requested you do a kyc verification exercise which you did, they coming back again for a video call meeting which you did and all they could do is to get your account banned andwithout allowing you access to your funds.

They've stopped to provide withdrawals for this coin since more than one year and a half (April 2021). And they are still accepting deposits without any warnings... So now I think they will try to steal the more funds they can until their bad reputation prevents them to get new customers. And if we look at the number of users on their chat and on twitter, they seem to be already half-dead actually. So we can expect them to definitively close their doors and to fly away with our funds in the coming months IMO unfortunately.",

What I have seen from the reviews about HitBTC is that it is a bad platform that lacks transparency, so try again to provide them with what I mentioned to you, and you will be lucky if you can withdraw your funds from their untrusted platform.",

Very laughable. Imagine if I had left money thereThat's appalling... On the other hand, if you had \"only\" less than several dozens USD of cryptos remaining on your account they are certainly already swept by them. Because they're applying a new rule since several months without noticing users. If you have not made any trade, deposit or withdrawal during 6 consecutive months they take a $10 fee each extra month of inactivity. And it wouldn't be surprising if they apply this rule to locked accounts too. Quote17.4. Inactive Account Fee. In case during 6 (six) months the User has not made a single Trade, or single Deposit, or single Withdrawal of Funds, the Account of such User shall be considered Inactive Account (“Inactive Account “). For all Inactive Accounts, HITBTC applies a monthly fee, which is the equivalent of 10 (ten) USDT at the current SPOT rate of the USDT to the Currency in which the fee will be debited (“Inactive Account Fee “). From the moment of recognizing the Account as Inactive, HITBTC has the right, without notification of the User, to debit Inactive Account Fee every calendar month. Inactive Account Fee debit occurs before the 10th (tenth) day of each such month. Herewith, the Account ceases to be considered an Inactive Account from the date of execution of any of the following actions: one Trade, one Deposit, one Withdrawal of Funds. The debiting of Inactive Account Fee shall discontinue from the date when the Account ceases to be considered an Inactive Account. Inactive Account Fee is debited by HITBTC in any Currency in which the Funds are available in Inactive Account at the time of such debit. If the amount of Funds in User Account is less than the amount of Inactive Account Fee, HITBTC debits the entire balance of Funds from such Account. Inactive Account Fee is debited starting from 1 June 2021 for each Account, which is considered as Inactive Account as of such date and hereinafter for each Account that is considered as Inactive Account according to the conditions specified in this Clause.https://hitbtc.com/terms-of-use",
