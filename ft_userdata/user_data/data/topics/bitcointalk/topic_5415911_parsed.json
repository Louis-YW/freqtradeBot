  "content": "r/Electrum - Missing BTC & Electrum Address not showing up anymore on ELECTRUM WALLETHey guys,Hope everyone is well. This is a very weird situation and im hoping someone can provide some input on it.I recently sent 2 transactions from my Coinbase account to my friends Electrum Wallet address:bc1qcj3f0kllhwctsvgud4k9zv5gxqf574fm2qlj5tPlease find details of the transactions below.https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qcj3f0kllhwctsvgud4k9zv5gxqf574fm2qlj5tMy problem is that:Most funds do not show ( he only received 0.004/0.01611 BTC) on his electrum wallet on an address that DOES show which is bc1qfg0a4ns3z4ud2d90t8hfgc2a2x6j65y7j3rnsa .2)The Address I sent it to ( bc1qcj3f0kllhwctsvgud4k9zv5gxqf574fm2qlj5t ) has disappeared from my friends Electrum wallet.Honestly, I have never seen this happen before and I'm looking for some input on the situation.please find the transaction hash's below as well:Transaction #1:ac5a0a85fd07e3b8175de59e0e0944912b3be5d9e7ee728499778aeaaa82b33cTransaction #2:9ed2ce7aa4d6ee6bba10de58eb6865c4ade96ac356f54c462b06b777da48b457What confuses me is that if this was the wrong address, how would you justify the last transaction seen where that address sends some of the funds (0.004) to the visible Electrum wallet address while still keeping the majority of it.Help is much appreciated!",

If the same address gets pasted, it's not. Do this on your friend's computer.  The receiver is a close friend and I dont owe him any money but the contrary that anytime he needed money I always offered to help. When the situation happened initially I did check from both ends if it could?ve been some sort of clipboard malware and it wasn?t from both my side and his side. We both tried to copy paste addresses the same way the transaction happened and the addresses came out correct from both ends. (From when he copied his address from his wallet, then pasted it on discord, then I copied it from there and pasted it in coinbase to send.)

I know it wouldn’t make any sense but do you think it’s technically possible? Well technically, if the address where you made those 2 transactions doesn't belong to your friend and someone else is in control of its private key, that other person wouldn't need to move those coins at all. It's his address and bitcoin transactions are irreversible. 1 hour after you made the last of your two transactions from Coinbase, your friend or whoever moved 0.004 BTC to another address.https://mempool.space/tx/85006bcc25ed3ad370482f108eb8dc5ed6737a83ee0d5e0918f3ebeed39b302fIt's weird that your friend claims he only received 0.004 BTC, which is the exact amount that was moved to the bc1q...3rnsa address. Someone made that transaction and your friend claims that's all he received. Weird coincidence. Are you close enough to visit him at his home to see all this for yourself and look him in the eye when you ask about that last transaction?",

The only person who can make a transaction from an address in the one who owns the private key of the address. No one else could make that transaction. Quote from: qpool17 on October 05, 2022, 01:30:19 PMAnother thing I’m thinking is that let’s assume it was clipboard malware, and the hacker DID have the initial address it was supposed to be sent to (bc1q…nsa), how likely do you think that the hacker would only send a small part of the funds back ? I know it wouldn’t make any sense but do you think it’s technically possible ? That's technically possible. But It's very unlikely that a hacker would do this.Quote from: qpool17 on October 05, 2022, 01:30:19 PMHonestly the last justification I want to resort to is that my friend did something dishonest. Unfortunately, it seems so.",
