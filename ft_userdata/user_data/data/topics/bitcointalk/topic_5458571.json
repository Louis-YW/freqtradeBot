  "content": "Cypherock is a company founded in 2019 to build the World's 1st Hardware Vault to protect your Crypto. Cypherock X1 is the 1st product released by the company. It uses Shamir's Secret Sharing coupled with tamper-resistant hardware to avoid single point of failure in private key storage.Cypherock comes with 5 hardware components - 1 X1 Vault and 4 X1 Cards. The X1 Vault is the main computational device used to perform transaction signing and verification. It comes with a screen, 5-way joystick and connects through USB-C. The X1 Cards are Smartcards and communicate with the X1 Vault through encrypted NFC. Each of the 5 components store the 5 Shamir Shares individually. In order to construct back the master private key, you need the X1 Vault and any one of the X1 Card along with the PIN if set (2-of-5 Shamir's Secret Sharing).Features1. Unlike other hardware wallets, Cypherock X1 allows you to secure upto 4 seed phrases in the same product. You can protect each with a different PIN. Hence a Hardware Vault and not a Hardware Wallet.2. There is inherent protection against loss. As along as you have access to 2 out of the 5 components (either 2 X1 Cards, or 1 X1 Card and the X1 Vault), your assets are accessible. You can lose upto 3 components at the same time and still be sure that your assets are recoverable.3. There is inherent protection against theft. For a hacker to compromise the assets, he will have to find the locations of atleast 2 out of the 5 components physically and then buypass the PIN protection on top of them individually, which is extremely difficult.4. There are no seed phrase vulnerabilities. You are not required to backup your seed phrases on a piece of paper or a metal backup.5. It supports more than 3000 digital assets.6. It is the World's first sufficiently trustless wallet. Today, you have to trust your wallet provider that they will not push a malicious software update to your wallet that extracts out the private keys. In Cypherock X1, even if a developer pushes a malicious software update to the X1 Vault, they will not be able to compromise your private keys since your private keys are never stored as a whole on X1 Vault permanently. X1 cards are not upgradable once shipped to the users.7. it is going to support a non-KYC inheritance service that will allow your assets to be recoverable by your loved ones without Cypherock ever in a position to compromise user's assets. More on this soon!8. It is BIP39 compliant.Use Cases1. Use it as a hardware wallet without needing to backup the seed phrase. You can read more here - https://cypherock.com2. Use it as a seed phrase backup manager to secure the seed phrases of your other hardware and software wallets. You can always view the seed phrase of a particular wallet by tapping an X1 card on an X1 Vault and entering the PIN. You can read more here - https://cypherock.com/wallet-backup3. You can view and manage all your other wallets' portfolio through a single app. You can read more here - https://cypherock.com/portfolio-managementSecurity1. It is open-source - https://github.com/cypherock.2. It is audited by Keylabs that have found vulnerabilities in Ledger and Trezor hardware wallets before - https://cypherock.com/keylabs.3. X1 Cards have EAL 6+ certified secure elements. You can set a PIN protection on top of them.4. X1 Vault have a dual chip architecture and uses ATECC608A secure element, the same secure chip used by Coldcard.5. It is one of the few hardware wallets with a reproducible builds as verified by WalletScrutiny - https://walletscrutiny.com/hardware/cypherockx1.I would love to get the community's feedback on the same. Here is a coupon code for 10% off if someone wants to try it out - bitcointalk10",

I read somewhere on the site that one seed phrase is divided into 4 cards, although I understood that one seed is the same on all cards, what is true here?The seed is sharded into 5 parts. One of the shards are also on the device. You need any two but atleast two components (device + card or 2 cards) to construct the seed back. We use Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS). The one seed is NEVER same on all cards. You can read about SSS here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharingQuoteHow safe are EAL 6+ to be hacked or cloned?EAL 6+ is similar in security as that of your debit cards or credit cards. Not clonable honestly, atleast not so far. For comparision, Ledger has EAL 5+ .QuoteThe formation of seed cards is a kind of backup seed phrase, right?Papers or metal plates with seed phrases may not need to be kept with your wallet, but plastic cards must be kept.Not really. Your seed card can be only be constructed from atleast 2 cards or device + card. You need to keep one card along with your device to make transactions, however we recommend to keep the rest of the 3 cards away from the home to protect against the case in which the house burns down.QuoteAfter 6 months, does it have to be paid for your support?Not really. This is more like a hand holding support we offer in the first 6 months. You still get the support after 6 months, the only difference being that it would be a normal customer support.",
