Fine, accepted, you only have two to three options left and it will be better if you listen.1. Move out of Texas and go the electricity bill is not very high.2. Forget Bitcoin mining and invest in Bitcoin.3. Invest more on solar energy or other. Bitcoin mining is not a do or die investment, there are other legal ways you can make money with Bitcoin and in your own situation it's better you change location or invest more on solar energy or just forget Bitcoin mining and buy Bitcoin direct and hold.Any other ways apart from what I said is scam, especially anything cloud or rent space, etc.",

You can use these funds to simply purchase a couple or three miners and simply find the nearest data center for placement, while investing in cloud mining you will simply lose your funds since reputation and cloud mining are not joint things in 99% of cases.",

When milk prices go up your host would be better off just getting his own cows, or hosting a larger cow with more milk at a higher price, so I have to agree with phill, forget the cow, just get the milk since you are not a farmer and don't own a farm.",
