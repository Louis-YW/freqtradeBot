  "content": "More info: https://medium.com/@CdeFGa/warning-sigft-com-is-a-scam-website-that-steals-your-crypto-e628c0f4a5aI am writing this to warn everyone about the scam website sigft.com. This website claims to be a platform for trading crypto, but in reality, it is a scheme to steal your money.I have been a victim of this website and I want to share my experience with you. I deposited some crypto into my account on sigft.com and started trading. Everything seemed normal until I wanted to withdraw my money. Then, the website told me that I could not withdraw because of a security breach that affected their system. They said that they had to fix the issue and that I had to wait for a few days.I waited patiently, but nothing happened. I contacted their customer support, but they gave me vague and contradictory answers. They said that they were working on the issue, but they also asked me to deposit more money to unlock my withdrawal. They said that it was a temporary measure to protect their users from hackers, but it sounded like a lie to me.I realized that I had been scammed and that they had no intention of giving me back my money. They had used a fake excuse to take my money and prevent me from withdrawing it. I searched online and found out that many other people had the same problem with sigft.com. They had also lost their money and could not get any help from the website.This website is a fraud and a danger to the crypto community. They are exploiting the trust and enthusiasm of crypto investors and traders. They are stealing their hard-earned money and leaving them with nothing. Do not fall for their lies and do not use their service. Stay away from sigft.com and warn your friends and family about it.",

Did you see their ads on Google or something? I suggest you improve your security practices and install an adblocker since Google is notorious for its terrible ads filter. Most of the time they suggest malware instead of a legit software, or a phishing site instead of a legitimate service.Also, following the report format might be better. Especially if the website in question has a profile here. A quick search shows they have no presence on this forum though.",

Possibly, you might be hired to defame the purported trading platform you claim they scammed you while looking at your profile. How could you have don such trade without conducting due diligence when you know it involved  funds and come to talk of it, no trading platform could demand that you fund your wallet more for easy withdrawal.Learn to do your own research when you are engaging with any unpopular site so you do not fall victim of any kind in the nearest future. Members her are very wise and smart. As you can see, a member here  was able to unravel the identity of the said trading site very fast for you to  see which means that you barely did any personal research n it and possibly someone referred  you to that site which you probably do not ant to talk about.",

Exactly, those beginners are not the same as experienced users on crypto field which is very large and bigger world once you get to know it. Now everyone can differentiate between a scam and a legitimate platform even having experience the very similar example were with FTX. Beside that we can’t say  that even we here have never been scammed due to a lack of experience and knowledge and sometimes despite being well aware we still fall into these traps.Most likely the OP found this platform through a simple Google search and this sigft trading platform was sponsored by Google ads so it appears first to him. He probably didn't know about other trusted platforms, to choose over and this is his first experience which will be as a valuable lesson to avoid such losses in the future. Beside that it’s a great thing to join our forum and learn more here.",

The background from which many come is that financial transactions are relatively safe. Everyone who pays for online shopping uses Paypal, Visa, MasterCard or solutions in which he can get his money back if he does not like the service or during a guarantee period, which is something that does not happen in Bitcoin, as transactions are mostly final.Scammers find it an opportunity as it is easy to convince investors to profit, especially if he made a deposit and was able to withdraw for the first time without problems.",
