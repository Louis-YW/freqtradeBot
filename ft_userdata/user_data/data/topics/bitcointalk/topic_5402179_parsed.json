  "content": "BitLucy.com ðŸŽ° 200% deposit bonus, ðŸ•¡ valid for 48 hours! this new casino was posted by Royse777 who're known as good and experienced campaign manager, this bring a good appearance since many users think when the ANN posted with known user, it wouldn't scam and would have be great service. This casino started with giving away 7 free bet to 777 users with some requirements e.g. played in pragmatic play provider with 30x wagering requirements, all went good until Royse777 said many users want to abuse his bonus and in the end he stopped the free bet.But during the thread started until right now, many users keep complaining about their withdrawals are always pending and the live support doesn't help anything, all they do are only to promise and keep convincing the victim to wait more longer. It will be different if they complaining into this thread, where Royse777 handled it ASAP, though the recent accusations still not solved because he's inactive since June 05, 2022.This is the summarize of valid accusations against Bitlucy based on my own research, I have ignored some accusations including a troll :1. rokuen's got rejected his withdrawal after waiting for 15 hours, the reason is upgrading withdrawal system2. Betesports's waiting his withdrawal for 5 days, the support promise to pay him after few hours3. endigo's can't withdraw his $6004. pinger651's won 1000 Euro and got cancelled due to broke their rules, his funds convert back to his beginning deposit, he waiting the withdrawal for 7 days5. mojdragane's waiting for 8 days to withdraw $7006. davidr_22's waiting for 3 weeks to withdraw $10007. leytonlufc's waiting for 2 day while the support promise to pay him after 24 hoursI don't know the specific what does Royse777 position on Bitlucy, but he seems to be have a good impact behind this casino. Honestly looking how his performance and solving the issue, especially handling many abusers and trolls wouldn't be easy. He told this casino was created from the scratch and every day he keep learning how to manage his casino to become better. But the question is, how long we need to wait until this withdrawal problem is completely solved? it's already around a month and a half. I know if the gambler who contacted Royse777 the problem will be solved ASAP, but does all the withdrawal must be proceed manually? the gambler must be feel frustrated to wait his withdrawal each day by day. I think everyone ever face this problem either on casino or exchange, I believe you guys know how it feels when the money still not arrived on your wallet while you're in needed with your money.I see the Bitlucy campaign already stopped, but the avatar campaign still continued and there's a user remove his avatar. I think every participants of the avatar campaign should look into this thread.No hard feeling and offense to Royse777, but this kind problem should be solved otherwise your reputation might be ruined if this project fall and take this as a friendly advice.",

I thought he was only a campaign manager for them, but I do find it odd that they do not have an official account that i'm aware of. Also odd that royse hasn't been online for a week.

It's okay to have a problem because we can't deny there must be a single user who face an issue while most of users aren't, but after reading on the thread, the discussion isn't healthy and this is the reason why I create this thread.",

Or is it just a story that they are dealing with a new gambling site?",

I would rather skip them and let you all to address and continue. I am going with important parts that I need to address here.

I will go through possible all users details (you mentioned above, taking their usernames and email address) and individually address them later. It's even better if anyone offer me help to find the usernames (posted publicly) and give me a list in my PM. It's not possible for me to check every posts from the ANN and anywhere in different board.

It seems eventually they fall into problem with casinos. With Bitlucy may be this is just a continuation. I have only skimmed the first pages of their post history. It was just a quick one. Anyway,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2880706endingoBitlucy username: Cekniki (Since I found the username, I will check his case with the department)https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3479006davidr_22Please provide your username.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3482774leytonlufcPlease provide your username.With pinger651 we settle with him that we will give his deposit back, but not sure if we have already done it yet. I will bring info.I would request anyone who had issue with bitlucy, let me know. First post the issue in the ANN thread and then fill up the form (The spreadsheet will be private so please don't worry about personal information. I need to know your problem and if this is valid, you will get solution).https://forms.gle/ra1Uk5xVhJmfq9kR8The form will be closed after 17th.Please make one entry for one user, make my life easier.Insight,I know there are many cases popped up here in the ANN thread but as per my knowledge most of them are just fake cases, some are trolls and most of them are abusers who are giving their best to get back abused money, I am confident in this statement.These are some tactics that I have learned from them so far.- You give them no deposit bonus, they will create multiple accounts, in some cases 10 to 100s or even more. They will then exploit the system and make huge amount of money before requesting an withdrawal.- You ask them to deposit some small amount of money so that you can at-least filter the free abusers and narrow your list to only depositors thinking they are legit (before doing other investigation). They will deposit in one account and then send peer to peer transfer in the system to the account they deposited. So that they can withdraw money from that deposited account.- You ask them to give the transaction ID of the deposit they made, they will come with random transaction iD and will claim it their deposit.These are some key strategies we are able to see but there could be many more tactics, logic they use just to justify their abuse so that we allow them their withdrawals. If we still don't allow then in some cases they come and wants to blackmail us. Let me give you an example that happened not long ago but just yesterday. Even I had to chat with the guy in the support.https://paste.ee/p/CeIpiIt worth reading it from line 196, that's when I had to enter. In summary, the simple thing he could do is to give a tx ID that matches the data we have. We would credit him his money but instead he went and started threatening and blackmailing the entire casino.He didn't stop there. He came to my official telegram, the previous support managers telegram, CEO's telegram, my bounty group and everywhere. The chat he had with me: https://imgur.com/a/pmz7zKSWhatever he has done is only possible for a person who wants to hit you hard, like very badlySo this is just only one example of internal cases of many we deal every day. Only the one who are handling it knows how painful it is to deal with the bad actors.By the way, with our old system, in one day we had like 13k or 20k registration (speaking from my memory) and all happened because we had only $7 no deposit bonus. We had to close it though.PS: I am not saying it's true for all cases that pops up in the ANN threads, scam accusations and reputation boards:When someone takes unfair advantages and when they get caught, when they fail then their only weapon is to hit your reputation. When good users are getting paid in a casino they do not care much and come to public to post about it all the time.",

I don't see any problems with having a withdrawal taken and assured manually especially for a newly made website that is being built from scratch. You cannot just create a whole big ass gambling platform then release it and expect no issues, regardless of how big your system is, issues will still arise. Baby steps are the ones they are making. All of the gambling platforms we have in this forum as of the moment also had their issues back in the day. And so how they start their withdrawals. Payment system in crypto isn't also that well way back from 2013-2017, notably to new crypto gambling websites.Also, I don't see the patience nor the knowledge of those gamblers that expects a new gambling website (only published in about 3 months and had to change providers and devs) to be as good as Stake, Roobet, etc. I'd rather not accept if one week they haven't had any online supports. Speaking of supports, man do you think supports are the owners? I don't see how a support can settle an issue specially about withdrawal. Do you think their supports can give you money without the permission of the CEO or any admins? Tighten your nuts and bolts, they are loosing..",

I don't think this is correct that you dig those gamblers with their own experiences on other casinos, I understand it's odds when a gambler faced so many problem in other casinos, but the gamblers I mentioned above isn't a trolls who trying to hurt the casino reputation. Based on the list you provided, they're correct with their accusation especially they have provide an evidence.Quotehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2795942rokuenBetFury: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5276159.msg58592342#msg58592342He give an evidence where Betfury cancelled his bet and returned his deposit amount, then he said he have a similar situation on June, it was a mistake by Betfury and BetfuryÂ  pay his winning.Quotehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2790812BetesportsProblem with Csgo500: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396580.msg59996016#msg59996016TheSuspect500 aka CSGO500 team admitted he was wrong, so he pay all the winning with small compensation.Quotehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3372048pinger651AceDBets.io https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5230348.msg59986396#msg59986396BETOP.GG https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5328184.msg58388611#msg58388611AceDBets is a scam casino since they got negative feedback and BETOP.GG always have slow withdrawal problem, it's make sense he have a bad experience.Quotehttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3465496mojdraganeRollbit.com https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5326640.msg60189824#msg60189824I can't comment to much about this accusations because there's no more explanation about bad bet attempts, it's either mojdragane is an abuser or rollbit wrong suspecting a player.QuoteWhen someone takes unfair advantages and when they get caught, when they fail then their only weapon is to hit your reputation. When good users are getting paid in a casino they do not care much and come to public to post about it all the time.I understood, but usually an abuser is spread a completely nonsense and trying to hurt someone reputation while the good users sometime didn't do that. Though it's just a personality and we can't use that to trust someone since many people are an professional actor, but since most of the reasons I see regarding this withdrawal problem are because of abusers that taking advantages over your casino e.g. bonus, promotions, features etc. I think it's better for you to make your casino more strict, though you may lose some gamblers, but this can be an option (it's good you have removed the free bet and have a hard requirement of the welcome bonus).The strict rules what I mean is:-Ask a verification through his phone number when sign up -Ask a KYC when you in doubt to prove he's a one person or have other alts.-Tightening the wager requirements in order to prevent someone withdraw his initial deposit.",

But then you said the worse suggestions for strict rules. Having abusers can already be solved just with that manual withdrawal checking (since they are not stake that has huge traffic) or just simply don't create abusable promotions. Verification like those are already way too far for the others gamblers. Even I can have KYC and still have multiple accounts. Tightening wager requirements? Are you dumb? You just said that they should be resolving withdrawal issues but then you suggest that they should do things to prevent users to withdraw. I don't really see your general idea on what they should do. Maybe your suggestion is way better than their collective ideas and experience?",

Even I can have KYC and still have multiple accounts. Almost gambling have mandatory KYC and everyone should know they could be asked in the future. It doesn't solve 100% against abusers, but it do reduce some percentage since they need to spent more times and effort to create fake KYC.QuoteTightening wager requirements? Are you dumb? You just said that they should be resolving withdrawal issues but then you suggest that they should do things to prevent users to withdraw.You're allowing an user to deposit and then directly withdraw their funds on casino? A casino isn't a mixer and they're combat against AML, the withdrawal issues happen because the manual checking, tightening wager requirements will proving they're high likely a real gambler.If you're not a regular gambler and not familiar with gambling, you're better off to learn first before talking non sense.",

      "body": "Quote from: Royse777 on June 11, 2022, 02:46:40 PMI know there are many cases popped up here in the ANN thread but as per my knowledge most of them are just fake cases, some are trolls and most of them are abusers who are giving their best to get back abused money, I am confident in this statement.These are some tactics that I have learned from them so far.- You give them no deposit bonus, they will create multiple accounts, in some cases 10 to 100s or even more. They will then exploit the system and make huge amount of money before requesting an withdrawal.- You ask them to deposit some small amount of money so that you can at-least filter the free abusers and narrow your list to only depositors thinking they are legit (before doing other investigation). They will deposit in one account and then send peer to peer transfer in the system to the account they deposited. So that they can withdraw money from that deposited account.- You ask them to give the transaction ID of the deposit they made, they will come with random transaction iD and will claim it their deposit.I have filled in your form, however i have little faith it will make a difference given my experience with BitLucy so far.I never took a no deposit bonus from BitLucy, i have one account & noone ever asked for my txid.I made my account, deposited money twice last tuesday and then made a withdrawal. I waited 24 hours.I asked your live support how long my withdrawal would take on wednesday. They said less than 24 hours.I asked your live support where my withdrawal was on thursday. They said 24 hours.I asked your live support where my withdrawal was on friday. Telling them i would post my experience on here if they continued to give false information. They told me it would be done the same day.I asked your live support where my withdrawal was on Saturday. They said wait 24 hours. It was at this point i told your support that I'd be posting my experience on here. At which point 'BitLucy' took over the conversation and assured me that my withdrawal would absolutely be processed the same day and they would email me as soon as it was complete.I check on Sunday and of course no money has been sent and the whole site has been taken down again.And you're saying its me/other players that are the fraud?I cant speak on behalf of the other complainers. But as was pointed out above, its ridiculous to dismiss their allegations on the basis that they had an issue with other casinos as well. Plenty of these issues where solved in the players favor, or involved scam casinos.I have no issues with anywhere else stake, fortunejack, bustabit are all exemplary casinos which i use all the time. There is no excuse for the continued lies your support team are giving about payouts, which simply aren't being processed.",
