This is what exactly the Lightning Network Tutorial is https://medium.com/lightning-power-users/send-a-lightning-payment-with-zap-desktop-17b74b65b9b8When I send bitcoin from Electrum to Binance and there is a Lightning Network, can I send it directly? Or should I first download the tutorial on the medium platform you gave here, sir?Because I really want to learn to use LN, for example, if there is congestion in the Bitcoin network, LN is the alternative I will use so that the fee I can use when I transact is low. So I just noticed something like no Windows 64-bit? is there",

So I just noticed something like no Windows 64-bit? is thereBinance do accept both on chain and LN, if you have Bitcoin on chain just deposit to the deposit address, if you have Bitcoin in Lightning network just deposit to the invoice.Oh yeah you're correct, it seems zap discontinue their project, unfortunately I didn't find an easy solution to use LN in windows, what I found you need to run full node which takes time to sync your wallet https://medium.com/@johnny_pham/guide-setup-a-lightning-network-node-on-windows-8475206807fBut if you use Android or iOS version Open-source Lightning wallets, you don't need to sync your wallet.LN is a good solution for cheaper fees, the problem is you need to pay Bitcoin on chain fees to open the channel and convert the network (on chain to LN).",

I believe those threads will be helpful for your guides.Very few exchanges have Lightning Network for deposit and withdrawal but basically if you can use Lightning Network from your non custodial wallet, it will be better than using centralized exchanges.The barrier is you have to open your Lightning Network channel, with an on chain transaction, before you can use LN as an off-chain solution for your bitcoin transactions.",

Don't miss out – watch now and let us know what you think in the comments!I do not like it. Even though I'm certainly not a fan of YouTubers, there I need to watch a video with lots of text, so why isn't your tutorial written in an article accompanied by screenshots? What is the advantage here compared to a written article tutorial, for example, the list tbct_mt2 mentioned?",

What complicates it is when users expect they can use LN to perform a single transaction and pay cheaper fees.",
