You can't do anything about those that create similar usernames or places that have an identifier system, and not truly unique usernames. It's partly the reason why I like generic usernames so I don't have to go into the effort of all that. There's thousands of Welsh's out there, and I'm fine with that.",

However, it's probably a decent idea to at least get the matching usernames on as many platforms as possible. I mean it doesn't exactly hurt, if you have a unique username just register them you don't have to use them. Although, yeah you'll never stop others impersonating users, and unfortunately with the different characters some platforms allow, some can pretty much look undistinguishable. Yeah sites like Discord that use the identifier system e.g #0001 are particularly bad for impersonators. The other option is to state explicitly you don't use any other platforms, however if you do use a few, that can be rather difficult to clarify then, so best to just get the matching usernames, and never use them. It's at the very least a extra step of protection, even if it doesn't solve the problem completely, it at least mitigates it slightly.",

If there's a legitimate reason to change a username, and theymos agrees that, I imagine he's more inclined to do it. Although, timing could be hit, and miss. Might have just caught them at a good time. Although, most of my communication with theymos has been relatively quick. Although, I wouldn't base how quick it too this time around or my experience with theymos. If you ever wanted to change your username, you ask, and it either gets rejected or takes as long as it takes.",

I skimmed through the replies on the thread, and from what i get you never got any answer whatsoever, well that is strange, especially for someone of your reputation. Did you ever get to give Theymos your reason for wanting to change your username? Or you didn't get the chance to since he never replied in the first place?I am thinking the problem could have been the timing, maybe you asked at a time Theymos was prolly busy or less inclined to make any such change for users, i can't see any other reason, first you are an established user, and from my deduction you never actually had the chance to tell Theymos the reason, so the claim of 'the reason wasn't susbstantial' can't suffice. Why don't you try asking again bro? How about that, well that is if you consider it important of course.",
