  "content": "Fiat banks inscriptions says they have 24/7 services to their customers mostly in E-banking. But I came to realized that Africans' Banks promises became Africans Leaders (Politicians) Blueprints (Manifestos).How I discovered itI was out of cash yesterday in my house and it was night already so I said I would go to a bank ATM Machine this early morning which is today. And I left home early as possible by 6:00pm  so I can meet to my working place to attend my customers on time and I have done it before but ironically today when I reached the Bank ATM it was locked and I went to another bank the same things, I paid transport to another communities to check if theirs are dispensing cash all the same. So I wanted for about 2hrs and by 8:00pm which is the official time for Banks to open for day was the time ATM Machines (all) opened and started dispensing cash. When I came my neighbors told me I have loss a number of customers today. There was a crowd of people waiting to collect money that belongs to them but the bank restricted them to take their money on their will. Some people were even saying that they will sue their Banks in court to know why they can't take their bown money on their willing time to spend.My thoughts on the Fiat BanksAll these nonsense happened because banks are centralized service agents whereby it control by the central authorities (either the president or the central bank). Bank managers can not do things on their own but they acted on instructionsMy thoughts on the BitcoinAll these nonsense can never happened in bitcoin space. Really I don't think such thing will happen in crypto ecosystem. Since bitcoin uses p2p, I can use my fund at anytime. The only thing that can hinder my transaction is network. There is always someone to make transaction on bitcoin. Bitcoin is the best option for transaction of goods and servicesThe images are used to represent the various Banks because the time of the incident I didn't go with my mobile phone. https://www.google.com/search?q=techcabal+access+Bank+image&prmd=niv&sxsrf=ALiCzsZE8MYC2OeHCrv4_renYU7Ri_b97A:1662911286233&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiR1Iiki436AhXASPEDHQZSBUQQ_AUoAnoECAIQAg&biw=320&bih=512&dpr=1.5",

      "body": "This is exactly the way that people find out that they need to abandon banks and adopt Bitcoin instead. Banks are a dying breed, just like VCRs or floppy disks. There is absolutely no more need for banks with cryptocurrency. Bitcoin can give people everything that Banks can give them. Except it does not charge hidden/any holding fees and nobody can freeze/take over your money with Bitcoin. This is true independence. True freedom.How long until everyone in the world understands this? Personally, I will never put more money in the bank than I plan to spend on the same day. And even then it feels disgusting to have to use these \"middlemen\" because not every shop has adopted cryptocurrency yet.The day will come. Have patience and spread the word.",

Since many people came to discovered that Bitcoin transaction is the best option for someone to carry out Bitcoin transaction without waiting for anybody to sign or permit or give instructions like the way bankers do in the bank before the transaction can be successful. Bitcoin transaction is fast and secure for the users to carry out their daily transaction without the fear that the transaction will take time like the way banks transaction used to take  people time in their daily transaction.",

Bank managers can not do things on their own but they acted on instructionsThis nonsense happens because they're private businesses with virtually no competition (i.e. they're pretty much a cartel). This means they can optimize (cut) costs by not providing the services they promise without being afraid the competitors will \"fill the gap\". Even more, they've probably paid up politicians to \"not notice\" the banks make false claims/false advertising.Depending on the country some of these (dirty) moves may or may not work.So it's a shared guilt between the private businesses (banks) and the politicians.The quick fix is bitcoin. The long term fix that also has to be done is be more careful what you vote for next time.",

Working hours are only from 8am to 4pm.I think for you to easily get a cash from your bank then you have to contact your account manager, if the money is huge and you would get your money ready before getting to the bank.You can transaction with Bitcoin if there's anyone who needs it at that point to give you physical cash then you have overcome queuing up in the line but for your service you have to include it maybe if anyone wanting to make deposit or withdrawal.I m seriously failed up with the poor operation of Nigerian local banks.",

Just go to Binance, Remitano or any other web or app that vendors are buying and selling BTC. So forget P2P, his first advice was to trust another bank, just that it's a crypto bank and not a fiat bank!I love when all those people just criticize banks and tell stories about how you can't withdraw your money from them only to stuff their precious coins on some same-level centralized entity.",

The banks can be really frustrating at times and I can imagine how frustrated you must have felt. Personally as much as possible, I try to avoid anything that will take me to the bank because there is always a queue and you get exhausted easily with their very snail speed service in attending to all the customers.Banks can generally be under instruction from one body because of their centralized nature to not operate and that will have a general effect on all customers, but with bitcoin via your wallets creators, there is no centralized body controlling them, so there is no possibility that one day they all will generally just decide to not operate and frustrate customers like the banks have done to you.",

Often times i would have to call for confirmation of a transaction that normally need no follow up, all due to the fact that there is no network service at the moment. The 24/7 service bench mark as stated by them is just like you have put it, a political manifesto. All talk no bite. The only thing that makes these fiat banks still relevant is the fact that Bitcoin is still in the process of gaining mass adoption, in that, the populace who transact business on a day to day basis may need to have proper orientation on its use. It is also not a legally recognized means of exchange in the country of which makes these banks, have an edge and as such can follow directive to limit use of the channels for dispensing cash at whatever time they deem fit. Bitcoin exchange, is fast and can be done at any time of the day, as long as the network is available, not on basis of any directive given to by any governor or president in charge.",

Though it was not only elderly people were more annoyed than even me. But the funniest part is that, really as you said, we can not do without the fiat because bitcoin has not accepted worldwide. Anyhow we do and talk here, we still need fiat currency for survival. If I send BTC to someone for trade or exchange, I will need the fiat to buy what I want to eat and wear. There is another problem I am also seen, the awareness campaign on bitcoin is not enough, most people are not aware of bitcoin mostly the traders of food stuff and market women. I vividly remember a chemist lady asked me what is bitcoin after she saw it on one of my advertisements on my office banner. There is a need for a massive campaign on bitcoin in all the Communities, Towns , villages and cities. When the number of people that aware are more than the unaware and the usages increase then even without government adoption within us, we can enjoy it. If market people (women and men) started using bitcoin then God has butter our bread.",
