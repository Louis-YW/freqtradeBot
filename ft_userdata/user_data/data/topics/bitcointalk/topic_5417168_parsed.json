They don't have to. My guess is the user is not aware of anything at all, he even does not care what he have in his signature and avatar. On the other hand bitlucy site is down, I do not think there are any payment to receive too. All leads to realize only one thing which is the said user does take care of his signature and avatar space. A PM to him will not take longer time to get this removed.But from your side this does not make sense to me. Have you created this account only to accuse that user?",

I think we have seen this before. People wearing the signature of a campaign that has long since disappeared, for one reason or another, sometimes due to simple carelessness.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on October 15, 2022, 07:47:03 AMBut from your side this does not make sense to me.

I still doubt he doesn't know any information about Bitlucy. but looking at his activity on the forums, he only makes a few posts per month.",

It has to be manually checked by any user who wants to allow newbies to PM him or her. So in that case the OP most likely won't be able to pm FFrankie if that person doesn't manually tick his personal message options. Maybe, OP can remind FFrankie with his main account if the OP really cares.",

I think it was the bravest thing they could have done because they were already out of finances to run a casino; I hope they get things in order before the next time.
