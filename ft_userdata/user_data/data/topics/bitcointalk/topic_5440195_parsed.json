I'm sorry that our parents must go through this, but I can suggest that they don't really need to withdraw all the cash because some stores have POS or rather they can transfer, at least that should relieve them of the plenty of charges. The current cash situation has been a challenge for everyone currently, and the problem now is that everyone is suffering from it. It is a matter of time.",

I also donâ€™t like so many things that this present government had implemented but this cashless policy is definitely spot on. Should this get pulled off then both Buhari and Emefiele should be praised for standing firm on it. We all listened to the news we could hear how the politicians are complaining, this tells us it is affecting them.A new policy like this will definitely come at a cause and this is part of it. The best we that are knowledgeable in this aspect should do is to start educating or tutoring our older ones on it. Most by teaching them how to run this transfers and also to tell them that there will be lots of people that will pounce on this and scam people.So mr Uche6215 please tell Grandma this is just a phase and it will pass",

It is very disheartening to see how the old and weak ones are been affected drastically by this new money policy. They always say for a change to happen, a sacrifice has to be made. Should we see this as a sacrifice to birth a better nation? We are confused and donâ€™t know what to do now at the moment, but we just hope tomorrow will be better than today. We are all in this together, those at home and in abroad, because one way or the other itâ€™ll definitely affects us all. We pray for an end to this soon.",

Your aged parents shoudn't be living alone in the first place, hire them a maid that'll look after them and she can teach them how to operate the mobile apps or use the debit cards and your problem is solved. I personally don't see any thing bad with the cashless policy although I don't support how it's been implemented with such urgency. It makes me begin to think that there's a bigger picture that we're yet to get like this policy is been targeted at some politicians or something because normally no be so dem dey implement directives. E suppose take time and this one wey be say every other things come dey fall apart I come begin to believe my suspicious of a bigger game to the cashless policy matter. I no see any disadvantage that won't be addressed in the shortest time possible. Infact this policy go make banks invest in their systems and upgrade to better ones so they can render better services or they lose customers. Our banks are been poorly managed and just small traffic see the wahala dem dey cause everywhere.",

We are on no choice now,all we need to do is to apply wisdom when spending or making withdrawal, so that we don't have a big lost at the end of the day. Transfer to those traders that accept transfer and use cash only to petty traders, in this way, you should withdraw little cash because now cash don get value over our money wey dey account, due to insufficient cash. I like the cashless policy even if e dey affect us because e go help our economy in future. Imagine those politicians wey don keep enough cash for house,no reach to swap all their cash because say e to big to go swap am once,don enter one chance because their old cash don expire. Kidnappers no go fit dey demand for ransom again,and also money laundering to stop but spraying of money for party no go stop. LOL",

I sent 20,000 to my dad last week and he called me and said that to withdraw 20,000 is 2000 charges. And it took him like two days to see where he can make the withdrawal. And he couldn't make a transfer because he does not know how to transfer. As he would have transfered to the store where he wanted to buy some food stuff.The only solution i think of now is to be patient with the new policy, withing a short period which is after the election i believe everything will fall in place and that is dependant on us voting the right candidate to ease our suffering.",

OP, is it the bank that is charging your mom 20 thousand naira to withdraw 50 thousand naira? I don't understand that part. Also, instead of stressing your parents by starting to look for places to withdraw cash each time you send them money, you can possibly send the money to a friend of yours (if you have one) who can help you get cash and send it to your mom. It's just an opinion.",

This is robbery and the vendor who wanted to deal this way should be arrested. The cashless economy is so because of the ongoing elections. So as cash will be restricted and am guessing it worked in a positive way because those who usually stomp the voting ground with cash reserves to buy votes from voters couldn't do so this time for fear of being arraigned.The cashless economy has made more persons to stay still with limited movement to meaningless locations and save more. Although charges are still high, it has made people know more persons names they would normally not know even if they had asked politely. It has made people use it as an excuse to not refund debts which is a negative, but thank God the advantages outweighs the disadvantages from my perspective here.",

So it's really affecting their little business, and most of them that wish to buy can't afford to pay the POS charges too, instead they rather bear the hunger and starvation and it can also lead to them getting sick because of lack of food..And another problem is the POS people, their charges are just too high, even me as a youth most times when I want to collect cash when i think of the charges eh, I will just declined the thoughts and look for another means to purchase what ever I wish, the last time I collected 1k from POS agent, I had to pay a charge of 500 naira, imagine the POS girl just divided my money into two, omoh e pain me oo, Even as I dey talk am now sef, e still dey pain me,So the cashless procedure is really affecting, and I pray it ends soon abeg, because we Don tire...",
