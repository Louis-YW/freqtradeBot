  "content": "Vintage Parker Duofold Red Herringbone fountain pen– with issue– Streamlined– Rare Red herringbone marble pattern– Button-filling systemUp here is a vintage English Parker Duofold Streamlined Button Filler fountain pen, which was manufactured in England circa 1950s. This Parker Duofold is a fine example, very rare in stunning red herringbone marble. The pen is in nice condition, yet unfortunately there is a crack-line on the thread. It has been repaired and serviced so still highly collectible. It bears a Parker 14ct solid gold nib, semi-flexible, writing medium line. The Parker Duofold has a button filling system, which is particularly simple and elegant filling method – the end of the pen unscrews revealing a button which is depressed while the nib is immersed in ink. The pen has been serviced and tested for full functionality. https://pastpens.com/shop/vintage-parker-duofold-red-herringbone-fountain-pen/",
