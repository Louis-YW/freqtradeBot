      "body": "First of all, double check that you have a ypub and not a Ypub. The two are different things. The rest of what I say below will assume you have a ypub (which you should have if you are using a standard nested segwit path at m/49'/0'/0', as you say).First, you need to convert that ypub to an xpub. The easiest way of doing that will be to paste it in to this site: https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/. Select the top option from the drop down box (xpub), and hit convert.Then, run the following command, changing the xpub for the one you have just generated from the above site:Code:getdescriptorinfo \"sh(wpkh([00000000/49'/0'/0']xpub6Cyu4zAA9sU3T46hUfmycvnRs6dmSFSkkVm9JKqbHinuKAeJbGCuL36Wyd44pV7PAL9uQz6p2CmK4yZhFcjATQECEmHfWzPYPyiUtYiZ6Yr/0/*))\"It should hopefully return the following:Code:  \"checksum\": \"k0veet2v\",  \"isrange\": true,  \"issolvable\": true,  \"hasprivatekeys\": falseNow, run the following command, again changing the xpub to your own one, and also changing the \"xxxxxxxx\" to the 8 character checksum you just produced above. (Yours will be different from my example). You can also change the timestamp to a more appropriate time - this is the Unix time from which Core will start rescanning the blockchain looking for transactions. If you know when the first transaction to this wallet is, you can change it to a little before that time. If you aren't sure, leave it at 0, but it will take a while to perform a full scan.Code:importdescriptors \"[{\\\"desc\\\": \\\"sh(wpkh([00000000/49'/0'/0']xpub6Cyu4zAA9sU3T46hUfmycvnRs6dmSFSkkVm9JKqbHinuKAeJbGCuL36Wyd44pV7PAL9uQz6p2CmK4yZhFcjATQECEmHfWzPYPyiUtYiZ6Yr/0/*))#xxxxxxxx\\\", \\\"range\\\": [0,999], \\\"timestamp\\\": 0, \\\"internal\\\": false, \\\"watchonly\\\": true, \\\"active\\\": true}]\"You'll also want to repeat the process with the following command, which will add change addresses:Code:importdescriptors \"[{\\\"desc\\\": \\\"sh(wpkh([00000000/49'/0'/0']xpub6Cyu4zAA9sU3T46hUfmycvnRs6dmSFSkkVm9JKqbHinuKAeJbGCuL36Wyd44pV7PAL9uQz6p2CmK4yZhFcjATQECEmHfWzPYPyiUtYiZ6Yr/1/*))#xxxxxxxx\\\", \\\"range\\\": [0,999], \\\"timestamp\\\": 0, \\\"internal\\\": true, \\\"watchonly\\\": true, \\\"active\\\": true}]\"",

      "body": "AFAIR, the first bold part is the fingerprint of the extended public key, the second bold part is the descriptor checksum.The checksum of a descriptor can be obtained with the getdescriptorinfo command.You will likely need to convert your YPUB to a XPUB, see here: https://jlopp.github.io/xpub-converter/(You get the fingerprints there, too. Not sure which one to use then, though, as you get two of them.)You can't use the linked tutorial that easily because it doesn't explain how to construct the descriptor for importdescriptors in your specific use case.What kind of script type does your YPUB represent? I assume P2WPKH-P2SH which should be the normal case for a standard derivation path of m/49'/0'/0'.I haven't tried this myself yet, but I think you will need to construct your descriptor something like thissh(wpkh([parent fingerprint/49'/0'/0']converted xpub/0/*))#desc.-checksum [for receive addresses; add a descriptor sh(wpkh(.../1/*)) to cover change addresses, too]I'm just giving some hints, no full recipe, yet untested by myself. Someone with more experience with Core descriptors should definitely chime in.This documentation of Core descriptors might help a little: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/descriptors.md",

Not sure which one to use then, though, as you get two of them.Neither of them.The fingerprints that jlopp site gives you are the fingerprint of that specific xpub and the fingerprint of its parent. So in this case you are getting the fingerprint of the key at m/49'/0'/0', and the fingerprint of its parent at m/49'/0'.In the bitcoin core descriptor, the fingerprint is that of the key at m. Since we don't know it, I simply substituted \"00000000\". This will make no difference to importing the descriptor.Quote from: Cricktor on April 09, 2023, 09:21:30 AMWhat kind of script type does your YPUB represent?
