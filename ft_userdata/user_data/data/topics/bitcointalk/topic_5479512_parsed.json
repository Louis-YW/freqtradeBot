      "body": "You are welcome to the forum, and I am happy to say to you that you have come to the right place, because here is where you will have all the information that you need about bitcoin and even other alt coins.My suggestion for what I will say to you is that you should understand bitcoin first before you invest in it, because it is of no use to invest your money in something you know nothing about, so you should know and understand how bitcoin works. If you have done that, no one will tell you the amount to invest. You will know the amount to invest when you understand how bitcoin works.Actually, investing in bitcoin is profitable, but understand it first before you invest because if you depend on the suggestions of others, you will end up blaming them. You shouldn’t be brainwashed by the profit; invest the amount that you know you can lose. In this case, I will like to tell you that you are the one to determine what to invest. Quote from: Yorubek on December 28, 2023, 05:42:32 AM He said, he will open my bitcoin wallet and help to buy bitcoins. Should I invest in bitcoin?Yes, it is a good idea to invest in bitcoin, but understand it before you invest in it.especially, be cautious about him that will open the wallet for you, and make sure you keep your seed phase (private key) very secure and not allow anyone to have access to your private key (seed phase), because if someone has access to those keys, it is like he has access to your bitcoin, and I hope you know what that means.",

He's not wrong for telling you about investing with any amount you're willing to invest. That also means that amount is what you are willing to lose. Why so? It's because this market is highly volatile. I don't want to encourage you to invest but right now, you are not yet ready IMO. What you must do is read more info or gain more knowledge so you understand what you are investing with.Quote from: Yorubek on December 28, 2023, 05:42:32 AMHe told me that if I invest I will get good profit.

Should I invest in bitcoin?He's right that you'll get good profits in time but I disagree about it that he's the one that will create you your Bitcoin wallet. He can guide you but the wallet that you must use is a wallet that provides you your private keys. You can invest in Bitcoin but do that later when you understand these things already.

Should I invest in bitcoin?First of all welcome to this forum which will surely be very useful for you. You have heard right about bitcoin, indeed bitcoin is a good investment, and people who have capital prefer to invest in bitcoin. Whoever advised you to invest in Bitcoin must have given you good advice. You have no idea about investing in bitcoin, because you don't know anything about cryptocurrency. so in my opinion you need to know about cryptocurrency market first.You can find complete information about Bitcoin from various platforms and useful information about investing in the cryptocurrency market is everywhere. However, I would suggest that you don't rely on anyone else to buy bitcoins and create a wallet, but rather learn about creating a wallet yourself, and when and how to buy bitcoins. It's still a good time to invest in Bitcoin, and if you invest $500, that's a small amount considering the price of Bitcoin, but still a good start for a new investor.",

Should I invest in bitcoin?Before you throw your money into Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever, you gotta educate yourself so you actually understand what you're getting into.  As for that guy's suggestions, maybe he actually knows his stuff when it comes to crypto.  You should probably ask him some harder questions before taking his advice and  like, what's his background with all this? Does he really understand it or is he just seeing dollar signs? Gotta make sure hes not leading you down a rabbit hole.  But if he has real expertise hey, maybe you should listen.  Either way, you should look into it more yourself too.  Do your own research before throwing money around.  In the end though, it comes down to trusting his motivations.  If something feels off there better to trust your gut.",

Since you are a beginner, you probably don’t know that the seed phrase that is created when creating a wallet is important, and it is this that needs to be kept away from other eyes. But by helping, your friend can keep it for themselves.Therefore, investing in Bitcoin is of course always good, but do not be hasty; take the time to learn some points about creating a wallet and buying Bitcoin yourself. And also read not only bright success stories from investing in Bitcoin but also stories of people losing them. And how can you protect yourself from this.",

You need to understand that Bitcoins have grown in price across the years, so if you buy now then there is chance that it might grow more in the future. Hence you should definitely invest in it for long time. Moreover, I would suggest to read articles online or watch YouTube videos on how to use a Bitcoin wallet and manage the Bitcoins.

You have to understand things like this, there should be lots of sources on Google that you can read about Bitcoin and its risks.And just as a piece of advice, you have to open your own wallet and don't let other people use it, even your own relatives. The wallet is where you store your Bitcoins and if someone wants to do evil they can back up your private key and import it on their device, and then they can send Bitcoins from that wallet.

      "body": "As you are new to this forum that's why I highly welcome you to this amazing forum where you'll get a lot of information about Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general. The person who told you about investing in Bitcoin did a great job because it's the best asset in the market as of this time and anyone who learns about Bitcoin and investing in Bitcoin will get profits if he/she aims to hold that investment for long term.Although, an investor can get profits by investing in Bitcoin but it's not possible to get a lot of profits by investing in Bitcoin right now. Bitcoin is already over $43k a Bitcoin and it's expected that in this bull run Bitcoin may reach to $120k a Bitcoin. This bull run will continue for at least 2 years at minimum as speculated by professional market analysts and if you invest in Bitcoin right now then you may get more than 100% profit if its price reaches $86k or more.But before investing in Bitcoin I would suggest you to learn about Bitcoin by reading as many topics on this forum as possible and you should also try to learn about personal wallets like Electrum in detail and use it yourself for sometime with small amounts. Once you learn it properly then you should create your own personal wallet and keep the seed phrase in a secret place that you get when using the Electrum wallet. Never share your seed phrase with anyone because if someone learns about your seed phrase then they can easily transfer your Bitcoin from a remote computer.I would say that the tough part is to learn about personal wallets and that's only a little bit tough for the newbie users but once you learn about it and you also learn that how you can protect your seed phrase and private keys then you won't face any problems with Bitcoin investment. I would also suggest you to go with a DCA strategy when you have learnt about the personal wallet and its security. With a DCA strategy you may invest $100 to $1000 per week into Bitcoin. I won't suggest you to go with $10 to $20 based DCA investing as that's not going to be helpful you should begin DCA with at least $50 a week and continue investing in that way.",

Through bitcoin/crypto it is a tool for you to find what you are looking for. But it will be similar to many things in life about investing in knowledge, health, time, money, relationships,... if you do not grasp the basics and just participate. The way it is presented, it is indeed a danger. I can mention the story of using a car, we all know it has benefits such as reducing travel time, protecting us from the weather,... but if we don't learn how to drive, we just sit above it, sooner or later you will have to pay the price. So still welcome to this environment, freely express your opinions and always learn from everyone, I hope you will have a great experience in this field.",

Also fair warning avoid people telling to invest because you can get a passive profit here since usually they are scammers and running a ponzi schemes. Anyways good luck and start investing if you have gain enough knowledge and don't go(invest) if you are still doubting or doesn't have clear inputs about questions still in your mind.",
