      "body": "Yes, you are right. This resource can be used for argumentation in discussions with bitcoin haters and, as you said, to mark the \"value\" of their forecasts.It seems to me that the largest number of burials in 2017 is due to the fact that this year was the most hyped for bitcoin with the sharpest and most significant increase in the price of it. It is not surprising that non-believers expected the speedy collapse of this entire “pyramid” and “ponzi scheme”, which created many \"valuable\" predictions about the speedy end of bicoin's \"life\".",

All bitcoin is dead submissions must meet these rules  before it'll be published: the website, blog or social media account that created a Bitcoin is dead article or thread must have good following or traffic and the articles must focus on the failure of Bitcoin mainly. Which means that if all the Bitcoin is dead articles or tweets were recorded they'd be more figures than what we have today. But, yet, despite the limitations the numbers are still high. Bitcoin triumphs from both bad and good publicity. I'm seeing the site for the first time and the idea behind it is excellent.",

      "body": "To older folks like me, this site is obviously well-known  For me, the most interesting thing is the distribution of the \"Bitcoin is dead\" articles over time:- 2010: 1- 2011: 6 - first bull market with some media attention, and subsequent crash. (For me, this was the moment when Bitcoin indeed was closest to \"death\" - e.g. it could have been 51% attacked and then forgotten.)- 2012: 1- 2013: 17- 2014: 29 - second big crash.- 2015: 39 - MtGox insolvency and depression.- 2016: 28- 2017: 124 - as already was mentioned by @m2017, this was probably the moment when Bitcoin really was noticed massively by the public opinion. It was not the sharpest price increase though.- 2018: 93 - Crash and aftermath of the ICO bubble, with lots of scams.- 2019: 41- 2020: 14 - surprisingly low taking into account the deep March crash, but probably overshadowed by COVID in general.- 2021: 47- 2022 (so far): 24 It really is surprising so few articles came out in 2022, above all due to all the \"energy consumption discussion\" (bitcoincleanup, European Union PoW ban discussion, etc.). I would almost suspect the site isn't up to date when it comes to new articles.",

Such statistics won't be relevant to me except for historical research. The crypto-currency world can't take serious words from people who choose to be bias and creating FOMO for no tangible reason at all.

I have found one of many sources to explain to them, that bitcoin is the best investment and similar asset that has gained a capitalization of one trillion dollars in 10 years, even though it has been considered buried many times by certain people. Sometimes we don't want to discuss the greatness of bitcoin with stupid people, because indeed they like stupidity and consciously reject the facts about the greatness of bitcoin.Technological developments do not make them aware that bitcoin has reached the moon, even though the history of bitcoin's journey is so easy to find on the internet today. I passed one medium that said bitcoin had died time and time again. Even oddly enough, there are some idiots who don't believe in bitcoin, yet they acknowledge blockchain. Isn't this a simple level for us to understand bitcoin.",

The issue seems to be that less people submit obituaries in those times. Maybe because newer generations of Bitcoin users don't know \"classic\" Bitcoin-related websites like 99bitcoins anymore (which was created in 2013/14 and had for example also during some time the most comprehensive list of Bitcoin-accepting shops). And older Bitcoiners became rich and are busy on their private islands driving their Lambos It's of course also possible that Bitcoin has already been around for such a long time that predicting a \"death\" isn't that easy anymore. But I had expected more just because of the cleanupbitcoin.org discussion (the website only was set up in March 2022) which got recently a boost again due to Ethereum's Merge (which in some newspaper articles I read was very much hyped to the point a \"flippening\" and subsequent slow decline of BTC was predicted. But we know now it had, very much unexpectedly, almost zero influence on the ETH/BTC exchange rate).There seems to be a sort of competitor:https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/bitcoin-is-dead/ (previously seems to have had an own domain, bitcoinisdead.org, which is now a redirect to it)Don't know if they use the same data source. Seems pretty similar, maybe it's simply a copycat.",

It is also not anymore interesting to find patterns of the price or its reaction every time a death declaration is released. After all, it is declared pretty much all throughout Bitcoin's existence.

They were focusing on an attempt to convince people that bitcoin price is directly correlated with US stock market. The attempts partially failed because bitcoin started rising back up when US stock market was still struggling which proved that like the prior 12 years there is no correlations whatsoever.

It's not surprising to me that it's ben proclaimed dead so many times, but I think it's good that the peak is behind us. The early years don't really count as there haven't been many obituaries not because of a strong belief that Bitcoin isn't dead but simply because few people knew about Bitcoin or cared about it at all. Then we see a big MtGox spike, and the peak of 2017-2018. That was a hard time, as many truly thought this was the end and that there's no way Bitcoin can cost $20k again. And now, just a few years later, many are whining about such a low current price of $20k.I think the 2020 count is low because Bitcoin recovered fairly quickly and because Bitcoin was overshadowed by bigger things. And lately, there have been fewer proclamations of BTC's death due to, I believe, fewer people believing that it really won't recover this time. The public trust in Bitcoin is growing.",
