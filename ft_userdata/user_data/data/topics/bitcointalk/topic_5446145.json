Hopefully, they will come back to explain the issue in detail.As I know game/sportsbook provider does not give false info like fraudulent activity or something like that if they do not notice it. So you know actually what you have done there. Meanwhile, wait for playsherbet's response.",

      "body": "Most casinos don't explain what was wrong when they suspend the account. But, in my opinion, If a player is guilty, he still has the right to know what terms he violated. In such cases, casinos avoid responding to their customers (shady ones). But, as Sherbet says, you can appear at support@sherbet.com. I would say contact them to get more details about your case. Is there any possibility that you may create multiple accounts? Since the issue with the provider, I think it's something serious rules violation, such as syndicate plays or something.",

No other communication?Have you asked them to explain what type of fraudulent activity you have done, types and things. Sometimes it's better to push internally then when there are no other way then come to the community support. This community have great experience with solving sportsbook and their clients issue but there are many occasions where unknown people tried to take advantage of the free service community members provide.It's important you are to be honest and showing everything that you have to support your case.",

Most of them never always give a proper reason why the account was banned/locked.What is so hard with the saying \"Hey Player X, we have banned your account because we discovered that you were involved in fraudulent activity A, B and C. On this day you did this and that, on the next day you did more manipulation\" etcSomeone will obviously complain if they don't know why they were banned.",

It's that simple.Stop assuming things until proven otherwise. @Yahoo only mentioned what's really happening in the scam accusations section, where thousands of newbies start topics accusing and attacking casinos. After a few days when the truth is revealed that the gambler was either lying or cheating everything back to normal. And sometimes the problem gets resolved after by just contacting the casino support and being patient without the need of starting a whole story and drama. As for this thread we can't see many details shared yet about the matter and we can't judge until the casino answers here. The OP didn't answer to many user's questions about whether there were other conversations with Sherbet’s support whther they did mentioned the reason for permanently locking his account.Many old Bitcointalk users also have accounts with these casinos and they rarely have issues with them or they open topics against the casino without any proofs. So it’s obvious why only newbies are behind the drama as always.",

People come here once they are already in trouble and want to get rid of it. Some of them indeed know that they are guilty. But, still they tell the story from their side in hope of getting some help from the community. As long as casinos freeze or confiscate balance with a valid reason, the chance are slim to get any help. Even the community cannot help if casinos doing something shady. It depends if the casino cares about it's reputation on this forum.",

I'm not even close to exaggerating. Go take a look at the accusations. I have worked with a lot of casinos and I hear stories about groups that go from casino to casino targeting sportsbooks.
