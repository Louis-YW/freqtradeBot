  "content": "Welcome to NFT EPubsWe firmly believe in the power of markets and the worth of ideas.Like ebooks, ideas are too frequently not given the correct or equitable value. That's because the ebook publishing business was created to benefit a small, well-established group of people. It was a closed market that stifled competition, masked transparency, and gave the gatekeepers the majority of the value instead of the authors themselves.\"Closed systems like these can only support the top 1% of authors, and even then, it's not by design.\"We think that all creators, not only gatekeepers or the top 1%, should benefit from the value of ideas. As a result, we established an open market where any creator who receives royalties can sell them to any investor willing to pay a reasonable price. The outcome is the sole remedy for the 99% of creators and investors who were previously disregarded by the outdated system we're upending.That is the strength of a free market. As a result, value is transferred from vested interests to those who were previously marginalized—the creators.Who is behind NFT EPubs?Primary core devs are:Sam Enrico Williams → Inventor of NFT EPubs, founder of ZloadrA more extensive but non-exhaustive list of team members can be found here.Our ZDR token contract addresses which powers NFT EPubs, can be found at Zloadr's website the site contains all needed instructions.The Next Step: Some LinksNFT EPubs: Benefits and InformationFollow us on our socials for giveaways and airdrops!Website: https://nftepubs.com/Instagram: https://instagram.com/nftepubsTwitter: https://twitter.com/nftepubsContact Us:General Queriessupport@zloadr.com",
