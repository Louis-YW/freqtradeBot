Real Madrid, in terms of quality and squad depth, is clearly the favorite to win this final compared to Osasuna, but I have never felt that Osasuna should be underestimated. Osasuna will be pushing for the title even if they are not the favorites to win it, so if Real Madrid do not want to lose the title then they will have to be pretty good at avoiding mistakes.I expect Real Madrid to win the Copa Del Rey title today, and then I would like to invite you to predict and discuss this final including odds and everything for 24 hours from now. Don't forget, choose a team that will win it because I have prepared a poll for you.",

Don't forget, choose a team that will win it because I have prepared a poll for you.According to the latest news, Real will play with the strongest team because Modric, who was injured, will also play.This may be Real's last chance to win a trophy this season, because in the Spanish championship they no longer have a chance to overtake Barcelona in the standings, and in the Champions League they are not favorites against Manchester City.Osasuna is currently in the middle of the Spanish championship, it is tenth in the ranking and is a very unpleasant and dangerous team, which it showed in the Spanish Cup.However, Real is the favorite in this match and I give them an 80% chance to win.",

This will serve Real Madrid as compensation since they are not holding any thing tangible out of the various leagues this seas in, Barcelona and man city is big threats to Real Madrid this season.",

In my opinion, the interesting thing about the Copa Del Rey final is the handicap bet, if you want to win at least @1.8 of the total bet, Real Madrid bettors must choose -1.5 in the handicap. But, can Real Madrid win by 2 scores? It could be that the FT in this final is a draw and then the results will only be seen at ET or even the penalty shootout round.",

Ancelotti is most interested in winning this CDR Cup, especially Real Madrid. In thirty years, Real Madrid has only been able to play in the final round of the Copa del Rey six times. three of them Real Madrid won and the other three were runners-up. The last time Real Madrid won CDR was 2014 when Real Madrid won 2-1 over Barcelona.",

Nobody can guarantee Real Madrid a win, I think that should be true enough in a final. I think Real Madrid will have a hard work winning this final if Osasuna plays a total defensive strategy and counterattacks. In the last few matches, Real Madrid have failed to win matches against such teams, so I hope it will be a tough game for both of them.",

They also had so many goal attempts but still couldn't prevent Real Madrid from being the champions in the Copa del Rey. Rodrygo became the star of the night by scoring 2 goals. His recent performances have started to impress me a lot and he is getting more consistent compared to the old times.This was an important step forward for Real Madrid considering their situation in this season. Because finally they achieved a title which should improve their morale. You know that they have fallen behind Barcelona a lot in the La Liga and they can't go for the title there. We don't know what they can do against Manchester City in the Champions League this time either. But this title must be some help for them to focus on their Champions League matchup more.",

If that's true, he's just done half the job  The Champions League will be much more difficult to win, but Real players seem to be more suited to cup competitions than championships in recent seasons.",

Osasuna had a great final even though they lost in the end, but it seems true that most people tend to believe that Real Madrid have no problem winning this title.I respect Osasuna who gave the best game, so I agree that it was a great final for both teams. Thibaut Courtois managed to thwart Osasuna's 4/5 chances to score, this ultimately made Real Madrid the champion in the final. About Rodrygo, he is hero for this title. Congratulations to Real Madrid and all the fans, I really feel this is a title to be proud of.Thanks for participating in the thread although I realize it doesn't interest most users. Now the poll is closed and the thread will be locked because we have found a winner.",
