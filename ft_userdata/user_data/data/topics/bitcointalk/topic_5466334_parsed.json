  "content": "I am currently addressing a problem gambling addiction and have taken proactive measures by permanently self-excluding myself from participating in any form of gambling with legal and licensed operators within Australia. This self-exclusion was intended to ensure that I could not engage in gambling activities, even if I were inclined to do so.In September 2022, I encountered a troubling situation when I received marketing communications from Cloudbet. These communications explicitly encouraged my participation, stating phrases such as \"join the club\" and claiming that Cloudbet had been \"serving Australia's crypto community since 2013.\" I possess substantial evidence documenting these marketing materials.Moreover, when accessing Cloudbet's website from an Australian IP address, their homepage boldly declared, \"The best Bitcoin sports betting site in Australia.\" Once again, I have gathered concrete evidence to support this claim.Regrettably, these marketing tactics successfully lured me into activating an account with Cloudbet. Over the course of my account's existence, I made deposits exceeding $40,000. During this period, it became increasingly evident that my vulnerability to problem gambling was exploited rather than addressed.Eventually, I encountered a disconcerting situation where I could no longer access Cloudbet's website, as it displayed a government notice stating that they were \"banned.\" Upon conducting further research, it became apparent that the Australian Government and the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) had formally banned Cloudbet and conveyed this decision in July 2022. This action occurred two months prior to the distribution of the misleading marketing material and my account activation. I am prepared to provide documented proof of the public notice and correspondence between the Australian government, Cloudbet, and Curacao Egaming regarding this matter.I am deeply troubled by these circumstances, as I feel I have been deceived, misled, and deliberately targeted by Cloudbet. Had Cloudbet genuinely held an Australian license, as they professed, I would not have been able to create an account in my excluded state.Upon contacting Cloudbet's support and raising my concerns, they consistently maintained that my understanding was incorrect and asserted that they were legally operating under full licensure within Australia's jurisdiction. This, I firmly believe, is a manifest falsehood.Cloudbet's own licensing requirements explicitly dictate that operators must have a thorough understanding of the laws governing the jurisdictions in which they offer games of chance. Furthermore, their terms and conditions, which I reviewed carefully, unambiguously state that they do not accept registrations from individuals residing in jurisdictions that prohibit online sports betting, gambling, gaming, and games of skill, particularly when involving cryptocurrency.?7.1.1. Before you are able to start playing on the Website, we will require you to first register with us. 7.1.2. We do not accept registration from persons resident in jurisdictions that prohibit you from participating in online sports betting, gambling, gaming, and/or games of skill, for and/or with Cryptocurrency.?The issue transcends my personal experience; it raises a significant concern regarding Cloudbet's actions and the broader implications of their conduct. By allowing individuals from banned jurisdictions to register, Cloudbet potentially manipulates the situation to its advantage, misleading players with marketing materials while retaining the ability to deny payouts should a player win significantly.There are plenty of examples I can provide where Cloudbet refused to pay users from banned jurisdictions after KYC  and rather than paying out winnings, decided to void all bets and refund deposits. Cloudbet should remain consistent and do the same  for the losers too.EDIT: Email I received from Cloudbet stating “Join the club” and that they have been “serving Australias crypto community since 2013”:https://i.ibb.co/tZbk8Lp/68938389-D51-D-48-AC-AC08-FDB1-B3889-A24.jpgCloudbets homepage stating they are “The best Bitcoin sports betting site in Australia”https://i.ibb.co/cFD3zQN/CC73-D589-14-E0-46-CE-9-D16-132-E6-B8-C7-E72.pngScreenshot of the Australian Governments formal warning to Cloudbet advising they were in breach of Australia’s laws (two months prior to my account activation):https://i.ibb.co/j8dDD7Z/131395-C1-A4-F2-41-A2-9-D57-A96-BAC405319.pngScreenshot of Cloudbets representative claiming to be fully legal and compliant in Australia after I raised a complaint:https://i.ibb.co/mRdHgXb/75-ED16-DC-2-A98-44-A2-AE0-D-D2-C8-E1-CD7-B09.pngUPDATE: I joined Cloudbets discord server where they claim to be “driven by the community”.I posted my issue in the “help” section.. My message was deleted by the admins and I was blocked from the server.UPDATE: their license provider “Curacao Egaming” responded to my dispute with a rather complex and puzzling response that doesn’t even make sense:“The Player has based his/her claim on an (alleged) violation of a norm (unlawful action). The relative aspect of the unlawfulness means that the norm infringed by the perpetrator must have been codified in order to protect the interest that has been harmed. The norm on which the player has based his claim does not pass the relativity test. Whatever may be of the alleged breach of a norm, as a consequence of not passing the relativity test, it is ruled that the Operator has acted in accordance with rules and regulations pertaining to the issues relating to the player.”",

Please be honest.For someone like me, struggling with problem gambling to the point of needing permanent exclusions, the concept of 'winnings' feels elusive. It becomes a cycle of continuous play without the knowledge of when or how to step away, so the idea of 'winning' doesn’t really exist.Suppose, hypothetically, I were to achieve a substantial win and successfully withdraw a significant profit. It still raises concerns that Cloudbet might initiate a KYC (Know Your Customer) process and decline to pay out the winnings based on their terms and conditions regarding banned jurisdictions. This situation has unfortunately been a recurring issue for many users, as evident across various online forums.",

This becomes even more concerning, given that it occurred just a few months after the Australian government had issued a notice against them.When I refer to being a permanently excluded gambler, I mean I've been excluded by the regulatory authorities in Australia. This implies that I'm barred from participating in gambling activities with licensed and regulated Australian bookmakers who operate within the confines of the law in my jurisdiction.Cloudbet.com is now a banned URL in Australia completely however they continue to claim legal licensing and regulation in their communication to me. Any remaining 'Australian' customers would have to resort to VPNs (which are against Cloudbets  terms of service) and run the risk of losing everything once the KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures are implemented.It's indeed a concerning situation, and as you rightly mentioned, I plan to share this information across various platforms to alert and inform fellow users.",

He'd then submit this judgment to the courts in Curacao for enforcement.Interestingly, he told me a similar case recently occurred with a different operator. Two users from Austria and Germany obtained foreign judgments, on the basis that a Curacao license isn't sufficient to provide gambling services in their jurisdictions. Surprisingly, the Court of Curacao enforced these foreign judgments.This means that virtually anyone has the potential to reclaim their funds.Also, apparently if two or more claims are left unpaid - it is sufficient grounds to declare the business bankrupt and stop trading. He referred me to this article:https://www.onlinegamingcuracao.com/2023/08/08/araxio-declared-bankrupt-on-appeal-by-the-court-of-curacao/",

I'm waiting for the second part of your list to complete the claim of over 70 cases and we can probably decide how trustworthy cloudbet is from that list.",

      "body": "Update:Cloudbet has finally broken their weeks-long silence and responded to my email. However, their response raises several concerning points:They have emailed me acknowledging that I was lied to by one of their representatives about the legality of Cloudbet in my jurisdiction. They have called it misguided, a “human error” and advised that staff will be trained on legal and regulatory framework.The irony here is that the same representative who initially lied to me is the EXACT same person sending me this email lol. I don’t think their even paying attention.The response seems to have conveniently ignored or perhaps forgotten the evidence I provided. This evidence clearly showed their targeted marketing efforts towards Australians. They had specific content and emails declaring themselves as the \"best Bitcoin betting site in Australia\" on their website. They even had a blog section guiding Australians on how to use crypto for gambling on their site. To label these false statements as a mere \"human error\" is a gross understatement.Cloudbet has now removed all Australian-targeted content from their website, presumably due to pressure from their licensor, Curacao Egaming (the same licensor who refused my complaint and said Cloudbet did nothing wrong). It's perplexing that they admit their wrongdoing by removing this content but still hold me accountable for being a victim and refuse to address my concerns.Besides all of the facts, they refuse to hold accountability or return the disputed deposits.In essence, Cloudbet's response fails to address the core issues of false marketing, misleading information, and their unfair treatment of users. This is far from a satisfactory resolution, and I remain committed to seeking justice and spreading awareness of their practices.",
