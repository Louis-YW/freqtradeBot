When anyone tries to harm the one/ones with the greatest effect on the price of Bitcoin/crypto, the market reacts by falling sharply... (this largely depends on whether the one with the greatest effect on the price is affected), the price then reverses and move up sharply. This is analogous to how the bull moves backward before rushing forward to headbutt an opponent... Opponent in the case of the Crypto Market is the bear.  I hope you understand what this mean? The bull is about to reverse and charge towards its target. I wouldn't advise you to trade based on this because you may likely fail. I previously offered people the opportunity to be guided by the one with the greatest effect on price, the Bitcoin master, but only a few grabbed the opportunity. They will be occasionally exposed to the most accurate price prediction in the world.All Glory be to the CREATOR of the Universe. This is impossible without HIM.

The bull run is not coming yet, sorry. It's still not time because many are saying that the bull run will come only on 2024 and beyond.There is a recovery that is seen today but that is only tiny. A lot of us are expecting that the price will continue to fall down because the tension between the two exchanges namely Binance and FTX are still there. There is no bull run yet @op, only just a bear market but you are right. The price will charge first before it explodes. The explanation for this is that many people are buying and hodling, and that creates a strong force.",

Don't worry with sharp dips guys.People should really have this kind of mindset whenever we do see bear markets or extreme crash or dips which we should mind off that this is the best opportunity to get in and not on the time where prices are already getting or making huge gains or increase.People cant just really be able to avoid not to resist that fear and it do goes all the way until they had missed out the best time on getting in.They would justsimply regret and whine over when they had missed out those cheap prices which they hadnt really taken any action and now that prices are climbing up then they do start on accumulatingwhich is really a totally opposite action which you should have done it earlier to maximize profitability rather than on making yourself that late.",

Just wait till the bull comes out of hibernation and start to run to it's course.",

This is where we get in to move the price further up. Before that, I will be going through posts in Crypto space to be sure nobody has predicted a price increase and precised date that is similar to ours then we will start moving things up probably this week, according to the Will of our CREATOR. Once the time comes I will hopefully signal it in my post/posts. The target is to start moving it up sharply and cross $30,000 from now onward.",
