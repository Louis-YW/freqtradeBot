Everyone could attack it, but at the end of the day hyperinflation is real and it is going on all around the world right now, some more than the others but everyone is getting worse. This means that we should not be really focusing on anything that is outside attack, we should only trust crypto and we should always believe in bitcoin.The video is awesome and it is telling the truth and it is showing the world why we are investing into bitcoin and why we prefer it over any other fiat in the world.",
