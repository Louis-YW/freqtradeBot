The problem is that if we create an \"information black hole\" then CSW will have undisputed control over the media (skies) and will be able to tell them basically anything. Most won't even attempt to challenge such ideas and will just rubber-stamp them on their publications.",

I sometimes think he's got some inward jealousy, encaved by his Incessant claims on Bitcoin; to have own 'em‚ò∫Ô∏è and would he publicize also, the fact that he's a troll and knows little or nix about the processes in Bitcoin just as did make public, in court, his empty proves just to see if it cuts?Believe me, that dude's a bunch of shit; there's no way he can make the issue political, which remains his endeavours right from inception. I'm even seeing his factless turbulence as a top-notch advertisment cus for sure, that dumb-head ain't gonna get through 'em, even with his fuckin cash. 'em pegan's effort keep getting thwarted......seems provable to 'em, or maybe somewhat ironical.EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE A DEAF EAR TO THAT SHITBAG.SANDRA üíá",

This is a good evidence against him when next he appears before the court to claim that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.",

If satoshi wanted the attention he would have made himself known but rather he didn't, so it means satoshi wants the attention to be focused on bitcoin, his creation that he has out forward. Ignore people who are claiming to be him, and redirect your focus to buying, hodling and using bitcoins.",

So they support CWS and his crusade against Bitcoin Core, similar to how people believe in conspiracy theories. No amount of evidence is going to convince them otherwise. All CWS has to do is to keep lying, doesn't matter if he's doing well or not.",

If that's not enough reason for people to invest their curiosity to something else then I do not know anymore. There are other more important points of discussions out there that warrants our time, and in my honest and straightforward opinion. Satoshi Nakamoto's identity, no matter how interesting or inquisitive it may be for the many, is not gonna be one of those discussions.",
