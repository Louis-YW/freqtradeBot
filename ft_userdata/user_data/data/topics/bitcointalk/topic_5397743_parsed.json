  "content": "They say you can't teach an old dog new trick, but I was able to teach my 80-year-old father and 75-year-old mother about Bitcoin. It all started when I visited them a couple of days ago. My parents asked me- why do I spend so much time on the computer looking at charts? What does the big yellow \"B\" sticker on my laptop computer stands for? These questions provided the perfect opportunity to tell them about Bitcoin.First, I told them the \"B\" on the sticker stands for Bitcoin. It is just like our regular local currency but much better. And just like cash, you can spend it. A typical example I gave my parents was that I paid for my laptop with bitcoin. I explained to them that as the value of our local currency fluctuates more against the Dollar, so does the value of bitcoin fluctuates based on supply and demand.Second, on the state of bitcoin, I gave them a simple analogy. The Central Bank in our country is pushing for a cashless economy, so it was just right to weave it into my analogy. I told them that just as the government pays their pension benefits into their bank account every month. After which they pay for their groceries and other items at the mall with their debit cards without ever seeing or touching the physical cash, that is the bitcoin state of bitcoin. You can't see the physical bitcoin but can make transactions with it. Third, I explained to my parents that, unlike our local currency that the government prints, bitcoins are created through mining. Since they live in a coal mining town, I used the coal mining analogy. I told them to imagine that there is a bitcoin mine. And that this mine contains only 21 million bitcoins. I explained to my parents that, unlike the conventional coal mining techniques, bitcoin miners utilize sophisticated, expensive, and specialized computers for mining bitcoins. I specifically pointed out that bitcoin doesn't come from the ground but is the reward of solving a complex computational math problem. Furthermore, I told them that the value of 1 bitcoin is about fourteen million in our local currency. And just like the highest denomination of our local currency can be broken down into smaller denominations, 1(one) bitcoin can also be broken down into smaller units and owned by individuals. I also told them that although I do not own 1(one) bitcoin, I own some units and that occasionally I exchange them for our local currency when I need to pay for stuff at shops where bitcoin is not accepted. I can also convert our local currency to bitcoin so that it doesn't lose its value.Fourth, I gave them two major advantages bitcoin has over our local currency or any other currency. I told them that bitcoin is a global currency whose value is the same everywhere. For example, 1(one) bitcoin in Germany is equal to 1(one) bitcoin in kazakhstan. In addition, bitcoin is not subject to control by the banks or the government. Instead, individuals are in control of their bitcoins without fear of interference from a third party. I explained to them that just as they have a physical wallet or bank account where they keep their money, I also have a bitcoin wallet where I save my bitcoin. Furthermore, I briefly explained the concept of a private key being akin to the secret pin they use to access their mobile bank app and input when to allow them to send cash from their bank account to another. I was about to give them a quick overview of blockchain when dad thanked me and reminded me that he and mom had a meeting to attend. The next day, I travelled back to my state. Well, I am glad that they now have an idea of bitcoin. Have you tried to talk to your parents or any senior citizen about bitcoin?",

You explained Bitcoin to them in a good way, you told them it is a currency rather than a money making investment, the right step should be learning Bitcoin as a currency first, then other functions can come later. At your parents age it is unlikely that they would want to use Bitcoin, but one must not use it to have knowledge of it.",

For people at that age, you used the right teaching technique which is demostration and you used the right examples. I think they would be able to learn the basics but they might not comprehend the technical and more complex aspect of Bitcoin. But you did the right thing and your parents my teach their grandchildren. I am suggesting you start an online or offline Bitcoin class for the elderly. You might end up having many clients because everyone cherish financial freedom.",

I think that's great, of course, but I don't think that many of the octogenarians and close to this age will show such an interest in bitcoin. Your case is more like an exception to the general statistics. It seems to me that you can only give information about bitcoin older people if they show a genuine interest in it, and you have enough time to educate them. Otherwise, I tend to think that it is better to concentrate on teaching about bitcoin the younger generation. Young people have more energy, strength and enthusiasm to immerse themselves in the bitcoin world and there is a chance that they will be able to contribute to the world in the future. And what about the old people? I doubt that they will even have time to take advantage of the profit from BTC holding after 5-10 years. At best, they will leave a inheritance in the bitcoin form.",

To educate these minds to be aware even if they might not have or see the need to use it but, it provides some protection of them from scammers who explore the system.

First off happy birthday in advance @Jet Cash. Personally, my parents are very traditional but have always been curious about technologies. As a matter of fact my father started using a smartphone in his late sixties.

I wanted them to have an idea about Bitcoin without throwing in any technical jargon that would get them confused and disinterested. I don't think they would be switching to Bitcoin anytime soon but like they say no knowledge is a waste.",

I can't imagine how it would be even more difficult if I start trying to explain the blockchain technology for starters! I might even get punched by my mum! haha.But in all seriousness, the thing that may have gotten it a bit easier for you to talk or explain about bitcoin to them is their already curious minds either because of seeing you looking at charts all day or because of hearing about crypto somewhere else(if they are tech savy people). This would make things easier because people that are already interested or curious about something will most likely already have an open mind about the thing they are curious or interested about.
