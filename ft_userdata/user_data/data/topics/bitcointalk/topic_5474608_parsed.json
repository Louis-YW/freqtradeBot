It's hard to say what is a best exchange for you because to choose an exchange, you have to consider many things: KYC or non-KYC, Taker, Maker trading fee, withdrawal fee.I am not sure about UK, you can find some from exchanges for Europe.https://www.cryptowisser.com/exchanges?continent=EU&coins=&fee=2.0If you don't like KYChttps://kycnot.me/QuoteI am only going to start with $200 roughly to see what I can turn it into over the next few weeks and months as the market is starting to get very volatile so could be good opportunity to make some extra money which would then mean I can invest more into my long term plays. I will go frankly with you, trading is difficult and it's hard to get rich with trading.Your capital for trading is smal, $200 and I will use it for investment to layer 2 projects like Arbitrum or Optimism. If these projects successfully make its bull run in 2024 and 2025, chance for x10 or x20 with their tokens is possible. It's a better choice than trading.",

There might be a limit to it (On withdrawals) however it's the best option if you want to go with a Centralised Exchange.

That's weird. Trade is completely different from holding, the risk associated with it is too high that $200 can't take you anywhere and from your op it's obvious you are about trading for the first time which very unlikely for you to make profit, so don't get too comfortable with a few basics you must have learnt about trading. Am not being pessimistic but realistic with you, to be a better trader you have to be prepared to make losses and those losses means money , the preliminary question you be asking yourself is are you ready to lose your money and be comfortable about it.",

Although as for now I see that people are saying that trading can be beneficial if you learn the trade very well but with my experience I think even the so called expert get the losses.",

I would rather use that $200 to invest in Bitcoin than to waste it on trading, I am expecting you to say that I am trying to discourage you because it's what most newbies used to say on here but I don't care, the truth is always something you guys don't want to hear, trading isn't something you can start because you have the money, as a matter of fact put that money aside first, what do you know about trading? Nothing, just because you have money to try trading out doesn't mean you should, there is also no demo trade for crypto trading available that I know of, if you want to know trading start learning first and when you are at a level you are free to use $10- $20 dollars as your testing amount, not $200.I have cousins that are into trading, as smart and educated that they are, it took them three years to start knowing the real strategy of trading, they started with rush and they lost a lot of money but that's not even the case, the thing is they end up in debt and I came to their rights rescue, trading is not like investing in coins and tokens, it's very complicated and you need to take your time in learning only, fix your mind on learning it instead of thinking about making money right now, the longer you take your time in learning the more you will get better knowledge about trading. I won't dare stop you if you are ready to pay for your own ignorance though, but I hope you will listen, it's not about having money to trade, it's about the skills you have gained from learning how to trade, start your trading journey today with zero money, learn how to read the charts and other important things, this is like going back to school honestly, you will come back and tell me that I am right.",

You want to trade with altcoins, and not Bitcoin; so this topic should prolly be in the altcoin discussion board.I don't know anything about these two coins you have just mentioned, but i know they are pump and dump coins, you have seen them pump and that's why you want to get in right now, mind you that it is the dump that usually follows next. Altcoins generally do not have any actual utility like Bitcoin does, so they just pump and dump and if you must buy them, you have to know when to sell; if you hodl it longer than necessary, you might end up being a badholder. That's why buying/trading altcoins is generally regarded as gambling.",

You think and say very simply but in reality completely different. Every time you think about turning $200 into $300 and $300 into $1000 you will never be able to do it if you actually want to do it. Everyone thinks like you and by participating in trading platforms with your thoughts, at some point it becomes difficult for many to return with the original balance. In some cases people lose their original balance. But I want to tell you that if you are very skilled in trading then you can do trading and if you are less qualified then avoid trading because at any moment your trading can be damaged.",
