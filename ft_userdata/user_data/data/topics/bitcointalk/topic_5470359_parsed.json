Because gambling is an act against the law, in the end it becomes a polemic and turmoil which ultimately results in several countries on the Asian continent becoming easy targets for the rise of illegal gambling.So when talking about gambling sites and the Asian gambling market, I cannot recommend sites that can provide the highest odds because most of the sites circulating in the Asian region are illegal gambling sites, which are very dangerous because they cannot guarantee security for their visitors.",

So, please elaborate a bit more on what you want, because that will help us to give you more accurate information on your questions.  Yes, you're right. I didn't articulate my point clearly.Some platforms replicate the odds from an Asian site named Pinnacle. When I mention 'Asian sites,' I'm referring to these platforms. some crypto site may appear to operate their own sportsbooks, but in reality, they're trading liquidity on Pinnacle based on actions taken on their platform. So, when you place a bet on one of these sites, it might influence the odds across multiple platforms. It's a nuanced process, but that's essentially how it functions.",

When you place a bet on one of these platforms, it can affect the overall liquidity and odds available on that platform, and potentially on other connected platforms and I think that is how it will work.",

I must say that I don't know if they are a non-Asian casino or if they are an Asian casino and I also don't know if you managed to create a stake account last year and if you did, how long did you use stake, because I saw one of your post from that year in the past when you asked in the stake.com ann thread if they accepted that if you were in Italy you could use the VPN or not, then or talk about my experience in stake taking into account that you don't have a stake accountbut in case you have a stake account but have stopped using it, I would advise you to start using it again, because at stake the odds are good, the designer is very good, at least for me he is very well organized and has many events sports, and they have good bonuses and promotions. They are quick to credit deposits and have very quick withdrawals and always without problems. I would say that they are a perfect casino, and a very old casino, has good support and has a good reputation. For me, I use casinos because they have higher odds and ignore other things like whether the casino is trustworthy or not, how many scam accusations against the casino there are and how many have been resolved, what is the level of customer satisfaction, how long withdrawals take, how kyc are done, ignoring all of this because of high odds is a very dangerous movementThe safety of our money in the casino must be a priority, and when I talk about the safety of our money in the casino I mean having access to our money quickly when withdrawing, but unfortunately many people ignore this because they are more focused on the bonus or at high odds. There is an example on this forum of a proven scam casino but as they have high odds, they have paid for a lot of advertising on the internet, so many people deposit and play at them and lose money and come to complain here on the forum. so my advice is to use reliable old casinos, as a priority",

There are a few that I know of, but they can only be accessed in China. There are some that are pushed by online influencers, though I do not trust these platforms at all. I'd rather play with Western platforms and do KYC than deposit my money into a platform that isn't even well-known in my region.",
