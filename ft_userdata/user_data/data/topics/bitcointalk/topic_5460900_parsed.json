  "content": "Hello everyone here at the Bitcointalk forum!Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to the creator of the Bitcointalk community. Long live the creator and this wonderful crypto forum!Now, let's get straight to the point. As the founder, CEO, and developer, I have been working on a crypto search engine called Bitfinder. Currently, it is still in the beta version and development mode. Therefore, I have decided to open up the platform to users for viewing and to seek support for Bitfinder. I firmly believe that without the crypto community, Bitfinder will not succeed.I am truly excited about Bitfinder as it represents a way to provide maximum exposure to the crypto space. Bitfinder aims to become the go-to search engine for all things related to cryptocurrencies, much like Google is for general search. I understand that some of you may have doubts about Bitfinder, but I assure you that we are embarking on an incredible journey. Our sole focus is on the crypto space, aiming to help numerous crypto tech companies achieve the highest quality traffic exposure through our search engine's advanced algorithm.At BitFinder, we have developed our very own crypto search crawler bot, eliminating the need for third-party search APIs in our operations. Certain Bitfinder APIs will be publicly available on Github.Currently, Bitfinder is undergoing development, and all users can access and explore it. We will provide daily updates on the progress and ensure transparency in our development process.Here are the services that Bitfinder will offer:Search Engine: Bitfinder will function as a search engine dedicated to crypto-related content.

This can be achieved through a reliable and credible team behind the project, along with a clear vision that extends into the next two decades, showcasing its long-term viability.Absolutely, you make a valid point. Combining a search engine with cryptocurrency isn't a completely new idea, and there have been past attempts that didn't quite meet expectations. However, I believe that with the right approach and demonstration of greatness, this venture can stand out and succeed because bitfinder is not using any 3rd party api search results.To build confidence in the project's potential, it's crucial to have a team that's not only reliable but also credible, with a track record of delivering results. Additionally, having a clear vision that spans into the next two decades will showcase the project's long-term viability and make it more appealing to potential investors and users.By focusing on these key elements, we can set ourselves apart and create something truly remarkable in the world of cryptocurrency and search engines. Let's work together to make it happen!I've developed my own API specifically designed to focus on crypto-related content not using any 3rd party Api like google, a few search engines calming to be a crypto search are infact using 3rd party algorithm. The API will display results based on a combination of our internal algorithm's page rank and other relevant variables. To ensure quality and accuracy, we'll also have a manual human moderation process.What makes the bitfinder project even more exciting is that we're aiming to combine elements of both centralized search engines and decentralized web 3 revenue sharing contracts. This way, we're creating an ecosystem where everyone involved in the crypto community can benefit and enjoy the benefits.I started this journey alone, I've been receiving a lot of help and support from other influential developers who share the same vision. I'm actively seeking to build a strong and powerful team with the help of the community, so we can achieve our goals together. It's truly an exciting journey, and I'm looking forward to what lies ahead!Bitfinder is not only just a search engine, we strive to create a crypto platform that will include more services other than search engine as we grow.",

Exciting times for Bitfinder! 🚀 Glad that you share the same vision as me.. Let me explain how the crawler bot works: it gathers relevant data from submitted websites and then compiles a database. This database becomes the source for potential search queries, offering accurate and relevant results. However, I must admit that the current system isn't flawless. We're aiming to enhance its capabilities through funding, which will allow us to improve the search algorithm over time.What truly distinguishes us from other search engines is our unwavering commitment to the project's mission. Our driving force is to build an exceptionally useful platform for everyone within the crypto ecosystem. We're dedicated to offering a wide range of services without compromising on quality, envisioning it as an all-in-one space for everything related to crypto.For a better understanding, here's a visual representation of our revenue sharing concept:To ensure transparency and fairness, we're in the process of creating a transparency page. On this page, you'll find detailed information about transactions associated with wallet addresses. This will provide a clear view of where funds were utilized and for what purposes.I invite you to also read the whitepaper https://bitfinder.io/bitfinder-whitepaper.pdf",

Additionally, the availability of .com domains for their second-level domains might be limited, further establishing .io as an ideal alternative domain choice. :-)However, I can assure you that we are determined to dominate the \"Bitfinder\" keyword.",
