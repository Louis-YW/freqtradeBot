In addition, by having integrations with multiple blockchains, NEAR developers can overcome concerns regarding single points of failure due to bottlenecks or other service disruptions.Pocket Network aims to accomplish 100% up-time for projects via a globally distributed network of over 47,000 full nodes that service Web3 applications across 46 blockchains. Pocket Network aims to bring about revenue generation opportunities for full-node operators by offering payments in its in-house token Pocket Network (POKT) for servicing traffic across the network. “It’s a win-win-win scenario for NEAR apps, NEAR nodes and the Pocket Network protocol,” noted Michael O’Rourke, co-founder and CEO of Pocket Network.With Pocket Network’s integration autonomously allocating bandwidth and relays, the NEAR ecosystem is expected to witness reduced friction when connecting decentralized applications (DApps) via Pocket Portal, a layer-2 product on top of the Pocket Network protocol. Speaking on the development, Cameron Dennis, head of ecosystems at NEAR Foundation statedInformation source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/near-developers-to-get-seamless-web3-app-deployment-with-pocket-network",
