  "content": "Hi, I have been using cryptocurrencies for about a year now where I usually do transactions from time to time in this period of time I have only used Bitcoin and Litecoin, I have seen quite a few people using Ethereum as well and I wanted to know what do you guys use to receive or send money with cryptos. I usually prefer to use Litecoin because it has almost no fees, in Bitcoin for small transactions of just a few dollars $5-$10 they can charge you up to $2 fees or a few months ago when it was broken they charged you $8 fees or more it was crazy, instead Litecoin does not charge you almost no fees and it is very comfortable to use although it is quite slow. And about Ethereum I have seen a lot of people using it but I don't know how the fees and speed are.Best regards!",

Over the last couple of months, the Bitcoin network is highly congested because brc20 tokens spam the network and users are ready to pay huge transactions making Bitcoin is not practical to use temporarily. LN is an option where you can send and receive BTC for pennies but its recommended only for advanced users.So if LTC works for you then better use it until the BTC network is back to normal.",

So right now its not worth using those networks for small transactions. On the other hand LTC is giving much lower gas prices for transactions, so i am surely going to use that network from those three. If i can i will use solana or ETH's Layer 2 network as those will have much lower transaction fees as well. But for long term holding bitcoin and ETH is the best choice till now.",

BTC, ETH is widely accepted and commonly used for transactions, although it has slower transaction times and higher fees than other currencies. However, LTC is known for its fast transaction times and low fees, making it a popular choice for transactions.

If you want to buy a coffee with BTC then i think you don't want to pay 20$ gas fees for 30$ worth of coffee. That is not worth it and LTC has been used in some online marketplaces but it is not as popular as bitcoin. Non-crypto guys might know about bitcoin and most of them are unaware of the existence of coins like litcoin, bitcoin cash etc. Stable coin is very popular in some countries where inflation is super high but it is still not that popular in the west where people have no reason to use the crypto version of their fiat currency.",

There's no need to lose a few dollars on a network with high fees when I can do the same with much lower costs on other networks and currencies. Indeed, Litecoin is suitable in terms of fee cost and transaction speed within its network, but not as slow as you mentioned. Mining a Litecoin block is faster than Bitcoin, taking only two and a half minutes to confirm a transaction. Also, the quickest and cheapest option is BNB, as the BSC network has minimal fees and a block time of no more than 5 seconds. Bitcoin and Ethereum can be used when the transaction amount is significant, as there is a slim chance of reducing transaction values and significant price volatility occurs, similar to other currencies.",

SOL has one of the cheapest transaction fees out there, but outside its ecosystem in the real world, it doesn't have that much acceptability. Even HBAR charges a fixed fees for all transactions, no matter how congested their network is. This type of model well fitted for daily transaction but you can not use it for that purpose because no one will accept it outside of an exchange.",

Using BTC now for transactions will be costing you a lot of fees and might be the same for ETH because sometimes fees there are also that much. For LTC, I've used it and it still has cheap fees at all.If there are other networks like the TRC20, matic sol, and many others. Wherever you can save fees, use them at this moment but eventually for the fees of Bitcoin, I think that they'll be very back soon for being cheap again.",

If you are talking about Ethereum so there is a problem with Ethereum network. First is there is a high fee sometimes. And gas fee change continuously means if the fee is 20Gwei at this time so after one minute this can jump to 40+. And you set the 20Gwei so you have to wait for 20Gwei if the gas price is up. So I will prefer that if you are using Litecoin so it is better.",

Although not spent all $100 but left my fund under $40 and risk when trading coins with Ethereum network not list yet on CEX exchange. Other coins have lower fees cost transaction is Solana coins and their CEX still lower cost under $0,1 every transaction, we need move our transaction or trading coins when ETH or BTC with higher cost fees and looking with other coins have lower cost fees to earn much profit without paying highest cost fees.",
