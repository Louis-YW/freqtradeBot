  "content": "There is much discussion and debate over how humans developed the capacity to become extremely skilled at making tools, leading to the development of big brain social dynamics.Some scientists claim the pack hierarchy of mammals coupled with the dyanamic social interactions it necessitates. Drove the evolution of primates, dogs and dolphins towards larger cubic area cognition in contrast to body size. Complex social interactions require the processing of greater volumes of data. Which leads the brains of pack animals towards gaining in mass over time. This trend could align with greater capacity for tool making. But of course there are other considerations. A larger brain size requires more energy. Which could allow for high energy warm blooded mammals to develop better in this area. In contrast to cold blooded reptiles who are more dependent upon temperature for energy generation.In the title, I claimed \"people are becoming smarter over time\".If it is true that pack animals developed larger brain sizes through the necessity of processing larger raw amounts of data in complex social interactions.It is possible people of today. Will develop larger brain sizes. Through the necessity of processing larger volumes of raw data. Found in daily advertisements, commercials and internet content. Our society being proliferate with scams forces us to engage in critical thinking. If the average person is exposed to more than 2,000 advertisements and commercials per day. That could give them 2,000 more opportunities to engage in critical thought and consider how many of those ads are scams. Than those in a pre electronic era had to consider.Degrees of hyper communication introduced by the digital era. Where people can not communicate using social media, email, phone texts and other avenues of communication. Could also hyper accelerate any brain gains that were originally made by an increase in pack based interactions.Processing greater amounts of raw data being a necessity in a modern world. It is possible that the trend will drive human evolution in a way that forces us to use our brains more. The long term effects of which could lead to modern people being better equipped to solve problems using raw cognition in contrast to our predecessors of past eras.This could result in people of the current era developing larger brains. Becoming smarter. Which might give us hope that we can better overcome some of the obstacles life throws at us.",

With Darwin's theory we could see the evolutionary progress of humans until it got to the missing link from where humans became bipedal. There so much to discuss on that actually but the point is to say that human is the most gifted and talented to dominate the world with all sorts of innovation and creation to be able to adapt and subdue her environment which ascribes man to culture and traditions based on her environment and here the theory of adaptation and natural selection referred to Spencer deserves some thought. After I found a place in the bible (in Daniel 12) making reference that at the end time, knowledge will increase, I then got some understanding that it was natural that the increase are seen in all human lives like socio-economics, politics, religion, agriculture , now blockchain technological growth is the new rave.",

They still can't calculate what every move will do but they can use minimax and other algorithms to determine what the best immediate move will be. We did still need the smaller computing chips for that but also better algorithms.

As long as information can be verified (/proven) and is interesting/useful to the prover in some way then it'll be beneficial and memorable for them as long as they know how to retain it and remember what was fact and what wasn't.Sadly, while most generic scams follow the same trends, some will always be outliers and innovative so there might be a long time before everyone understands and adapts to them (take the transition with crypto from ponzi schemes that relied on trust to signing airdrop tokens with malicious contracts to electrum's phishing attack).Quote from: Gyfts on September 09, 2022, 06:59:03 PMPeople are bound by their IQ, and IQ is purely genetic.

A segment of the brain is devoted towards motor cortex -- control of muscles. It is possible the motor cortex portion of the brain is shrinking as people become less physically active and athletic in their daily lives. But this does not mean that people are becoming less intelligent imo.The idea that people use only 15% to 25% of their brains is a quote out of context. Originally a researcher was famous for saying most people will only develop 15% to 25% of the full potential their brain is capable of. Somehow it was misquoted as people using only 15% to 25% of their brain, with the rest being unused.I think most believe they're better off not knowing things and not learning or improving themselves.

If the average person who lived 200 years ago, read 50 words per day.And the average person today reads 5,000 words per day on social media.Could it be considered an upgrade?The common claim is our pace of life having increased dramatically. If that claim holds true, it correlates with greater exposure to data and information. The content could be less relevant and fact based due to environmental differences. There are probably forces working for and against human intelligence in the current era. Just as in every era.If nothing else, can we say that ancient people not having access to basic books and reading materials. With only an oral story telling tradition to rely upon for content. Would definitely be exposed to far less data in contrast to the modern world where we have developing stories, news and information being constantly directed at us from a massive number of sources.",

People indeed need to process more information on daily basis now than they needed in the past. That doesn't mean people are more critical thinkers than they used to be, though, but I hope they largely are, especially because the world has never been such an educated place as it is right now. That being said, I too used to believe in human progress up until very recently. It was not because the events that happened were particularly out of place but rather because when they happened elsewhere, I didn't pay enough attention and didn't fully realize it. What I'm talking about if the Russo-Ukrainian war. If a country can still invade another to grab territories, if they can torture PoWs and civilians, almost completely destroy towns and cities, and YET the government and the troops of this country can maintain strong support within their country despite plenty of available evidence... If the rest of the world can weigh gas prices and utility bills over what now several countries recognize as genocide... I am not sure humanity is making progress and that there's hope in that. If after thousands of years of development and tons of terrible devastating wars and other things like the Holocaust people didn't finally figure out that terrible things must be prevented and that many things are completely unacceptable, have we really make ANY reasonable progress to be proud of? Technologically, maybe, but without moral progress, the technological progress poses a threat to become a weapon of greater destruction.",

If you want to enrich your brain, you also need to eat rich and healthy, but with food delivery apps and fastfood takeaways, I doubt they can achieve that. Not a lot of youngsters are also engaged in reading and making their mind work. Technology has become so advanced that it also breed a generation of lazy people that doesn't want to think, just Google. While there are still some percentage that wants to get into STEM programs, or those who just wants to finish their degree and pursue a relevant job in line with what they studied, it's still worrying that they are overwhelmed by the number of people who just wants to make it big on the internet and do nothing.

We might be developing larger brain sizes and all that, but the connections in the brain which are more important in memory retention and critical thinking skills might not be doing well.",

We've seen how, despite the ballooning population, food is more or less readily available thanks, again, to technological progress. Explorations and, therefore, discoveries in so many areas of life and even the universe are a world faster because of technologies. There must be a lot hope in all of this. Obstacles abound, however. But it would be another story.",

Which might give us hope that we can better overcome some of the obstacles life throws at us.It took thousands of years for the homo sapiens sapiens to develop a bigger brain. Evolution takes a long time.I actually think that internet makes us dumber, not smarter. The easier access to information makes our brains lazy. We don't properly analyze the tons of the information that we get online, which makes everything even worse.The amount of online scams doesn't develop our critical thinking. If less people were falling into online scams, the scammers would simply find new ways to scam. Living an unhealthy life makes us dumber, because the digestive system is really important for optimal cognitive function.Sitting in front of a computer for hours and using a smartphone 24/7 definitely doesn't seem healthy.",
