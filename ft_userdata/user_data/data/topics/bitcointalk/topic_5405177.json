      "body": "With all due respect to OP, who in their right mind would risk a whole block? this would make sense if there were no other solo mining pools which have been there for years and proven to be trustworthy, it's true that Cksolo charges 2% but 1% more fees is nothing compared to risking a whole block, there is another trusted pool with even lower fees than OP's pool that charges 0.5%.I am not trying to let you down if you are honest and not trying to scam, but why waste time and effort in making something that probably nobody is going to use? anyway, good luck",
