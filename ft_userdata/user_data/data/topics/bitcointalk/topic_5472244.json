Why would you hold fiat when their are assets that you can go for. You know everything about fiat and that makes it not a scam.",

The thing is fiat is a currency to be use for transactions and not to be hodl on to as an investment asset because of deflationary effects of it. Treat it as a currency that it’s suited for and look for better asset to use as investment tool and you wouldn’t address fiat as a Ponzi scheme",

Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk. But in many Ponzi schemes, the fraudsters do not invest the money.source: https://www.investor.gov/protect-your-investments/fraud/types-fraud/ponzi-scheme#According to the article the following list are the signs that the investment is more likely a Ponzi scheme:1. High returns with little or no risk2. Overly consistent returns3. Unregistered investments4. Unlicensed sellers5. Secretive, complex strategies6. Issues with paperwork7. Difficulty receiving paymentsSo from the definition, fiat is far from being a Ponzi scheme, Bitcoin is more likely nearer to the explanation but we all know that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi scheme.  The reason for this is that Bitcoin is in the open market free from any centralized authority that can control the trend of the Bitcoin price.",

Today the facts has changed and the solutions of the past are no longer valid for nowadays problems/needs. Fiat money could be used safely in the days of feudalism until the beginning of the victory of capitalism, but it is no longer valid today. this is what i think.Today we need to re-establish a new financial system that responds to the requirements of the times. Fiat money has been making successive failures since the late 18th century, and in fact we need to reconsider the entire global financial system, not just fiat money.In this context, various experiments appear, including Bitcoin.",

I think if you have different views or don't agree with the fiat money system, that's fine but it's too much to think that fiat money is a Ponzi scheme. However fiat money has a big role in human life and trade, if there was no fiat money then maybe we would still use gold and silver to trade and that is quite difficult to do, especially if we buy goods in large quantities then we need to carry a lot of gold , and it will be more troublesome than putting fiat money in the wallet",

Maybe Fiat really has similarities with Ponzi in other things, but in reality, it's not really. And we also know that Fiat is made through the central bank, where it can lead to inflation.  Ponzi is not that much like Fiat. In addition to this, Ponzi is not used by people to pay for the products or items they want to get; instead, fiat is used in situations like this. So if there are people who believe that Ponzi is also Fiat, it still remains an opinion or speculation.",

Fiat currency system has no characteristics of a Ponzi scheme. Early holders of fiat don't benefit from being early, in fact they lost the most. Someone who decided to put $1M into cash 50 years ago is a lot more today than if they put it into real estate or gold or nearly any other asset. The previous generations didn't benefit from fiat, they benefited from technological progress, post-WW2 rebuilding, urbanization and other things. Nowadays the living space is becoming more saturated, maybe even hitting its limits, and the previous economic growth rates of the boom period can't be repeated.",

Fiat was never like this in the past; the devaluation of Fiat was not as crazy as it is now, and the volume of printed money was not like it is then. So, because of the situation with Fiat now, we cannot still call it Ponzi. We are living in a world where you can exercise your freedom of choice. If you love Bitcoin, acquire it; if you love Fiat, acquire and save; if you like both, keep it, so long as it doesn't cause problems for you. That's what I think.Some countries don't allow the free use and adoption of Bitcoin, and if you find yourself in such a country but you want to invest in Bitcoin and you have means of doing so, as long as it won't cause you trouble, then go ahead. Some people also see Bitcoin as a Ponzi, but that doesn't mean that's what it is.",

To get money paying for first investors, it is easy but any Ponzi scheme has to rely on flow of money, inflow and outflow. If inflow is bigger than outflow, newcomers keep coming and spending money, the scheme will continue to work smoothly and operators can pay for late comers.Unfortunately, all Ponzi schemes will end with inflow break by that outflow will become bigger than inflow and the scheme will come to a point of collapse. The whole Ponzi system will collapse quickly at that time.There is no promised from anyone that you will get 10%, 20%, 50% APY with BTC, nobody pay you in any scheme so Bitcoin basically is not a Ponzi scheme but you must aware that some scammers will create their Ponzi schemes and add Bitcoin as one of their used assets for scam.",

Inflation itself is an economic phenomenon that is different from a Ponzi scheme, especially now and this looks like a Ponzi scheme.So, what must be noted for BTC is that there is no element of fraud.
