In addition to the founded Twitter account, this is our first marketing activity:https://opensea.io/collection/daddiesandcandiesI am even willing to send them for free if anyone is interested.Take this as an idea, and soon I will build up the volume to ignite a fire of awareness.I am working also on a dapp which will have many functions like lottery/draw, quiz, rankings of holders etc.",
