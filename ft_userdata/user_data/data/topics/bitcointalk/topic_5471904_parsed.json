Maybe 2 papers is good choice.The link above is not about translating the seed phrase but it is about if you want your seed phrase to be in other languages according to BIP39.I will advice you not to translate anything. The reason is because the word you are translating have synonyms and very possible there could be a mistake in the future in a way you may not be able to translate the language back to the original 12 to 24 words.And that is true, translator works online which is another reason it should not be used.Quote from: pawanjain on October 27, 2023, 04:26:00 PMIf we go by your method then it is even more better if we just encrypt the words using other algorithm and then keep those encrypted words at different places.Encrypting the seed phrase is another good advice.",

Maybe 2 papers is good choice.Google is not just tracking you because of your small funds, just knowing that you have Bitcoin is profitable information that can be shared or sold. These words can still be translated by anybody that has access to them. This process can be complicated and lead to loss of funds because the meaning of words changes over time. It could also pose a problem to your dependence in cases of death or sickness. Your funds might be lost forever if your dependence doesn't understand your security measures. The best options remain backing up your seed phrase in different locations and ensuring that no unauthorized person has access to it.",

During translation from different languages there some words that mean two or more meanings which when you try bringing them back to the original word will cause a change. Any complication of the seed phrase creates difficulties not only for potential attackers, but also for the owners of this seed phrase themselves. In this case, the problem is that the same words can have several interpretations in other languages and vice versa. This will create confusion.The emergence of confusion when translating words back is inevitable, because you definitely noticed that words in different languages have several translation options and this will create several unnecessary incorrect versions of seed phrases.Quote from: Zaguru12 on October 27, 2023, 04:14:20 PMStick to the words of BIP 39 and use passphrase to safeguard it more, if the seed gets exposed your passphrase acts as a second layer There are also some nuances with the passphrase: the length of the phrase and the presence of additional characters make it difficult to select this passphrase.",

Some words have synonyms, so translating it in your native language you might have problems remembering the correct word. I would try I explain this the best way I can. Taking a local language in my country as an example, let's say one of the 12 words is \"heart\". \"Heart\" could be translated to \"obi\" but \"obi\" also means \"hut\". So if I translate it to \"obi\", I might have problem remembering whether the correct word is \"heart\" or \"hut\" when I want import the seed phrase.",

Take a look at the illustration below, how easy it is to translate Seed Phrase in various languages that I created. Just write \"Translates to English ...... \" and you're done.It is possible that there will be some errors, but it is already close to the actual meaning of the translated Seed Phrase.",
