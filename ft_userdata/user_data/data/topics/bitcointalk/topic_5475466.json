The hacker used him to launder the stolen funds.Thus shows the conplex nature of the Nigerian society and further stress the fact that most of the people into politics are people with criminal records; when they make money through illegal ways, they enter into politics to protect themselves. No wonder they used money to corrupt the electioneering process. Assuming WIlfred won the governship election of Cross Rivers State, he would have been enjoying full immunity by now and would have used money to kill this case. This Patricia hack was so painful, because Patricia was a promising company that have gained so much popularity after their sponsorship of the BBNaija. This made their use base to grow exponentially,  bringing in many celebrities and influential people into Bitcoin. Unfortunately,  this ugly incident happened and brought a bad image to cryptocurrency, confirming the fears of many critics.

They control everything and always find a way around our security and legal system.",

To me all these dubious politicians that have always been involved in frauds and money laundry should be brought to book and face the penalty of their crimes. Like these set of people are the ones tarnishing our image to the international community thereby making everyone look suspicious and has hindered the growth of our country because whenever the genuine ones are sorting for solution from the western countries they will feel that we want to use that avenue to defraud them thereby they might not really give us the benefit of doubt that we ain't really the way they paint us. Corruption needs to end now or else corruption might end the country. And these are the set of people that will never allow anything good to come to the people instead they will kick against it.",

Smart because he or they were able to notice the security loophole in Patricia infrastructure and took advantage of it, dumb because they used someone who is a public figure to launder the money.Well my happiness from this all is that Patricia's clients gets their funds back. I can imagine them withdrawing it at the speed of light. How can they get the trust and confidence of the Nigerian populace. This is going to be a hard one for them.",

The issue here is people will still store their crypto on other platforms, we will still be hearing news like this and the more the adoption rate increases the high rate of scammers will also increase.One thing have observe in the crypto world, as bitcoin continues to grow the more we hear new platforms showing concern about crypto, people talking about bitcoin and some people will share their crypto information unknownly to them, what am trying to say is not all platforms we should invest our crypto or store our coins.",

Most Nigerians are not even using exchanges that are in Nigeria, most Nigerians make use of foreign exchanges.Secondly, if the license of the exchanges that are hacked should be revoked, most known exchanges like Binance, OKX, Kucoin and most other exchanges licences should have been revoked because most exchanges have been hacked.Recently Poloniex and HTX (formerly known as Huobi global) were hacked. HTX was hack two times this year. Most well known exchanges that were hacked since 2020 were able to reopen after short period of time and refund their customers. I can blame Patricia because it has been long before the exchange open withdraw, and not yet to all his customers.But I know that if truly Patricia has paid all his customers, it would be declared in the public.",

I’m not trying to take sides but speaking from my experience as a gift card trader over some time now, I’ve noticed that most of the third party cards bought from the stores are mostly corrupted especially the steam cards and if in any case, your card gets marked as used without anyone using it, then it shouldn’t be a course for alarm as it must have been corrupted after activation without anyone actually using it and most times there are the google informative cards which can’t be redeemed by a third party and if maybe you aren’t satisfied with the response from Patricia, you can maybe track were your card was redeemed from the card providers official website.It has already taken Patricia so long to refund their customers funds to them and I thought they were supposed to refund every penny of their customers funds to them before been cleared of any charges",
