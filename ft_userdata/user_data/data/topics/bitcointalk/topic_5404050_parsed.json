      "body": "If you look at the evolution of digital currencies, Bitcoin is the only right candidate for future finance. In this case, I'm pretty sure that fiat is losing value due to non-renewable inflation. But will the world's governments and central banks hand that power into decentralized hands? leave it running unattended? that's where I still can't be 100% for the next 5 to 10 years. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is becoming increasingly scarce and its limited supply is increasingly demonstrating the resilience of its value that cannot be ignored.",

      "body": "I would guess that bitcoin will probably not have that type of power, because those three currencies mainly became the world currency because of the power behind it, not because of the currency itself being valuable. Spain had that type of army and navy, then british had that type of navy and army and peak capitalism by conquering everywhere. Nowadays USA has the same thing, they go attack and kill people all around the world and they force the whole world to use it \"or else\" and thats about it. So bitcoin doesn't have that, would it be the first one to actually become a big currency, a world wide dominance, by just the volunteerily used by the people? Maybe, not impossible but it is quite unlikely and I would bet against that.",

The greatest thing to have ever occurred in the history of bitcoin since its creation will be that. Countries like China do not truly appreciate the USD enough to rely on it or hold it in high esteem as a reserve currency. Because of the nature of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin—which defy institutional control—China also outlawed them. They would have preferred to adopt it, but their opposition to its nature prevents that.",

We're about to enter the fourth one, Bitcoin.It will take some time, but it will happen.Why not think of it this way, Bitcoin is already a world currency because Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet, and since there are two worlds linked together which are the physical world and the Internet world which are connected and have given birth to the global village called the Internet. Bitcoin being the modern world currency, The old traditional world gave birth to those currencies such as USD and pounds but time has moved beyond that and attention has shifted to a more realistic and statistical/digitalized currency which is Bitcoin. let's just take it this way the industrial age gave birth to the traditional financial system, and the Internet gave birth to blockchain/Bitcoin. So specifically speaking Bitcoin does not need further acceptance than what it has witnessed already and there is no need for further validation. The future will just get used to the fact that we only have one currency which is Bitcoin which gives them control over their financial life and the freedom to use their money whichever way they want without a third party, Being able to send and receive money via the Internet without the bank.",

This would require significant restructuring of the global financial system and by the time it happens, bitcoin will probably be dust. Maybe Yuan can?",

Countries shifting to bitcoin means something bad has happened economically that pushed us to convert to bitcoin as our main currency. I'm not a fan of fiat, but us having a standard to work with means everything is working as intended, although the system really needs some tweaks in order to not get those huge blows every so often that causes the whole world economy to collapse. I'm very much okay with bitcoin existing side by side with fiat, but if bitcoin is the only option that remains, then you know that everything else failed for our economies.",

At this point, the major reason why btc is not yet adopted as a global currency is the government constant rejection, and I believe this also why the developing countries are not warming up to the idea. Government have huge influence on actions of people people over their. And perhaps majority don't understand btc enough to ignore most of the things they are being told.

Yes one of its biggest challenge is government regulations or interference. But another big challenge would be infrastructural deficit in developing nations. Most countries lack access to internet and other basic facilities that facilitates the adoption and transactions of Bitcoin. Illiteracy and poverty would be another impediment that would slow down the dominance of Bitcoin. Fiat is very easy to handle which makes it more acceptable to less educated people but Bitcoin transactions would scare some of them away. Most people in developing nations cannot even two balanced meal per day, how would such persons afford to buy a smartphone?",

And it only makes sense like that for them, developed countries are trying to dominate the world by improving their fiat and economy, and accepting an alternative might not help them.But look at underdeveloped countries like El Salvador and CAR, these countries already have a bad economy and they aren't really in any competition with any other country, so they can look for alternatives like bitcoin and see if they can make something out of it. El Salvador have invested heavily in bitcoin and are expecting to make profits in the long run for the benefit of their economy, this is something that a first world country like China, U.S.A, Britain etc, will never do.",

US wont want to lose the top spot even it if means inflating the dollar and then tweaking the FOREX rate of yuan to look like china is less each time. these next 5 years will be interesting though. in the end it wont matter if its UK, US china or some syndicate of numerous nations using a whole new metric. bitcoin wil remain as a extra option away from that game",
