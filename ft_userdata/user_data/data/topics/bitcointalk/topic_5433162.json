      "body": "At least we expect you to explain a bit the kind of error you recieved so that anyone can help you with what could be wrong whether it's from your end or something else. If you are using mobile electrum just like the android version the you may likely have one or two difficulties using the app because I think the wallet is not that user friendly with mobile version. I have seen few complaints on Android Play Store from users which I know the desktop version could be the best. In case your complain is not similar to this then make sure you stay safe.",

Even if OP has set the fee rate to 1 sat/vbyte, the transaction should be broadcasted, unless there's another problem. The network isn't busy now and all full nodes should have the minimum relay fee set to 1 sat/vbyte.",

If the color is green --then, you are connected. Click the green color and you will find out which server you are connected.It looks like this --otherwise please be more specific about your question.If your problem won't be solved, uninstall it and download a new updated one and make sure you are on the right official website which is secure downloading. [ https://electrum.org/#download ] and don't forget to verify before downloading.",

The old version lower than 3.3.4 is no longer have any connection so if you are currently using the old version start downloading the latest version from electrum.org and make sure to verify it to avoid installing fake Electrum.Or if you are using the latest version but it still has server error when sending BTC would you mind trying reinstalling your Electrum? Make sure before you reinstall Electrum verify the installer first and don't forget to make a backup of your wallet seed phrase or wallet file for future recovery if anything goes wrong.",
