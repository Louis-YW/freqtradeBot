Against a backdrop of a mounting number of cases, the SEC is reportedly finding it challenging to hire experts in the field of crypto. The agency statutes require professionals to sell their crypto assets to work for the agency.\"___Good news",

Most experts are young and prefer jobs that allow them more freedom than government work, which is suitable for those who want to prepare plans for retirement, are all reasons that will make finding such experts very difficult. The price of Bitcoin will rise during the next 18 months. If I want a job that forces me to sell what I own, I would prefer to apply for it in 18 months and not now.",

I can explain this to you using the example of a large Russian company such as Sberbank. If you work with Sberbank, this does not mean that you will have information for trading shares of this company on the stock exchange. You will perform a certain part of the work and sign a non-disclosure agreement. And your knowledge will not help you speculate in the market. Therefore, in order to gain access to significant information, you will have to work for a very long time and apply for a high position in the company. But once you achieve this, you won't have to break the law for profit. You will have enough money anyway.",
