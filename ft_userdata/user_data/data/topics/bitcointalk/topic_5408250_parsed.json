So, I decided to share it with you.- They ask their investors to lock their money for 720 days and in return and give unreal profits even more than 100 percent which is not legit according to (https://www.stakingrewards.com/staking/)- They offer an 8 percent referral commission which is too good to be true.- They changed the domain address many times, last time they changed from icbtoker.com to Icbroker.io- According to this link (https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/international-chamber-broker) they provided fake documents to their clients.Using a cheap 'dashlite' panel can be another sign.

Honestly, this should be enough to consider that someone a scammer. That's what I would do. If you are asked to invest in something from people you don't know (or even from people you do know) and they are offering you an unreasonably good deal, most of the time it's a scam waiting to happen. Why would they contact your friend? What's so special about him/her?How did they even find your friend in the first place?If the platform is so good, people would stand in line throwing at them their investments, and they wouldn't need to go around and ask people for money.",

If you are asked to invest in something from people you don't know (or even from people you do know) and they are offering you an unreasonably good deal, most of the time it's a scam waiting to happen. I would say nearly always!Unless the guy sends you a referral link for which he gets paid a share or a fixed sum then there is zero incentive for somebody to pick up strangers all day on the internet other than scamming themQuote from: Leviathan.007 on July 31, 2022, 08:14:50 PMToday one of my friends told me someone invited her in person to join and invest on some platform and asked me to have a review.Well, this is a new one, usually it's men who get invited by women to invest, seems like sexism is done for even in the scam business",
