I don't know about you guys though, but is this really going to be possible in making our private keys safe when storing it on dental implants?What would be the pros and cons of this one? Would love to hear your reactions, feedback or opinion about this one guys. Thanks!",

Upgrade00 also has a great point that because it cannot be done alone, you're surely risking not just yourself but also your private keys to someone else since they are gonna be the one to do the work. Even if I have a trusted relative that can do the engraving, I would not even budge it.",

      "body": "I must be sincere with you, this is the most ridiculous thing, or should I call it idea, I've heard on the discussion of how to safely store our private keys/seed phrases.I personally would never try this even if it becomes one of the means through which private keys/seed phrases can be stored , and I do not encourage any one to.Quote from: cheezcarls on September 06, 2022, 06:23:23 PMWhat would be the pros and cons of this one? Like Upgrade00 said, I also see no pros here, all I see is cons, and I will mention just three. 1. (inline with what Upgrade00 said) Your private keys/seed phrase is no longer private since you will have no choice but to expose it to a second party who will do the engraving, and possibly to a third party too, who will do the implant ~ and remember the saying that... A secret known by two or three persons is no longer a secret.2. It puts your life in danger - those who know you have such a thing planted in you can plot against you, they can have you drugged or even killed, just to steal your gold teeth.3. It will lead you into being restless and always anxious - imagine you are asleep, and someone, touches your cheek (it can be your wife, daughter or son patting your cheek) and you quickly jump up from your sleep thinking someone wants to remove/steal your gold teeth - yeah, it is absolutely possible.There are several other disadvantages of doing this, I just mentioned 3, I leave the rest for other users to dig out.",

      "body": "Quite an unusual way to store private keys and also not practical unless you are a dentist yourself. Otherwise, you are at risk of compromising your keys at the time of implant placement, as this will be done by specialists. Also, if bitcoin private keys is suddenly needed, then what to do in this case? Going to dentists again and creating another risk of compromise? It seems to me that this method of storing keys is very uncomfortable, in view of the fact that you can't put/extract key's info yourself without the extra help of specialized specialists. This is the biggest drawback.",

IMO, there's no need to complicate things such as implanting your private keys to your tooth and having it inside your mouth just to keep it.I find it weird and I agree to Upgrade that writing it down has always been proved to be one of the most effective way of keeping our pks and writing as well it with many back ups.",

Better to store up your keys which wont really be part or hidden inside your body even into your teeth.There's much risk if ever someone do knows on where you are hiding your keys or someonehad been informed or able to know which would really be putting yourself into trouble or danger.Nothing beats out if you do store up your coins on a non custodial wallet which its keys neitherbeen written on a piece of paper or on hard drive or even on an usb which had been kept on safe place rather than on having those always beside you which it wouldnt really be thatcomfortable for you to have most of the time.I wouldnt really be that too confident on having so.",

There are too many what if, on this method of storing your private key which I think, it's too paranoid IMO. You can implant it anywhere in your body but make sure don't risk your health by just storing your private key, I remember this when I saw a short video clip regarding a man who implants the key chip on his car in his hand.",

To print or place the private keys within the implant you need the support of the dentist or a dental technician who make the implant.

This backup is hard to restore, you'd have to visit a dentist and there's a risk that it will fail because it will get damaged during removal or it will degrade naturally.The idea of carrying your coins literally in your body is interesting though, but I don't think that it is necessary for most people. It could be useful for spies, people on the run, nomads and others who don't have a stable and reliable shelter and are constantly under risk of losing their possessions.

The whole thing starts with the wrong premise, unlike what the author claims gold was never used as a store of value in teeth, gold was used because of its properties, it's totally noncorrosive and malleable, and some do use it as a sign of wealth but never as storage. Besides a golden teeth crown is just a few grams even with your full mouth full of gold the entire weight won't be more than 100 grams, it's actually hilarious do you think you could chew with gold teeth weighing half a kilo? So in the best scenario, you would have about $4000 there, in most of Europe the procedure to get those will cost you triple that. No, we're debating something that never happened.",
