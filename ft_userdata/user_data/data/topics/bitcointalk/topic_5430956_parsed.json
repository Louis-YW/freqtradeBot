Several betting platforms such as stake and sportsbet.io has been pretty generous in giving out good lines and great odds for most of the esports games present in there. If you want to start betting, you also have to start watching some of the games that are highly popular in the esports betting scene (CS:GO, League, Dota 2) and from there you can draw your interest and perhaps choose which one you would like to focus on.",

Also, I did used fiat based digital currency on picklebet which I somehow regret last year 'coz there were some delays with the payments and withdrawals maybe because of 'traffic' on servers. Thus, I think it would be an advantage to use cryptobetting platforms on esports betting and you may choose from the suggestions of users in this topic.",

We're not just gamers but we're also bettors and those that have a passion for gaming, it's the same as betting on the same thing.With Duelbits, there are a lot of esports that are listed on their bookie, coming from Dota 2, CSGO, Valorant, R6, Warcraft 3 and other esports games that you have the same interest.",

But I haven't made any fortune From it and in future i might try something better like e-sports tournaments. Cause here these Casino have very less chances of scam also. There are many websites but I used only Bitsler website and that's why I am telling thus.",

Match game is the most worth and have higher chance win rather than other game, why match game have a higher chance win?Because you know the performance and other things about the team it self, off-course if you have the data can analyze. But, If you just blindly folded betting then just the same like regular gambling while you're chasing with luck only without data to increase your chance winning.",

And what are the best places for that?For me, it's worth it overall since I enjoy watching the competitive leagues most of the time but when it comes to making money it can be a hit or miss as it's only good when there are promotions offered on top of it similar to how most sportsbooks offered some good promotions in the world cup.The bookies that i'd recommend would also be Sportsbet, Stake and 500casino. Sportsbet would be at the top since they now have two odds providers for esports. Then Stake and 500casino for the esports promotion as they don't always have the widest range of markets available but their promos are some of the best though.",

I reckon most famous sportsbooks have eSports on their categories anw, so you can check whichever one you usually choose (and if none, go to sportsbet). As for why eSports, well, it's mostly a subjective bias since I've grown up playing those games. I reckon people who've grown up playing sports like say, basketball or football (or at least grew up watching those) would also answer the same. Defining it as \"worth it\" is kind of hard really, it's just like any average sport out there, just that it's, well, on a video game platform. Not to say there's no skill no, games accepted as eSports titles are ones that heavily require on skill, both mechanically and strategically.",
