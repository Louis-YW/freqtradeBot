      "body": "Are you talking just about NHL, or whole hockey around the world in general? IIRC, there was several topics about NHL, but eventually it become dead. I also made topics about several recent IIHF World Championships, but it didn't got much interest. So, it's obvious that we don't have many hockey lovers here.I don't really follow what's happening in NHL, only starting paying some interest when playoffs begin. But can't remember when I watched whole game from start till the end. I more follow main leagues in Europe like Swedish SHL or Swiss National League, sometimes make bets on it.",

Hockey is also played on the grass (we call it turf in hockey language). These days the most popular form of hockey that is played on artificial turf. To know more about it and the tournament itself, you can study the Men's FIH Hockey World Cup.Anyways i did not see anyone discussing hockey here on bitcointalk but let's see if there are hockey fans with us who get active on this thread  Does anyone know which International hockey matches are currently in progress?",

Tonight we have a lot of NHL games and it seems this is another season for my Avalanche team to have a good run and maybe this year they will win Stanley Cup. ( a fan can only hope )I will also make a simple betting ticket on NHL with following teams : Red wings to WIN , Avalanche to WIN and Sharks to score 2 goals ( because they really need it for their morale at least ).",

      "body": "Anyone want to discuss about the tragic death of Adam Johnson? He was representing Nottingham Panthers in Elite Ice Hockey League (the first tier hockey league in United Kingdom). On 28th October, during a match against Sheffield Steelers, he suffered a freak accident in which he suffered a slash to his neck by skate. Matt Petgrave of Sheffield Steelers was responsible for the accident and from the video, it looks like Petgrave deliberately kicked Johnson's neck with the blade of his skate. Johnson was just 29 years old. Neck guard has been made mandatory in all EIHL matches after this incident. Video: https://twitter.com/EndWokeness/status/1718859769962693064/video/1",

      "body": "There are two types of hockey sports but both are not very popular in almost all countries, both are ice hockey and field hockey but the easiest one to find is field hockey because the way to play is easier and doesn't require so many special coaches if it just for fun playing around.As for the World Hockey Championship itself I don't know whether it is still being participated in by many countries or not because many people are no longer interested in hockey even for athletes hockey is no longer of interest to teenagers.Ice hockey was first introduced and was quite popular in Europe but as time progressed this sport began to lag behind and most people preferred to football which became the sport with the greatest popularity.Currently only Canada has made hockey their country national sport and there we can find quite a lot of special schools for every hockey athlete.Apart from Canada I don't know about it because this sport is not well known in the country I live in, maybe we can have deeper discussion here about the sport of hockey.",

      "body": "Well I have to update here,as I have been losing massively in these sport bets as I try something like over 2.5 goals or over 1.5 goals for a specific team which has a relatively low odd and my bad I think is that I love to parlay many games together in a ticket to get odds of well over 10 which so far as I said has brought massive loses to me financially speaking,so taking a break from betting here.From a side note I love to watch ice hockey from time to time as despite they play on ice field things can boil pretty quickly here between the players  .",
