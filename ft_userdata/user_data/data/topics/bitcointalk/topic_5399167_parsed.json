Let's take the example of plagiarism that is common on the forum, so let's say that someone who doesn't appropriate other people's merits or things in real life won't do it on the forum either - everyone can act to some extent, but you can never escape what you really are. Also, the rules about death threats or phishing/malware links are something you don't need to learn unless you're a really bad person in real life.Quote from: Cryptomultiplier on May 18, 2022, 09:38:46 AMAlso, with engaging posts raking in merits, joining a campaign and earning, how does one even begin to rank up with as little as, or no experience as regard bitcoin or related crypto topics? What is expected of a newbie aspiring to learn, earn and impact with knowledge and investment?If I tell you that I joined the first paid signature campaign only when I became a Full Member, will it mean anything to you? It takes time for you to learn something and be able to progress, therefore it is completely unnecessary to put pressure on yourself when it comes to merits or signature campaigns. All you need is time and determination, there is no magic formula.",

You don't need to create many posts, since you're a newbie then you need to read more than comment. Not mean to forbid you to discuss whenever you like with the subject, but I believe reading other users posts is better than join into the discussion.",

Knowledge just depends on how much you want to learn and keep your consistency to keep reading and reading. In fact, someone who is knowledgeable sometimes does not talk much but prefers to act and that is a positive impact of learning outcomes.In forums, you can contribute and share knowledge with hundreds to thousands of other users. That's great for you and will probably make you better at interacting and understanding anything that might not have been right before.

Nobody started a professional or knowledgeable in crypto, some learnt about crypto outside this forum, while some others became knowledgeable when they joined this forum. As you have mentioned that you possess little experience and knowledge on bitcoins and crypto, you have to prepare yourself to learn and develop the discipline to subject yourself to reading both on and off forum materials. One thing is sure, the forum is here to keep your enthusiasm fresh, the other part is yours to play. The more you gain knowledge, the better your contributions will become and most definitely merits will follow for your input. You are in a good place to learn OP, take good advantage of it.",

I don't know exactly if the OP is a native English speaker, but maybe that's the reason why some people choose reading over watching videos, and I am one of them.Sometimes some knowledge discussed in the local language is helpful, it can also be considered by those who don't understand English well.

We are a community that holds its rules at high esteem and that has been the core to preservation of the forum.You seem to have understood the steps and procedures of the forum but, I'll like to point out one truth. That the singular need to impress or make merit raking post as you call it often turns produce nothing. The forum is one that doesn't need you to be over experienced as a beginner. If you are,it's good but more than anything, they need to refine your ideas and teach to you what could be seen as thee pros and cons of cryptos. You just have to be ready to learn and improve, it would serve you better than forcing merit raking post on yourself. Asking intelligent questions can function  in that capacity of merit raking too.",

First, understand that good things don't come easily, you work for it, and what is the work required of you in this forum? That's knowledge. You need knowledge to be of value in this forum, and to acquire knowledge, you need to research and study, read and learn, you need to have knowledge of every topic of discussion here to be able to contribute meaningfully to the discussion, this is how you gain value on this forum. QuoteAlso, with engaging posts raking in merits, joining a campaign and earning, how does one even begin to rank up with as little as, or no experience as regard bitcoin or related crypto topics? Does a company employ you when you have absolutely no knowledge or experience of what they do there?, the answer is NO, so how then do you think a crypto company will hire you in a crypto forum when you have no knowledge of bitcoin/crypto?. To rank up, first, you need merit, as well as activity. And to get merit, you need to make valuable contributions to the forum. Join a campaign and earning on this forum is also like the first, you  need merit, and to get merits, you need to make valuable contributions to the forum.  QuoteWhat is expected of a newbie aspiring to learn, earn and impact with knowledge and investment?Knowledge is expected of you, valuable contributions through your knowledge is expected of you, and you are expected to research, learn, unlearn and learn again, you need experience to get proper knowledge.",
