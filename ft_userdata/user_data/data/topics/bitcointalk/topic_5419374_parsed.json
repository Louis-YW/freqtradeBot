I only find instructions on how to get such a database myself. Bitcoin Core predicted that it would take 55 hours to download the database, which is certainly a lot, so I'd like to ask if you know any repositories where they put the latest UTXO databases received?",

I'm interested in a database that has up-to-date information. I'm not chasing constant updates. If it has information from a week ago, that's fine with me.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on November 04, 2022, 10:18:36 AMBased on your description, do you actually mean synced Bitcoin Core directory? If so, someone upload pruned version of Bitcoin Core directory at https://prunednode.today/.I thought that's what I needed. I don't know much about Bitcoin, but if I understood correctly, there are no old wallets in this file. Long story short, I could not find this wallet 1ANUrCXvHsPUbdcSdYgkyCG9bgEQfbqYRG . It now has 0.0045 BTC. Judging by the description, it is a trimmed DB. It doesn't work for me. I need wallets for all time.Quote from: PawGo on November 04, 2022, 11:41:24 AMMaybe look there: http://blockdata.loyce.club/ (more details: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5307550.0)Depending on the connection speed (and your computer, especially if you have SSD or slow HDD) it may take less than 55h, I think 24h is realistic scenario.Not exactly. There is a database with transactions. I don't need transactions. Everything else is bigger. I need addresses and the number of coins on them. If it is possible, only addresses that have some number of coins.

I read a shitload of questions on bitcoin.stackexchange.com, where they only advised me to build UXTO myself, and then to get this table from there. I understood that there must be this table somewhere, but all the ways led me to the fact that I need to get UXTO. I ended up asking the question here, with the goal of finding a ready-made UXTO, and it turned out that the DB I needed was already there. THANK YOU!",

THANK YOU!There's a difference though: the List of all Bitcoin addresses with a balance shows the total balance of each address. If you would parse all UTXOs, you'd get each individual input on each address (many addresses received multiple transactions). If all you need is the balance, the above link is enough.If there's a demand for daily (or even more frequent) UTXOs lists, I could setup a script to parse them myself from Bitcoin Core. I think the output will be around 4 GB.",
