If you would have posted this thread in B/H it would have been better of than here. That not withstanding, facebook has misplaced their reputation. How can someone open account within 2 days the person has been hacked by someone else or disable or blocked by facebook team. Like me now, I open facebook account last week. Within last to this week i have disabled by facebook team for more 5 times. All because I add friends as a newbie in facebook. Facebook is unsecure number one social media platform. facebook only suffer innocent users not the real criminals. To used facebook now as for me is a waste of time.",

Because until now Facebook can still be opened by everyone, even though its users may have started to decrease a little because there are many other social media that have more benefits than Facebook.So I won't be surprised by the reasons you mentioned because I'm not an active Facebook user either.",

      "body": "I haven't used Facebook in a long time, although I still have the account. It serves for example to get in touch with people you haven't heard from for a long time. But their numbers are down:Facebook's user numbers shrunk for the first time in its history.Younger people use Instagram, although you can have both accounts linked.I think the move to buy other companies like Instagram and Whatsapp is also a way to diversify in the face of the danger that in the long term Facebook will lose many users or end up disappearing.",

Also, I have not used FB as a personal medium, but I still have to agree that it is still more popular regardless of social background today . And whether they are losing users more and more or have other orientations related to it, it is too macroscopic that I can't know yet. However, if one day, maybe this never happens, it will still be a good tool for people to use and connect with each other.",
