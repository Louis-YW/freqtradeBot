What do you Think? Only the earliest becomes profitable with any new trend that's being set to the market. Yeah, as of now, those are the AI coins but I don't still think that this is the right time for people to look at it as something profitable. Who knows what may happen during the bull run if the majority of them are going to be profitable.Quote from: Tahid12 on August 25, 2023, 10:13:26 PMTime to invest AI coins or you avoid?I am avoiding, although I know that it can be profitable for these trend setters. But I've got my own focus and that's to buy Bitcoin and other few known altcoins that I know that can be a good choice to hold. If you think that you'll be good holding these AI coins and you're optimistic with them, not all of them will be.",

AGIX is one of the coins that I follow and it's going downhill since start. They all are in decline and I don't know how they will survive.AI is an area worth investing in, but finding the right project is very difficult. I'm not sure if there is a coin in the crypto world that doesn't just use the name AI, but really does something worthwhile. There is no doubt that there is a big cake in this area. The problem is to find the right project and stay away from scams.",

There's always room for it. Even dogecoin, for every bull run, you can really make a good profit, dogecoin is always here to stay compared to other altcoins or meme coins which just only once will go parabolic run will be gone after.",

The time is almost right that AI becomes a keyword that causes a lot of attention, not only crypto but many other fields also show great interest in AI. I also believe it will become a big trend in the future, and as we observe in this market, in hype there are a lot of active projects but then only a few are able to maintain their activity and performance long-term development.",

What do you Think? AI coins are not in trend anymore. The hype has already gone since last months. It's caused by the scammers were destroying the market. Scammers were plague in the crypto. I don't even think AI coin will become a good investment. We dont actually need a lot of AI coins. Some were enough, but this time we have so many ai tokens in the market. I remind you that most of ai coins projects are still experimental project. Even some didnt even know how to develop AI properly. You must be careful caused by there was a lot of traps now in the crypto. Quote from: Tahid12 on August 25, 2023, 10:13:26 PMTime to invest AI coins or you avoid?I just avoid to invest in the token when we have not entered into the bullmarket. I meant it doesn't even matter what kind of that coin is as long as you bought in red and sell in green, you is still fine. I remind you that if anyone is not even caring what kind of coin it is as long as they can get decent profits from their investment.",

What do you Think? Time to invest AI coins or you avoid?You said yourself that it is all about the trend, and once the trend is over, the tokens or coins will most likely stop performing on the charts. So, I believe those who like riding the waves, taking risks by investing in coins and tokens that are hyped because the technology behind them is trending, they should obviously go for it, but they should remember that it is all too risky since if the trend gets over soon, you might see the coins coming face down.However, some of them might actually be good and their projects might be offering something useful to the community. Such cryptocurrencies generally tend to stay in the market for quite a long time until their teams stop showing interest in their projects and then their downfall begins.",

If you keep thinking that the price will go up for the AI and it doesn't, you will be upset. This is why wait until the bull run and you are going to make a bigger profit from it that way.Trends are not guaranteed things, you are not going to get whatever trend it is right now, carrying over to that period, you need to end up having some sort of situation that would be different in the end. I believe it will be a bit different on the long run and AI will not be as popular, still be a good thing, but not hyped as much when the bull run comes in.",

They are hot products these days and good for short term investment.  Well, I wouldn't compare some of the AI coins that we have in the industry with meme coins or shitcoins that are created out of nowhere without any team or any project or anything to offer to the community other than the promises of potentially high returns on investments which barely happens with every one of them. Some AI coins are actually good and they have been created to serve some purpose and have good projects and teams backing them up.However, I agree with what you say about everything that starts trending people start creating cryptocurrencies using their name hoping that the tokens will also get some hype and they can earn a lot of money once people start buying their tokens through any decentralized exchange or sometimes through the websites they create for their token sales.",

There is no AI coin that I can trust and invest.There’s no rush to adopt AI projects as they are still in the development period and yes there’s no good project right now to invest with, most of them are just riding the hype and will turn into a scam later on. AI might be the new trend now but if you really want to be more safe then do your research before investing. AI can be a big help to many projects too, and I’d hope that they will maximize the opportunity to have this option in the market, we should be open for this kind of development.",

There are so many Alts out there that are well established and available at discounted rate at the moment. Better go for them rather then risking your money for something that is very new and entered crypto only because its a buzz word. I don't think investing in AI based coins is good idea as its not related to Fintech. Its now become a norm that anything that is popular has a crypto token.",
