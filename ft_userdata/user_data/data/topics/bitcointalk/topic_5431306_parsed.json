Rodney Davis, Jim Banks, Troy Nehls, Jim Jordan and Kelly Armstrong, covers the results of months of investigation surrounding the events of Jan. 6, which the Democrat-led J6 Committee failed to conduct, Just the News reports.\"Leadership and law enforcement failures within the U.S. Capitol left the complex vulnerable on January 6, 2021. The Democrat-led investigation in the House of Representatives, however, has disregarded those institutional failings that exposed the Capitol to violence that day,\" concludes the GOP report, which also highlighted that Capitol Police began receiving specific warnings in December over potentially significant violence planned against the Capitol and lawmakers by angry protesters who planned to contest the certification of the 2020 election results.\"Prior to that day, the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) had obtained sufficient information from an array of channels to anticipate and prepare for the violence that occurred,\" reads the report. \"On January 6, 2021, criminal rioters assaulted police officers, broke into the U.S. Capitol, damaged property, and temporarily interfered with the certification of states' presidential and vice presidential electors at the Joint Session of Congress—a typically pro forma event.\"...",

The point was the safety of the Capitol.Pelosi was asked by members of Congress and others, to authorize strengthening of Capitol security. She wouldn't do it. By not doing it, she essentially had a role in the Jan. 6 rioting. She should be on trial with the other rioters... as one of the leaders, and the perpetrator.If she had strengthened Capitol security as she was asked, the whole riot would have broken down before it got started. And there wouldn't even be any accusation against Trump. Since she wanted an excuse to accuse Trump (even though he didn't have anything to do with it), she kept the security lax, so that anybody could have done the rioting.",

Three other Oath Keepers were also convicted of that and other lesser offenses. The 63-year-old Army veteran's defense attorney, Matthew Peed, said he plans to appeal.\"Ed brought 30 days of food with him, not just for himself but for a group, and he believed he was going to a campground where he would set up a food kitchen and cook for protesters,\" Peed defended Vallejo's role during opening statements. \"And it would be kind of a, kind of like a festival.\"Vallejo worked security for Donald Trump associate Roger Stone on the day before January 6, at the Rally to Save America at Freedom Plaza. He and other Oath Keepers paid for four rooms at Comfort Inn in Arlington, Virginia, and Vallejo never left the hotel during January 6. Vallejo, who works as an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor in his free time, was not arrested until a year after January 6. Peed said he never took any action, and he thought he was merely supporting peaceful protesters. Vallejo did not go to the Capitol or deliver weapons there. He brought 200 pounds of food and supplies, intending to cook for those participating in the protest.When Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes, a graduate of Yale Law School, suggested Vallejo and others delete their texts in a group chat, Vallejo declined, stating he had nothing to hide. \"Oh, I got that (call to delete evidence) but I didn't do anything wrong and I was at the hotel when things got wonky,\" Vallejo texted Rhodes, adding, \"running and hiding is what GUILTY people do.\"Since the Oath Keepers, who always carry firearms, had weapons in their hotel room, the prosecution asserted that the group had \"stockpiled\" an \"arsenal\" in preparation for violence. But Peed said its \"quick reaction forces\" were a defensive group only, ready to come to the defense of any Oath Keeper who needed protection....",

To be honest, I would not be the first time a government agency like the FBI tried to incite some unrest to happen, so they can arrest people. However, Trump being the president of the United States and having authority over the FBI and other federal agencies, he could have done something to prevent agents to do this (assuming it actually happened).I think it will be just matter of time before Tucker Carlson covers this, is consistent with his theories on undercover agents on Jan 6th",

I mean, there is no doubt there were people who drove to DC with the purpose of getting ready in case Trump invoked the insurrection act or something, as far as I know those convicted with charges of sedition are the easiest to earn the tag of insurrectionists.On the other hand, we have others who did not plan to actually take down the government of the USA and simply went along with the mob, attacked officials and even broke windows... Perhaps, they were being used as part of a plan without them being aware of it. It is possible. I personally feel more comfortable referring to most of those who participated in Jan 6th as rioters and the few who got sentenced because sedition as actual insurrectionists. After all, rioters is a term with goes accordingly with trespassers in federal grounds.",

Basically NOT Trump supporters.Jan. 6 Tapes Released -- Sorry, No Insurrection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO9vpQgGWc8It's not called the \"Empire of Lies\" for nothing. Deception is the oxygen of empire. 44,000+ hours of January 6th footage has been released, and it's quite obvious as to why they weren't released in the first place. Also today, Javier Milei was elected in Argentina. Is change coming to the South American nation?...",
