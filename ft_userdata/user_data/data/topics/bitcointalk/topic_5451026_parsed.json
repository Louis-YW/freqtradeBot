But if he already has money to lend to others, he can totally afford to put down a small amount of money to become a co-member. So, it is very reasonable to limit newbies in participating in the loan table  But technically I'm not sure the admin is willing to do it, this forum wasn't originally designed to restrict users to any boards, this requires him to change the code a bit and maybe it's more complicated than we thought",

If we refer to restrictions on serious discussion and ivory tower boards, the restrictions apply to all newbie accounts and there's no exception even the newbie had 10 positive feedback, become D1 member etc. But this restriction is lighter since they only need to buy a copper membership to post an offer on lending board.Although someone who bought a copper membership rank aren't always legit, but this might reduce troll because someone can create a new account without pay anything and immediately post a crazy request.",

In the month of March, a newbie started a thread in the Beginners and Help board, I guess. He was complaining about how he could not get a loan from the bank after he offered to give them his university certificate as collateral, and he was thinking he could get a non coletaral loan here. Some members were suggesting he go through the lending board, but some members also specifically told him he could not get a loan here either, because he was just a newbie. So what I am trying to say is that some members here just think that any newbie could get a loan on the lending board, and when they make suggestions, they don't specify that a newbie cannot get a non-coletaral loan from the lending board, and it's those kinds of suggestions without warning that bring most of these newbies to the lending board.  Some newbies are not smart enough to quickly discover the lending board on the first day they join the forum, they are able to do so with the help of some suggestions. it would be good if this your idea is being implemented.",

They can weed out these threads or put the pesky newbies on \"Ignore\" mode.Usually you can spammed on all social media DMs if you are lender and have those handles. It shows then and there that the person is desperate for money and most of them are without collateral.With all due respect, I am pretty sure that all the lenders here would immediately jump in on a loan request from a newbie who provides a valid collateral, if that ever happens in real.
