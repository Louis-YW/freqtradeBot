I don't agree that bitcoin impoverish people, no it doesn't except if you want to multiply your unit or fraction by trading it. If you make a decision to trade your coins then it is not the fault of bitcoin but the trader that refuse to hodl only. Example if you are hodling 0.005 in btc, it will remain that value after bear market and can increase if the bull season come but it is riskier to trade it because you can lose all of it. Hodling bitcoin is not negative but trading it can be negative if you lose.",

No-refundable - A good deterrent to careless spending and being alert when sending money. You will think twice before sending money to a random stranger and also reduces beggers from getting the easy change off daily passengers. Imagine beggers with QR codes on the road, they will get ignored by everyone.Privacy - is important but not completely possible because we do use centralized exchanges and buy gift cards on online sites which log our IPs and all.Hackers - they are everywhere, in this century basic cybersecurity measures should be learnt by every user. It is a necessity and they are enough to keep you safe.Price changes - I urge you to check the yearly volatility of bitcoin, it remains under 15%.",

But the truth is that it will only make them lose their bitcoins, and they never learn about it.As long as you can keep your bitcoins in a separate wallet and never tell anyone how much or tell anyone that you have bitcoins, you will be safe from hacking, fraud, or theft.

Price vitalities - bitcoin price is unpredictable and nobody as monopoly of the market.You list the negative aspects of bitcoin. Do you think that cash, bank accounts, the stock market or other financial instruments have no disadvantages? Everywhere has its downsides.Cash, for example, can also be stolen from you, it is subject to strong inflation, paper banknotes burn very well and so on and so forth. But the world doesn't stop using it, right?I'll add some of my comments:1. Moreover,bitcoin is not convenient for use by ordinary average people.2. Bitcoin doesn't forgive mistakes of its users. Wrong amount or recipient address - your funds are lost forever. The need to ensure safe and secure storage of seed phrases.3. Pseudo-anonymity and permanent preservation of the entire history of transactions in the public domain.4. Almost the same as the 2nd paragraph. The need to take on the role of a security guard and be your own bank for yourself.5. Non-constancy of bitcoin price and unpredictability of changes.Despite these shortcomings (and not only) bitcoin still continues to be an excellent digital money and investment tool. This is the case when the positive aspects more than compensate for the negative ones, which can be neglected under certain conditions (that is, subject to certain actions).",

      "body": "@Godlovesyou   In summary, of your four points about the negative influence of Bitcoin, can you point out which of those negative influences is new to society as a result of the development of Bitcoin?The only negative influence I see here is people like you who choose to put all the blame regarding all the bad influence and negative things going on in society on Bitcoin, as if Bitcoin is the problem. All your listed negative feedback is also seen in every other financial sector.Regarding losing funds when you lose access to your private key and all that, if you can't take care of your own personal belongings, why then own them? Those are not things you should blame on Bitcoin, but individual mistakes and carelessness for which anyone should take responsibility for their own security.Hacking and hijacking of funds are primarily for those who hand over their funds security to a third party, and when that third party's security is compromised, everything is lost. It also happens in the banking sector, which is not something new; bank accounts are being hacked and individual funds are being hijacked. Any money that is in your personal wallet, especially a self-custodial wallet, cannot be controlled or moved out by anyone aside from you unless the security of your wallet has been compromised by you, which is mostly as a result of users carelessness in clicking on malicious and untrusted links, which gives hackers control over their wallet. It's not something new.Sometimes this week, a similar topic regarding the disadvantages of Bitcoin was also listed, which is almost the same point as yours. You guys just need to understand that whatever you are seeing as a disadvantage of Bitcoin is not the fault of Bitcoin but something that has already existed even before the invention of the currency. The earlier you start realizing this, the better it will relieve you of this negative energy you are having with Bitcoin.",

This is because there will always be someone selling and someone buying, meaning that some individuals will gain while others may lose. It's important to keep in mind that Bitcoin is constantly changing hands, which can contribute to its volatility. However, if you are a strong holder who doesn't engage in frequent buying and selling, you may be more likely to experience gains. It's also worth noting that scams and frauds can be found in any industry, and should not be the sole basis for developing negative opinions about Bitcoin.",
