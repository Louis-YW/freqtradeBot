When any user asks loan from a lender then s/he should wait until accepting/rejecting. Or at least remove the previous request and ask for a new request from another lender. Only those people whose intention is not good may ask loan on multiple people/threads at the same time. I have seen your loan may not approve for several hours yet you do not ask loan on another. Also, I have not seen any legit user who may ask loan on multiple people/threads at the same time. But this user asked for three loans within less than 4 minutes.",

Also, he hasn't contributed much to the forum to gain enough merits, which is why he still got only 10merits with such an old account.

His behavior is very suspicious. These scammers prefer to be present in the topics of lenders to obtain loans from them and then disappear without returning again. It is better for any lender to lend to Sr.members or above who have green trusts and to use the escrow service to obtain the account of the one who requested the loan as a mortgage. If the loan applicant does not return the loaned amount on the specified day, then the lender asks for the account details from the escrow and sells the account, and returns his stolen money.Frankly, lenders have a great risk in these transactions because if they do not guarantee their rights, they will lose their money, so they must always choose the person to whom they will give the loan.",

About 250Eur in altcoins haev a nice daybest regards papundelli22I don't think you will be allowed from anyone to take this type of a loan without any collateral. And op will also not give any loan as the op needs to collect only some personal information as well as personal document to use on somewhere which is unethical. So, beware from taking any advantages from anyone or any place, thanks.All he has done on this forum is ask for loans for years with the most ridiculous collaterals, he knows his account is worth nothing so he keeps trying, of course, nobody is going to give him any, at least I hope so.",

Everyone should be constantly made aware to not deal with these type of users by actively monitoring their activity and warning others. The forum will be a much better place if we get more of such scambusters. I am usually on the side of ignoring spammers, not scammers.",
