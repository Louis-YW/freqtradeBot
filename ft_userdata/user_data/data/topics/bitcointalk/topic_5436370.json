Namoto has a fairer and longer coin distribution period than Bitcoin, which allows for more even distribution from the beginning. The coins distribution model aims to reduce the number of large whales from the early days of mining. Only 4% of the Namoto supply will be mined in the first year, as compared to 12.5% for bitcoin in year 1. The Namoto website (https://namoto.org/#charts) provides an interactive chart that shows how many coins will be mined in percentage terms over time, compared to bitcoin.The fairer distribution of coins from mining should help onload ample hashpower, independent miners and nodes over a long time into the future making Namoto decentralized.By seeking to attract numerous talented developers to become Github repository collaborators from day one, Namoto aims to secure fair development governance much like Bitcoin has.Transactions are improved with a bigger block size (2mb) and faster block times as compared to other cryptocurrencies on the market today - making it an attractive choice for users looking for speedier transaction confirmations to a degree.",
