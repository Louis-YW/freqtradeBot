  "content": "Just like it says on the tin: half a bitcoin, silver, 2013.I'll be up front with you: I don't know anything about bitcoin or, specifically, this coin. Â I got the coin from a crypto enthusiast, but I never got into crypto myself.I know it's worth half a bitcoin at a floor, and an auction seems like the best way to find the ceiling. ðŸ˜ŽIs it series 2 or series 3? Â I don't know. Â You'd think this would be easy to find out; it's not. Â The pictures are not helpful, and the wiki doesn't list the differences comprehensively.Chain of custody? Â Couldn't tell you. Â It is currently mine and that's ~as far back as I can trace custody (gonna leave the previous owner out of this).Grade? Â Uuuhhhhh look at it. Â As far as I know, it's never -- not one single time -- been in a protective case, and I can tell you for a fact that it's been touched by ungloved human hands. Â I am touching it while I write this post.If you've got fun facts about Bitcoin, this Casascius dude, or collectors' coins, I'm all ears. ðŸ¦»Here's pictures: https://imgur.com/a/fkJSMZLIf you want more pictures of the coin for reasons that are unfathomable to me, I can take more, as long as they're not under the seal.Here's \"verification\" that it's still loaded (I don't know how reliable this site, maybe you do): https://casascius.uberbills.com/?address=1Agj3S8Rr2QFW4m2mLFiR6JHG2zrbaUDj6Starting bid is 0.6 BTC, 0.1 0.01 BTC increments.I'll shut bidding down at 11:59PM PST on 26 September 2023.Buyer pays escrow fees. ðŸ’¸",
