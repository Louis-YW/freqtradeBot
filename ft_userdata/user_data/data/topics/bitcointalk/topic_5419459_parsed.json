If something like surveillance were to be done on a large scale and by AI it'd end up marginalising minorities. In a way, I don't think this would lead to an end of things like bitcoin and other decentralised projects but it might lead to higher amounts of more restrictive regulation targetted at impaling the consumer but advertising it's in their best interest. Where such a system has been implemented in the past, China, a lot of companies have already left (especially tech startups) and I think this will be seen to be happening more and more in any country that considers adopting such systems. There's a difference between making sites warn they're unregulated and adding lots of barriers for them to be able to function - it seems more and more that regulation is geared towards conserving wealth and companies competitiveness without them having to compete with newer more efficient companies, but this might and probably will change at some point soon enough due to voting pressure (or market pressure - it's harder to regulate your borders information wise now - companies can function internationally without licenses/tax/fees if their host doesn't have them).",

I don't want to think pessimistically, and expect to have no right to speech, no right to choose, no right to my money, and no right to think, nor do I believe we're going in that direction absolutely, but I hold no doubt that we'll witness events such as social credit scores, repealing of physical cash, fall in private financing, etc., and generally sacrifice more and more freedom for comfort and social safety. What I like about bitcoin is that it can help us resist without violence. All that's needed is a merchant accepting it, and a customer willing to pay with it. No elections, no promises, no outsider that can fuck with this simple process. It's as simple as handing over a dollar bill, only that this can't be purposefully debased. So, yeah. I think it can serve its purpose, even in a society that puts equality above freedom. I'm actually looking forward to see it working; that's undoubtedly going to be the great test.",

It has become more or less a safe haven for those who wish to keep their identities hidden while being candid with their opinions. There is also a growing movement now for the same freedom in strict countries like Iran or China.Bitcoin will remain to be a symbol of resistance whatever happens. It can't be censored. Totalitarian governments may attempt to stop it, but they would never succeed.",

Bitcoin has faced its worst time with people and countries not believing in it until they started to believe in it and the adoption grows. Bitcoin offer a decentralized means of payment and a privacy and freedom means of holding it in a way to resist much pressure from government and regulators unlike fiat and other means that are centralized. Yet, even many of the government officials like how bitcoin is. This should not be a debate that bitcoin will still exist by 2030, if bitcoin won't exist by 2030 as a result of regulation and government, it will not still be existing by now, but its nice design makes it to exist.",

When the glass is getting full, the people will react, and badly.For now, especially in the democratic countries, some politicians are testing the waters and others keep an eye on them. Sort of equilibrium that doesn't need to be taken too serious (everybody can declare anything, that doesn't mean it will actually happen).So no, I don't think that bitcoin will perish that soon. It will even get bigger.Plus, bitcoin can work with and without KYC, depending on what the user wants and his level of knowledge.Actually this trend trends to even fuel the privacy oriented altcoins ...",

Many times the government wanted to control the citizens but it was met with stiff response from the masses. Freedom of speech would never and can never be a mirrage. Irrespective of the fact that there would definitely be some policies initiated by the government to control the people, it would only succeed for a short time but believe me you, the people would surely react fiercely against it. The world has gone far beyond the stage where individuals would be under control for a long time without a revolt. Come to talk of Bitcoin still in the space till 2030, I assure that it would stay far beyond that year as you have mentioned Bitcoin is just like you giving Power to the people so tell me how do you expect the people to throw away the power given to them recklessly, It's not possible. Bitcoin has been designed and built to stand the test of time. So OO I think you would tell it that Bitcoin has come to stay.",
