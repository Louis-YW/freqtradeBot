  "content": "This morning, I was replying to a topic in the Beginners & Help section, and I wanted to write that Bitcointalk is a reliable source for anything. If you ask anything about Bitcoin and crypto technology, you will likely get the most reliable/valuable/accurate answer compared to most of the internet. Then I asked myself, but why? How does it make a difference? The answer I got from myself is; Tech Geeks BitcoinTalk has some tech geeks who exclusively write their posts to help people in every other way. Of course, Bitcointalk also has average users like me. Since this forum is one of the oldest on the internet, thousands of articles were written almost decades ago, and tech geeks are still writing informative articles, hoping that someone will get help from them. It's nice to feel that one day, Satoshi was part of this forum, and his posts are still there. Imagine you can say to your grandkids that you have seen many posts from Satoshi in the early days of Bitcoin (I still consider it as early days.Why are you unlikely to be publicly scammed? I consider Bitcointalk as one of the safest forums on the internet. The internet is full of scammers, and Bitcointalk is not without scammers. There are scammers, but you are unlikely to get scammed if you talk in public. Remember, scams are not moderated in this forum. Bitcointalk members are unlikely to scam a random person publicly because others will immediately try to save you from fraud (if they notice). Why it's reliable?One of the reasons is reputation. Bitcointalk has designed the reputation system very well. The users build their reputation over time by helping others, writing helpful topics/posts, and trading with others. So, if you see a member with a couple of +green feedback under their name, you can trust them (Not all of them). Always check their Trust page before you deal with anyone. Bitcointalk users want to build up their reputation in every possible way. So, most of their intention to help is genuine. Which is why the source they provide is most likely reliable. Yet I suggest you check before you click on anything. That's what I had in my mind. Feel free to add why you think Bitcointalk is a reliable source!",

However, if you say that bitcointalk is a trusted forum for bitcoin and cryptocurrency, I agree.In my opinion, all sites or forums have their own advantages and disadvantages. This also applies to the bitcointalk forum, that discussions about economics and politics here are only supplementary boards and most of those discussing there are not experts. The discussion is often just a brief analysis without clear references. Or worse, many of the answers are repetitive. There are many sites out there that discuss economics and politics comprehensively and are written by experts But when it comes to bitcoin, this forum is definitely the best",

The thing is its left for everyone or every user to filter their information by themselves to see if they are true or not, just as post are being evaluated from many people since what i could see as quality contents might not be quality for another user.",

I believe the merits and the DT network affects the reputation system, which is why most peoples want to earn them. If you want to earn them, you must contribute positively.

To an extent, it is far more easy to use the forum than Google to find an answer here. There are good tutorials that are very well explained, but they do not promote any product or have referral links. My concern is that those tutorials have images that are not showing up due to the Imgur issue, if and only if those images can again be activated then it would be helpful. Some tutorials are not updated, if the creator of those tutorials can update them according to the current situation then it would be great.",

Well, Satoshi was part of this forum and he/she/they may still be part of this forum but in a anonymous way but still in the early days he/she/they was active as a user of the forum and was helping to fix the issues of Bitcoin in those days.Yeah, the Bitcointalk forum is a good place for everyone who want to make deals with the members of the forum, but I must say that if someone really wants to avoid being scammed then he/she has to deal with reputed members only. The newbies and low-rank members of the forum can't be trusted and some of them can be scammers who may steal your money and may not deliver what they have promised. I would again say that the members should always keep in mind that no forum on the internet is free from scammers and people with scamming mentality are everywhere. None of the scams take place publicly and a scammer always try to scam others via private messages or via Telegram. The reputation system of the forum is in good state but we still can't consider it as a perfect soliton. I have seen members with many green trust ratings who were later involved in scams while on the other hand there are members without any trust rating but still they haven't done any kind of scam activity so far. Although, everyone trust those members who have positive ratings and actually most of them can be trusted without much thinking, but sometimes the members with no-trust ratings can also provide valuable information for the readers of the forum. I firmly believe that the users with green trust ratings will always try their best to protect their reputation and they can be trusted.",

Which is very sad and I am quite shocked to see how legendaries member could do such things.
