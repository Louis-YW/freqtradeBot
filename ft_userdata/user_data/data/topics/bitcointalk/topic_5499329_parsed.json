  "content": "This is not about candidate choice or who you support but I want to inform you that all Politicians don't care about Bitcoin or anything concerning crypto, it has always been their political career and how they can get to the office and make their goals and nothing more. This is why you shouldn't give them your Bitcoin, you will suffer later if their policy doesn't favour Bitcoin.Last week and this week, there has been a discussion about Donald Trump being referred to as \"Crypto president\" and I see that as a big fat lie, he is nothing but just one of the candidates like others who is soliciting support from different communities and Bitcoin is just one of them.Fact check me, Donald Trump was the president of the United States between 2017-2022, and guess what, Bitcoin had one of the most crucial and worst moments in these years, the Covid-19 market breakdown and fear among Bitcoin investors when Bitcoin did as low as -45 % in one day but when this guy was asked about Bitcoin, he said all sort of bad things about Bitcoin, this was before and after Bitcoin has recovered from all these losses. Now walk with me with the things he has said;1. Source: https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1149472282584072192Here is one of his posts in 2019 when he think Bitcoin is not real money and too volatile, used for unlawful behaviours such as drug trade and other illegal things.2. Source: https://x.com/TylerLaroche_/status/1401903725728387082Here is another video in 2021, he admits he will never invest in Bitcoin because he thinks Bitcoin competes with the dollar and Bitcoin bleed much that day.The big guy now accepts Bitcoin and other crypto forms for donations to support his campaigns and the coming election.Source: https://www.donaldjtrump.com/cryptoHe is not the only candidate guilty of this part, all the other candidates contesting are now accepting crypto donations from people. However, the moment they reach the office, they act like it was never them that was campaigning and asking for help from poor holders. They don't care about you and this is why you should never donate your Bitcoin to anyone because your Bitcoin will be sold on the market and will continue with their games.Don't give out your Bitcoin, HODL!!!",

Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity....Is it fiat that are money if bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin has money nature than fiatFiat value is not volatile but if you check their price in a decade, you will see how very volatile they are in downtrend directionWas fiat not created based on thin air? It wasFiat are regulated but still more used for unlawful behaviors like money laundering, drug trading and many other illegal activities.But this was old Trump. He is now supporting bitcoin to get votes from crypto enthusiasts. There are people that have also spoken bad about bitcoin in the past. Even Michael Saylor tweeted bad about bitcoin before in 2012 or so before he realized the truth when he understood what bitcoin is.",

Yes, this is the time of their need, they need to gather massive votes for their campaign and election. That's all what they are asking. Even with criminals, they're going to tell how much they love them and how they're planning to give them a better program once they get out of prison or while they're staying there. All of those sweet and convincing words they're going to say in all of those communities that they want to get as much votes as they can. But later on, once the election is done whether it's Trump or Biden or whoever gets elected, they'll turn their way and will reason out that there are so much to deal with aside from what they have promised before.",

Whether Donald trump is reall about what it thinks about bitcoin at the moment won't change anything about Bitcoin,  it has come to stay and will keep on having more awareness. Let's not judge trump for understanding bitcoin better now because there are some leaders who were against bitcoin before but today they are core bitcoiners that doesn't joke wit bitcoin.",

And it kind of sad because for sure there are bitcoin investors who will actually trust this guy, because they dont know the history of trump bad mouthing bitcoin, I hope not much could give him bitcoin for his campaign, because I dont want something like that won a position in the government again.",

In political or socioeconomic view, if you want to support any politician, donate them and you can use bank, bitcoin or altcoins as your donation method.
