  "content": "Hey Guys,Since I last posted about this a little over a year ago-here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5335262.msg56936144#msg56936144 the overall crypto ATM machine installs worldwide has nearly doubled from a little less than 20k to a little less than 40k! I have been working on a list of Bitcoin ATM Operators and currently I am showing 121 unique operators in this space below (I am probably off by another 10-20 that I have not found or are too new to have any info yet). If this isn't proof of the adoption of Bitcoin then I don't know what is. Mind you this is also a physical presence of Bitcoin at your every day convenience stores which I think is pretty powerful to generating more awareness to the general public and definitely fosters curiosity. These machines have helped to further legitimize the crypto space as a whole. I check coinatmradar.com every few months and see new companies pop up every time so I can assure you there is constant growth in this space, year over year, for the past 8 years. This picture I posted on May 5 2021 which was the current BTM Growth on that very day:Fast Forward to now and there are over 20,000 MORE Bitcoin ATM machines that have been placed in gas stations, grocery stores, bodegas, vape shops, and many other types of brick and mortar stores all across the globe.   Here is a current and alphabetized list of all the Bitcoin ATM companies that I am aware of. If you know of another Bitcoin ATM Company that is NOT on this list please leave me a comment or DM me as I want to have this list as accurate as possible.

It’s amazing and very surprising to see this massive increase!!Thanks for posting OP Looking deeper it’s also interesting to see that the VAST majority of Bitcoin ATM machines are in the USA - 87.9%, with Canada being the next highest at 6.3% !!Is this because there is much more Bitcoin adoption in North America and/or because of regulation/laws?I believe in the UK you would need an FX license - which involves a lot of paperwork, money and abiding by KYC and AML regulations - a huge drawback.Is there anyway of knowing the difference between 1yr ago and now, to analyse if the North America percentage  has increased and conversely the “rest of the world” has decreased relatively ?

It is a stark dominance, much like BTC dominance in the crypto market is basically the USA vs the world in Bitcoin ATMs. Regulators here in the US have made a clear path to becoming an operator so long as they maintain a robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) Policy in effect. The hardest thing for an operator a year ago was finding a business bank account, so the friendliness of the US banks to crypto companies in the last year have also helped more operators to spring up in USA. If I remember correctly the US market dominance of crypto ATMs at that time in 2021 was around 60% so we're talking about an almost 28% increase in US dominance since this time a year ago! Incredible.",

The attraction of ATMs is the non KYC, as they charge high fees and paying those fees with KYC does not make sense.Seeing that more and more KYC is required, I understand that in the future KYC will be required for any amount, as it already happens in many cases, so I don't see much future for ATMs.",

This growth shows the interest in the bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is increasing over time and due to the increase of demand from people and the companies especially during the high inflation time, this was to be expected to see this growth of bitcoin ATMs. However, I'm still not a fan of bitcoin ATMs because they force the users to pass the KYC and that's not cool when are talking about privacy.",

Mind you this is also a physical presence of Bitcoin at your every day convenience stores which I think is pretty powerful to generating more awareness to the general public and definitely fosters curiosity. You make a conclusion based on an incomplete picture, because if the number of crypto ATMs on one continent is constantly growing and falling in the rest of the world, it is proof that 95% of the world is actually going backwards in this regard. In addition, awareness is one thing, and buying BTC on such a device is quite another - when people realize that they can buy BTC without a 10% fee, they will certainly no longer use such devices.",

Obviously territorial size is a factor, and perhaps it would be interesting to see the data of the number of bitcoin ATMs in relation to the country’s population, to relativize the numbers, but I’m still not fully aware of what makes them specifically interesting in the US (i.e. KYC yes/no, exempt volumes from KYC, commission rates, and so forth).To give you an example, a certain chain of ATMs in Spain was quite widespread in terms of usage, as it allowed people to buy/sell without KYC for up to 1K €/day (which could easily be bypassed), with commissions in the range of 3% ..7%. That was of interest to quite a subset of bitcoiners. Recently though, they introduced KYC for any buy/sell order, regardless of the amount, which has essentially bought their usage down to bare minimal, and shifted business off to other chains that still, for the time being, lack KYC under 1K €.",

The answer was straightforward: the only way you could really buy or sell easily was through an ATM. You can't do P2P easily (need a license). You of course could use Gemini or Coinbase, but apparently not everyone there can easily get verified (and those I know who had Coinbase got themselves flagged by interacting with a crypto service like, let us say, gaming).Used to have this long-term guy work with one of my projects. And he gave me insight into how a typical American lives and spends when they don't have a fixed job (so no regular income or address) and so can't easily apply for bank cards without an address or problems. They pay WEEKLY rent, get paid weekly (we used to pay him weekly just to fit his lifestyle).So the moment Bitcoin hit him, he'd run off to an ATM and sell, pay his motel, food, etc.I'm Southeast Asian and there are just a huge variety of ways I could sell/buy Bitcoin, often for great rates and near-instant speed (plenty of automated bots on LBC, for example).",

I should also note that the fair majority in this list are mostly US based- but keep in mind that many of the US based companies are currently branching out into other parts of the world, mostly in South America for obvious reasons.
