      "body": "Just to clarify - it's not like they'll be forcing people to disclose their crypto-holdings, but it's just that taxable gains will be reported separately in the Self-Assessment form. So not much of a change and no idea how they have estimated this will bring an extra £10 mils to the budget. Maybe they're hoping that people who previously didn't bother to report profits from crypto gains will be more likely to do that if the form explicitly asks for such. Makes some sense tbhThis will be effective from April 2024",

I'll probably seek some clarification from him even though he pretty much does everything for me, when I submit this years taxes, just to make sure I understand what exactly has changed. I've got until April 2024 to wrap my head around it anyhow.",

So if all kinds of assets that proceeded from crime could be seized, then crypto should not be an exemption.Coinbase did phrase this one a bit oddly though:QuoteWhile the House of Lords didn't make changes to crypto aspects of the bill, during earlier proceedings it was amended to ensure the measures extended to terrorism cases and measures to help authorities seize property that can help identify crypto linked to crime were added. Plus, an amendment was added to ensure courts can ask authorities to seize and freeze crypto used for crime.It reads as if the authorities not only could seize crypto proceeded from crime, but also seize crypto that can help identify crypto from crime. Whatever that means.I tried to verify it with the bill itself, but it's pretty lengthy: https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/29/enacted",

Without this registration, it is assumed that these ATMs are operating illegally. But from my research, no ATMs in the UK have been registered or certified by FCA. So all ATMs in the UK are operating illegally. I am beginning to wonder if the registration process is too stringent or if there are too many bureaucratic bottlenecks. This crackdown might be an indication that the government wants to limit the use of cryptocurrencyencies. https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/14/fca-and-west-yorkshire-police-raid-crypto-operators-in-uk-first",
