I wouldn't recommend you to invest for long term in DEFI projects, it's only good for trading.",

If you feel that it's unsafe then don't proceed. I think that you're aware that many defi projects were done because of the intentions of the developers are not pure. It's better to follow what you think is right and if you've seen some red flags then stop being interested on them anymore. What's better is to put your attention to the established ones.And before any other altcoins that you may seem to be interested with it, we've got bitcoin and you're safe as usual with it but your safety will depend on how you keep it.",

I think it depends on the results of your search for the Defi project and that is why you should look for more details about investing in the project.The Luna case has made many investors worry about investing but I don't think it stops them from trying other projects. I suggest you only use the money you can afford if you are really curious to invest in the defi project. But again, it's just a suggestion and you should really search and collect more info about the project.",

The point it, can you maintain returns from investments in Defi projects sustainable on long term? Or maybe you were just lucky to be on the right place at the right time so far? Anyway, 12%-15% yearly returns are pretty high, considering most investments considered safe don't pay more than 4%-5% APY.And if you don't trust pegged stablecoins to dollar, I think you already have your answer regards Defi's stablecoins, since the concept is pretty much the same. There is no assurance they are backed as well.",

I cannot really say much since you never mentioned it. Perhaps you should look deeper into the role of their native stable coin on the project's ecosystem or just leave it as is if you don't want to be bothered.Quote from: FirmWars on February 28, 2023, 08:47:04 AM....the mess with Luna and it's stable coin still lives in me till date. BUSD is also under pressure from SEC and other regulators due to a supposed breach and accusation of being a security. Paxos will stop minting it and Coinbase also announced it halt trading.Binance should be alright despite this.
