  "content": "According to this reportIt has been discovered that the video gaming industry consumes slightly more energy than bitcoin mining, the graph am gonna share below clearly shows that mining Bitcoin consumes far lesser energy compared to --Paper production-Gold mining-And slightly lesser energy than video gaming.It is reported that Bitcoin miners are utilizing electricity at a rate of around 100 TWh per year, this figure is said to account for about 0.06% of the world’s total energy demands, which is quite insignificant.My question is; Why then do people talk about Bitcoin mining power consumption like it is the most and worst energy consumer?",

The banking sector also consumes a lot of energy, for example, or city lighting, heating systems and so on.No one questions the energy expenditure of the banking system or that people can be heated in winter. They are questioning what attacks the established power.",

It does make sense as to why the video gaming sector consumes more power than Bitcoin mining, but this isn't a proper comparison if you ask me.Personally, I have an Xbox Series X which adds just a couple more units to my monthly electricity bill while an ASIC miner would add way more units in comparison.The irrefutable truth is that miners(Including energy saving ones) do consume a lot of power, but the media make it seem like a horrible thing for the sake of their corporate overlords.",

Let's say Bitcoin mining was only done on renewable energy sources, like \"Wind\" / \"Solar\" / \"Geothermal\" energy ....then it will not be harmful.The real difference is this.... Bitcoin mining use electricity to power a global payment system, where Video gaming use electricity to power systems for entertainment.",

Hence they're biased against Bitcoin despite videogames using more power.",

Maybe it's time for the world to dump paper completely. Actually, the FUD about Bitcoin mining wasting energy and polluting the environment has decreased in the past few months. That's probably because the Bitcoin price is low and the market is bearish. If the BTC market was bullish and the price was close to another ATH, the environmentalist FUDsters would return with their noise.I couldn't care less about how much energy is being consumed by the video game industry. Nobody is complaining about videogames wasting energy, destroying the environment and polluting the air. I wonder why.",

The motive is to denigrate the reputation of bitcoin in order to scare and repel people from using it under various pretexts. Be it high energy consumption or criminal use.

Never imagined video games would utilize more power than mining, given how expensive it is to purchase the electricity assigned to mining. This demonstrates further clearly the inaccurate perceptions of bitcoin. They blatantly oppose Bitcoin's dominance over other currencies. To prevent the widespread usage of bitcoin, the media and its detractors are disseminating false and erroneous information about it. All problems are now attributed to Bitcoin.",

If they have something against the video gaming industry, they would have already pointed out this fact. But no, what they only see in video games is the facet of violence and not much else. They also ignore that the video gaming industry is a billion dollar industry that gives a lot of people jobs. A lot of facts have been ignored, and they single out one thing that they want to stress and that's what's going out on the media. No matter how many industries you outline that uses more energy than bitcoin mining, the 'advocates' have already made their mind, and that is to tarnish bitcoin as much as possible by using the environmental damage card. This debate will never end; they will always have different angles to attack and different explanations every single time.",
