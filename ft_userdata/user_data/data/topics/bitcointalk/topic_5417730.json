I've just had quick look here if this is the correct repo: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pullsAnyway, I will look around and see",

If it were any other way, then any troll out there would have changed the code every second of every day. There has to be one or two people who control what gets merged but that doesn't mean only they can contribute to the code, they are just overseeing things. For example if you know programming and are familiar with the technology start making contributions to the code. If it is just improvements to the existing code you would simply open a pull request and after it is reviewed by other experts, the code will be merged. If it is a bigger change like in the consensus rules, you first have to start a proposal in mailing list and let the idea itself being discussed first and for others to see and test the code. Eventually if it is any good it will be merged so that we can move on to the next step which is for the entire bitcoin network to check it and see if they want to accept that change or not.P.S. you should never compare bitcoin with altcoins because they are nothing alike. Mainly because altcoin users don't really care about the technical part of that altcoin and are only there to make a quick profit so changes are not reviewed by users or even the network participants. Not to mention most altcoins are already centralized like Ethereum where one person or group of devs makes all the decisions and forces the forks on the network (eg. the ETH hard fork to roll back a large number of blocks so that Vitalik and his crew could get the money they lost in a gamble on a smart contract back).",

I guess the code of Bitcoin was changed since Satoshi disappeared?  It's all agreed with the miners and they all followed in Bitcoin protocol.  If there are major changes in the code, miners will usually have a power like having a \"fork\" IMO.If you want to know those Bitcoin contributors' contributions, here is a graph from Aug 30, 2009 – Oct 21, 2022.Quote from: a298b112 on October 20, 2022, 07:36:32 AMI guess the code of Bitcoin was changed since Satoshi disappeared?  No, it wasn't.  It can't be changed.If it's changed, that isn't Bitcoin protocol.",
