I think that it is almost impossible to judge this people objectively without having lived with them and on the spotWe don't need to rely on the West. We can look directly into the Quran or the hadith and recognize every iteration of Sharia Law isn't democratic. Any \"modern\" interpretation of Islam is so far removed from the direct text that even with the loosest interpretation you don't have any identifiable form of Islam.We can hear directly from the Afghans themselves, but I figure at this point some have gotten so accustom to Islamic theocracy over the years, the abuse of human rights seems normal. This type of abuse is engrained in history, it's not anything that's new with the Taliban. Most other religions have modernized. And their holy books are not nearly as violent against nonbelievers.",

Are they good?The are seen as good by Islamic fanatics that wants to send the world back to the 7th century. They are good to people that hate civilization and people that yearn to become despots. People that hate to respect the fundamental rights of others are the close friends of the Taliban. Although they can be commended for thier military prowess that led to the fall of the US back government few days after the withdrawal of US troops but they are doing more harm than good.QuoteAre they bad?Very bad mate. They treat women like waste bin and fail to recognize that these gifted female children has dreams and aspirations. Sending the girl out from school and encouraging underage marriage is inhuman. Openly killing of opposition or alleged enemies without fair hearing is highly condemnable. The Talibans have unjustly murdered many innocent Afghanistans because of cooked up or negligible charges. They have also failed to make the necessary adjustment to enable them attract support and aids from other wealthy countries. This has led to a total collapse of the economy thereby pushing almost the entire population to poverty. The Taliban needs to retrace thier steps.",
