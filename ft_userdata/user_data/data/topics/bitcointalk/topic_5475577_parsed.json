Â You mean, the sideways, the pump, dumps, the bumps and so on. Another one, because she can't take the heat...of the market. LOL.I'm not good at this but at least I tried.",

She doesn't stays one place. today she will visit bearish and tomorrow she goes to bullrun. making the relationship not stable. And now Crypto currency is looking towards USTD as a wife material because of it's stability. but consedring bitcoin as the best because of it ability to grow in knowledge and understanding as days passes by.Ladies can lie! Emagine a lady telling her friends, that she met a rich guy that spray her bitcoin in a party last night. and guest what? The bitcoin is still in her bag. Probably expecting to use it to buy groceries in shop the next morning. One of my dude told me that we always talks about bullrun. That where is the bull running to? I replied, running to ATH. He asked again what is ATH? I said all time high. He replied is there anytime one can be all time high? I said yes, the highest time of drinking alcohol.",
