      "body": "Quite a good number of shiba inu fans have raised a lot of discussion on price speculation and what is the future prospect for the Shiba coin, this is quite difficult to speculate on since we are conversant with market movement and behaviours where no one can predict the price of any coin due to market volatilities. -So at best I will advise you to be prepared for whatever outcome the market will turn out to be, if you believe that the upcoming shebang network upgrade will give the coin more transactions and exposure then you may accumulate more to make 16x when that happens, but eventually we have not seen any great price movement since Ethereum upgrade their network and also move to (POS).",

Reaching that price might happen in the next bull run if the upcoming update will bring more hype, but expect for a bigger risk when the price started to pump because that is the time where hodlers becomes the seller.",

I am really not a fan of meme-coins because for me they are all useless shit-coins that were only created because the \"team\" behind it wanted to make a quick buck without investing much time and effort, just because Elon Musk made a few tweets that were just a hustle as he said himself later. That being said, there is no doubt that especially Shiba Inu made a lot of his early investors very rich because you could have literally made 100.000 profit out of a 100$ investment.That times are gone now though and to be honest i don't see much growth potential anymore for Shiba Inu. If the whole market goes up Shiba Inu will also go up, but i don't see another x10 from here on. I would look for another project to invest in. Something with substance and a real use case.",

A strong and determined person could just think that investing in Shiba Inu is good but for me, I'd rather play it safe than invest in meme coins like Shiba. If you have the basis OP that will convince yourself to trust Shiba Inu, then you also have the right to invest in this project. Because for me, I won't take a project that I have no confidence in and trust. If ever it pump high like before, I have nothing to regret as it was my choice either.",

My first instinct is \"$100b not in a billion years\" but than again, anything is possible if enough crazy people get into this crypto madhouse. Eventually there will be a limit and even as we hit the top people will have 1000x targets for their high cap coins. I am not saying it won't go up there but i see it highly unlikely. I see more changes of it having a fatal exploit causing a panic run and crash to the zero then a 100 billion dollar marketcap",

I also still have the Shiba that I bought when the price was undergoing a deep correction. But I can not say whether Shiba is worth making as a coin deposit for the short, medium, or long term because it depends on investors' reactions. But it seems that Shibarium is something that investors have been waiting for and many of them are convinced that this could trigger its price to increase when the altcoin arrives. So it's better to wait and forget about it to choose other coins.",

You invested in it, and I think you will understand it better than we do, you need to do a lot of analysis and research on it. If you are not sure about it, then sell it and choose another coin, if you still believe in it, then go ahead. But I would say that investing in altcoins, especially memes, is riskier than bitcoin or top coins. You chose risk from the start, so you should prepare for the worst case scenario.",

If anyone still holds it, I guess considering this advice is like doing yourself a favor. The hype is over and it's not worth it anymore.Unless they really can make another hype which I'm already doubting this Shibarium. They even tried to hype SHIB again by saying its possible SHIb will be shifting as privacy coin.",

All of the products that have already been developed are so garbage and how can meme token be worth 100b?Â  Quote from: JamesDaniel90 on March 03, 2023, 12:19:48 PMWith the release of Shibarium due this year I do think this will see the price rise but how much im not so sure?

Shiba looks very strong meme coin, i see their team is very active and working hard to implement new things as like shibarium, but i don't think itâs easy to hit 100 billion dollars market cap where now only over 6 billion. Yeah, if it will launch then price can be slightly increase i hope, you can hold till launch their new product.",

No one really knows but with that upcoming Shibarium update then we could assume out that it would really be giving out that kind of chance for some pumps since this is really just some positive news but we know thatnot all updates and fundamentals could really make out an assurance that it would really be making out some good or positive movement.Therefore, you shouldn't really that make yourself that expecting into it.If you could still hold up then its your choice but it wont really be that bad if you do sold you current holdings and secure out profits considering that you are really thatin gain as of this moment but if you do decide to hold up for more then it wont be that a bad option too.",
