  "content": "Hello everyone, we are Oldchief Casino!We want to consult with you about payment systems. The point is that we want to regularly add new coins, but we don't want to raise a node for each of them. We already use one company that allows us to process payments, but they have limitations (for example, you need to get a new address for each deposit, and we cannot assign a permanent address to a user). We would be grateful if you could point us to a reliable service provider that does not have the limitations mentioned above, works quickly and efficiently, and does not charge high commissions for their services. Perhaps you are a representative of such a company or you have a different solution to our problem. Write to us, we will be glad to any advice and suggestions!Sincerely,Oldchief Casino",

Write to us, we will be glad to any advice and suggestions!What coins do you want to support, other than Bitcoin?I can only vouch for open source payment processor BTCPay Server and Cypherpunkpay that are mostly Bitcoin and LN based, but recently one forum member VSYS Host made a topic about new open-source payment processor called SHKeeper.I know they are supporting some altcoins but I am not sure about all the details with addresses and I didn't try this service myself.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5413455.0You could probably use some third party custodial service that supports more coins, but I am not going to give any suggestions about that.",

      "body": "You can't add new coins regularly if you use a third-party gateway unless they accept it. For that, you don't have any other choice other than nodes. BtcPayserver would be better, they have the option to add altcoin as well. But the problem is it will change address every payment. I have used it for Namecheap and they changed the address for each payment. Better make your own payment gateway to solve the issue if your business is quite big.",

You don't have the capability do it by yourself and you would need to trust someone to make one for you, for a cost. This person  could not be as knowledgeable as you might think and your solution might not be as secure.My suggestion is to stick to btcpayserver.org  at first. When your service grows you can invest in your own",

But I think like others said it would be best if you start using BTCpayserver which is way easier to set up than making your own payment processor that has not yet been tested from any attacks.I think BTCpayserver is built with C# if you know c# you can fork it and modify it and put your own codes. Like others who using BTCpay and make some few changes on the code like adding feature or optimizing the code.",
