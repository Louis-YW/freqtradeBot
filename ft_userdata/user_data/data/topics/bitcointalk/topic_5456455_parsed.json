Concerning blockchain technology it is very verse and there are actually many things on it aside cryptocurrency. So to your question i would say attend events on blockchain if the aspect or the theme of the seminar is not frowned upon by your country government. If for an example bitcoin or cryptocurrency at large is banned in your country, attending an event on it exposes your privacy and you could be possibly be violating a law on that. So it depends on the kind of blockchain event you’re attending and also your country’s law guiding that.",

There you can meet investors and good project teams if you have any project too, you could have the opportunity to showcase yourself to the Crypto world to see who is looking for it.Concerning a country's ban on Crypto and the possibility of Crypto enthusiast holding a seminar there is very risky. There you could be exposing yourself to risk because sometimes the government can send in agents to go monitoring the events activities and possibly making a prosecution on those who organized the event and likewise the attendees too which is not safe.",

I attended one of blockchainevent  here in our country hosted by a popular exchange. I learned a lot but since I’m not a developer or involved on computer programming, I don't appreciate much the technical knowledge aside from key knowledge involved on blockchain.It will be helpful if you can provid the link to the event so that we can review the scope of topics and wha’t the background of the speaker involved. This is crucial to determine the worth of that event.",

Or, if you want to make connections and learn more about the subjects the speakers will present.It’s very important to make sure you choose an event of interest. There’s no point going to a blockchain event if they’re gonna talk about coins you don’t care about. It’s just as pointless to go there if you’re a Bitcoiner and only altcoin founders will talk, unless you’re interested in learning more about other projects.Overall, I think there’s some information you’ll learn regardless of the event that will open your mind more and teach you new things. But again, it’s not as easy as a yes/no answer.",

For connections, exposure, and socializing? Yes for sure. Blockchain events also give way for a lot of promising projects out there to flourish and be showcased before it gets into the public. Plus if you're into attending hackathons (which good thing right now is already dedicating whole sections of the event for cryptocurrency-related projects) you'd see a lot of promising project prototypes that would give you great insight as to what the future of cryptocurrency is leaning towards. All in all it's a genuinely positive experience even if you're someone who's not really into attending such events as it still caters to the people by offering all forms of entertainment that is legally allowed, plus most of them offer trinkets and awesome loot just for attending! So yeah it's something that a cryptocurrency enthusiast should look into joining in the near future.",

I mean if an event is to be conducted in a place and the location of the place where the event is scheduled to take place isn't far away from your home town then attending that event best decision one could make to learn about blockchain in detail.Those events are conducted to promote awareness about blockchain and its use cases. If you attend those events you will get inspiration from the ones who are conducting those events and at the same time you will learn a lot from them related to Bitcoin and blockchain. The ones who conduct those events are mainly specialists of the blockchain system and they have deep knowledge about blockchain and the technology behind it. You'll learn a lot about blockchain by attending those events because we learn things far better when they are taught by the experts of the field. If the blockchain events are free then that's the best thing ever to attend but if it has little fee then still it's worthy to attend those events. I would most probably recommend you to avoid the events that has very fees because they are mainly conducted to loot the attendees and may not offer much valuable knowledgeable things because of greediness to create more such events in future to accumulate more money.",

Then go for it. - Is there anything you believe you can't find out elsewhere, except in such events? Go.But in my opinion, it isn't worth it.

People who don't have a problem with it can go, but i think the disadvantages and risks outweigh the benefits.The best thing that can happen if you go is that you meet up with people, or if they have special guest speakers that you admire, you get to see them, but the worst thing that can happen is you will probably compromise your privacy and you can be a target of a $5 wrench attack, so you can now decide for yourself.",
