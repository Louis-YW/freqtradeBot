  "content": "Since I joined this forum I have learned a lot and I have also put most in practice why learning more from enlightened forum members here. I have Bitcoin wallet which I use in receiving transaction from Bitcoin blockchain. And I also have Bep-20 address which I receive Bitcoin with as well directly into my Binance account. I run a local P2P trade in my locality with my trusted friends and those they refer. I find the Bep-20 BTC deposit as the fastest way to receive and send Bitcoin directly into any centralized exchange account that supports it. Their was a little argument with one of my Client yesterday which I told him all transaction are being recorded in the blockchain irrespective of which chain that it is, the argument made me to scan through one of my customers wallet to prove my point, all the Bitcoin I sent to the user wallet through Bitcoin blockchain were all visible on https://www.blockchain.com/explorerWhen I moved ahead to scan the Bep-20 address under Binance scan, I could not find any BTC transaction both in and out of the wallet, nothing related to btc was on that wallet. My question here is, are their other ways of scanning Bitcoin Bep-20 which is different from the Binance scan? Me sending to the receivers address from my Bundle wallet.",

A real bitcoin address starts with 1, 3 or bc1.",

You sent from Bundle wallet to a centralized exchange right?. If the receive of that btc is using a Binance generated bep-20 BTC address, it will not be recorded on the blockchain reason being that Binance is also the owner of Bundle which was a wallet and App introduced specifically for Africans. So transaction interested between this 2 are recorded as internal transaction which inter transaction are not recorded or seen in any blockchain explorer. https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/introducing-bundle-an-africafocused-social-payments-app-for-cash-and-crypto-421499824684900534",

      "body": "Bitcoin doesn't work on BEP-20 or centralized chain, it's just a fake Bitcoin where the price pegged with the real Bitcoin. Although using BEP-20 make the fees cheaper, but that's the way how CZ want to scam everyone. Don't get tricked, there's a way to use Bitcoin with cheaper fees, you can use segwit address or lightning network. Many wallets already start integrating with lightning network, but only few centralized exchange has this feature.What's the point to hold fake Bitcoin if we have real Bitcoin?",

      "body": "First, I would like to tell you about tokens and coins. What is the difference between a token and a coin. A token is created in an existing blockchain which the token does not own. And a coin has its own dedicated blockchain.So from my understanding, what you have in your BEP-20 address is just a token created on BEP-20 blockchain to represent the value of original Bitcoin.If you don't own BTC on its own blockchain, then you don't own any BTC at all. BEP-20 BTC is just an imposter.",

BEP-20 BTC is an altcoin. Unlike Bitcoin, which is decentralized and accepted by all crypto exchanges, this BEP-20 BTC thing is a centralized token that runs on Binance chain and I don't think that many accept it (except Binance, of course).So you use a coin that is not Bitcoin, which is barely accepted and for which you have to trust Binance that this token's price will stay \"close enough\" to Bitcoin price. Hence sorry, but you're doing it wrong and on the long term you may face (bad) surprises.And as a lesson: one can name any crap Bitcoin or Bitcoin whatever, but that doesn't make it Bitcoin. The actual Bitcoin works only on Bitcoin's blockchain. Period.",

However, I believe that a lot of people live in the same delusion and think that they have discovered a way to send Bitcoin much faster and cheaper, even though the on-chain fees have been quite low for a long time. Of course, for those who use a custodial wallet or better said CEX, these fees are still quite high because they also pay a service fee, and then fall into the trap of some token invented by CEX.One would think that people would have learned something from the recent failures of projects that are mostly related to so-called stablecoins or tokens, but it seems that the show still goes on, just at a slightly slower pace.",

In the end, I'm afraid to save BTC there. I use the BEP20 network for storing and interacting with altcoin tokens only. While I still use electrum to save my \"long term\" BTC.We we don't have all those things that is why we value this platform because it is educative at least with you this you have said so far I have understand exactly what you are saying concerning your own teaching or your own understanding in Bitcoin and the transaction also so I believe that every new bill can learn as well through your own method of teaching",

It’s basically just another BEP20 token named Bitcoin and use it as proxy of the original Bitcoin that sent on the address with smart contract that wrapped it to become a WBTC on BEP20.
