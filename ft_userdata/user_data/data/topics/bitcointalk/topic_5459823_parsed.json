Withdrawal fee on Kucoin is higher on the exchangs I listed, but I do not know if it would still be like that after KYC.Read this in details. For non KYC centralized exchanges: Current list of exchanges without KYCYou can use those like Uniswap, Pancakeswap too to trade derivative. But I do not use it.

Be careful of these decentralized exchanges, they can be hacked too. Not sure if OP fancies DEX but personally I like to stick to CEX for obvious reasons. Speaking of KYC, it's been heluva season in the market as many exchanges now mandate KYC verification but Bitget, Mexc and a few others have stayed non mandatory. The withdrawal fee on Bitget is also minimal and asides Derivatives they are like the biggest Copy Trading CEX",

Bitmex: You need KYC verification for withdrawals.2. Bybit:  It offers the non-KYC option for trading.3. Binance: It offers both KYC and non-KYC accounts, with different withdrawal limits depending on the verification level.Also, you can find the fee structure provided on the respective exchange in their fee schedule sections.",

FTX is once the best exchange for trading derivatives because it has a very low base maker and taker fee and you can have discount up to 60% if you hold certain amount of FTT tokens). I think Bybit and Binance is currently the best exchange for trading derivatives because they have a low base fee and can be discounted using their native tokens. I suggest to invest on exchange native tokens if you really want to save a lot of fees on trading especially on derivatives that has a very high fee due to leverage.",

(....)Most trusted centralized exchanges became KYC exchanges after all especially Bybit and Kucoin. So for me, doing KYC will force you to do so to continue trading with them because if you don't want you will end up using a decentralized exchange will take higher fees compared to these centralized exchanges.For me, Kucoin and Bybit are good which is what I am using right now. If you want to use decentralized, you can use GMX which is already available on Arbitrum and Avalanche chains. I suggest do use the Arbitrum as they have higher TVL.",

I have personally used/using Pika, Helix, DYDX (They are building their own blockchain now, so is offline at the moment, testnet is live) and Polynomial. Only disadvantage I have found is they tend to have less number of coins supported compared to cex, but if you hover around a few you'll get what you are looking for. Good luck!",

Last time I checked, it was possible to trade on those exchanges without KYC.  But in today's crypto market, you won't get away much from. KYC as it's enforcement is across the board so it's much harder to evade KYC. If you chose to do KYC, be sure to do so on prominent exchanges. These smaller exchanges usually get hacked or become insolvent so it's always better to keep the security of your assets on top of your priority list.",
