You should check on the left corner of the bottom of your thread, and you will see move topic. Move it to the service board, where you can advertise your service very well, and people who are in need of your service will contact you. But try making your portfolio a little more detailed so that people will understand how you operate and your previously concluded jobs. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=52.0",

You are not going to find clients for your services here. For someone to pay you $900, he should earn not simply more than that amount, because if he earns $1K, he is not going to play just to give you 90% of the profit. At the very least he should earn $2K or considerably more, and if he did he wouldn't be on this forum. In my experience there are quite a few people on the forum who have played poker and have an idea but don't reach that level of professionalism.",

Americans can even play on most of these rooms. They accept bitcoin payments and wd in bitcoin if you wish. So, why would anyone pay you $900 a month for an account lmao. You must just be praying people are stupid.",
