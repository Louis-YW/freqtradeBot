In fact, 1xbet sponsors some of the biggest sporting clubs and competitions while a lot of complaints about consumer fraud are neglected by the only people who can do something about it.

It's the one Cloudflare protects from so it makes sense that Cloudflare is showing a rate-limiting screen on the Ordinals website. It does mean that the site is not receiving the full force of the traffic because it is intercepted at Cloudflare first, but it's still innaccessible nevertheless.",

Will they, who are attacking the website now move on the the second phase of attacking the smart contract? Or they will end it with a DDoS attack. IMO, it is a fool's game to attack the website as it does not stop what the ORDI token is doing currently. At present the token is only $4 below its ATH, the volume is good and before 2023 ends it might break its previous ATH. In the meantime, the mempool remains congested, and the transaction fee does not come down to where it was in the days when it used to be 12 sat/vB to 25 sat/vB.",
