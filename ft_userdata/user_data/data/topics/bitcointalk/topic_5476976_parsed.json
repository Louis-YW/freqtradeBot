It was a fraudulent smart contract.For FLOW I use the Blocto wallet. But you are absolutely right that a certain token called “FLOWTOKEN” has nothing to do with the real FLOW coin. Quote from: philipma1957 on December 07, 2023, 11:18:20 PM So I got an air drop of a coin called FLOWCOIN  it was worth 10 bucks it now says it is worth 1800 bucks.I can't seem to figure out if it is this coin.0xafeb1f1c********https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/flow/A typical trick of scammers: airdrop of tokens that have a mention of well-known tokens in their name (USDT, Tron, Matic) and when you try to sell them (for example, on Uniswap) you lose money for the fee network and in the end the exchange transaction does not go through (you receive a message about the error). Check such tokens (their smart contracts) at least through Etherscan - it often flags “problematic” tokens.",

      "body": "When exactly did the airdrop or airdrop announcement happen, OP? Was it last year?It will make it easier to figure out which coin you are holding in your address. You could also actually see the date of airdrop from a blockchain explorer.I see so many flow coin \"airdrops\" on doing a small search. Gotta be careful to avoid getting scammed.",

And in order not to be deceived, first sell several hundred dollars worth of coins and withdraw it to your wallet. If this is a decentralized exchange on Ethereum or other coins, then do not use your wallet for trading.Open a new metamask wallet and send some coins to it.",
