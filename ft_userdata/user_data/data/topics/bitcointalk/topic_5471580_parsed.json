On casinos, I have not seeing cashout before and I do not think it would be there because it is not needed.If you gamble in both casinos and bookies, you will clearly understand why cashout is not needed in casinos because of how fast their games is with single outcome.",

      "body": "OP, cash outs can only occur in games that can run for a number of days, weeks, or even months, and I think sports games and fixtures are the only games I know to run for as long as weeks or months. If there are any other fixture games that can run for days or weeks, you can probably expect cash out from them, but if there aren't, then cash out is not possible.Someone won about $3850 just yesterday, and it was in sports (football). According to him, it was 22 matches, and the games have been running for 2 weeks, so the night before yesterday was when they played the last match, and before the last match started, he was already having a cash out of almost $2k, but he refused to cash out, and luckily he won. My point here is that only sports can run for days and weeks, and that's why cash outs are usually available, but since other games happen so fast and on the same days, it's very impossible to have cash outs.",

Well I can't say except the tournament is played like real game and not in house casino organized games because I know casino games start almost immediately you activate your bet and no room for cash out. Regards to tennis or basketball, it has cash out depending on the gambling company if they decide to remove the option.",

So, your goal is to win a sum of $250. In the first part, the result was 0:1 in favor of Juventus.The software offers the option to 'Cash Out' $180 and close your bet as a winner. At this point, you can accept the offer and win $80. No need to get further involved with the game.Or, you can leave your bet open, to win the full amount ($250) if Juventus wins the match.In the same game, if Real wins 1-0 in the first half, your chances of winning will be smaller.The software can give you a $30 offer to cover your bet. This gives you the opportunity to not lose all your money ($100).This means that the purpose of the Cash Out Feature is for those who don't want to risk losses and secure money if the match doesn't match expectations, but for me I rarely use this feature.",

I was about to say this but thanks for doing it for me . Obviously, Crash game is not the same as Sports betting but if you mean about the cash-out feature, it might have a different design or positioning, but in the end it was still a cash-out feature. We don't know what comes ahead in a crash game, or sports betting.Maybe we can win so if we continue we can earn a little better. If not, we can regret it. So, it's also better to secure our money because that was already sure. Other than Crash, Mine's game also has this feature. The rest of the in-house/casino games may not have that cash-out button but you can always stop if you don't want to play anymore.",

There's nothing disruptive here, it's either a particular game we are playing support that future or not, if they don't support such, then there's nothing we can do to make use of this feature, why many gamblers do make use of these is because it's very common with sport bettors they do such whenever they feels uncertainty about a particular game outcomes, they cash out to avoid lost on such game and the winning rate also decreases because the risk involved is reduced as well.",

Aside from that don't get the idea that the cashout feature in sports betting is a real deal. The cashout feature is still gambling as you need to decide whether to continue or not. It's tempting the bettors to cash out the money or not but if you are in the situation it's not an easy decision to make because you have a big chance to fully win that game and take home money better than the cashout money being offered.",
