  "content": "Here is my proposed amendment to the pledge of allegiance. If you are a teacher, you need to use this new pledge of allegiance in school. If you are a K-12 student, you need to say this new pledge of allegiance. Because everyone who refuses to use this new and improved pledge of allegiance is a commie.\"I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And all bio-safety level 4 labs need to publicly post cryptographic timestamps of all their meticulous records.\"If you are not affiliated with the USA, you should include the statement about cryptographic timestamps in your country's pledge.-Joseph Van Name Ph.D.",

This should be done not only if you're an American, but any born and bonafide citizen of any country can make a determination on this to be patriotic, it is not by mouth, we have to see it in actions and in ones life, we need to know hownto appreciate nature and also our fellow human being, we may be different in colour, gender or race but we all belongs to thesame classification of higher animals named homosapiens.",

      "body": "A child or youth who is under age is responsible to his parents - if they are adults - or to his grandparents if his parents are under age. As a child or underage youth, he legally is not responsible for his promises and statements without parental consent, except that a judge in a court of law has adjudicated that he is responsible as/like an adult.When an underage person comes of age (becomes and adult) and has not been placed into a position where the question of childhood promises ever comes up, the question remains open, even though assumptions/presumptions are made about how he upholds certain of his underage promises.Underage youth promises don't mean squat, legally, until they are confirmed after the youth comes of age... except at the adjudication of a judge in a court of law for a underage youth. This holds true for the Common Law countries - USA, Canada, Britain, Australia, Guyana (South America), India (in part), and a few others. In addition, there are probably other countries, which have Civil Law systems, or other systems of law, that uphold this underage idea.See https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Map_of_the_Legal_systems_of_the_world_%28en%29.png.While it is a good idea to explain things to everybody, and especially kids, probably a load of adults like some of the ideals of Communism, simply because they don't understand how these ideals take away from their freedom, or the freedom of their descendants. But often life is too difficult for them to find time to begin to think about these things.",

      "body": "Hello Doctor Joseph. That is an interesting proposal for your national pledge of allegiance, I was expecting something different from you, though. Perhaps something more related to technology and thermodynamics.Anyhow, since you are also suggesting this new pledge for those who do not reside in the United States. Would this new pledge also apply if in the country I was born and live in does not have any level 4 bio laboratories or any equivalent facility? I think that the context is important we if seriously talk to change the way we swear loyalty to our respective republics. For example, it would not make much sense to add some pledge for nuclear security if the country in question does not have either military or civil nuclear installed capabilities.",

      "body": "Hi Hispo. I had to think about this one. I would still highly recommend adding the statement about BSL-4 labs to the pledge even for countries without BSL-4 labs for several reasons. Those countries may develop BSL-4 labs in the future. And even if they don't, those countries may still be affected by whatever bug comes out of a BSL-4 lab, so they need to stand against the lack of a safety culture at those labs. I am the only entity standing against this lack of safety culture (well, biologists Alex Shneider, Aleksandr Kudriavtsev, and Anna Vakhrusheva wrote a 2021 paper with an idea similar to mine, but their idea was not 100% what I had in mind).Non-nuclear countries still have the right to speak up against nuclear weapons because non-nuclear countries may still be affected by nuclear weapons.Pakistan has nuclear weapons but no BSL-4 lab, so Pakistan has the right to say 'We do not have a BSL-4 lab, but we have nuclear weapons, and we have the most badass mountains on Earth. If anyone refuses to post all cryptographic timestamps of all the information from these laboratories, and if we suspect that a bug released from these laboratories is infecting and killing our people, we will use our nuclear weapons against you.'",

Even if they had the money to do so, I am pretty sure some western powers would not feel very comfortable with third world countries or even adversaries holding dangerous specimens of bacteria and viruses. Anyone who would not know much about those weapons of mass destruction would say that pledges of alliances are supposed to be based on the traditions that helped to start a republic hundreds of years ago, instead nuclear weapons or viruses. Still, I am glad to read your proposal, even though it is not the most orthodox one.",

Because as far as I was aware the definition of such countries have little or nothing to do with the existence of BSL-4, but rather it depends on other social and economical factors. We both know, Dr.Joseph that many people around here and in USA would feel quite upset if suddenly we started to call those cities part of the third world, would not they be right ?",

It is a real shame that most people have no problem insulting and hating each other, but the moment I try to do something meaningful, every word I say that upsets people is somehow horrible. I really don't care. If anyone from Boston is upset that I call their city a third world city, then that person can go **** *******. The only thing I care about is that those BSL-4 labs publicly post those timestamps. P.S. If we use the original definition of 'third world', then the third world countries will be all the places that are spared from WWIII. During and after WWIII, the place that you will want to be is the third world.",
