Since it's a physical casino, means i can walk out of the casino with my cash.   Wagering requirements are usually in online casinos. So if it was an online casino, i may have prefer free spins and tried my luck.",

If it's just a slots site then it'd make sense to give users free spins (you can probably pay less to give them more goes at them then too).If it had other things like live/table games and you wanted to let them gamble on everything then I think cash makes more sense.",

If it is a new casino then I will choose money and if it is a casino like Cat Casino  then I will choose bonuses. Just because it's very profitable here with bonuses, I still withdraw money afterwards, but usually more than I could have withdrawn. But bad luck happens too, it's gambling.",

Free spin is only limited to a single slot game which is very hard to take profit especially when the free spin is just small. With cash reward, I can use it on sportsbook to bet on low odds bet to  guarantee my profit.But all this welcome bonus has a wagering requirements which always be the major turn off to claim on any of this kind of bonus.",

When playing slots I always happy when I get many scatter, so I can get free spins and if I'm very lucky I will hit another scatter that would make my spins will keep continue. Also based on my experience, I have better luck to play free spins promotion than the direct cash.",

The thing with free spins is that you still gambling when in fact you want someone to keep your rewards like money or something like cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.)",

But if the free spin will have more reward, I mean higher reward, I will prefer the free spin. Free spin can also get me luck and I may win more amount of money, but it can be other way too though.But to be sincere, this is not what I can consider, even all reward I have been given before are either free spin or an amount that I can not withdrawal directly, that I would still have to bet with it and win up to certain amount before I can withdraw.",

Lol actually when I'm newbie i used to do that and sad to say until now, where in i don't know why or maybe because it's not mine and its totally free? For short no regrets afterwards what will gonna happen on it, just the fact that at same time I'm enjoying the free money while gambling. No stress.",

I think that will be a good starting opportunity to try out the service that they could provide which will help me decide if I would stay on their site or not. I also like direct cash but I think free spins would be worth the risk for I won't be using my personal funds as a starting capital.",

With those free spins then you could really potentially able to hit up possible big wins or considerable amounts but of course it wont really be an assurance.Whereas you do receive cash rewards then expect it would really be just less and too small for you to mind off if ever you do tend to receive these things since they cant just give out significant amountwhere people could really be that interested or be contented with those amounts and if you do tend to make betting out of those free money or cash then it would really be just not able to equalon the thing you had get with those free spins.You could really just able to tell directly in between two on which one would give out those good chances on making money out of free things.",

In reality a new casino would love to see you get hooked and the vast majority of these free promotions are hoping to get you hooked before the money runs out. The sensible few will be the ones who capitalize on the money, potentially free drink(s) and walk out the casino with some money in their pocket. The losers are the ones who, when the freebie runs out, will start loading up their own cash and lose track of how much they have fed back in. They do make a great hook, say a group of friends walks in - some might win, others might lose more than they should and on balance the casino had the chance to empty someones bank account if they lost control.",

Direct cash is good, but i doubt that fresh casinos will offer that for just visiting their site, and if yes then maybe it will be tied to some wagering bet before you can even cash it out. So I prefer free spins at least you can have the luxury of playing your games as your own phase and see how it goes for you.",

But in general the bonuses given are always in the form of free spins and even then the nominal is very small, so getting a win from the free spins bonus is very difficult to happen.",
