Perhaps this happened due to overheating and possibly due to poor-quality contact. Or you made a mistake when building a mining farm or did not check all contacts before starting mining.",

I heard this bad boy are so stable than all those motherboards using risers,  I might probably change all my motherboards to riserless motherboards after the bear market does it's worse.I used to use only Biostar motherboards,with risers and they worked good,served me well from 2016 up until end of 2021.In the 2022 year I decided to buy riserless motherboards,I always buy branded ones because there are a lot of Chinese riserless motherboards which I am not confident to get good service for the long run,so I got with Asrock H510 Pro BTC + and I am extremely happy so far.The only downside if we can call it like that is that it needs a powerful processor to run stable,a minimum of Pentium Gold of Lga 1200 socket,personally I run it with a core i3 to have piece of mind.",

Either it wasn't connected properly or it has a poorly soldered conector.Yes, indeed the cable is not a standard 6-pin power cable, but is composed by 2 6-pin to sata male and female power cables.So in the middle of the cable, there is a male sata connector, connected to a female sata one, that ends to the psu with another 6-pin male connector.So, when i moved my rig to another location, the weak sata connector disconnected by mistake.",
