      "body": "Having a low range private key could put your funds at risk after revealing the public key, however if your private key is in a high enough range (256 bit range) to this date and for the 10 coming years in the future, there is no danger whatsoever. Think of it this way, your unused address is like a buried treasure, when you use it and send back the change to the same address is like digging the treasure out taking some coins from it and burying it again, now if anyone passes through and sees the fresh soil, they could dig and find it, unless you bury it so deep that digging it out could take years and so much energy.Above analogy is not completely relevant but it should give you an idea.

It's the best practice to use different newly generated addresses per transaction and use the wallet that has this feature and AFAIK, Electrum wallet has this kind of feature. I don't understand why only a public key that starts with 04 is shown, I think all can be seen publicly once it will broadcast in the blockchain.",

In simple terms it is not possible to reverse a public key to get the private key and put you at a risk. And if some day that becomes possible, Bitcoin as a whole is going to fall apart not just your address being at risk.This is of course assuming your wallet doesn't have any bugs (eg. your key was created randomly, the nonce when signing tx is chosen randomly, etc.).The only issue with reusing addresses is a privacy related one.",

However, there is a privacy issue with receiving bitcoins at the same address more than once. And, generally the only way to send bitcoins from the same address more than once is to receive them at that address more than once, or to have the change returned to the sending address (which is the same as receiving it more than once).A public key that begins with 04 is an uncompressed public key. There are no security issues with using uncompressed public keys.Perhaps the issue is this: to send bitcoins from an address, you must reveal its private public key. If the public key is revealed, then that is one less step needed to find the private key. However, the reduction in security from exposing the public key is not worth worrying about. The reduction of privacy from giving an address to multiple people is a much bigger problem (if it is even a problem at all).",

With current technology, no amount of time is sufficient to turn a public key in to a corresponding private key. It is perfectly safe to reveal your public key (and indeed, every used address has done exactly this), and it is not analogous to revealing the location of your treasure.Quote from: sheenshane on March 19, 2023, 11:20:28 PMbecause each time transaction was made, it's possible that your public key was revealed and could be publicly seen by anyone in the blockchain.It's not just possible - it's a necessity. You must reveal the public key as part of the signature. Without doing so, you cannot spend those coins.Quote from: sheenshane on March 19, 2023, 11:20:28 PMThat time, the address that you've used can be tracked and traced and it could be your wallet address is vulnerable to hacking or it could be at risk.This is not accurate. The address you have used is revealed on the blockchain the instant you first receive coins to it. And revealing the public key does not put that address at risk of being hacked.Quote from: sheenshane on March 19, 2023, 11:20:28 PMI don't understand why only a public key that starts with 04 is shownUncompressed public keys start with 04. Compressed public keys, which almost all software now uses, start with either 02 or 03.Quote from: odolvlobo on March 20, 2023, 07:06:38 AMPerhaps the issue is this: to send bitcoins from an address, you must reveal its private key.You've made a typo here.",

And when you need to spend one for paying something it can be joined with another one you didn't want to use for that transaction, if you don't pay attention. If you use an UTXO coming from a KYC platform it can be bad for your anonymity. If it comes from a darknet transaction, a mixer, a casino, a sex shop or something like that, it could hurt your privacy. While when you dedicate one address to one platform/use case and you label it rightly you are less likely to make this kind of mistake.",

It is your private key that an attacker can use to steal your funds, but then a public key being revealed whenever Bitcoins are spent from an address cannot be used to derive the private key belonging to that address, so the funds are safe.I am pretty sure you didn't read the earlier replies on this thread because all of these has been said already, the only thing your protect when you don't reuse addresses is your privacy.",
