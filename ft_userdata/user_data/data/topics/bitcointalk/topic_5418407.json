I am sure that back in the day, Satoshi Nakamoto never thought that 14 years after the WhitePaper got published, what he started as just a small fire can be creating an avalanche of support and for BTC to be recognized as an important asset that is now freely traded. What Satoshi simply dreamed of is now an unstoppable movement that nobody can stop and kill. Long love all Bitcoin lovers, supporters and enthusiasts.",
