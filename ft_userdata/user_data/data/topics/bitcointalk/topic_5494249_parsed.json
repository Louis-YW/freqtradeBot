  "content": "Bitcoin can not afford to reprogram its potentials values of being a non-custodial currencies hence it is a technological development created by an initiative individual who is known to be Satoshi Nakamoto.It is a financial system initiated without any sector of the government contributing to the structure neither being slated with any form of authority role in the system of the digital financial system as Bitcoin.And on no account would the potentialities and nature of Bitcoin would be flexible to be reformed such as to be centralized in other to justify the mistrusts of the people who are in doubt of it with the facts that Satoshi Nakamoto has remained unknown and yet the digital currency is non-custodian.I made this expressions because just in, a neighbor is f man who has been in good terms in a while now with me¬† asked if I can recommend him to any way she can Invest, have her funds secured and as much make profits.So I recommended Bitcoin to her which she acknowledged that she knows a little about it but her fear is that it is not a centralized technology and for that she has always felt insecured on the development.You can imagine that she told me to give her my words that if anything happens to her funds if invested that I will have to refund her. üòè. That was silly and I felt mad at her.And right then I clearly told her that I am not trying to introduce her to any of the Ponzi schemes so it is her choice to decide but all I can tell you(her) lastly about this is that your funds will be secured as long you (she) would stick to the terms I have explained to her after explaining the Pros and the Cons to her.Dear fellas, please I needed to know how you would feel if you were in my position basically where she said I would refund her if her funds gets lost becasue you recommended and introduced her to the system.",

To me she's not ready to go into investment and should focus on relatively stable income like salary. But if you really want to help her out You can assure her and set aside fund in case of a dip so you can pay her capital back and take it as a form of accumulation.

As for the safety I think it is a two way something, if she is scared of been her own bank then you can possibly tell her that there are centralized exchanges that holds your keys and also the great risk attached to it. If she doesn‚Äôt wants that which is a better option then you tell her straight up that bitcoin is a freedom from centralization or banking policies and if she isn‚Äôt willing to take that risk then the bitcoin space isn‚Äôt for her instead. Taking the risk of even keeping the funds for her is a risk I wouldn‚Äôt take for anyone. Bitcoin brings individual freedom to financial savings of you‚Äôre not ready then it‚Äôs better to stay away from it",

You don't also give anybody a guarantee that their funds are safe and it will also yield profit. Recently there have been cases of government attacking decentralization including wallets. Nobody knows the next wallet that might be seized by the government. We cannot also erase the fact that scammers and hackers are still on a rampage in the crypto industry. There is also no certainty that she would make a profit from her investment because Bitcoin price is unpredictable. She sounded as if she was doing you a favor or her Investment will also benefit you financially. If I were in your shoes, she would get no assurance from me.",

This will be going to happen when you talk to someone whose doubts are in their mind already and make them think you are a scammer because what they think about Bitcoin is a scam investment.

You are introducing an opportunity to someone, and it should be the person's responsibility to go and research and find out if the opportunity you are introducing to them is one that is good for them. Regardless of the relationship you have with someone it is advisable to advise them never to make investment decisions based on only recommendations without conducting their own research first. Introducing someone to an opportunity and then carrying the responsibility of taking blame if it goes bad is too much. It is better you do not introduce anyone to any opportunity",

Second, if he understands, tell him to make a decision of his own choice so that the blame does not fall on you.
