I don't know if any of such tool is in existence but based on the knowledge I've about Bitcoin, I can tell you that a scammer can only use it on a newbie by showing the person the transaction on the bitcoin flasher app. Once Bitcoin is spent on any genuine Bitcoin wallet, it cannot be reversed and all transactions are written on the blockchain.",

That is why you need to read more and be security cautious of your coins. The momenta transaction has been confirmed in the blockchain it remains permanent there and can't be deleted. What I only know is that one can send you bitcoin and in the process which the transaction his reflected in your wallet but not confirmed, he can stop the transaction after he knows that you have paid him. That is why it is advisable for one to confirm that his transaction has been successful before paying for whatever transaction that you did with bitcoin.",

You have the right to contact your account officer to know if such amount of money has entered your account before releasing your coins for buyers which, is among the things that made many people to love BTC transaction. I no fake alert is very common in some countries, but very easy to identify if someone is using fake alert to transact with you by checking your account balance at the moment before releasing the goods once the transactions is genuine. I will advise you not to be an hurry to release the money without you confirm the coins by checking your wallet very well to see the amount of BTC he or she has send to your wallet before releasing the cash.",
