I would praise other f he win not looking for something to critize. It’s because your thread is about bragging about your winnings with a touch of prostitute which usually happening on movie. This kind of story is very peculiar and no one will praise for this win because there’s nothing great here besides the fact that you won but the rest is just some bullshit bar story. You should post this on strippers club forum so that you can get support to other user that doing the same things as yours.This thread is explicit so it’s normal that you will get negative reply since this is gambling forum using crypto currency and not strip club forum. Still congratulations to your win and free hook up!",

You are not the only one who will win in this casino and you are lucky enough because you are one of those winners. But all I can say is that if you want to share your experience about using or playing this casino it's better not to create another thread but instead replying the Announcement thread in duelbits. But as I observe you are so happy or overwhelmed because of your win so that's the reason why you created this.",
