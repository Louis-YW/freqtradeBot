There are some factors that contribute to the movement of the Bitcoin price, such as bad or good economic news, that could either cause the market to spike or fall, but the price movement of Bitcoin doesn't mean it's controlled. Also, war and pandemics can affect Bitcoin's price movement. From what I know, Bitcoin is decentralized and not regulated or managed by any organization. Altcoins price movement could be controlled by the project itself; for instance, they could add or remove liquidity from their token.",

How does it work?I think that one reason that coin prices move in tandem is that people invest in different coins for the same reasons, so they make the same short-term investment decisions regardless of the coin.As for being controlled, I don't see how that would be feasible without being publicly visible. There might be one or more coins whose prices are manipulated, but I don't think that manipulation can exist across many coins.",

      "body": "I was thinking that bitcoin's massive rise, could have been fueled by many around the world withdrawing money from their bank accounts to buy bitcoin instead. The crash of silicon valley bank has to leave consumers concerned about whether a bank run will occur. Whether they will have access to their money if FDIC insurance isn't upheld. This could lead to mass withdrawals with consumers seeking other assets in which to store their wealth.We won't know for certain exactly what happened until more data is available. There are a few generic scenarios which can typically explain most price movements. Of which, most have been known for many years. Many of the things people believe are \"new\" have been around for decades. People simply did not know about them until now.",

It might the reason Bitcoin is the most widely traded cryptocurrency, and as such, changes in its price can have a ripple effect on the prices of other cryptocurrencies due to liquidity effects.  Or it could be many altcoins are traded against Bitcoin on cryptocurrency exchanges, which can also contribute to the correlation between their prices.For being controlled?It might possible to manipulate because Bitcoin isn't immune to manipulation, it can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, supply and demand dynamics, and geopolitical events.  Or possibly it causes by large investors or traders who may be able to influence the price of Bitcoin through their trading activity or by spreading rumors or false information, IMO.",

But in my opinion, the cryptocurrency market is still very new and small, so being manipulated by the rich is inevitable. I believe what's going on in the market is largely controlled and manipulated rather than supply and demand, because if volatility were due to supply and demand, it wouldn't have volatility as much. Every market will have manipulation, but with crypto, there will be more than others.",

But once I shift the price of my coins in my mobile price tracking app to Bitcoin rather than USD, it shows that while Bitcoin is actually in green, the altcoins are all in red. When I set the prices in USD, all of them are in green. It's only because Bitcoin's price is really surging that the altcoins, even if they're falling in their prices in terms of sats, are still net green in terms of USD.",

How does it work?yep. its called arbitragingwhere people dont just day trade left and right between btc<>usdbut instead play the wider marketsusd>btc>eth>usd>btcusd<btc<eth<usd<btcwhat you notice iseach market/community(coin) should have its own 'price discovery' of its own community/utility/desires/speculations/benefitshowever if the community is weak/low/uninterested. their own market 'price discovery' efforts do not move much. meaning it allows other coins arbitraging effort to affect the altcoin market more than the altcoins own price discovery efforts can defend against other coins arbitragebitcoin is strong so yes bitcoin over powers weak altcoins. when bitcoiners arbitrage between the markets.. here is the thing.ethereum has locked up most funds into \"stake\" meaning their community is passive rewarding itself new coins. but not then able to trade those coins on the market.. thus has become less price discovery independent due to their weak market. their stake is locked until they release code to allow stake unlocking (so people can actually spend their passive rewards)this means ethreums price speculation is controlled by bitcoin. and is being artificially held up by bitcoinersbut wait until those who staked can unstake. then there will be a wave of people selling coins on eth and breaking the shadow tracing arbitrage of bitcoin . here is another thingwhen ethereum switched to pos. the underlying cost of creating new coin dropped by 95% meaning there should have been a correction of price discover by a 20x drop/correctionhowever due to the lack of 'unstaking' the arbitraging of markets. that correction has been delayedbut as soon as unstaking is allowed and people can then sell their eth where lots of eth suddenly hits the market. expect the 20x correctionthe eth-btc ratio will change from 14:1 to 280:1meaning instead of ~$1.6k eth it will be ~$80eths underlying price discovery of cost of coin reward is about $40 a coin.. down from 800 a coinso right now eth is artificially marketed at a 40x of valuewhich pre pos it was price discovering at only/ever a speculation of ~1.5x-6xthus yes eth is going to correct",

But just like other investment markets, the crypto market cannot be separated from government influence and economic sentiment as well as the role of whales which often affect the crypto market and make it appear unstable. Due to these various external influences, it seems that the crypto market is in control, but it is not controlled at all.",
