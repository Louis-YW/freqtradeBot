  "content": "Just as the title of this thread,  your investment will burn when you accumulate more shit coin than Bitcoin, most of us newbie think that since shit coin gives higher return, they actually don't know that investing in shit coin instead of Bitcoin is suicidal.Let's take a look at the market today, Bitcoin is trading at $41800-42500, but almost all the shit coin as the name implies have fall drastically from grace. They don't know  that altcoin fall more than they rise, and most times it will totally refuse to return back to the price you actually bought it, and you will be forced to sell at a loss.Think of those guys that have DCA into Bitcoin for years, how profitable they would have been now.In other not to get burned, start DCA into Bitcoin now and seat by and prepare for harvest during the bull run.",

But it’s all left with anyone who want to make an investment to decide which one they want to invest on it’s there money and there personal decision, and just so you know there are altcoins which are consider shitcoins that are worth investing on, not all are completely useless so we can still make few right choices but those are risk which anyone who want to get involved in it are going to take. Few shitcoins are worth investing on and taking profit when the time is right but they are not meant to be kept and hold for long period of time because as soon as the hype is over the coin will continuously keep losing value.",

It was never pumped, even though Bitcoin reached ATH again. Probably the team scammed us; hence, many exchanges delisted them and lost funds forever. After that, I am not much interested in altcoins, especially shitcoins. Even when I invest in altcoins for a short period of time, I only invest in the top coins. But I always prefer to invest in Bitcoin, definitely. It will recover once a day, whereas shitcoins never recover their prices.",

A year later it doubled and briefly reached $400 but you had to be lucky to sell at the top. Since May 2021 it kept going down an now is going for $50. If you turned your BSV into bitcoin in 2019, you made a lot of profit, but if you held you lost a lot. At the same time I got rid of BCH that I got for free as well. I sold in 2019 @ $400 and again turned it into bitcoin. The coin had its moment in 2021 when it went to $1,5k but again you had to be lucky to dump it all into euphoria. Instead I turned 2 BCH into 1 BTC in 2019 and even at current prices that BTC is worth 4x what I paid for it, but BCH is worth 40% less than what I sold it for. It's just 2 examples of how shitcoins do against bitcoin. You can get lucky and get a brief moment when they outperform bitcoin but most of the time it will be the other way round.",

Little do they know, yes, it is an attractive and eye-catching coin, but the thing is, these coins are meant for beginners, thinking that they could earn from it as the price is not much and affordable. But that's the trap. Some shitcoins or memecoins either scam or just one time ATH and will fall drastically. If you are a good trader or flip coins, you know when to buy this coin and take advantage of its one-time ATH, which is a good time to sell the asset before it falls down. Many traders do this, but the thing is, it's too risky and dangerous. Without enough charts or technical analysis, you will not find the opportunity to earn and end up losing, and beginners are not meant for this kind of method of investing.",

They might turn shitcoin on you and that'll be lose of profit and capital, in the end the investor becomes worse off than when he bought the altcoin. We can not overemphasize that Bitcoin, remains the best crypto coin to invest in, because it has proven it's worth to that regard, aside from Bitcoin, it'll have to be top altcoins, that have also proven that they can withstand the pressures of bear runs, and will always make it to bull runs and be profitable to investors.",
