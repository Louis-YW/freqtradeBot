Similar to $25K, this is a level where many speculators believe price might be strongly rejected, because the previous strong support level could well turn into new resistance. There is otherwise the argument that above this level Bitcoin is confirming a U-shaped recovery, with a target of up to 80% to the upside.",

Definitely our thinking and speculation was that bitcoin would reach $30000. It is now $30000 and what people would be thinking about now is if bitcoin will continue to rise or not, or if bear market is going to follow.In my opinion, I think bitcoin price may still rise further, but if it happens like how it happened while it was at $28000, it was a strong support price that made the bull market to continue further and hit $30000 today. If bitcoin do not fall or rising back to $30000, I will be expecting $35000 to be the next support price. But I checked the monthly BB, all I think is that it is possible for bitcoin to increase to $35000 before falling again. Even if bitcoin may not increase further for now. It would be a good idea for people to still continue to DCA. I do not know about other people but I myself is believing in long term speculation and price increase, that bitcoin will hit over $100000 after the next bull market. Which means bull market would still be the overall result after long term holding.",

Waiting for another 2 to 4 weeks before this $35k happens I guess but if this again is another bear market bull run, it will already be diving to $25K without hitting $35k.",

The increase in the price of Bitcoin towards $ 30,000 has made many traders excited again, but in dealing with this situation traders must be careful because this is a strong psychological number, don't get caught in this position. Traders have to be careful not to buy at high prices because that is like catching a falling sword for me because the market still likes to spin circles around psychological resistance or support.

Which after this there will be a pump in the price which will make it hit 35k and above but it will take sometime,maybe three or four weeks from now. We have seen how investors are dumping USD and stacking their funds into bitcoin which makes me believe that the more people are using bitcoin as a store of value,the demand will increase with low supply, all these will make the price move up to 35k soonest.

Imagine how many high margin longs are in huge profit right now and are getting greedy? Also a lot of the indicators are pointing to a correction on 4hr and 1 day charts. I don't think it will be a large correction, maybe 2 - 5%, or a sharp one with a quick recovery to liquidate longs. It would be a very odd occurrence if there is no correction at this point though.

I tend to agree with this speculation, if from the moment after reaching ATH, bitcoin starts to fall, the bear season is only 1.5 years long, and if the market cycle repeats, we are still too far from the new season bull.Bitcoin also increased continuously in the first 3 months of the year, and there has been no major correction. People are getting very excited and starting to believe that bears are giving up and we are entering a bull cycle, this is the right time for whales to take profits. I would still be more cautious than believe in a larger uptrend.",

Market structure - Short term highs taken consistently and Higher lows created means where currently on a short term bullish until proven wrong. From where is price right now it could create another short term low at $23-25k ish  before going higher if bullishness is still supported. 2. The noted S/R level  is truly a significant level that how the price would react to that would be beneficial for future price moves. Would it reject? Consolidates? Breaks? 3. Volume- green candles are not yet supported by the expected volume for bullishness which gives a tendency to consolidate and create another low first. 4. Heatmap- it simply indicates liquidity and orders in the marketplace. You can see there are more orders below market place that what is above.Remember. The goal is not to be right. The goal is to get in line with the marketplace when the direction is clear and right. Don't force any price action to materialize. When it is clear, it will be obvious. Anything could happen.",

It seems to me that if bitcoin changed its trend, it is likely to continue to move upwards with small corrections and in the next quarter the price could be for example 40k. If 20k happens again, then all the previous growth was a bull trap or a dead cat bounce. A 50% drop is not a correction.",

It's still to early for the big bull run, halvening is 1 year away.I agree that Bitcoin tends to reverse direction once momentum has been lost, hence price has increased dramatically since the bearish momentum was lost. I also agree that it's too early for a big bull run. I also see a bear market relief rally to $50K at best, prior to falling back down to $25K/$30K.  This would then further confirm the long-term bear market with a lower high.Quote from: bittraffic on April 12, 2023, 03:04:14 AM$35k will be oversold in the weekly chart and it will dip again slowly that it take months before it will hit the bottom at around $25k or probably just $26k. before going up again to $40k. I also noticed price is getting oversold overbought on Weekly chart, based on RSI. This makes $30K a relatively important \"make or break\" price. Either price breaks through this level into overbought like in 2019 at $6K, in order to be able to move considerably higher in a parabolic fashion, or we see the correction in order to cool off, that could well take a few months.Quote from: TravelMug on April 12, 2023, 03:19:38 AMWe can't just go on parabolic rise, sooner or later we will have a correction. So most likely we might go $20k'ish again before another leg up. That's how the market moves in the past.Worth pointing out that in the most recent past, the year after a 1 year long bear market, price did in fact go parabolic and retrace 62% of the downside move, despite most people's expectations that it wasn't possible. There were notable corrections during that parabolic move, but they were short lived, unlike the correction to $20K that definitely broke the previous parabolic momentum. Ultimately we've already see one parabolic move from around $17K to $23K, so it can't be that out of the question to see another, logically speaking.Quote from: CarnagexD on April 12, 2023, 01:02:21 PM3. Volume- green candles are not yet supported by the expected volume for bullishness which gives a tendency to consolidate and create another low first. Well spotted. This current move to $30K certainly isn't supported by strong volume. In fact there has been decreasing volume since November last year, despite the near 2x in price.  To me this suggests that this current move isn't the volatile high volume move that we are yet to see. The only questions remains is whether the return of high volume will be bullish or bearish, as high volume is rarely neutral.",
