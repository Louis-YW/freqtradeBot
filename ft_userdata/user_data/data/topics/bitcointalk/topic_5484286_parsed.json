My guess is, it's gonna be like the general tech industry. It's male dominated but we've slowly seen an increase of women as the industry expanded so I'm expecting an increase on crypto space too as it gets more popular.

I think there's an edge for the female crypto personalities since this is likely a male-dominated market. There could be simp or what not but that's not the whole point of it when a truly influential female comes to defend the community and knows how-to on this market.Quote from: rat03gopoh on February 06, 2024, 12:58:58 PMSo, gender isn't something serious.I agree, it doesn't really matter at all and it seems that all of us here, both genders are just equal.

Crypto is one of rare remaining places where we don't have this toxic thing. I actually never thought that there is very few women in crypto. Yeah, there is less than men, but not so few that it would be a problem actually. And as you say, staying anonymous is a thing in crypto, no matter that someone would like to change it, some people just don't want to disclose their identity, gender.Equal rights is great thing, but in most cases you won't have 50/50 ratio of man and women, no matter it's crypto, science, sports, art or something.

This, just like the market, is a self-regulating phenomenon, and if there are women who want to build a career in this field, then if they have the abilities and talents, they will very quickly become famous and influential personalities. In a world of equal rights, everyone has equal rights, right?The gender doesn't need the help of powerful women to accept crypto. Women should embrace cryptocurrencies not because of other women in the industry, but because of the technical or financial opportunities that cryptocurrencies provide. Simply put, if you want to buy a cryptocurrency, do it not out of gender solidarity, but based on technical analysis.",

For example, Gracy Chen, a thought leader in the crypto space, whose insights are impressive. Her expertise demonstrates the potential for women to thrive in this industry. Although more work needs to be done to make crypto and blockchain more inclusive, the accomplishments of these pioneering women are encouraging. Their leadership can inspire more female participation and advancement in this important emerging field.https://www.techopedia.com/women-in-crypto-bitget-gracy-chen",

Cryptocurrencies are generally dominated by men rather than women, so if women are able to engage with the platform and carry out various activities, they will certainly be appreciated for their work. If a list of the best Bitcoin investors were to be made, there would certainly be a number of female investors who are big investors. You have to respect the courage and risk-taking nature of women doing such great work in a place where women are considered relatively weaker than men. There are many women investors who are idols of many and are followed by many.",

I don't know why people feel that there are fewer women who are into crypto. Personally, for me, I don't feel that way; I believe that there are so many women in the crypto space too. Even in my country, I know that there are so many young ladies who are very interested in Bitcoin and crypto, as long as it is something that they feel is safe to put in their money, they are ready to invest. I believe that men have the heart to risk a lot, while women cannot risk a lot because they want to protect their money with whatever they have so that the money they have managed to save doesn't slip from them, but that doesn't mean that there are fewer women in the space. Women also have brains like men to be able to know what Bitcoin is and blockchain technology, so they don't need a woman influencer in the crypto space before they can key into the space. They are already doing so, without your notice.",

A decade ago it would've been difficult to name more than 1 or 2 off the top of my head. If people think there isn't enough women in crypto they should pay more attention and follow a more diverse set of people on social media. It is clearly a thriving demographic.",

Yes, if we will compare, there are more men than women who do crypto currencies, and we don't know the exact reason for that, but maybe because men are more on the internet and like to explore as their hobbies are gaming or what, while women are more focused on other stuff like aesthetics or something like that. Also, as we know, crypto currency is just for strong will and a strong mind, so women tend to be more fragile than men, so they can't take the stress and anxiety crypto currency may bring. But we aren't gatekeeping or limiting women from accessing or doing crypto currency; it is just that in reality, more men are emerging into complex things such as crypto currency.",

Sweeping generalisation, of course, as the names you've mentioned are technical career women (and not also dismissing the content/media etc. categories).It's an age-old issue in tech and engineering. You just don't get enough interest or support. That's grassroots education, not something a specific industry can really change.My region learnt long ago you don't just fill up universities with women in the areas you feel they're underrepresented (I remember in the 90s 9:1 ratio of women to men in unis in a lot of technical faculties, and yet majority of women graduates ended up not choosing a career in the field). Change, if they truly feel is needed, also has to come from within, no?",

Even the female fashion industry is dominated by men. I think men can access funds more than women so they can easily invest in any sector. Another reason might also be that men are more focused on business than women who are sometimes distracted by childraising and home keeping. I totally agree with your position that the crypto space is nondiscriminatory which means everybody is free to be part of the industry. However, speaking from the happenings in my location, it will be difficult for a large number of women to get involved in the crypto business because many of them don't have the same opportunities most men have because of religious and cultural sentiments.",
