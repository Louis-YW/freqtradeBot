I asked few ppl on other forums and nobody knew/answered this, lol...I am not a specialist, so the following thoughts will be based on my own limited understanding of how the lightning network works. To receive and send payments on Lightning Network, you first need to open a payment channel with someone. Opening a channel means creating 2-of-2 multisig transaction where one of the keys belongs to you and the other to your counterparty. In order to sign your part of the transaction, your wallet should have access to a corresponding private key, which in the case of a watch-only wallet, it obviously doesn't have. So, from my understanding of what's going on, you can't create channels with watch-only wallets. Actually, I tried open a channel in watch-only Electrum, but it said \"Lightning is not enabled for this wallet.\" I couldn't find an option to somehow enable it, maybe I should have funded my test wallet first, I don't know. It works with standard wallets, though, without changing any settings.",
