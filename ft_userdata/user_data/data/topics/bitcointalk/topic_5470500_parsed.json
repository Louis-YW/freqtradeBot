  "content": "The increment or will I say the rate at which young girls jump in and out of marriage lately is something that have given me sleepless nights ever since the girl I so much loved left me for marriage 4 years ago, came back seeking for forgiveness. I can vividly remember that fateful day she came to my house, bluntly told me she's no longer in love with me, she loves someone else, she's getting married to him. I was bewildered, that's the least thing I expect from my girl, I asked why? one of the multiple reasons that captured my heart is I haven't taken her to my parents, well as the other man have introduce her to his mum. Here she's devastated I only knew my girl have fallen in the hands of peer pressure \"marriage\" . I tried to call my girl back to senses -- you've just met this guy barely three months ago and you had already made up your mind to get married to him, you haven't known tangible things about this man of course --- she shun me, proudly said I have no right to contribute to her life anymore, she continuously aired out her grievances, myself deliberately knew she had already moved on before coming to announce the news to me. I helplessly watched my little girl walk away from me in tears and never came back, it was over between us.Four years later, she calls. hello guess who's on the line, ...... It's Becky. You have been with my number all this years and you failed to call me, why calling me now, i replied. We made out time to meet and she opens up to tell me she's no longer in the marriage, money is not everything I've come to realize she said.¬† Amongst all her pleas the highest plea she made to me is I should not ask her to go back to the marriage. we can still be friends this and that.I'm in a position to settle or to shatter a broken home, she is vulnerable, she has a thousand reason not to be in the marriage, I do also have a thousand reason to make her go back to the marriage she chose over true love. I loved her she knows that's why she came back. I need help...... What would you do if you found yourself in this kinda hectic situation.",

I don't because there is no moderators in the local board your just turned the board to social media to tell stories of different kinds. Op if these are the kind threads you will like to create then I will encourage you to do more. Because you don't want to read what others are doing to get merit and rank. I thank God that you are Marriage counselor but here we discuss bitcoin and not Marriage. So keep the marriage issues aside from the local board. You can present it in the general boards and attract more viewers to your profile to receive different tags.",

I loved her she knows that's why she came back. I need help...... What would you do if you found yourself in this kinda hectic situation. The reason be sey once a man ask a lady for marriage now, you go see most of girls dey like use that small opportunity wey dem get to rush dem self into marriage because of the population of single girls wey they now na em make some them they do that.And they many for girls wey just they rush into marriage because of wetin man get and once a man realise sey na em money you dey after he no go dey see your value again, and some men sef no dey get shishi dey go just fake life give girl so that him go marry her, na after marriage the girl go con dey suffer.But wetin me I con understand for dis ur post be sey the girl no leave you to enter street to flex life, she leave you to start her own family because she think sey you no take her matter serious. Abi u don't know sey single girls full street now? person wey u get better plan for why you no go introduce her to your family?No be every matter we go dey blame girls sey they like Money even you as you no get money that time you like yourself? Normally even if na boyfriend and girlfriend relationship una dey do you suppose get money true love no dey too sweet without money.",

You know that many people are here for cryptocurrency and BTC purpose, and they want to see things that related to cryptocurrency or BTC so that they will know if there is a good news in the crypto market. I will advise you to run for your dear life because, for such woman to leave her marriage to return back to her x show that she discovered something she want to collect from your home you give her the opportunity. Maybe she no that you're into BTC investment that made her to take that step to your side because women nowadays are after money not love again, and no one want to help a man to build like the a way our mothers help our fathers to build.",

No be lie bro. This post suppose land here for Politics and society board¬†  so that even if person dey high, the person fit still see say no be local board.

My simple suggestion is to stay away. If to say that your babe na small pikin when she take that decision to leave you like underage then you fit easily consider to look into the opata wey she dey yawn from her mouth but that one no still mean say you go automatically accept her, just be careful.",

      "body": "Sounded like you have already analyzed it well. Remember that she is already married this time. The man who she married might come after her any moment and you don't wanna be in the middle of their domestic fight. Not a word nor a pipsqueak sound in between them, just let her go back. You have no role there. It's already 4 years ago, that's too long and you more than likely forget about her. You may have already been with several girls since that time.",

I don't intend to demean your thread but I think this is an off topics and these thread is not related in any form to why this forum was created and has nothing tangible to educate us on this platform. So I think you should bring up topics that concerns the economy and other relevant information that will bring about people's opinion and views",
