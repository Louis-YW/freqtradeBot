I've crossed out the addresses that don't contain the USDTs but it's on that last one. It currently have the $103,533. I'm curious as to how they've recovered the $4999 or they've just stopped the withdrawal. The two crossed out addresses had the last transaction from 60-70 days while the one that contains the USDTs, are just active a day ago. The money is already on the possession of the hacker/scammer and it's not reversible but still wishes you all the best if there's any possible way they can help you getting it back.",

If the address belongs to an exchange. OP still has the chance of getting back the funds.The only people who can help him in this case are the law enforcement and the exchange the hacker might use.",

Both for the fraudster and also for the OP. I am quite doubtful that the authorities will react by insisting on returning the tokens to the original owner. if that were to happen, a long period would be needed for such a thing.",

He just have to report this to the authorities at the right designation so that they can act too quick before the scammer sends and trades it.Quote from: abrarrk on December 20, 2022, 11:31:07 PMThank you for the information. Can you tell me in which exchange this is?Sorry but that can't be known. It's different from Ethereum that we can know where the funds have landed and sent. But maybe there are some other technical experts here that can help this out.",
