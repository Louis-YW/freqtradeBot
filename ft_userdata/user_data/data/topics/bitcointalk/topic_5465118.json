I'm assuming it would be the same with Bitcoin. I assume that too, as what they use in analysing the stock market is the data that has been made readily available. The same way the humans who built it can't be accurate with exact stock and crypto market prices, the same thing will be applicable with the AI prediction. QuoteIn terms of anonymity within the Bitcoin blockchain, Machine learning can be used to track down transactions for fraudulent services and possibly help control the illegal activities transacted through bitcoin? I think we already have a similar thing at work currently on most of the crypto currency exchanges, which they use to detect some blacklisted addresses on their exchange. That is, any deposit that came directly from a blacklisted address or was somehow connected to a blacklisted address that was recently flagged for scam is usually detected by most exchanges, and the funds are held for further investigation. The only difference I think the AI might make in respect to this is to be a little faster in linking an address to any form of scam history they might have, which ordinarily any human won't be fast at doing. So to answer your questions: No, I don't think the AI will be much of a help in tracking or tackling fraudulent activity going on right now in the crypto space.",

In term of network modification in future there might be the possibilities but I thnk it will start a new debate as well.Quote from: Smeet on August 30, 2023, 08:08:53 PMIn terms of predictive analytics, I'm sure AI has been tried and tested to predict stock prices & etc, and failed.

I doubt that machine learning would would work better than traditional methods. Like, you might be able to find a darknet service wallet by noticing that a large percentage of incoming and outgoing transactions are passing through mixers. You don't need AI to do this. Also AI might fail at the task on un-mixing, because it's too complicated and too difficult to train the model when there's not a lot of good data. It's possible that AI will eventually be used in some aspects of Bitcoin, but don't expect some technological singularity from the combination of two - AI is just a tool for working with data. Chances are the application of AI in Bitcoin will be something very boring for most users.",

No kind of technology will hinder the growth of bitcoin technology as it will adopt all kind of secured way to make the technology secured as for the cryptography. Developers will make softfork or hardfork when a bug and insecurities is detected. It's the same on the banking sectors.Quote from: Smeet on August 30, 2023, 08:08:53 PMIn terms of predictive analytics, I'm sure AI has been tried and tested to predict stock prices & etc, and failed.

With the role of a business, both can be adopted simultaneously. AI is applied to help create products or services efficiently, while bitcoin is a type of payment.From this point on, the influence of the presence of these two technologies is the user experience itself. So the right question is \"do ML, AI and Bitcoin help or hinder users in business?\".",

Imagine getting a security system that learns from patterns and behaviors made by malicious actors to flag you if someone comes around. That would be one of the most awesome things you can expect to do with AI and machine learning on crypto. Another would be the integration of AI and machine learning in trading, investment, and financial advisements. Having an expert behind your back is an indispensable tool especially for stuff like bitcoin and crypto in general. Making these experts bias-free and ever-learning is the cherry on top that makes every investor confident about their purchase and sale decisions since after all, it came from AI and machines that are tailor-fitted to do these stuff for breakfast",

I'm assuming it would be the same with Bitcoin.AI will have its advances and certain aspects that characterize it will be strengthened, but we are still far from seeing a joint collaboration with technologies such as bitcoin. It would be better to redirect this type of artificial intelligence towards a field of security rather than prediction, since the The truth is that these are based in large part on saving data that they supply or that they carry as they learn about the environment for which they were created, that is why it probably failed when it was tried to be used to predict prices, because these movements are totally involuntary, and they do not always have a constant sequence, causing the response of this technology to be incorrect by not being able to deduce the next movement... Just imagine, even the most experienced person in this area sometimes fails... for the AI ​​it would be printing wrong answers constantly. For this reason, I think it would be better, if you want to incorporate AI into the world of cryptocurrencies, take it to the security area of ​​the platforms where we decide to store our assets so that it acts as an impediment to hacking...I think it could be an alternative",

Machine learning and Artificial intelligence has real potential in the future of the industrial market over the crypto market.AI can't predict future outcomes, it can only can draw a result based on the input data we have so it's like a statistical answer but the accuracy is unpredictable cause the nature of crypto prices is always unpredictable which is beyond the patterns for the records.Bitcoin itself isn't anonymous, its pseudo-anonymous, and all the data are stored in a public ledger which can be seen by anyone in the world so it is not going to break the anonymity but as mentioned above there are better ways there to trace the fraudulent transaction.",
