  "content": "Mailchimp again was hacked, exposing DigitalOcean customer's email address,QuoteAt Mailchimp, the security of our users’ data is our top priority.Across the tech industry, malicious actors are increasingly deploying an array of sophisticated phishing and social engineering tactics targeting data and information from crypto-related companies. In response to a recent attack targeting Mailchimp’s crypto-related users, we’ve taken proactive measures to temporarily suspend account access for accounts where we detected suspicious activity while we investigate the incident further. We took this action to protect our users’ data, and then acted quickly to notify all primary contacts of impacted accounts and implement an additional set of enhanced security measures. We did not suspend accounts based on their industry, and we are committed to continuing to serve crypto companies. We are reviewing our Standard Terms of Use and Acceptable Use Policy in light of our commitment to bringing innovative crypto solutions to our customers.We realize this may have caused uncertainty for our crypto-related users and their customers and apologize for the disruption. We are continuing our investigation and proactively providing impacted users with timely and accurate information throughout the process.https://mailchimp.com/august-2022-security-incident/And as per DigitalOcean,Quote- On August 8th, DigitalOcean discovered that our Mailchimp account had been compromised as part of what we suspect to be a wider Mailchimp security incident that affected their customers, targeted at crypto and blockchain. - From that Mailchimp incident, we suspect certain DigitalOcean customer email addresses may have been exposed. Out of an abundance of caution, we are currently sending email communications to those impacted. -  A very small number of DigitalOcean customers experienced attempted compromise of their accounts through password resets. These customers’ accounts have been secured, and have been contacted directly. - As of August 9th, we have migrated email services away from Mailchimp. - No customer information other than email address was compromised, however, we recommend increased vigilance against phishing attempts in the coming weeks, in addition to enabling two-factor authentication on your DigitalOcean account. https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/digitalocean-response-to-mailchimp-security-incidentThis is not the first time that email servicing Mailchimp have been breached, April 2022, they have been compromised as well,https://twitter.com/Trezor/status/1510558771944333312And so the attack on mailing services have been increasing this last couple of months and the hackers getting most of crypto related emails. And this could be another 1 -> end customer.DigitalOcean for example have notified their users that there could be phishing attacks in the coming weeks as a result of this.",

      "body": "Here we go again, with yet another mailmarketing platform to be breached in recent times. There is yet no apparent reference to the amount of crypto related companies affected, nor the extend of the breached data. DigitalOcean claims that, in their case, it was \"only\" the email, but it’s never just that really. At the bare minimum, the fact that the breached emails belong are customers/prospects for a certain company and/or industry is a big added value for phishing purposes.Prior to Mailchimp’s statement, those crypto companies that were finding their account inaccessible thought it was an arbitrary action on Mailchimp’s behalf against their crypto clients, and so the media played along with this idea. Now they are selling it as a preventive action (probably more on the post event than on the pre event side of things).Anecdotally (or not), their Acceptable Use Policy went from (2018,when crypto clause was introduced):QuoteSome industries have higher-than-average abuse complaints, which can jeopardize the deliverability of our entire system.

This is mean they have no choice either follow the exchanges or accept the risk, if the exchanges track the email with the real name, then they might freeze the clients money.Though I can't search about an accusation related to this case for back up my words.",

I mean Mailchimp’s hack/leak was essentially sized-up around the 12/08/2022 at the latest, as per this released information. Today is the 19th, and we’re yet to see corporate names pouring-in, besides the known few.Presumably, we’re talking about 214 affected corporations on this occasion, and although it will down to these companies to communicate the events to their in turn affected customers/leads, being prompt is essential to minimize potential phishing damages. One would have expected that, by now, plenty more corporate names would be known, had they moved to action to communicate with those affected.",

I think email users should activate 2fa for their accounts to add an extra security layer.If by user you mean end-user, like you and me, then having 2FA on our personal email has nothing to do with this incident really. Where 2FA does provide some further security, whilst not being invulnerable, is if was added to Mailchip’s corporate customer’s accounts.Say you and me were amongst DigitalOcean’s customers. Our contact information would be likely stored somewhere at DigitalOcean, and again at Mailchimp in order to carry out DigitalOcean’s email marketing campaigns or such.Now if you and me have 2FA on our email account won’t manage to contribute anything towards our data being leaked from Mailchimp, nor receiving potential phishing emails. What does make it more difficult is for hackers to access DigitalOcean’s account on Mailchimp, were 2FA to be set by DigitalOcean on their Mailchimp account.… Nevertheless … if we are talking about some hacker that managed to obtain access to a Mailchimp’s employee’s account, as seems to be the case, we may presume that the employee’s account could have privilages to access data for Mailchimp’s corporate accounts (i.e. DigitalOcean), with disregard to them (DigitalOcean) having 2FA on or off on their account. Afterall, support tends to need to look into customer’s data and configuration, and it would seem weird that they were impeded because of a customer 2FA setting. This is my speculation, but seemingly reasonable.What could have helped is for employee accounts themselves to have 2FA access to the Mailchimp’s overall system, and to be required to connect through a VPN from a fixed set of firewall approved IPs (perhaps with 2FA on the VPN login itself).",
