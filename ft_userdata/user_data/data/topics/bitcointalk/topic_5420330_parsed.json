Or by that you meant trading, but for you to turn that into a full time job you need to be an excellent trader, and you can become that only after years of hard work, learning and a lot of money lost in the process.

Wise people keep both until they're able to survive for so long daily with what they have made with their investments.Quote from: Tommiewill on November 10, 2022, 06:15:03 AMIf you were fired by the company, would you still find a job you love as quickly as possible?Or you might choose to relax your mind and look for work again after a while.I'll take my time to relax and at the same time upskill so that I'll get paid higher than the last time my company has fired me. It doesn't sound good if the next employer you'll have or for the next job interview you'll have,you'll say that you've been fired.That's why, unwinding would be a good thing to do just after that frustration.Quote from: Tommiewill on November 10, 2022, 06:15:03 AMDo you have better advice for work?Work while you can but don't forget to make investments because you won't be working forever.",

There are times when we must try to control ourselves and think about a mature decision to start over with a new job and a new atmosphere. Therefore, the self-calming phase is often effective rather than having to rush to find another job quickly but the mental state and mind are still present in the old job.I speak from experience, and so far the process of resting my mind for a while has made me much more mature in making decisions.

Eh, I couldn't even say it's risky since I don't know exactly what OP means--switching your job for \"full-time investment in cryptocurrency\" just doesn't compute.  I'd say if you've got a job, stick with it if you want to eat.  If you're trading crypto right now or have been in the last couple of days, yikes!  I can't imagine doing that as a job, but I bet you there are members here who do just that.  Now is the time to be saving money IMO, particularly if you have a job that might be in jeopardy.  This economy is really spooky if you ask me, so that old advice of having at least 6 months worth of living expenses set aside for emergencies sounds very wise (if you can manage it; I never could).",

From what they told me, good traders shouldn't really care that much whether its bull or bear market as long there is some volatility and there wasn't lack of that lately. As a matter of fact, that pro guy I know performs better during bear market as he is better at shorting. But yeah I have to agree with you, I can't imagine doing that for a job and I would rather do the most tedious manual job than that as I simply don't have the stomach and patience for it. DCA+hold worked pretty good for me so no need to change the approach.",

Cryptocurrencies are risky, whether it is a bear market or a bull market, there is no guarantee that you will always win in the market. If you have crypto knowledge and skills, you can apply for jobs in startups or blockchain companies, that would be a good idea. Never think that investing in bitcoin or becoming a day trader will replace your main job.Crisis and unemployment are happening everywhere, if you are still an employee of the company, try to give your best instead of thinking that there will be a better place for you right now.",

I agree, and the important point in investing is not to make it your main income and what you have to realize is that investment cannot be used as your main income because all forms of investment are for a certain period of time. Both short term and long term unless you trade it you can do it full time but it's not that easy.doing online work is not difficult, you can do it according to your ability or expertise or many examples are done by many people and you can learn it depending on your effort and hard work because you know your abilities better, and nothing is difficult unless you are lazy. And in the current situation we have to be smart and creative to produce.",

Before I forget, beware of scammers.Another point is talking on full time cryptocurrency investment, how is this possible ? Do you have people you know that are doing it? This is not easy to do, you need to have some business that you can take up incase something goes wrong with your crypto investment.

That is why we must have other sources of income apart from our regular jobs. Actually, if we have prepared this from the beginning we will not be confused to find steps if we have to be dismissed from the company where we work. Previously a lot of time for us to work on our own skills and try to do business as a side job. However, this has become a habit, including myself, who will only start if the situation is really urgent, such as being fired from the company.To work full time in cryptocurrency investing will require a huge amount of capital. And it must be remembered that investing will not always be profitable. So there will be a very big risk too if you do this without any other financial source.",

There are people thinking that they are living comfortably with their 9-5 job in a private company but then they will realize how vulnerable they are to be laid off at any time. It is quite scary if you would ask me unless you are working under the government. While I work full time, I do freelancing sometimes and what I freelance varies from mini web dev services (some small fixes to websites) to something more.....easier which is just data entry. Sure, it would be a little bit less of an income compared to what I earn full-time, but at least I would still be sane after accomplishing both sides. From that, if I was laid off from my 9-5 job, I would not hustle myself finding another one and I could put my mind at ease while applying for job.",

Government and private sector jobs are currently unpredictable, therefore every worker should have a plan B or business idea that can be executed at any given time. I have never seen any full time professional crypto trader in my life. All of them I know are doing crypto trading or investments as a side job because they all have full-time jobs. If you are sure that you have gotten the requisite skills or expertise to successfully make profits from the crypto space that would be able to meet your basic needs, then switching to cypto trading might not be a bad idea. But if you are not sure of your expertise, please stick to your jog or search for another if you lose your job.",
