This has been a difficult product to develop, and we wanted to ensure it was top quality. We create user-friendly products that are similar to futures, but much simpler to use without a deep understanding of the futures market.We are currently working on a flagship product that will be followed by two additional productsData collection from centralized platforms is open information and does not require verification to use it",
