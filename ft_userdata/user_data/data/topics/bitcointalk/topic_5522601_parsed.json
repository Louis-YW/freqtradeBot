  "content": "Why are people quick to refer to Crypto specifically bitcoin as scam? This person bought bitcoins worth  £383 in May 2022. As at December 6th 2024, it was worth £1,000. This is over 161.1% increase. He withdrew half of it and said he wants to leave the other half. What baffles me is that he still went ahead to say, Crypto is still a scam. That it has eventually favoured me doesn’t mean it’s not a scam. Infact he opined that it is unexplainable wealth. This human behaviour that is strange -  skepticism persisting even in the face of its success. For me, the real scam is choosing not to understand Bitcoin and missing out on its potential benefits. Share your opinions. Edit: He mentioned Bitcoin specifically because that was the cryptocurrency he purchased. It's him not me who is using the term 'crypto' and 'Bitcoin' interchangeably.

Share your opinions. Smiles.. though it's funny but I will say is lack of knowledge.He invested because he was forced to do so, maybe his friends invested and he decided to do so even as that he wasn't convinced enough to invest in bitcoin.Those who calls Bitcoin are typical people who are scamming bitcoin by indirectly making profits from it because if it's scam there wouldn't have been a day he could have taken the profit from bitcoin maybe he could had sold and dash away the profits to someone else to enjoy the benefits. This is how those who lack knowledge behaves when it comes to what they don't have single idea about it.",

      "body": "Lots to take from the OP.Firstly you/everyone needs to separate Bitcoin from Crypto.Technically he is right by calling Crypto a scam and he is also generalising. Crypto refers to all other cryptography $hitcoins which are predominantly owned by someoneor a group and so controlled which means they are open to all sorts of scams.Unfortunately a lot of people lump Bitcoin into the same group as $hitcoins out of ignoranceand lack of understanding.Over the years the media have attacked Bitcoin and its been associated with organisedcrime again by people who dont have a very good understanding of Bitcoin v Crypto$hitcoins",

      "body": "I didn't see him mention bitcoin, but there is a high chance that he also generalised it and knows about bitcoin and still refers to it as a scam. Some people don't understand how all these things work; they see all crypto as a Ponzi scheme because there is a high chance of always getting profit when you invest in something. They don't do research to know how the market works. I really don't pay attention to such kinds of tweets or talk again because even if you try to advise or talk to such a person, they will always find it difficult to believe you; what they say is what they believe to be real. If all crypto is a scam like he said, then he's probably a scammer for taking advantage of a scam project.",

His ignorance must be very expensive because making mockery of something that he is a part of us really crazy and I think he's just happy because of the profit he has made and he couldn't find something else to write on he's X handle. The only way people especially the media will start seeing Bitcoin as a scam is if the word Bitcoin becomes separated by other cryptocurrency because a lot of people has lost their funds through the purchase of shit coins and some altcoin so whenever they hear cryptocurrency they would not ask if it's Bitcoin or not they will just believe that everything known as cryptocurrency is used to scam.",

The second group uses the first to reinforce their attacks against Bitcoin, but thankfully in vain, since Bitcoin is growing stronger cycle after cycle.Unfortunatelly there are also many scammers who adopted Bitcoin to run their criminal schemes, so people who see such schemes tend to connect Bitcoin to crimes, although it's not a smart conclusion, considering Bitcoin is money and that criminals always deal with some kind of money. If it's not Bitcoin, it's going to be any other fiat currency. At same time, people aren't going to call fiat currencies a scam for that reason, right?",

Share your opinions. Well, it's his opinion and anybody on the internet can say anything that's on their mind even though in fact, they know deep inside of them that it isn't a scam.I can say that Bitcoin's a scam, or Bitcoin will go to 0 like Dan Pena is doing. I can also say that Bitcoin will not reach $100,000 in the next bull run if I want to, but of course I don't mean it. It's the same with that person. He bought some Bitcoins and made money from it, but still, he still calls it a scam. Maybe he doesn't understand what Bitcoin is and he just bought because he saw a random person online making money on Bitcoin hence, he invested on it as well, and didn't care to learn about it. Humans in general is strange.  TBH, I'm not bothered anymore if somebody calls Bitcoin a scam. With where it is right now, the only ones that call Bitcoin a scam are those close-minded people and those who don't even know what Bitcoin is.",

People labelling Bitcoin as a scam aren't necessarily ignorant. It's possible they simply aren't convinced of the technology. They find no value in it, and for many reasons. Some of them may be thinking such a technology can't really function as a currency. Some are probably convinced that the current monetary system that we have today is the best.  For these people, the price of Bitcoin or profit they get from it doesn't matter. Taleb, for example, would remain against Bitcoin regardless of the price. I can only wish that we're like them in some sense, that we, supporters of Bitcoin, are truly convinced of the technology and stick with it despite its market performance.

In Nigeria bitcoin was banned until last year, and the ban was lifted by the government only to tax it and create revenue because they realized their ban has not worked and Nigerians have been using bitcoin ignoring the government's ban all this time.It is clear from the tweet you shared as well that the government is interested in the tax revenue so its employees like this guy, also share that mindset that bitcoin is just for profit making.So you can expect the \"doctor\" and \"political economy analysis\" to still follow the mindset of \"bitcoin should be banned because it is scam\" narrative.",
