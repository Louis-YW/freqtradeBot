      "body": "If you're asking which coin/token is going to pump next, then i'm afraid nobody can be certain about that. Pump and dump coins are high risk coins because it is basically impossible to predict them, one thing is certain about them anyway, and that is that they have no actual utility and are definitely going to dump, but predicting if/when they'll pump is not possible.",

What you guys think?Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, AI, there are many of them and we'll never know what's going to be the next. It will base on the market reaction with these projects if the community have seen some successes from the first ones.",

Most alts will go down the drain without warning. And so better keep an eye on every alt you have.Otherwise, you will know that the coin has just vanished from the trading market and you are left with worthless coins.Not many holders can get lucky like the OP, so he should be thankful he got out before it went down.",

What you guys think?Ended or just beginning? Maybe on price its stable now for 1.40 level but still early to judge them and might still go on big in the next few weeks. A lot of hypes around their platform too so there must be another leg up coming to it. If you are looking for next hype then it will take a while since a lot still showing off their value to the public. Layerzero is good but its too early I think to dind the next one.",

The coin has initially listed on quite a few exchanges so it cannot be said that it is over rather its journey has just started.

So they will give the mainnet airdrop within the next two months. In addition to that, layer zero will give the airdrop for their users.",

What you guys think?Is the Sui (SUI) you got from WL? If so, first of all I want to say congratulations to you for getting the allocation. There are many people out there who are unlucky to get WL including myself. Then about the hype, in my opinion from the post you made, you are a buyer who moves on the basis of hype, and because of that, it's a good idea to see the hype that is happening on Twitter. I'm not sure if the Layerzero you mentioned will get the hype going forward, wait, we're talking about https://layerzero.network right?",

What you guys think?Good for you, but I guess some of us miss the boat of the SUI hype. Although I myself don't follow that much in the altcoin market, but at least it is still thriving as what we have seen, another one is the Pepe coin.Anyhow, what about layerzero? I mean it seems that you are shilling for it, as least though tell us why it should be the next hype? Otherwise, it's obvious that you are already a bag holder maybe and just promoting it here.",

There are actually a lot of threads regarding this but some Layer 2 products still haven't confirmed anything about Token release. Some time ago Metamask, and the most hype now is Zksync Era which within a few months the volume of transactions reached a very large value on Ethereum. So, whether or not the hype depends on the influencers who play a role on social media.",
