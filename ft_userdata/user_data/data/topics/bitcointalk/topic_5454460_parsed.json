I can see they claimed you have violated their terms and as usual its always unclear to users what violation it was. Its been happening to many casinos though especially to unknown ones like this coinzino.",

Why would chat support tell that even?Well, according to their investigation, you have broken their ToS and they have taken steps based on that decision. Although they should give you a valid reason, they don't owe you that explanation. You better know what violation you did, and what ToS you have broken. If you think you are fine (although most of the time, it turns out in favor of the casino), you can follow the above suggestion. Try Askgambler. The only possible way to get your fund back if they are going to follow Askgambler decision.",

I’m curious about this since you’re about to withdraw as per your statement.The site should inform you about your violation, its not fair to left you hanging around. The only way to escalate this issue is to post this on Askgambler or other platform that might help you.

I've no relation with this online casino and I am positive that many people don't have know this online casino as well.New online casinos can steal money from you if your money is attractive enough to them, they can easily change the terms and condition to their own taste just to rob anyone, this is the problem I have with online casino and their terms and conditions that never stays in one place for long. Are they doing this knowing that it's the only way they can rob people and no law can make them pay what they owe? OP like I said you are at fault.Stay away from online casinos that are not commonly used by gamblers on this forum, you are inviting trouble if you go out there and look for any online casino yourself, scammers can create online casino hoping to use the terms and conditions to steal from people and they will run the business for a long time because terms and conditions is terms and conditions.",

And since the casino has refused to tell you the rule you broke it is now clear that they are only looking for an excuse nothing more.Btw, did you by any chance take a screenshot of your account balance because the casino is currently claiming that you don't hae any balance and how do we confirn that your claim of having an account with ~$3,000 closed is true?Just as others have suggested open a new thread in scam accusation board create a flag although the representative here on bitcointalk is no longer  active, so that those who find your post convincing can support it, and your thread in scam accusation board might also help others become aware of the shady business of the casino.",

Probably he deposit less amount than that and just manage to turn it to 3000$ when he make the withdrawal. He mention that he keeps withdrawing until that 3rd time which means he is on winning streak that triggers casino investigation.I’m not siding with casino here but most of the cases like this that newbie magically turn small amount to 3 grand or more always involves cheating on the casino games.

If they seized your account and refuse to disclose the specific terms you allegedly violated, it can be frustrating and may seem unfair. As I know, a reputable casino should provide clear information about the rules and terms that customers are expected to adhere to. It seems a fishy move to me and that is definitely right, further evidence about the deposit amount as your valid evidence could be no reason to raise the red flag on this casino.",

If you say I am guilty, what is my offense? OP has argued that he didn't violate any of their terms and condition, so the crime or scam section of the casino should explain to OP what is the crime he committed and OP should be willing to bear the consequence of the ToS being violated. This is one of the dangers of playing games in casinos that are small, new, or have no reputation in the forum. $3000 is not a small fund but I don't think the casino will want to kill its reputation because of this fund. I will encourage OP to still contact them and keep explaining the issues to the support team. If they think it has been moved to the scam section, OP should at least get information from them about the status of his account.",
