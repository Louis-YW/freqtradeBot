Fox said, tomorrow will return the tokens, so from screenshots. It confirmed, he received the tokens. It‚Äôs little bit hard for me to understand full. But i understand that. Fox take his Salary in token. He give coinsbit deposit address for receiving his salary. After that he also take bounty allocation like escrowed campaign. And then fox transfer the bounty allocation to his coinsbit exchange and then dump the token by selling. After scamming the bounty allocation, Fox start blackmailing the owner. Fox said, bitcointalk administration said the project is scam. That's all. I am requesting here all DT's including @Royse777 @LoyceV @Rikafip @Ratimov @suchmoon to check it.

The FOX¬† team wanted to reopen the thread¬† because the Partyland owner wanted to make another deal with the FOX team after returning the 4k PALA token to the project owner.. After returning the token to the Partyland owner , he messaged again to the FOX team to remove the scam tag and wanted to keep the previous deal . The previous deal was that the partyland owner need to pay USDT to fox team as escrowed balnace and FOX team said they will put a poll in their official group. SO that participants can vote for reopen the bounty for USDT or NOT. But seems the Partyland owner did trick with one of the FOX team member and then shared the screenshot over different telegram group and here in this forum.. There still many thing you need to know before share your opinion and put scam to bounty tag. I am sure most of the bounty mananger in this forum who¬† is well reputation full now comes from the FOX team position.Judge¬† later but first research what happend!",

SO that participants can vote for reopen the bounty for USDT or NOT. But seems the Partyland owner did trick with one of the FOX team member and then shared the screenshot over different telegram group and here in this forum.. What's the point of voting for reopening the bounty campaign since its obvious now that Partyland CEO has a long scam history meaning same thing will happen with his latest project. So instead cutting all ties with Partyland after finding who is behind the project, Fox Bounty team wanted to reopen the bounty instead. That tells me everything I need to know about them.Quote from: Dorjoy Khan on June 19, 2022, 07:35:40 AMThere still many thing you need to know before share your opinion and put scam to bounty tag.
