Sometime last year they went through a complete redesign and rebranded themselves as Nuri.Spoiler alert: If you see a crypto company redesigning their website and its not because they bought a slick domain (I'm looking at crypto.com), you can tell they are clearly struggling in the business.They filed for bankruptcy in August 9, some months after the CeFi fallout. Their FAQ happily said, which I coincidentally checked just yesterday: \"Q: Will you continue operations? A: Yes, we will keep operating\" or words to that effect (I need to grab a Wayback Machine copy of this page for reference).And now today they announced that they are shutting down: https://nuri.com/blog/letter-from-ceo/This phase feels like a market correction for recklessly lending & borrowing companies.",

Did they send 1 email that may or may not have wound up in their spam box, or have there been repeated attempts? Yes, the front page has the letter but if you had their login page bookmarked https://app.nuri.com/login there is nothing about it.I have a few exchange accounts with some dust / small amounts in them. I don't read a lot of the mail that comes from them because most of it is crap. And now they are giving only 60 days to pull funds. Unless they are sending a lot of emails, I can see in early 2023 getting a lot of posts here from users that had small amounts that were just sitting there because it was only $xxx and it was not that big a deal. And now they can't get it.Don't get me wrong, still way better then all the exchanges that disappeared in the middle of the night.-Dave",

And those that don't check their accounts and wallets on nuri(bitwala) will miss the withdrawal period. Trading is still until next month and by December 18, they'll be close and no more withdrawals but if there are still some funds from their customers that haven't withdrawn yet, some may ask or out of their good will to extend the date.",

They've been open and transparent throughout, and have let customers continue to access their accounts and funds at all times. Compare with Celsius, who locked all accounts without warning and were still advertising deposit promotions <24 hours before they locked down. Looks like every user of Nuri should be able to withdraw their money, whereas all the users of Celsius are still fighting over scraps while it emerges the CEO cashed out about $45 million in the days prior to the bankruptcy.At least millions of innocent users haven't lost everything in this particular case, but how depressing that the bar has been set that low. It is yet another warning that you should never be leaving coins with a third party.Quote from: DaveF on October 21, 2022, 12:22:24 PM-snip-According to what I've read on Reddit (but can't confirm since I don't have an account), users are shown a notification as soon as they log in.",

Really bad accounting on their part, but they were run at a loss since years beforehand, so it was probably one last attempt to artificially boost their user metrics so they could be attractive to investors, while their whole business model was broken and relied on giving users freebies.

Exactly, rebranding is mainly to get rid of bad internet reviews, scam accusations and bad news on crypto news sites. By changing their name, such reviews can't be found because some people don't know their old name. Most likely, experienced crypto bros can't be tricked by this but many Newbies will still fall for it. And Newbies are a big target group.",

If you see the old name and the old interface no way you're going to try it again.Also, at least in their minds, maybe they were trying to find a new audience, while bitwala doesn't really mean anything according to all these online dictionaries Nuri does have a meaning in Arabic and in Korean (light/world) so who knows their plans might have been expanding in one of those regions if they fail at home.Quote from: 1miau on October 27, 2022, 12:16:59 AMI don't know if there a huge costs for a digital service like Bitwala / Nuri to do a rebranding.

It's not like a supermarket where you have to change physical things, Bitwala / Nuri is digital. Probably a small percentage of one round of investment if it were just for the name but from what people were saying overall social media they did change the app also, although the reviews weren't that positive so that might have cost a bit more, but yeah no way closer to change all those physical signs and all the branding in a retail store, Auchan spent on average 1 million euros for each superstore in bought in the last decade just on rebranding. These guys probably spend 500$ on some banners and more than that on their office coffee mugs and pencils.",
