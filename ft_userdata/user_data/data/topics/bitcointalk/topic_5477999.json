Yesterday or day before they again listed 1000sats which resulted in a major congestion in the network again. Binance may list more of them in the future that is what causing the insane pump. If the congestion keeps on continuing in the same manner small investors won't be able to buy Bitcoin.",

The pumping can be done by mostly the speculators. But it can be done by the supporters of bsv token and other competitors. No one really knows! But one thing we all know that, if this madness is not stopped, Bitcoin is going to lose any competitive advantage it has gained so far. Because those who transact regularly using Bitcoin, they would obviously look for cheaper options for their daily cryptocurrency transaction. Bitcoin will remain as an investment only.",

Some of them will easily say that you should use some altcoins and thus avoid big fees, because Bitcoin is not what it was in the beginning anyway.Some others say that any prohibition of these transactions would be a form of some kind of censorship, which would later open the possibility of censoring individual transactions, as if some mining pools do not already do this or have not already tried to go in that direction.Read this topic and maybe some things will be clearer to you.",

In fact, it is possible that others will appear that will make transactions increasingly dense on the Bitcoin network, causing costs to continue to increase rapidly. Even now, Binance continues to list coins on the Brc-20 network one by one. Which of course will make the hype for Brc-20 continue to grow. And it's possible that the community that likes Brc-20 will increase too. And last long enough that bitcoin transaction fees will continue to be as they are now or even become higher.",

What if in the future miners are agree to censor transactions related to gambling because gambling is a sins? censor coins from mixers because it's money laundering?Most of people who own Bitcoin are only care with profit, that's why they hold their coins in CEX. So it doesn't matter for them to join the ordinals since they have an opportunity to make more money.",

Although bitcoin was not created as an investment or speculation, it is clear that the majority of those participating in this market are looking to make a profit. There are not too many people aiming to support the bitcoin revolution without any benefits. And BRC20 is generating huge profits so I believe that even though many people complain about bitcoin transaction fees, they still quietly invest in these meme tokens.

There are probably many miners who strongly support the growth of Bitcoin NFTs because it benefits them. And then there are also those who are in the community to speculate and make money.

People is pouring tons of money on a project without researching and just following the hype of the social media influencer promoting it. Shitcoins doesn’t need to do much marketing if the project is on hype on this case BRC20. Crypto investors is insane when it comes to hype investment due to the potential profit short term.",

If only the nodes can reject this inscriptions and these spams but they will say the network is turning to centralization but I think it is for the benefits for all and not some specific people that want to make money to cause attack on the bitcoin network.",

I am not a developer so I can make efforts to solve this ordinals problem but I am an ordinary person who have learnt that what potential and threats does ordinals have, shich is zero for potential and 100 as threat to BTC blockchain.You might say, the potential is not zero as you mentioned they have gave huge returns but I am more like talking about use cases, which these coins dont have any, or some person with huge amount of money can dump and pump the price of these ordinals easily.Well, jus to stand a point, I am a member of bitcoin community but I dont accept ordinals and even never bought a single coin just for the sake of money. Those who have helped these coins to pump hard are the ones manipulating its price and are after money. They don't care about BTC and its potential.",
