Which is why we advocate for non custodial wallets and hardware wallets for storing large amounts of Bitcoins instead of exchanges. I often wonder how come people still make these mistakes, Bitcoin isn’t “new” anymore, there is a decade worth of information and experiences of people in the crypto space. From MtGox to FTX, exchanges have proven to be unreliable for hodling bitcoins. Exchanges are good for one thing, buying and selling coins. The smart thing to do after making purchases, is to transfer your coins to your non custodial wallet.",

The Exchanges hot wallets are digital numbers that can never be expected as real-time assets but in your custody will be always on-chain, authentic assets with ownership you possess in real-time.The more you are capable of spending in security you should, the more you prefer a separate system while interacting with the wallets, and traders from the one you are using for social media and day-to-day tasks.

All those regulations the governments apply to exchanges is to only monitor user activities, not to provide them with any kind of security. Of course the exchanges give all kinds of empty promises to attract customers but in the end if they want to run away or if they get hacked, it is users that would lose money.",

Is there any authority that are in charge to make those hacked exchange resend customers lost asset? Many conventional banks are insured by Deposit insurance so depositors can get a refund of their deposit if the bank goes bankrupt. The government also ensure that banks comply with regulatory laws and that their accounts always go through periodic audits. But all these measures have not also stopped banks from going down the drain. Exchanges are worst and should be avoided. Keeping huge funds in exchanges is like leaving your funds in an unregulated bank. Most of the audit reports they present are not verifiable and they also engage in sharp business practices. Except hacked funds are traced and recovered depositors in exchanges will likely never get their money back.",

I have been in a Bitcoin Facebook group for a year, maybe. People ask what wallet they should store their Bitcoin and other altcoins. The most common comments on those posts are from Binance and Kucoin. Whenever I try to correct them they say those are just centralized exchanges and you shouldn't store your coins where you do not have full access to your coins. Most of the time, I end up being trolled by them because their argument is that those exchanges have been running for many years and are trusted enough. Sometimes, I felt stupid because I argued with them. People understand at some point. But I tried to convince them many times. The problem is, the number of people who understand where should store their coins is not too big. 90 peoples were suggesting Binance and 10 of was saying to use Electrum. If 90 of them start trolling 10 of us, we are nothing against them.",
