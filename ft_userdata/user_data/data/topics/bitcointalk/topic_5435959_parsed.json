  "content": "QuoteThe potential stablecoin aims to enable cross-border transactions instead of fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, the Russian ruble or the Iranian rial.The Central Bank of Iran is reportedly cooperating with the Russian government to jointly issue a new cryptocurrency backed by gold.According to the Russian news agency Vedomosti, Iran is working with Russia to create a “token of the Persian Gulf region” that would serve as a payment method in foreign trade.The token is projected to be issued in the form of a stablecoin backed by gold, according to Alexander Brazhnikov, executive director of the Russian Association of Crypto Industry and Blockchain.The stablecoin aims to enable cross-border transactions instead of fiat currencies like the United States dollar, the Russian ruble or the Iranian rial. The report notes that the potential cryptocurrency would operate in a special economic zone in Astrakhan, where Russia started to accept Iranian cargo shipments.Russian lawmaker Anton Tkachev, a member of the Committee on Information Policy, Information Technology and Communications, stressed that a joint stablecoin project would only be possible once the digital asset market is fully regulated in Russia. After multiple delays, the Russian lower house of parliament once again promised to start regulating crypto transactions in 2023.Iran and Russia are among the countries that banned their residents from using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTCtickers down$20,921 and stablecoins like Tether (USDT) for payments. At the same time, Iran and Russia have been actively working to adopt crypto as a tool of foreign trade.In August 2022, Iran’s Industry, Mines and Trade Ministry approved the use of cryptocurrency for imports into the country amid ongoing international trade sanctions. The local government said the new measures would help Iran mitigate global trade sanctions. Iran subsequently placed its first international import order using $10 million worth of crypto.The Bank of Russia — historically opposed to using crypto as a payment method — agreed to allow crypto in foreign trade to mitigate the impact of international sanctions. The regulator has never clarified which cryptocurrencies would be used for such transactions though.https://cointelegraph.com/news/iran-and-russia-want-to-issue-new-stablecoin-backed-by-gold....Iran and russia want to issue a stablecoin?! This world is becoming crazier by the day.I would guess their first kneejerk reaction was to simply use gold. Then they realized if they digitized it. They could simply move digital funds from one account to another account. Which is easier and more efficient than shipping heavy piles of gold across long distances. But then who would cover development costs of what could easily become a multi million dollar project? Then they realized, if they used free open source code from crypto projects, they wouldn't have to pay software development costs and would only need servers to run it and personnel to maintain it.So it seems that crypto and stablecoins may become a natural progression for corporations and nations of the world who are attempting to solve basic and fundamental problems of economy. Such as developing and deploying financial systems to facilitate transactions denominated in gold. Rather than starting from zero and building systems upwards to achieve basic and fundamental financial tasks.",

I thought they'd have a decent enough development firm for something like this at least, or is this more of a strengthening ties exercise (to which, maybe they don't need the currency anyway).I thought there was already an Indian company that made digital gold in the past, is that not still a thing (but maybe India seem too neutral and a potential risk for now)?They probably can't use something too decentralised (like PoW) because it'd either be expensive to run or it would get attacked (it might just get attacked anyway, like Russian TV did regardless of how it's made).",

To me, the whole idea sounds more like a desperate attempt to somehow replace the dollar.It is unlikely that the alleged joint issuance of a stablecoin by Russia and Iran is intended to weaken the dollar. Thus, Russia and Iran are simply trying to circumvent international sanctions. Due to the fact that Iran has begun to supply Russia with its combat drones, as well as in view of the possible supply of ballistic missiles and other military weapons, it is advisable for these war criminals to unite. After all, additional sanctions are now being imposed on Iran for military cooperation with the terrorist country Russia. Russian gold is also subject to sanctions. Therefore, it will be easier to issue a joint gold-backed CBDC here. At the same time, Russia and Iran are likely to focus solely on mutual trade with the help of such a CBDC. Although in the future they may allow changes to these plans. But the war in Ukraine may disrupt these plans of terrorist states.",

Instead of legalizing bitcoin and developing their own digital money system, they outlawed it to control the economy and its people.Creating a stablecoin, especially one tied to gold, is a massive undertaking. They must figure out how to make and maintain the stablecoin and demonstrate a clear relationship between gold and the new currency to gain public trust.

So for now, gold is the only reliable alternative. But how reliable is gold? The total amount of gold mined out till now is somewhere between 180,000 and 200,000 tons. But there is a lot more gold in the earth's crust, and the only problem is that it is contained in deposits which makes no economic sense to extract. For example, ocean water contains 20 million tonnes of gold. What will happen in future, in case technology advances to such a level, to make extraction of gold from ocean water economically viable? Or what will happen, if humans are able to travel to other planets or asteroids and mine gold from them?",
