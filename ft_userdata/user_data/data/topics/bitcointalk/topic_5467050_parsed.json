If the hacker does not co-spend the transaction with other UTXO's in the same wallet. Walletexplorer will never know. Getting the name of the destination address will also be less likely, as exchanges/services now have newer hot wallet addresses that are not named in the old database.",

If the hacker does not co-spend the transaction with other UTXO's in the same wallet. Walletexplorer will never know. This is the main goal of such services. If you do not spend from many inputs (not using coinControl,) there is no way to know that they are linked except by connecting to a node managed by block analysis service and not having used Tor.I agree with you that the results are bad, but I think they update them from time to time to exploit this service to collect more data, just as is the case when cooperating with some explorers.Do you know a better or updated tool?",

The reason is that I created WalletExplorer and its database in my free time. Then I joined Chainalysis.com, which basically does the same product (but far more advanced) and I'm paid for discovering names. While I'm paid for it, I can't disclose names publicly. Ask Chainalysis if you want data with newer names. Quote from: Yamane_Keto on September 21, 2023, 08:08:49 AMDo you know a better or updated tool?Obviously they won't be free services. Chainlysis.com is one of them. There is Elliptic, ciphertrace, coinfirm etc.",
