Not worth a penny.Do not take I or your friend's word for it, do your own research on Bitcoin; utilities and qualities that sets it apart from the other coins.",

But do not be disappointed of you see the altcoin you invested on not to have expected result, or it may increase more. No one truly get only one crypto, but you can invest most on the dominate one which is bitcoin.",

But what do you think, is it better to invest in bitcoin or other coins?The main choice in terms of investing, it is very popular to invest in Bitcoin, but in Altcoins you can also do by paying attention to Altcoins with good popularity, you can also invest in both, split between 70% and 30%, 70% for Bitcoin and the rest for Altcoins.The main advice is, of course, it is more appropriate to fully invest in Bitcoin, and pay attention to Bitcoin Charts. There are great opportunities to invest, but if you want to have several Crypto Assets, you can choose to invest in Altcoins most of your funds.currently our choice apart from Bitcoin, we prefer Ethereum and bnb from some good Top Altcoins, maybe you can follow these tips if you want to invest in both Crypto categories, and use a percentage between 70-30 %, Bitcoin is a large percentage, and save the rest to Altcoin.",

I suggest just focusing on collecting more Bitcoins in the long term. with little by little, you accumulate Bitcoin, you will not realize that you have accumulated quite a lot in the long run. and you can enjoy it when your target is reached.",

      "body": "Investing in Bitcoin is safer than Altcoins. But altcoins are able to give faster profits than Bitcoin, on the other hand, since Bitcoin is a valuable coin, it is not possible for everyone to buy a whole Bitcoin, so it is not possible to make high-quality profits quickly from here. however, since the value of altcoin is low, it quickly pumps up high quality and even with a small amount of investment, it is possible to get big profits quickly from here. But also there is high risk because there are huge amount of altcoins in the market so it is very difficult to predict which one is the most likely coin.  And altcoins have a long history of being scams.  So investing in altcoins can unfortunately result in you losing your entire investment.  Which is almost impossible with Bitcoin",

Bitcoin has less volatility compare to Altcoins. So in terms of risks, altcoins has the higher risk. You should invest only in Bitcoin if you are very scared of losing money. In Alts, it's very dangerous to invest in a coin without checking their site because there are so many scam coins. However, Altcoins are highly rewarding than Bitcoin, it can multiply your money in a short time. If you want to invest some in Altcoins, I suggest you to invest in top 10 alts in coinmarketcap, such as:1. Eth2. Bnb3. Xrp4. ADA5. Doge6 Matic (and more)",

But that would be a gamble because you're more likely to get scammed than picking an altcoin that will have that value since you're picking from 1/10000 altcoins.",

Try to learn first at least the basics and don't be like the 95% of the investors out there who are just throwing their money, wanted to invest hoping that their money will grow without doing nothing and not knowing the risks of it.
