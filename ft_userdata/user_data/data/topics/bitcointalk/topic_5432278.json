  "content": "After a long debate with myself, I decided that I will try to offer this service on the forum.Gazeta's Escrow ServiceRules:Rule One: Never change the deal.For beginning, as I am new in this field, I will escrow first transactions for free. I will update OP once I will decide to add a fee for my service.The buyer should include the transaction fee in the payment, thus I will be able to send to the seller the amount which was settled between the two parties. If the transaction fees will not be included, I will send the payment back to the buyer (obviously, minus the fee required for this transaction).I am allowed to reject any escrow or user which seems suspicious to me.I am from Romania, therefore I am available mostly between 8am - 6pm GMT+2 timezone. Of course, if you plan to use my service outside these hours, we can discuss that.What I will escrow:I will mainly escrow BTC (be it for trades between users or campaign funds).I may, or may not, offer escrow services for a limited amount of altcoins (feel free to ask me if I will escrow your altcoin in the moment when you decide to use the escrow service). I am not decided yet on which altcoins I will work with, therefore we need to discuss this first.I may, or may not, offer also escrow services for other digital or physical goods. If you intend to use escrow for physical goods, take also into account the shipping costs.I will not escrow trades of accounts or other shenanigans.How to proceed:In order to perform an escrow I need both parties' approval (buyer and seller). If you will write inside this topic, please tag the other party's name as well; if you contact me through PM please add the other party inside \"To\" field. After I will admit a request, the buyer will have to send the payment to me. After I will receive the payment, I will wait for both parties to confirm that the trade is completed (meaning that buyer received the object of the trade), then I will release the funds to the seller. Releasing of funds should not take long, if we work during the hours when I am available.You may also add third parties to the PM you send me, for having witnesses which may be needed in case of disputes.Please write your submission in the following format:Code:Buyer's BitcoinTalk name:Buyer's refund address:---Seller's BitcoinTalk name:Seller's address to send coins:---Amount to escrow (in BTC or altcoin):Description of the trade:Disputes:Although I hope I will not encounter such cases, disputes may appear. In such cases, I will ask both parties to explain as detailed as possible what happened, from their own perspective. I hope that such incidents will be mediated in a pleasant manner and I may appeal at other forum users, with high reputation, for their opinion.Reputation:Although I am new in escrow services, I think I built a strong reputation on the forum so far. I made multiple successful deals with users (with more or less reputation); you may check a part of these deals by reading the feedbacks I received and the ones I sent. So far, nobody made any complaint toward me, related to how a deal worked out.I am also an established forum translator, being listed on efialtis' translators list, and my portfolio can be found here. I collaborated with many iconic figures of the forum, translating various and precious essays, such as 1miau, fillippone or LoyceV. You may ask them about my seriousness. My most important translation, by far, was the one I made for Bitcoin white paper, which is now listed on bitcoin.org.I am a self-made Legendary member, being also the only Romanian user which reached this rank starting from scratch. During my first three years of activity on the forum I earned more than 3000 merits. I have a 1.12 merits vs posts ratio, being one of the very few users with more merits than posts. I am also one of the very few users which ever received a 50-merit bomb (I received 4 so far) and which also ever sent a 50-merit bomb (I sent 4 so far, without being a Merit Source). My full bpip stats can be found here. I am also a part of DT users.I am actively combating spam, with more than 60.000 good reports, being also nominated by theymos as forum's fourth reporter in 2020.You may also want to check my reputation thread.Needless to say, I am honest and I want to collaborate only with honest users.",

Have you read Best practices for Bitcointalk escrow providers? If not, I encourage you to do so.Thank you for the link you provided. It was an interesting and very useful reading although, from my perspective, everything what is written there is common sense. I mean that some things should be in everybody's mind, like (highlight is mine):Quote from: LoyceV on October 29, 2021, 10:29:03 AMShouldn't it be the escrow's responsibility to make absolutely sure the trade can't go wrong in any possible way? The escrow provider is the experienced trader, who should assume one of the other parties could be a total n00b and the other one an experienced scammer.I'd also say the deal should be completely clear before any payment is made, and once payment addresses have been exchanged, the deal should not be changed anymore.or like:Quote from: LoyceV on October 29, 2021, 11:33:44 AMThis is what I would have expected:Buyer and seller provide payment and shipping details to escrow.If all agree on all terms, buyer pays escrow and seller sends product to escrow.Escrow verifies product.Escrow releases product and payment only if everything is okay.However, if such details don't come up to mind in an automatic (even unconscious) manner (like breathing -- you breath, but you don't have to think that you actually have to inhale then exhale), then maybe the respective escrow was also a noob or imprudent...Quote from: LoyceV on January 08, 2023, 10:40:05 AMBefore accepting any escrow deal, ask yourself if there's any scenario possible in which none of the involved parties can really prove what happened. If that's the case, I wouldn't accept it.I will take this advice and use it each time. As I stated in OP, since I am a honest person, I will also want to work only with honest people. If I'll feel anything fishy I will not get involved, as I don't want to be part of a scam (even without realizing it) nor to stain my reputation here. Thank again, Loyce, for the tips! Highly appreciated!",

And considering the large fees they charge, I would have expected better.Quotesince I am a honest person, I will also want to work only with honest people.That's tricky: if you could know that for sure, they wouldn't need an escrow so you always have to assume the worst. I've seen escrow scams on Bitcointalk get quite advanced.Here's another scenario: 5 Bitcoin was given to an escrow to inspire confidence, and asked back right before they pulled an exit scam. In this case, the escrow should have negotiated for instance a 7 day cooldown time before accepting the deal.Quote from: NeuroticFish on January 08, 2023, 01:21:58 PMThis looks easy, but can also be, at times, extremely difficult, tricky and with a great potential for troubles.That's one of the reasons I never started such a service.

Make sure the parts are aware that only such signed messages are meaningful. Impersonation is a big risk in your business.* Always store all the funds you need to work with on hardware wallet or cold storage.

Bitcoin allows signing a message. If you own a bitcoin wallet you can sign a message with one of the addresses of that wallet (actually, better said, with the private key of such an address).So best is that all parts of the deal have bitcoin addresses staked (you'll need to learn to sign a message, you'll need to also take a look onto this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=996318.new#new ) and sign their deal related messages from those addresses (maybe also stating \"current\" date/time).So no, it's not a SMF mechanism, it's a Bitcoin mechanism we also use for proving ownership of bitcointalk accounts in case of troubles (this topic can be informative too: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5436734)",
