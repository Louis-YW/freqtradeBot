This indicate that even how eager they are for running a promotion or how to make their casino trusted 1 year is not enough time to determine that they are really a legit gambling site. And we need to be more careful on new casino will launch because same thing might happen again so we need to be more xareful for that.",

This will call the attention of participants here to be wary of this casino if they eventually resurface again. Although when I checked, this complaint should be a year and since then there have not been any solution to it. This calls for more caution by participants noting that not all the casino they see are for real and some are just waiting just to delay to make gamblers feel they are real and at given time, they run away with gamblers funds and assets under their custody. I was thinking if their is any possibility of identifying them if per adventure they resurface again with a different identity so that they can be easily recognized and discarded from the casino space. This I suggest should be taken into cognizance.",

Perhaps that's why some other members were reluctant about creating it.I think this is the difference (as well as purpose) between a type 1 and a type 3 flag. Anyone can create a type 1 as has been done with the current topic, whereas a type 3 needs to be created by someone personally affected by the exit scam. So in this sense, there should never be an issue/contradiction with creating a type 1 flag prior to be a type 3 being created (as in this case, it was never created). May have got my type 1 & 3 mixed up here, but you get the point... one should never wait for a scammers flag to be created, but instead apply the newbie warning flag in case the former never arrives...Quote from: logfiles on March 23, 2023, 09:23:01 PMQuote from: dragonvslinux on March 22, 2023, 01:51:53 PMI feel sorry for guys who lost money there, but they should never hold coins on websites like this.Sometimes they are just winnings and just as you attempt to withdraw the funds, you get locked out.Although this sounds like the sort of thing I'd say, I never actually said it by the way  Quote from: dkbit98 on March 22, 2023, 04:03:11 PMI feel sorry for guys who lost money there, but they should never hold coins on websites like this.",

So it's clear an exit scam.I supported the flag.I really feel sad for the players of this scam casino whose team's intentions were to promote their platform in the forum through signature campaigns to attract potential customers and even collect the money of players and gamblers over the course of a year and then run away; they did not even put KYC procedures in place so that there would be no obstacle for anyone to use their scam casino platform and deposit his money on it and start playing and earning, so that they not only stole 1.1 BTC from this person only and were satisfied with that, but rather collected vast amounts of bitcoins from different clients whose reviews were found on the reviews and ratings sites on the Internet.Not all casino platforms promoted on the forum by trusted managers are reliable. You should be careful before choosing the casino platform you will deal with.",
