I guess no that's why the minimum most likely is at least 10 dollars to have a better chance of playing more games and enjoying. But some of the casino today now already included in their terms and condition that they don't have a minimum deposit. Last I've seen like this is the blackjack.fun",

Some site have a high minimum deposit to encourage those gamblers to play more and this is beyond our control. If your budget is still not enough then save it for now, and when you reach the required amount you can start to gamble now. Some site have a low minimum as well but higher minimum withdrawal, you should know this before playing.",

      "body": "The minimum deposit is usually low. In crypto casinos, the minimum deposit can differ from coin to coin, there are some altcoins with a very low minimum deposit. But at least, to have fun while gambling, $10 is not much. I have used both crypto and fiat casinos very well and the ones I have used both have low minimum deposit.Gamblers do not that care about the minimum deposit because it is usually low, even the withdrawal is usually low, but high on some gambling sites, example was a gambling site that accept only fiat that I have used before,  you can be able to even deposit $10 (maybe even less but the least I have deposited on the site before), but require $40 for withdrawal.",

Now I think this withdrawal and deposit are the best important to the gamblers so that they will able to stay. The withdrawal and deposit have nothing to do with the gamblers who want to control themselves. The addiction could rely on your attitude on how to stop your eagerness in gambling which is an addiction. So it always matters to us.",

There's no such discrimination if you're a minimum depositor and just casually plays.The low minimum amount of deposit really is encouraging everyone to gamble to any casino and that's why it's easy to play with almost each and every of them.And not just with minimum in fiat but also in cryptos that they're accepting that's why it's an ease for every customer that they might take.",

      "body": "Sites with higher deposit limits I'd consider to have fewer games and probably older games like more focus on table (poker, dice and blackjack) and less on newer games like slots. Lower deposit sites are probably more entertaining or addicting and encourage users to play because of it (like sites with slots and wheels).I don't think these do as much to increase initial deposit as deposit bonuses do (or other rewards like wager cashback). Withdrawal limits probably act as more of a barrier to both though but it might make players get into a habit of gambling until their funds are gone rather than withdrawing before they are (the same comes from withdrawal delays too).",

I mean what choice does player have if their balance is below the minimum withdrawable amount?

Does high minimum deposit fees from online casino discourage gamblers who want to stick to a budget and influences them to gamble with bigger amounts? The concept of responsible gambling parallels responsible consumption of alcoholic beverages. We are more prone to engaging in excess rather than moderation. Its human nature.Quote from: Queentoshi on November 02, 2022, 09:24:35 PMDoes minimum withdrawal encourage players to try again and keep gambling if they don't win up to the minimum withdrawal?Minimum deposit/withdrawal isn't something most gamblers will concern themselves with.Chasing odds is a popular pastime. Losing gamblers will usually engage in comparison shopping to shave every advantage they can on wagers. Bonuses, incentives and freebies are also popular. The one area where minimum deposit and withdrawal could really matter is with foreign gamblers. In poor countries where the average wage is $40 a week. Those minimum deposit and withdrawal metrics could make a big difference in the bottom line of aspiring gamblers of those regions.",

Obviously these terms need to be VERY CLEAR BEFORE THE PLAYER MAKES THE DEPOSIT.",

And if I'm correct, before you can go on a casino way back, there is this so called show money that you have communicate before you can enter (at least this is what I heard from those OG gamblers).And maybe this is similar to what this casino's are implementing, you need to have the money, at least bare minimum to play and uses this system. And besides, most casino's charges for withdrawal fee so that $10 will not be enough.",

If a user can't afford to meet the minimum deposit required, then don't gamble at all.There are lots of people who can afford that minimum deposit amount, why the site should adjust for these users who are strict in budget?It's not with the gambling site but why these persons who have a strict budget will do gambling? If they are really decided to do it, then it's just common that they need to adjust and cross the line of their budgets to pursue gambling.",

Obviously like that if the minimum withdrawal is 0.01 btc then the gambler will play to be able to get them, that's why every gambler must first know the minimum withdrawal. I personally always ask about the minimum withdraw if that's a new Casino, because I can only gambling with money which can afford to lose and want to withdraw when already win.",

Does minimum withdrawal encourage players to try again and keep gambling if they don't win up to the minimum withdrawal?Most casinos don't have deposit fees and you can set the miner fees to very low if the network isn't that hectic. If they plan to bring in more gamblers then lowering the deposit amount is one way to do it since not everyone would be gambling with a lot of money and the same goes for their minimum withdrawal if it's not low enough then their customers would be forced to play or deposit more. I remember getting caught up with this issue back then as the casino I'm playing at suddenly increased their minimum withdrawal by more than $100 out of nowhere while my current balance was below the minimum. Instead of risking my bankroll and potentially losing it all I just made another deposit so I could move all of my balance out from my account and play at another casino that has lower minimum withdrawal.",

Does minimum withdrawal encourage players to try again and keep gambling if they don't win up to the minimum withdrawal?Low minimum deposit and withdrawal may encourage people to gamble or engage into such activity because to most of the things, capital is the problem. If it would be low, it will give them the opportunity to experience or play the games of their interest. I guess, some gambling sites has high minimum deposits to keep the accounts active and to kepp their players. My idea is in line with banks wherein there should be a specific amount in order to withdraw our savings; amount less than that won't do. Another consideration on my perspective is the tax and transaction fees which should be an additional amount to the minimum deposit or withdrawal. These are just guesses so feel free to correct me.But I haven't encountered gambling sites which are requiring that much for the withdrawal and deposit amounts. Maybe it also depends on the platforms or casinos themselves.",

If a gambler wants to deposit just a dollar, let him do this. It's much better to have 1000 customers depositing 1$ each than one customer depositing 100$, while all the rest will simply not play because they can't afford to spend more funds or they will find an alternative casino which allow them to play with lower amounts of money.Now about withdrawals, it's not possible to be so flexible, because we know there are operational and network costs to be paid through fees, so a gambler must be aware it's not possible to deposit a single dollar and withdraw it as soon as he double his bankroll to 2$.",
