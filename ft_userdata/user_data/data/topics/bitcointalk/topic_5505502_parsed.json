But, I heard during early days, it was not easy to access Bitcoin since you must be a high technical person where you need to run full node and receiving in public keys instead of address.So, I think the early adopters are mostly rich and have high knowledge in computer science.",

Even today, a small percentage of the population actively uses bitcoin or have ever made a bitcoin transaction. Put some money aside if you feel like investing and buy your first coins. Or better yet, work for it and get paid in bitcoin for the services you render. A short-term up or downtrend shouldn't put you off from becoming an adopter.",

I really want to do that in the future..Well, as much as your post makes really good sense to me which I appreciate, forgive me but your question makes no sense since it's one that have no definite answer, how does one become an early participant to something if not to get to know about that thing and get involved in it at that very moment when no one else or just a few number of persons are talking about that thing, and truth be told, what you have missed being an early participant in, you have missed it and there is no way to turn back the hands of time.Only thing one can do is learn from the past and present things one feels he or she has missed, and pay close attention to new innovations and try to get involved on time.But also important to know is that in the world of technology and innovations, you can't catch every opportunity, potential big projects on time, you surely must miss some and that's a normal thing cus no man is omini present in this world.",

I really want to do that in the future..Your assumption that all the early members of the forum are rich might not be correct. Some of them might have sold their coins, others might have lost them, and some might have lost interest in Bitcoin before the price skyrocketed. However, some were able to hold their coins to date; yeah, many of them will be millionaires. Bitcoin is a technology that is second to none. Many developers have tried to replicate Bitcoin but failed to produce something of the same standard. If you want to be part of an innovation, I suggest you engage in in-depth research in some areas; maybe you might get an idea. The artificial intelligence sector is at its early stage, you could discover an area you can contribute to.",

I really want to do that in the future..You made a lot of digging and can't blame you to think that way especially if you look at the old value of bitcoin way back before. But actually not all people became so rich after bitcoin reach at this current price since I see some several people before who do earn and sell schemes. They didn't left anything in their bags and just sell whatever they earn since no one believe before that bitcoin would able to reach this far. Bitcoin is new and future is unsure that's why lots of people from old era think about they miss a opportunity to become a millionaire since they sold all their earnings before when the price of bitcoins is so cheap.But even though with those cases still there's something more to look after even if the price of bitcoin is bit expensive to the eyes of current adapter. They just need to accumulate what they can afford since for sure they will still get rewarded. Bitcoin has many things to offer and those people continue to believe will provably get reward especially as we know there's limited supply of bitcoin and lots of people still buying it.",

As for bitcoin, if you haven't started yet you've missed being part of earlier participants but starting now can make you be among early participants.

So yes, those initial stages are far behind us, and it's hard to say what's the next big thing worth joining early. But from a different perspective, we're all still early Bitcoin users and enthusiasts. Even though Bitcoin gained significant media attention, and serious funds and authorities have to take it into account, Bitcoin is used by less than 5% of the world's population. If we expect is to go to mass adoption, then it's still early days, still a time to be a part of something bigger.",

For personal transactions, privacy coins offer peace of mind, knowing that one's financial transactions are not easily accessible or traceable by others.
