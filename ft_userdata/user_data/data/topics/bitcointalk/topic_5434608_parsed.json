Me personally I am not a victim of this as I did not buy anything from him, but the whole market is really huge. I think everyone heard of Casascius coins (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins) which value is now much much bigger than their denomination.Aside of that, that small items are perfect gifts.It is just a matter of trust. For years he was running a company which became quite famous and trusted, all was fine and just one day he ruined everything. I do not know which case is worst, the one where you plan everything and just have your 'poker face' because you know one day in the future you will steal everything, or if all runs fine and one day you feel you are in need and then you feel impulse to steal all the money from your customers.And at the end, it seems like really a 'personal issue', because like someone counter what was stolen is even less that $50k, not like millions in serious scams.",

Gambling addiction will really bring someone at their worst and then no return with all the loss of others money and much worst, the crime that was done which is stealing.Trust is still subjective and you just have to give it to the person that you really know even just online. But at these moments, in terms of keeping money or buying stuff online that involves collections/collectibles that has got embedded with bitcoin is totally risky. It's worrying but I'm sure the circle in you guys (the remaining honest ones) got each others back.",

I'll make you guys some nice addresses to use and they're going to be free! Any takers? The person who created these collectibles was once a trusted member of this forum. He had a good reputation right before someone who owned his collectible noticed that his funds from those collectibles were swiped. As per the creator of this collectible, all of the files/keys from the collectibles he sells, he destroy immediately. But unfortunately, there is one collectible set to which he didn't delete all of the files which he then used to get money from and gamble it all away (as for owlcatz who came in contact with him).I think this may not be a gambling discussion per se, but it's a textbook example of how gamblers can throw everything away just to get their fill of their gambling hunger. Mind you, his reputation is years in the making, but because of his gambling itch he just threw it all away.",

He was supposed to destroy all private keys but somehow months after selling the wallets happened to find a bunch of them? He intentionally kept them because \"what if I need them one day, what if someone deposits a million dollars?\" What's done is done, the guy is never coming back after this. Personally, I'd never hold bitcoins on such a wallet. In my hands it would only have a decorative purpose. It's a collectible, not a normal wallet.",

And sorry for those who lost their bitcoin in the scam that Yogg pulled, no one really expect it from him, until suddenly unknown to us, this trusted member is a gambling addicted behind. Yes, his reputation is ruined and the project itself which has been running for many years now.As for the gambling addiction, it's really hard to help those people unless they are willing to help themselves. Even if we spot them, maybe it's too late. But if you know someone who are into it, better talk to them right now, sort of intervention.",

Gambling addiction is a very strong negative influence that it could make the sufferer irrational in thinking. They can gamble with people's funds without having any viable means or plans of recovering such losses. My heart goes to people that have lost their money in this project. The scammer said he is not going to return to the forum again. If he is still addicted to gambling, he might still create another account and dupe members of this forum again. He needs to see an addiction psychologist for treatment and he should seek for funds to refund all he has stolen from the people.",

Not only that, it creates ripples and damages the reputation of any future collectible creators because less people will be so trusting in future after such a widespread scandal. I think it's a bit lame to blame it on a gambling addiction, because there are some addicts out there who know their limits and do not stoop to the level of stealing to fund it. If you want to spend your own money on this, do as you please, but once you start stealing other peoples hard earned cash you have crossed the line into criminality and financial fraud which is far beyond normal behavior.",
