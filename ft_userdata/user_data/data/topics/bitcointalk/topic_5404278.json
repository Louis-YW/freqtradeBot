      "body": "This is an old coin that doesn't have a good progress, the same thing that happened with ark coin. It's not worth to invest in this coin. The era for SDK already gone and lisk is not even a useful coin for now. Just becuase a small pump didn't make this coin is good to invest right now. I think that if you shall consider your choice again to invest in this coin. I would like to avoid to deal with this coin and try to pick another coin that is even more legit compared with lisk. The era for lisk already gone and this will not go up like what happened with another major coin again.",
