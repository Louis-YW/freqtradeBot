But what makes this artwork so special? And who is mx12? While no names or faces are revealed, the artist's story begins in 2015, a year of rebirth following a coma. From that moment, mx12 emerged as a fighter, a Bitcoin artist, a bitcoiner battling not just for survival but also for financial freedom. While there's a much larger story behind the scenes about the artist, let's focus on THE ONLY DIAMONDS!Mx12 is an artist who never gives up, regardless of the obstacles faced. The day finally arrived after 5-6 years since the accident to hold a private exhibition in London. This event was a culmination of years of investment, a chance to connect with people and share the story behind the art, to explain why the artist continues to create Bitcoin art with an unstoppable passion. However, tragedy struck as illness struck just before the exhibition. Yet, undeterred - some may say \"foolishly\" - mx12 still attended the event. But alas, the temperature soared, the heart faltered, and the artist fell. Two to three days in one of London's finest hospitals followed, then two more weeks in Germany. It was during this time that THE ONLY DIAMOND was born, sketched in the hospital and completed at home.The event in London was supposed to be brilliant. Each artwork felt like a diamond in that space. Observing people's interactions with the art on social media felt surreal - you see it, but you can't reach it. Sometimes, even Bitcoin feels like that. That's why it's crucial to safeguard your private keys and passwords, because without them, access to your assets can seem tantalizingly out of reach.——————————————Here's a sneak peek behind the scenes of mx12Art: Each artwork, after that accident, serves as a memory. No art, no memories!——————————————As of now, this listing is being updated as the artwork is halfway to being sold out, with 6 out of 12 pieces remaining.Typically, there's a limitation of 12 artworks in mx12's collection. Two of the artworks are loaded via Opendime with 1,200,000 sats, and one is still open for loading.——————————————Details:Artwork Size: 17x25 inches (44.6x64.6cm)Material: Alu-Dibond-Finart (print is on aluminum)Lamination for protection against moisture, UV light, and scratches12-color printing process for stunning, high-quality results——————————————Until this moment, the artwork includes Satodime, which is similar to Opendime but with additional technology.It offers more vaults and a way to check Bitcoin balance via NFC without needing to destroy the artwork. However, if you wish to claim loaded bitcoins, you must destroy the artwork to access the chip card via USB.About Satodime: It's not just a storage device, it embeds an EAL6+ certified smart chip that acts as a secure element (SE) to handle your keys (public and private) with care.Private keys are strictly sealed within the secure chip, and you don't know the keys until you redeem them. The color of the key slot turns from green to red when it's unsealed.——————————————Here's what collectors have to say about mx12Art: \"Finally got this! I love it! Shocked. When you buy something from mx12.levins, you don't just get an amazing rare piece of art and Bitcoin history; you'll also find he's one of the kindest souls out there!

Screenshots are difficult because I cannot copy/paste the addresses used to check what happened exactly... Sorry for the trouble, and the bs last night... Deleting my post later when I'm allowed ...  If you can post more detailed info, I would be glad to help. Dustin's account looks ok to me at first glance anyhow? Thanks!",

Happy Birthday my brother I don't know how they did it, but I had something like this earlier - maybe you did click on strange link or so. What I have learned myself from this and everyone of course should learn from this - is that if the buyer asks you send the Bitcoin back to him, don't send to another address only the same bitcoin address possible to return. Second is you should contact him via other platform, you don't need to be worried asking - scammer are always getting better and no matter how good you know the person, you should contact buyer via other platform as well if he asks for refund. If the buyer is saying/writing you that he has open escrow with someone than you should contact them and ask if there is an escrow. Please be careful, with love Mx12",

And now, I'm gearing up to bring it to life with an AR animation! 🚀Speaking of sketches, it was an unforgettable week. I had grand plans for the mx12art exhibition in London at the iconic London Whale 🐋. I poured my heart, soul, and resources into it, overcoming challenges and forging ahead with unwavering determination.But fate took a turn. On the event day in London, my body rebelled, and I experienced health issues with some of my organs. I initially ignored it, driven by my commitment to the event. My body's temperature soared for an extended period, leading to my hospitalization. Even the doctors were taken aback.I woke up disoriented, asking if I was still in Israel. It was a frightening experience. Medical intervention worked wonders, and after a week, I was transferred to Germany, where I spent another two weeks under medical care.During my time in the hospital, I found solace in sketching, and the doctors' assistants fell in love with this particular duck. That's when I decided to scan it and complete it. Voilà! Our first duck artwork was born, with a second one in the works. I'm even considering extending this captivating series. 🦆✨Life's twists and turns often lead to unexpected artistry. Stay tuned for more creative adventures! 🎨🌟",
