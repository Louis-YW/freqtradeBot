  "content": "Please give a link to another topic if this has already been discussed (and solved ?), if I post this it is because I did not find anything.Hello !First post here, did not crawl a lot through the forum other to research material on this question - and I did not find.Context that lead to this thoughtThis might be a false idea, but again I did not find anything (I'm not that good at searching either) so I consider these scenarios possible.I started thinking, almost a year ago now, about what will happen when we got secp256k1-breaking quantum computers.I know that we will have developed a replacement quantic-proof algorithm that will secure our current funds, but here is not the thing.What will happen to old, lost UTXOs ? How will them be protected ? Should them even be protected ?Because here it is:If we patch old UTXOs with a locking script condition, like Code:if (quaticPatch has been there for over X blocks && thisUtxoIsNotPatched) { unusable UTXO }We definitely burn all the lost supply.Burning the lost supply is the current way of doing things, and it fits well for now, but as unspendable UTXO dust accumulates, and mnemonics get lost, maybe in the near-future we will change our minds.I'm no expert in burning sats, but I think we already got less than 20 millions bitcoins to play with, right ?Even if somehow, getting my sats scarcer seems nice, I think that profiting from the entire 21m supply Satoshi gave us, in a global scale, would be good.Especially when considering that gigacorpos and giga states will probably push for an \"unlocking fork\" one day or another, because we will be talking about getting hands on nearly 20% of the Earth's monetary wealth.So I think that we will just keep those old coins unprotected, and the corpos will crack their private keys to spend them.\"Satoshi is back ! Thousands and thousands of entire bitcoins moved !\"\"Bitcoin OGs are from {insert first country to do that} ?\"I think this is a bad future, a future I do not want to live, where the very same people Satoshi wanted us to be protected from loots the first epoch or so.And I think that you can already imagine what I mean by Perishable UTXOs !Perishable UTXOsIt is because I do not want states nor corpos to loot all the \"lost\" coins that I've thought about perishable UTXOs.The concept speeks for itself: after a determined amount of time alive, let's say E epochs, where E could be 4, any UTXO becomes claimable by miners.Why miners ? They are big corpos, they will even be states, but they are forced in some way to make sats circulate. Wether it is directly, by selling / spending fresh coins (or fees), or indirectly, by storing those sats and rely on a friendly actor to cover power expenses.This would allow the total supply to be circulating in the economy at some point, hopefully before quantum computing gets used to crack this old coins.To enhance our chances to avoid this last case scenario, we could \"sentence\" un-quatum-upgraded UTXOs to be unspendable in any case, some blocks after the quatum-protection address soft-fork, so they would be \"protected\" from quantum attackers untill perish.The distribution to the miners could be limited to X amount of UTXOs per block, so it helps spreading the old coins among miners. X could be ten.The implementation of this feature does not seem too complex, even though I did not crawl Bitcoin Core's code yet, but I think it will be in the form of when creating a new UTXO, using a different unlocking script which would contain a \"I'm a miner and this UTXO is old\" flag, then the nodes would check the time the UTXO has been alive, and agrees if it is older than E, and of course verifying there are no more than X inputs. Outside of this specific transaction, every node should be verifying that the new locking script is similar to the coinbase transaction, to ensure it really is a miner doing this.Again, I am not a Bitcoin Core expert, this is just a hint that could be in fact a terrible way of implementing this feature.I think that's it, thank you if you read it all, now this is an open debate on if this all makes sense or not at all and I just wasted time and brain juice.If you partially agree with all of this, please lt us know your version of the story so we can think together to enhance things.",

      "body": "Presumed lost bitcoins from the very early days mostly did not have any spent UTXOs so they are protected from any advancements in computing that will arise in the future. The public address will need to be available and used to get the private keys, satoshi for example has never spent his coins, so there is no way to get to the public key or the coins in them.Bitcoin is freedom, no coins should be presumed lost and recirculated to anyone else. That is against what Bitcoin is.",

Â just out of FEAR of QC is more foolish than just letting some QC owner brute old PK keysthe main genius of satoshi was to make bitcoin, his secondary genius was to make a few transactions leaving some signature proofs for some addresses, and then leave... which 13 years after leaving has been battle tested and no one has been able to steal his coins on old PK keys. which has provided good proof of security.",

      "body": "There are two parts in your topic.One part is the ECC being broken and needing to be replaced.Second part is lost/abandoned coins/keys.Considering how the concept of \"lost coins\" makes no sense in a system like Bitcoin, nobody should ever touch them. Even if ECC is broken and anybody could spend those. That simply goes against Bitcoin principles.The only thing I could see happening is the very special scenario where ECC is considered broken. In which case, there should be migration period where we replace ECC (or components of it like the 256-bit curve) with something else. It could last a year or a couple of years. In that period people should move their coins to the new algorithm themselves and after the deadline any coin that is not moved should be locked forever (instead of being claimed by a miner or anything like that).",

They don't agree with that at all. Even if it was 100 years. Or a million. I think that's a ridiculous point of view to have. After all, try depositing money into any financial institution and never touch the account and see if it's even open 20 years from now. It won't be. They will have turned the money over to somewhere else and you'll have to go there and try and get it if you can even get it at all. So I don't think its unreasonable for utxos to have a time limit of 100 or 250 years. Now would I actually WANT that? I don't know but everything else in the real world has an expiration date.
