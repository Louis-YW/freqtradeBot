  "content": "Hello guys.I want 240,000 sats in BTC and in exchange I offer 250,000 on the Lightning Network.Notes:1. As I don't have any trust in this forum, I will pay the invoice first. In fact I want to increase my trust here, so I would appreciate it if I could get a good feedback afterwards.2. I want the other user to have positive feedback since as I said I will pay first.3. Normally I do this via Robosats but I can't find any offers there.4. Feel free to contact me via PM.",
