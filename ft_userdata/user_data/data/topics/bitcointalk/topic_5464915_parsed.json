  "content": "It have been 4 months passed since we launched Canxium with the goal of creating a fully decentralized reliable coin and become a Demand-Driven Supply BlockChain. Offline mining is one of our main feature to separate the chain operation and coin mining from each other, so in the future we can operate the chain without mining new coins if there is no demand.Let test our offline mining and share the testing reward of 250 CAU.Offline Mining Guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o81-oFBCC7sWebsite: https://canxium.org",
