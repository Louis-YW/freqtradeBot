  "content": "My spot market trading stradegy.First we need to understood that coin the assets can fall down max of 100% and Even this one is very high % Usually it's 10%-30% price fall in 24 hours.Here is the example what i do: I have 1000$ capital for this If coin falling let's say 30% i buy with 300$ so Im safe.If coin falling 10% then i'll buy 100$ The 24 hours % fall Will show me the % i can buy it from my total capital.Once i buy it i'll wait for rebound and then i'll sell it for higher price.If i buy with Same % of my capital then i Will have capital left enough of my total money to buy up all 100% price fall.I hope you like it and it Will help you",

If you go for 1x and losing, you will go for higher leverage. It is tempting traders to use a higher leverage which makes this kind of strategy to be very dangerous. Averaging is better and make trading or investment to be less risky, unlike the martingale strategy that makes trading and investment to be riskier, making money loss to be more possible.",

      "body": "This strategy is the primary beginner's strategy where the trader tries to minimize the risk, not going in at once is good and buying only small percentages of the total capital is also good but then you must know that as the risk loss is minimal so will your profits be small since it is based on your total investment. Nothing goes for nothing so at that we must be prepared to face whatever becomes of our trading decision vs how we manage our risk, it depends on the trader whether or not his skills can contain the risk, some traders will go all in with the total amount of $1000 instead of dividing the amount into lower percentages of $100.",

If you read all then you get the point how it works.While Im buying asset with this stradegy on spot market i use just with 3% with 3x leverage short in case Market Will do bigger drop down.Usually when i averaging dips down on spot Market i use small leverage short position to use it as hedge and anyone who been trading long enough knows it's smart way probably smartest ways to trade.",

      "body": "Spot trading is safer than futures trading because you can keep your asset in account even if the price drops by 50% of your purchase price as long as you don't sell it, therefore it's quitely safe to invest large sums. However, your strategy, in my opinion, is a little riskier for me because you're relying on the percentage of the price decrease in 24 hours, so if the price of an asset drops 30%, you're trading 30% of your total funds. Here's the thing: From what I've seen in the market, following a significant drop in price, it will continue to fall. So it's not a good plan for me. This is just my opinion. Well, this is just my viewpoint, and if you believe your strategy is profitable, you can keep employing it. It's fine as long as you're profiting from your trading strategy.",

Everyone keeps saying it's just TA and trading, but I keep pointing out nobody has the balls to show their trades because nobody can remain consistently in profit for years. I keep getting called bad by traders, but I think it's worse to tell newbies they can learn trading and make profits. It's not as easy as everyone claims. If it is, we would have tons of threads with people showing real time balances and performance, but we don't, right?",
