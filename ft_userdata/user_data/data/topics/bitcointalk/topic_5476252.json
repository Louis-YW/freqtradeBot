  "content": "Why are target prices and especially resistance level terms that people use so much?  What is the point of saying target price unless you are going to buy or sell btc at that price?  Or is that what people mean by the target price? When you have people talk about overcoming the resistance level of 22k and things like that.  Then talk about how there will be a barrier at 24k.  Are people just randomly spewing stupid numbers out there?  First off, are people just randomly pulling numbers out whether it's 22k or 33k?  And why those numbers?  It gets even more foolish when there is talk about resistance level at 32700 when say btc price is 31200.  Is there a big difference between saying the resistance level at 32700 or 32900?  Why not just say 33k? Then again why not say 35k?  So if it passes the resistance level of 33k, then there is no talk about it anymore?  Well it eventually will go back down to 25k and then there will be talk and gossip about will it hit the target or resistance level of 27k.  Does anyone here find this just stupid or pure garbage?  I mean btc has hit 27k and 33k many times and went back down and went back up.  To me, unless you are talking about the all time high or close to it, what's the point of all this nonsense?  Now the same can be said about altcoins but this talk always seem to be about btc and eth and the top coins. When there is talk about these target prices or resistance levels in the news or threads about it here... it seems stupid.  Like when btc went above 20k and then went really fast above it to 22k.  People say wow it went over that 20k level so fast.  The same when it went to 30k and then 33k.  But it then went down all the way to 15k etc.  Is this just all gossip or pure garbage discussion?  Or is there something I'm missing here?  I have no issue when people ask will btc hit 50k again or the all time high or higher.  But when they say anyone here think it will have issues at the resistance level at 27k, then there are lot of replies about it... it just seems foolish.  I mean is there really a difference between going past 27k compared to 28k?  This talk makes it sound like it's a video game like when you played as a kid saying oh this level x boss is very tough so level 27 boss is tough but the 28k boss is much easier.  Yet these are just numbers and people making it seem like certain numbers are tougher to reach?  Then it reaches it again many times and goes back down many times and you hear this discussion yet again.  Now if I'm wrong here, can someone explain to me what I am wrong here about?  Unless you are trading actively, all this is basically just useless noise right?",

It has got nothing to do with the entire market as parameters for \"target prices\" vary.Resistance levels are just levels where the price of an assets bounces off and reverses downwards, its  not a complicated situation, however, it is pertinent to note that a resistance level can be someone's \"target price\".",

      "body": "Actually, there isnt a resistance zone. Instead, its more of a band that changes based on how investors and the market think. Investors arent making up numbers like 27k or 33k when they talk about barrier levels. After looking at old data, these numbers show places where Bitcoin has been sold off in the past.To put it another way, these numbers are like psychological signs for buyers. As a result, supply and demand have been affected by changes in investor feelings at those times. Yeah, the arguments can get too heated at times, but they're not completely pointless. Patterns, not just prices, are important. There is a lot of psychology behind these talks, even if they seem like just guesswork. If investors feel happy buying or selling at certain levels, that affects the price movement. Although, keep in mind that Bitcoin, like any other asset, is open to changes in the market, and these levels are only suggestions, not rules.",

This is just like you're trying to perform a trade and decided to make use of a limit or instead of a market order, you can wait for long without having your order being confirmed with the value of the rate you place for the market to sell, so it's more easier to use a market order than limit which is under assumptions, if you guess right, you win and if you don't then you losse or keep waiting for your order to get confirmed, we may not be always accurate with the way we predicted our own market view, remember we are dealing with a volatile currency, it can go the opposite of what we presumed.",

However, they can only show their strength when their is not short and long squeeze, their effectiveness diminishes under extreme pressure of squeeze . Wherever intense short or long squeeze occurs, no matter how strong these support and level are, eventually they will be broken, and in such scenarios, accounts of future traders are often liquidated if they don't use any risk management tools, such as stop-loss.",

Regarding the price history repeating itself, I don't think it's because the price movements are also different. Candlesticks cannot be used as a benchmark, sometimes their movements are wild depending on market supply and demand and the market players themselves.What you say often becomes a trader's benchmark for measuring an order block or resistance/support. And this order block can be a strong benchmark for the direction of price movements, but can also sometimes be deceptive depending on the direction of the trend itself.The conclusion I can draw here is that in trading we need several supporting data, just one data is not enough.",

I just have to believe that Bitcoins predictions is the investors anxieties that also speculates the rumours of Bitcoin.@ OP, I am backing your exaggerations up with the previous historical prices of Bitcoin that has the rate of the coin at the values of UPs and DOWNs. Bitcoin is flexible to inflations and deinflations that is depended to the investors of demands and supplies which is certainly undefinable because Bitcoin is a global accepted measure of investment and of course a unified digital currency for exchange of goods and services which doesn't have the system to its users totality present to its investors and not even to the expert trades whom are believed to have accurate or convince able predictive experiences.Here is the historical prices of Bitcoin which its history is liable to repeat itself or certain history is termed unbeatable. I believe we have since been expecting the price of Bitcoin to to get to or beat the history price of November 2021 where the price was at $69k and yet unbeatable while investor still appreciate the current price of todays can could termly say it is a bull running at when accelerating from mergings like $25 to $39k as today and it is being appreciated yet still doesn't beat the highest price in history yet.Interestingly you can read about in my previous thread tjat talks about \"The will of Bitcoin is not the will of man\".https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5474920.msg63259941#msg63259941That is just to say the agitations, the predictions and the exaggerations about the values of Bitcoin is just rumours just as OP has said it is because Bitcoin is hovered according to its potential volatility.",
