  "content": "BITCOIN AND NUMEROLOGY:SECRETS OF NUMBERSDid you guys think for a while that digits have their meanings or beliefs? Maybe many of you didn't think about it because we just see digits and nothing more, nor were we even guided by someone. In today's post, I will tell you about the beliefs or meanings behind the digits.>NUMEROLOGY  Well, numerology simply means the secret meaning or code in a number. People usually think that every number has its own special meanings, which can influence our lives, events, and the things surrounding us. According to the study, numbers are not just used for counting but carry some meanings and symbols. For example, the number 1 in numerology is associated with wealth, and the number 8 means success.The interesting thing is that this numerology is not a modern-day invention but has been used for many years, starting before the medieval ages and happening in today's time.> Numerology and Bitcoin.This post is about Bitcoin. We can use numerology in many aspects of life, but in this post, I will only focus on Bitcoin to explore what numerology says about it and whether this relates to Bitcoin or not. I checked it and was wondering after examining it. Numbers like 21 million, 69,000 ATH, the Bitcoin genesis block, the halving event, and the name Satoshi itself have some meanings. You may see them as digits or letters, but numerology sees them differently. Before going into it, here is a chart sheet of Bitcoin events, their numbers, meanings, and connections with Bitcoin..Chart Sheet> Numerology and Bitcoin Examples> Satoshi Nakamoto Name CodeStarting from the founder of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto. First, his name is in letters, so we can assign digits to letters, like 1 for A, 2 for B, and so on. The pictures below show the numerology math of Satoshi's name.As you can see, his number is 1, which means in numerology a leader or pioneer. Nothing is hidden from the world, Bitcoin was created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the founder and leader of Bitcoin. You can see how these digits correctly show the meanings behind them. Now, let's move on to another example.> Bitcoin Total Supply (21 million)In the picture, the result for the total supply is 3, which represents creativity and growth in numerology. Satoshi set a total supply for Bitcoin at 21 million, and millions of Bitcoins have been mined, with only a few left to be mined soon. This total supply is fixed, but the Bitcoin price increases every year, especially after halving, which reduces the supply and increases demand and price,  which eventually help bitcoin growth> New ATHLet's check what numerology says about Bitcoin's new ATH of 109, let's break it down in numerology.The ATH number is 4, and in numerology, 4 represents stability, structure, and hard work. We know the 100k milestone was very hard, but Bitcoin surpassed it and reached 109k, which shows its stability and strength as an asset. This number also reflects that the Bitcoin community is doing their hard work for the betterment of Bitcoin and has a structure of blockchain that is more transparent than ever before.> Genesis Block Date  The next one is the genesis block date, which is January 3, 2009. Everyone knows the history of this date; let's go to its numerological mathematics.The number is 6, which means in numerology it represents fairness and balance. Bitcoin was created by Satoshi to bring balance to money, eliminating banks and the centralization of money. Instead, the user controls his or her money. The aim of this system is to create a fair and decentralized system. Everyone can track the transaction, and the price will not be controlled by a single entity. Bitcoin was responsible as it started to empower users to have control over their own money, not by others..The post is related to Bitcoin, so the main focus is on Bitcoin events and related topics. However, you can also calculate your birthday date to learn about your personality. The calculation is simple, you have to add the numbers, and when the result is a two-digit number, reduce it to one digit. Then, check it against the ideas behind that number. There are three numbers known as master numbers, if your result is 11, 22, or 33, then it is a master number, and you should not reduce it to one digit. If you know some more interesting things about Bitcoin, please share them here to see what numerology says about it. The discussion is open for all, and your responses will be appreciated with respect and dignity.Source: All the images are made through the Canva application, and the information on numerology is taken from here, while Bitcoin information is sourced from here.",

Numbers have their meanings as well. From my childhood, I just used numbers for counting and many more things. Many are not aware of this, but when I heard about numerology, that every number has its own meaning, I was wondering at that moment and applied it to my birthday date. You won't believe it, the meanings tell about my birthday number, and I relate to it 70% with my qualities. Then I came up with the idea that I would be very curious if I applied it to Bitcoin. I used Bitcoin events for it, and the results are in the post you can check.The reason for giving reference means I take the meanings of numbers from there, and the idea of using those numbers' meanings on Bitcoin and its events is my own. I’m not aware if someone has worked on it before. I bring this information here, which is very interesting and debatable, but it seems like no one is showing interest in my post, and that's why it has been ignored by the community.",

Well, numerology is like predicting, people do it, but they are not sure about the results. The same goes for numerology, you can check the meanings and relate them to yourself, but they may not be 100% correct. In the case of Bitcoin, you see that the meaningful numbers and the agendas of Bitcoin are the same. For example, the number 1 represents a leader; Satoshi, who created Bitcoin, is number 1 and the leader of the crypto world. I didn't create these numbers and their meanings, but I check their meanings and relate them to Bitcoin, and I was wondering, so I brought up the topic here to see what people say about it.",
