If they continue to do this way we need to understand that site is SCAM.I doubt that will work. They decided to ignore complaints here too  Quote from: Coinbox1 on January 11, 2023, 11:22:19 AMUpon reviewing our past communications on this forum, we have decided to stop participating in any topic on this Scam Accusations board going forward.If there is any complaint post in the future, please direct the complainant to this announcement. We will still be monitoring tickets on reputable arbitration sites e.g. AskGamblers and CasinoGuru to clear up the confusion. The primary reason for this decision is the behavior of certain members of this board who, at least from our perspective, have repeatedly distorted our statements and made public threats in our previous communications. This kind of conversation they are fond of, and in general, their preferred ways of communication, is not something we should be involved in according to our code of conduct, and it is simply too much for our employees to bear emotionally. Just like most forum members, our employees are living people. Men, women, with family and kids. We have a responsibility to ensure they are not subject to unnecessary emotional harms. For this reason, we found it extremely difficult to continue as before, because our employees' mental health was at risk. Best,TrustDice Team",

Sorry for what happened to you, I hope that Coinbox1 will come here to clarify and solve your problem, he is last active today or you can send him a private message.There is a question for you:Have you tried to use any Photoshop software to modify your passport? If the answer is noThen any representative of Trustdice should ask you for a selfie while you hold a passport or a recorded video clip of you. because what they indicated to you that the documents are fake without giving more details is totally unfair.It is worth noting that there is one of the new complaints on Trustpilot from one of their clients who faced the same problem as you about fake documents, and they explained that their risk department reviewed his documents, but they also did not clarify more details, just copying and pasting their terms without any clarifications or procedures they ask or take from the client so that they make the right decision.",

      "body": "The casino's representative, Coinbox1, will surely not reply to you in your scam accusation thread. He already made the mistake (in his eyes) to engage this community in a discussion and made a fool out of himself. After that, they changed their internal policies and decided not to communicate with this community. It's impossible to determine if you were cheated by them or if you tried to submit fake KYC data based on the few sentences you wrote in the OP. Theoretically, everything you said can be true, but it can also be a lie. Trustdice will communicate with 3rd-party mediators like AskGamblers or Casino.Guru. My suggestion is compile all the evidence you have against them and begin a complaint process. If they accept your case, post the links to the discussions here so everyone can follow the development.",

The communication now goes through the 3rd-party mediator. What's that post about the casino sending you $24.50? Is that to your personal wallet or the casino wallet? My understanding is that your casino account is blocked, as in banned. Can you still log in to it?",

Is there an explanation sent by email or any ways of communication that imformed you where the 25$ is calculated from? If they refunded your initial deposit, 0.032BTC, it should be 650usd-ish, not 25.I would agree with pmalek, as you've escalated the issue to an arbitrator, we are now have to wait and respect their decision. Meanwhile, albon's suggestion seems made quite a sense; if you don't mind, providing a video evidence to CasinoGuru --not here-- of you holding your passport might works in your favor, as it'll be more believable that you didn't tamper with your documents through editing --unless you're a certified professional CGI creator.",

Just make sure you send it via email to the email address the agent gives you and not publicly on their forum. Additionally, the video should show both your passport/ID and your face so that they can see it's you holding your own documents. Suggest it in your casino.guru thread and see what they say about it.",

But if that's also proven to be quite difficult to be verified, I think OP can --if they would-- ask for video conference. I would boldly presume video editing is damn near difficult during live feeds, and if the passport in their country works as how mine works, they will have holograms and other security measures that'll rather hard to be forged --as in OP printed a fake passport and hold it during the video conference-- thus authenticating it and OP's credibility would be easier.And looking at the thread on CG, I think it's less to the representative took a long time to verify the documents and more to because OP send several new evidences. If you look closely, OP uploaded another posts that --as per this post was made-- were kept as private for review  three days ago and six hours ago,This could mean two things, IMO, either CG internally --maybe by email-- asked OP to provide another evidences because the other ones are invalid, or OP voluntarily provided a video as evidence like what some of us here suggested.",
