  "content": "It seems that rumors which began in March of this year are really heating up now.  There are lots of people on social media discussing a supposedly pending buyout offer of the Sandbox by Facebook (now Meta) for the price of 4 billion dollars.  I'm not sure how that would effect their SAND currency, or if the rumors are based in reality, but the total SAND market cap right now sits at around 1.5 billion dollars.  While I don't expect this offer to directly translate to a 4 billion dollar market cap for SAND, the popularity of Facebook/Meta would certainly have a positive effect on the development and value of things connected to the Sandbox.  Anyone have any more details on these rumors or incite on what will happen to SAND as a result of a deal (if true) with Facebook/Meta?",

Maybe its just a gimmick or fomo rumors created by some guys just to pump sand.But if this will materialize for sure there is gonna be a huge major pump for sand.",

It makes sense to see Meta acquired Sandbox and add it into their ecosystem.According to Coinmarketcap, Sandbox is the third biggest Metaverse project but difference between Sandbox and two projects above: Decentraland and ApeCoin is not too big. They can flip over two projects and take the first position anytime in the Metaverse category.The rumor will heat up Sandbox and Meta on social media and will impact their prices on crypto and stock markets.",

I am sure that there are some who will value their possessions more, than the money that is being offered to them no matter how big it was. They can still earn decent anyway since sandbox is still the leading metaverse/nft project up until this date though you're right.Facebook has the money and they can use all that money to hire good developers to develop a project with the same concept and can be much better than what the sandbox is offering now. Also they won't have a problems with promotions since they can just use their own platform. Sandbox are going to be threatened heavily if that is going to happen.",
