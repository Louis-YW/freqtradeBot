During non-celebration time, the rule of interest-free borrowing is that AEX Loan offers a tiered discount to the interest rate of such dominant cryptos like BTC and ETH according to the LTV, which means the lower the LTV is, the lower the interest rate is, and when the LTV is below 15%, you can enjoy free interest.During the celebration, AEX provides discounts on the 0-interest borrowing that once the LTV is below 30%, users can borrow with 0 interest. And moreover, users can receive a 50% off voucher to help them obtain more discounts on interest rates in their future borrowing.Borrowing in the blockchain field means users can borrow another coin by collateralizing one of their coins.
