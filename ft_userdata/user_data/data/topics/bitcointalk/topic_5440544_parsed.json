But how crypto will be at risk if an AI bot is able to create a good trading bot which can execute trades with better perfection? Market manipulation is also a very old concept and exists even before the AI became reality. So AI needs to go a long way before it can actually manipulate the market with fake orders. A risk is always there but should that stop innovation?",

The AI bot is making mistakes. I know that there's a lot of room for improvement, when in comes to AI, but it's kinda early to expect the crypto industry to get destroyed by AI bots.

Nope.It's theoretically possible for multiple trading bots to manipulate the cryptocurrency prices, but the costs of implementing such price manipulation would be pretty high. It's way easier to spread FUD on the social media and cause panic selling.Precisely. That's a good point out there and its also true that it's much easier to spread rumors than pay to use bots for manipulation. It's always effective on causing massive panic when you're using the most conventional way which is through FUD. I'm not saying this for bad purposes but mostly this happens a lot before and based from that it was effective although it's used in a bad way. Right now bots are still far from completion and it still needs a lot of improvements but, we couldn't deny that it slowly shows how much opportunities and benefits it could bring to our day to day tasks.",

Let us do back analysis of the ChatGPT. They are based on the data which is available throughout the internet. There is no filtering program yet or if there is any then its not doing the job correctly yet. Let us understand what we are looking at here. Whenever you ask a question to the ChatGPT then it will give you ABC answer in the first attempt. If you are not convinced then it will give you another answer. This time it could be arranged in different way, it will have more or less paragraphs, it will have more or less information. It may trim some part in the second attempt and may add some extra likewise. The problem starts when you ask the ChatGPT same question 3rd time or more. It will only keep scrambling all your answers and keep producing almost similar response later. Now if the implications are done to critical pattern analysis like trading then imagine what it may do? It will have it's reliance on millions of failed trades to give some positive outputs. I don't know I do believe it's sort of \"fresh\" tech out of the blues.",

As far as I know, this artificial intelligence has self-awareness disabled. Then what did the developers see in the process of creating it? We are on the threshold of amazing discoveries.

There have been a lot of so-called ground breaking technologies out there which in reality did not pan out to the widespread effect that was claimed by many at the start. Let's not forget that there have been many cases where it gets information wrong and it also gathers information largely from people who have produced it beforehand. While it may put certain groups of people out of a job, which should be beneficial to everyone in the long run as automation often frees up people for other employment opportunities elsewhere, it will probably not go as far as the doom and gloom predicts - of putting everyone in IT out of a job. Bot trading has been around for decades already and as it is based on heavily outdated information it's not really that advanced in comparison.",
