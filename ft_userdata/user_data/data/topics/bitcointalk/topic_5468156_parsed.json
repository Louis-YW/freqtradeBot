      "body": "Congrats, I looked through the site and found the enormous amount of games there, I didn't signup. But tried to ask, via live chat, the support team some question about the casino, but it doesn't load till now. What could be wrong with the live chat page, because I have not joined the website, I'd want to know about the blockchain page I saw on your website. Is it a list of cryptocurrency you accept or blockchain games? However, welcome here, having publicity all over the internet would help disseminate 9G casino to more potential players, especially on this forum.Quote from: 9G on September 26, 2023, 11:39:16 AMAt the same time, holding the Curacao gaming license allows us to have a higher reputation in the industry and gain the trust of more excellent game manufacturers.Where you operating without a license? If yes, that means you've got some loyal players on the casino that trusted the site despite the fact it's not licensed. Definitely, players would crawl into the casino and play with full trust. Obtaining license from Curacao is fine and would boost the reach of your casino, as players like myself check these things before using any casino. Adding more games to the existing ones in the casino is also a welcome development as lots of these games are already played too much and no longer enjoyable. It's relevant to test new games, while playing we enjoy them, regardless of win or loss.",

These are the campaign managers that I can advice you to contact: Trofo: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1099980Royse777: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=366632Hhampuz: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=881377icopress: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1137579Little Mouse: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=2344286Contact any of them if you want an advice on how to promote your casino on this forum.",

      "body": "welcome to the forum, your casino has a very beautiful designer and congratulations on acquiring the Curacao license, it is true that any business must be operated with a license, so that it complies with government laws, although having a Curacao license is a good thing in the sense that the casino is complying with the laws, the negative part is that the license provider, which in this case is Curacao, when a customer complains about a casino or accuses a casino of being a scam, the license provider in Curacao does not nothing, I've never seen the government of Curacao learning a casino's license because of many scam accusations, I've never seen the government of Curacao arresting any casino owner because of scam accusations against the casinoso I would say that this license is good for only the government to see that you have a license, but in terms of usefulness for customers, this license is useless, it does not protect customers in cases of complaints, to be honest I think that governments should not be forcing online casinos to have licenses, since there are still no laws on cryptocurrencies in most countries and as a result many respectable countries do not give licenses to online casinos easily, they create many barriers and refuse to give licenses and as respectable countries do not They don't give licenses but governments ask for licenses, so the only viable option became curacao.I haven't seen the TOS at your casino, I don't know if there is and I haven't seen it, but I would like to be able to see and read the TOS at your casino, I want to understand the kyc rules, the bonus rules and more. Many casinos have absurd rules about withdrawal and bonus requirements, things like high minimum withdrawal amounts and 3x or more wager to be able to withdraw, become a big headache and that's why it's important to read the TOS to know this and then decide whether it would be good to create an account or not",

Mainly English mixed with some random Chinese and Spanish and so on. Feels like you are reading the menu of some kind of Asian/European fusion restaurant.Also I seriously doubt you are an official partner of FIBA to be honest. They won't give their name to a total no name I believe.Still, welcome and prove me wrong.",
