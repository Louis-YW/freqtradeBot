If you meant that you only lost your wallet.dat file, then you should still remember the password to it, and therefore can unscramble your mkey and ckeys. Is this not the case?",

It never happens in Python programs, unless pywallet is calling some other program inside its code. Or maybe the Python interpreter itself crashed (it is written in C), but that is an extremely rare occurrance.",

Why not try craking the walllet.dat file instead you can able to use the BTCrecovery tool to find the exact password of your wallet.dat fileYou can find the source from this guide below- https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover/blob/master/TUTORIAL.md#btcrecover-tutorialOr try this one below which is a bit newer than the above link- https://github.com/3rdIteration/btcrecover/Read the documentation if you have a mining RIG with GPU the GPU acceleration would be awesome to speed up finding your real wallet.dat password.",
