So is this some non-standard way to create tokens on Bitcoin? So like people are creating tokens (just useless meme tokens I assume) on Bitcoin with some non-standard ordinal-specific wallet or something? How are they trading them? As far as I know there aren't any decentralized exchanges like on Ethereum where you can trade anything, since tokens haven't really existed on Bitcoin before except a few old examples. Or is there some non-standard brc-20 wallet that lets you swap them? Or are there some exchanges that are actually listing these random tokens? Where do you even see what the brc-20 tokens are? Are there any popular ones? Are there a lot of them?I don't know how new these things are but I just started hearing about them like a week ago and I was like wtf where did this come from lol??Also I see there has been an spam attack on Bitcoin this past week, and especially I guess on Sunday and Monday. Does this have to do with brc-20? Seems like that's what people are saying. Are people like just minting tons of these random tokens and that is what is flooding the mempool? Or is the spam attack entirely separate?Thanks for any answers, this ordinals thing that popped up a few months ago was weird and pointless enough, now I see meme tokens suddenly apparently being created on Bitcoin and I'm just like what is going on where did this come from?!",

Are there any popular ones? Are there a lot of them?Let's see if I can mash all the answers to this tsunami of ? without sending you to read a linkÂ  Â People found a way to mint tokens (brc20) which theoretically are fungible tokens on the bitcoin protocol, replicating some features of erc20 tokens but with a ton of serious flaws, in short, they are using basically the same let's call it ordinal exploit to mint them.As for trading them, I have no idea if there is a marketplace for them other than https://brc-20.io/ which looks like some 90s cms shop to me. Same for the wallet, I know there are 3 wallets that allow you to mint ordinals, like Xverse but no idea if they support brc-20 tokens, instead, you have a ton of web services where you can mint them quite cheaply if we take into account the fees we pay right now for a normal tx.The bad news:https://twitter.com/TheBinanceNFT/status/1655885586853425152?cxt=HHwWgMCzkeDK8fotAAAABinance is planning on adding ordinals, so from here just a step to adopt brc20 as the smell of cash and fat fees is probably too much for CZ.For the numbers, OMG, just go tohttps://brc-20.io/ there are nearly 15k of them, no idea about \"popularity\" but there must be some with an overall trade volume for 200 million a day!Quote from: thecodebear on May 09, 2023, 12:06:02 PMAlso I see there has been an spam attack on Bitcoin this past week, and especially I guess on Sunday and Monday.

Or is the spam attack entirely separate?Yes to all of them! And is it really a spam attack, users are simply using what's available to them, if some want to pay $1000 to mint a frog meme with their own coins, it's their right, right?Â  Quote from: darkv0rt3x on May 09, 2023, 01:08:45 PMAnd at what price?

The miners will be happy about it because they make more fees and money with this rubbish trend of NFTs on Bitcoin, why force something that is just waste of resources but miners don't see it that way, they see money and opportunities.I will not be surprised if this ordinals and NFTs are done purposely by some miners to increase their mining fee reward and perhaps since election is coming, they will use that to trend so they can make more money from Bitcoin transaction fees but this wouldn't last, it's just a matter of time before they die. Bitcoin will remain Bitcoin and this is just time, it will fade like BRC.",
