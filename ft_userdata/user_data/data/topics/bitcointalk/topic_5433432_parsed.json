  "content": "Hello everyone,After been scammed on qxtraders.com I signed with XQtraders on late January 2022 and I thought it was legit because it was registered with Florida department of state and I made profit, so I was able to withdraw money. I always email customer support and they reply instantly and fix any issues. The website look professional which guarantee 0.8 daily return for a year. I thought it was low risk because compared to scam website they guarantee 1000 percent return or more within 24 hours or less. I believe XQtraders was operating a Ponzi scheme so no real investment is made. I reported the website to anti fraud Canada, FBI, and FTC. The website went offline since October 3rd 2022 and I called Xqtraders and no one pick the phone. I chat with them on WhatsApp and they said original platform had issues so they started new site. Lunofund platform for Nigerians was also shut down in October 2022 after issues with original host and then it disappeared. I believe both platform were made by Nigerian scammers. On telegram group users were able to withdraw up to $10000 USD in 2021 and users were able to make multiple withdrawals. I also saw screenshot email of successful withdrawal. I  think they were scammers to encourage people to sign up. I also made a video on YouTube why Xqtraders is a suspected scam. No mention of loss. The website use to have same wallet address where I send my bitcoin. But this time Xqtraders suggested to email them so they give me different wallet address before I sent them bitcoin. I think because there were reported to authorities. They create new wallet address to escape criminal prosecution. According to Florida department the company name was under Nicholas Spurlock and Kevin Russ and I don’t know if they are real or actors and the phone number appeared Florida number but operating abroad.So does it make a difference if crypto platform guarantee 1000 percent a day or 1 percent a day?People claim XQtraders is legit because they were paying and not yet scammed or fake reviews by the company.Is registration enough or only for tax purpose? I think qxtraders.com and xqtraders are same scammers.Anyone scammed by this company? Feel free to comment.",

This is the first sign of a ponzi pyramid scheme. They pay ppl until they decide to run with big money. Im not sure how you got trapped in this. Quote from: Hamada1983 on January 08, 2023, 05:15:28 AMSo does it make a difference if crypto platform guarantee 1000 percent a day or 1 percent a day?So what do you think where do they get the money from to pay you such high yields? Lol. Just think logically mate.Quote from: Hamada1983 on January 08, 2023, 05:15:28 AMPeople claim XQtraders is legitI cant find much about this in the forum itself, but anybody promoting such scams should be instantly tagged red.I think you're in the wrong board, should be moved to scam accusations board.",

If not, then I doubt they registered with their real name. Quick lookup and it's not that hard to register a company: it cost a hundred bucks or so and can be done onlineBut yeah, all you need is the guaranteed high profit to know it's a scam, money doesn't grow like magic.

Take for example Celsius that offered ROI nowhere close to that (~20%) and yet they had to do a lot of risky stuff in order to be able to do that, and we all know how that ended up.To sum it up, any service that offers you more than ~10% (and even that is very high) per year is very suspicious, but then you should ask yourself if that kind of profit is worth the risk of sending your bitcoin to someone else. I think that answer is obvious.",

To demonstrate to newcomers to their telegram group that there are investors and that there are also successful withdrawals, it is not difficult to create fictitious telegram accounts and fictitious emails. They all talk a lot and act real. These accounts will post screenshots of their payouts and raise questions to admins to look more convincing. Without proper information, innocent people are targeted. You should have realized that investment returns that seem too good to be true are always frauds. There is no such thing as a 292% rate of return offered by banks and large investment firms. Even a yearly investment return of 10% is already considered extremely risky.",

Anyone know if programinspect.com is legit or done by scammers?So I checked some of their reviews and in my opinion they can't be trusted and they are getting paid to write a positive review for an obvious scam, or they are making money via referral links. For example, they concluded that Lunofund is a legit while in reality it was nothing but a ponzi scheme hidden behind \"bitcoin mining\" that offered completely unrealistic 2% daily profit. They do write negative reviews, but it is justa  tactic to appear more legit, like they are really testing the sites.Rule of thumb: any website offering you more than few % APY is a straight scam, that simply won't last for longer period of time. Instead of wasting your time and money with these dodgy websites, why don't you just buy bitcoin instead and store it in your own non-custodial wallet?",
