If you want to attend again, it will also be bad. This is because you have good knowledge about Bitcoin. All those half-baked information about Bitcoin will offend you because you hold the real information. I bet you, they will not talk about Bitcoin in that conference, it is a group of guys that invented an altcoin, they are looking for people to dump it on.",

I've watched the previous broadcasts of the Bitcoin Conference (specifically, 2022), and I'd say it's generally good; or at least miles better than I've seen. Having a Bitcoin conference doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to feed you the same old information about Bitcoin's basics.",
