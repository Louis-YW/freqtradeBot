      "body": "This \"Obituary of Fiat Currency\" artwork is a powerful and thought-provoking piece that speaks to the demise of traditional currency systems and the rise of Bitcoin as a superior alternative. The detailed and vibrant design captures the drama and significance of this pivotal moment in history, and the limited edition nature of the series adds a sense of exclusivity and scarcity. The inclusion of a certificate of authenticity timestamped on the Bitcoin blockchain via Verisart adds an extra layer of credibility and value to the artwork. It's truly heart-breaking to see the failures of fiat currency laid out before us, but at the same time, there is a sense of hope and possibility in the emergence of Bitcoin as a more reliable and enduring form of currency. This is an outstanding work of art that will surely be treasured by collectors for years to come.",
