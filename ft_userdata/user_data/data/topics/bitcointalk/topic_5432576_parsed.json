My current casino offers this kind of tournament that rewards to 100 user a USDT in exchange for a certain amount of wagering requirements.A special promotion too on Blackjack tables and free spin is what I like too as special promotion in addition to the weekly tournament. I believe that I already browse Punt last time but I failed to pursue playing because bonus code that you offer is only limited to few user.",

It's normal not to help a competitor.As a friend, Eddie might come up with some ideas for him, but he should think about them because they might be different from what he had in mind.The important is promotions to provide bonuses must continue to run, and maybe betting tournaments can attract the attention of gamblers to compete to enter the leaderboard. Or maybe he can make an offer that if someone becomes a VIP member, that person can get more bonuses and not just $5-$10 weekly on his account. But whatever it is, he should discuss it with all his team to find a suitable bonus for his members.",

I think members who are entitled to receive a weekly bonus must meet certain conditions, such as being devoted to certain games.and the monthly bonus, in my opinion, will be better suited to the percentage of the volume of bets made. This of course will require a certain rating or standard from the team. like the top 10 players with the biggest winning percentage. or total bets made in a monthly period.Several casinos have implemented a monthly bonus for members who meet the criteria. this is a great way. if your casino will implement it, you only need to modify its implementation.",

I believ Punt is asking for a special promo and not the regular rakeback bonus applied to wager. Bonus type like what Duelbits given in form of free spin, boosted odds on sportsbook or random cash drop with just x1 wagering requirements is what most the players looking forward in the casino. This kind of bonuses will make players check the casino.",

They will only look for the limit they have. If you have higher limit and allow them to stake high then you will find many gamblers registering with you. But consider that you have enough bankroll to pay the winners when they win big. For new registrations, if you have registration bonus like 150% of deposit or 200% of deposit with some wagering requirement, then anyone will like it. However don't make it like maximum $100 or $200 LOL. Deposit x and get x bonus without any higher cap. Have a decent wagering requirement to project your business. If I was a gambling company owner then I would focus on deposit bonus more than anything else.",
