I have to pay a phone bill expressly and since my work needs a lot of phone calls it’s quite bothersome to have my number blocked.I don’t have a collateral unfortunately. I came here since a friend told me it was possible to get a loan on this forum but after seeing the post talking about collateral that says that my request would at almost 100% be impossible I guess it’s the wrong place.Anyhow I am still posting this wether someone might be able to help me. I can share with y’all the bill I’m talking about. I truly hope someone might see this and could atleast try to trust me. Anyways if this post is completely unsuccessful, I’ll block the thread right away.",
