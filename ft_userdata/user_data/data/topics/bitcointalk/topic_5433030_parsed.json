Your input would be appreciated.Choosing wrong people to hang out with is pretty much worst thing you can do your self-esteem. Luckily in most cases in life, you can choose your own friends.But even in healthy relationships you still need to do most of the heavy lifting and emotional work yourself. You need to work hard on yourself and with your feelings for that healthy relationship. People with low self-esteem often make the mistake of getting hooked on pity as fish out the complementaries from people around them. Occiasionally everyone likes some comfort but for people with low self-esteem that's like heroin. They still need it. Even more then rest of people But as it takes away their problems and makes them happy, they get hooked, specially when they don't need to do any work for it. (except to hint and sort of beg for compliments), But not by asking, just by insisting how am ugly or loser, etc they think they are themselves.This however is counterproductive as self esteem doesn't come from inside themselves. They need a another person giving it to them constantly. And in a worst case they don't see how heavy and taxng this behaviour is to their friends. Lifting someone up constantly isnt healthy. If they don't pull their weight, it gets too heavy and those new friends are sadly leaving too.",

Some suffer this hurtful experience right from childhood and hardly share with peeps for fear of not being understood. Some even resort to having eating disorders or stress eat. Yeah, before healing takes place, one has to be ready to let go of those hurtful and debasing thoughts. Reading books on how to boost low self-esteem helps. Constantly reciting positive words could also do the trick too.",

I agree with you, one must build himself up, you don't need anyone to do it for you.  Low self esteem is man made,  it's wasn't given to us by our creator. God gives us the spirit of boldness. But because of oppression and wants. Some humans feels they're not worth something.  Low self esteem people, compare them with others. They forget that human beings are born with a special gift. If your gift haven't been tapped you have nothing to worry about than try to discover ur gift and deploy it to the world.",

The early years of a child's development are crucial. Teaching children to be able to dealwith problems such as bullying for example are extremely important, if those lessons are notlearned they can manifest into mental issues and the most serious is suicidal thoughts.Overcoming the issue of low self esteem will certainly help with positive friends and familyand may need professional help.",
