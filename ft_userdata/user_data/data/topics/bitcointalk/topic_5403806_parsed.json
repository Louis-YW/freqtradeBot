You can try posting your Chegg link on Reddit as there are some groups there that will accept payment per question. Also, you can try to check out this website as it provide a screenshot of the answer for your activities or exams that is available on the Chegg website. The website is  homeworkify, I've using this website as reference for solutions on some exams. Not all answer or solution is available on the website especially if there's no answer to unblur on you chegg link.",
