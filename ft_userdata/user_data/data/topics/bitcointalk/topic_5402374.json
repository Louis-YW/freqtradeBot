And currently, the price is now below the threshold of $25,000 and there are a lot of panic sellers, pushing the sell button and they might regret their decisions in the future if the price goes to $100,000 minimum. The whales though are going to be happy scooping cheap bitcoin from beginners and panic sellers. But it is what it is, those who are selling today might have to learn it the hard and expensive way.",

Remember whenever the market is down tension seems to be higher than ever so most at times some bitcoin holders at point can not control it leading them to sell. conspicuously speaking I was ones in that stage and i kept regretting whenever i sell of and the market bounces back again.Facts: Anyone who can control these few things can be able survive the market and hold for long time;1.

You, me, and a few hundred or thousands more were here in the sense that we know how this game is played, but unfortunately for all those millions of investors who do not understand what Bitcoin is, moments like this turn into a nightmare or something much worse. If for most Bitcoin is just a way to profit in the short term, then the thing is very simple - buy before halving, wait at least 6-8 months and sell at the peak. However, I do not believe that this dump is caused only by retail investors, but that we are paying the price again by not using Bitcoin in the way we should, but playing with some versions of crypto banks that sooner or later experience the fate of regular banks.

We were literally 7k at the start of 2020, reached nearly 30k by 2021 start, and 68k during 2021 as well, that is a huge huge increase, and nobody talks about how we could have the same thing nowadays, they all talk about how we should leave and \"crypto is a scam\", thats a sad thing, these people will not be profiting when it goes up.",

Remember $20,000 down to $3,000? Been through that storm too. Remember, 1 BTC = 1 BTC. To the Moon!Inflation and potential market crash on US are the main reason why there's a FUD in crypto. The current FUD that fuel this bear market has a basis, unlike those years that you mention when Bitcoin grow exponentially after the dump was pure manipulative FUD by the news outlet or China. There's a chance that we really go deeper when the economy of US worsens but I'm still hoping that Bitcoin will be the parking space for the money of US investors that want to dodge stock market crashes and hyperinflation. It's either we will see mega dump or pump but this is a high-risk high reward so consider cashing out some of your Bitcoin especially if you need it financially and hold only what you can afford to lose. There's a perfect opportunity to hold.",

That's only an assumption, and surely there are exceptions (when big institutional investors panic sell), but overall those who have a small amount are also more likely to be able to afford it less, and in bad times might require fiat or might need to have a certain amount of money and can't see the price getting below that.

It is not necessary that we will see this and this is not at all a reason for panic. Almost any negative situation can be used for good, and if bitcoin will costs $10.000-15.00, then this will be a great opportunity to buy at a discount.

I started doing dollar-cost averaging (DCA) last month with Bitcoin when the price was around $30k+. Despite that I am at a loss with my BTC holding, it doesn’t change my long-term goal as I will keep accumulating Bitcoin every month with my extra “not beer” money. So I won’t sell.",
