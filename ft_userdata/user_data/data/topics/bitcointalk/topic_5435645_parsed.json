You just said what the reason was and every sources you link say the same thing. Well that and tax crimes but that goes without saying.But as you are saying \"allegedly\", i would argue that it's pretty much sure thing they are guilty. You don't make joint operations of 300 people of agents, police and prosecutors raiding a place if you aren't sure what's going on.",

That's why the police raided nexo's office. The decision that already been made by authorities to prevent shady things like money laundering and unlicensed banking activities. I think that the reasons are quite clear if you wanna try to read other news before the police raided Nexo's office.",

After what happened to FTX Exchange, there are already a lot of centralized entities affected, by its contagion effect.If you take a look at this exchange, they got very high APY/interest on their Earn Interest program which for me is very fishy. Recently, I heard Nexo faced some issues with regulators. For me, I will not use this exchange at all and withdrawal all my funds right now.",

That means they are guilty, there is no reasoning with that as they are arrested for a reason. Now the lawyers of Nexo would handle that. This kind of news can be fake or what but if it did happened and it did not sounded on the crypto community then they are hiding this fast fact about the incident.With what happened with FTX, surely many centralized platform are beunf monitored at the moment.",
