  "content": "\"Exercise Caution with Crypto Asset Securities: Investor Alert\"https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/exercise-caution-crypto-asset-securities-investor-alertQuoteTLDR:  The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy continues to urge investors to be cautious if considering an investment involving crypto asset securities.  Investments in crypto asset securities can be exceptionally volatile and speculative, and the platforms where investors buy, sell, borrow, or lend these securities may lack important protections for investors.  The risk of loss for individual investors who participate in transactions involving crypto assets, including crypto asset securities, remains significant.  The only money you should put at risk with any speculative investment is money you can afford to lose entirely.This whole statement sounds innocent and, in a sense, as pretty good and sensible advice to investors, but is probably an indication of future actions relating to US crypto crack-down.Bitcoin doesn't seem to be in a direct thread, but if they go after stablecoins (to kill the competition and make a room for CBDC) the entire market will likely get hit.",

This not about securing the assets of those who believe in decentralized money, like Bitcoin, but rather we are witnessing the beginning of a more aggressive campaign against one of the most important parts of the market: the stable coin liquidity. The SEC and the government of the United States are not stupid, there are aware that in order to exercise the surveillance and control they seek with their incoming CBDCs, they may need to kill the competitors through legal means. Also, for whatever reason it seems the governor of Florida (De Santis) and Ted Cruz are using the lack of trust towards digital banknotes to boost his (unannounced) presidential bid and career in the chamber. Let us see if other states follow this lead, assuming this is not just hot air from the governor and the representative.GOP Sen. Ted Cruz Proposes Ban on a CBDCSource: https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/22/gop-senator-ted-cruz-proposes-legislation-to-block-cbdc/QuoteSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) introduced a bill on Tuesday aimed at blocking the Federal Reserve from creating a consumer-based central bank digital currency, or CBDC.\"The federal government has no authority to unilaterally establish a central bank currency,\" Cruz said in a press release. \"This bill goes a long way in making sure big government doesn’t attempt to centralize or control cryptocurrency and instead, allows it to thrive in the United States.\"",

True, regulation is imminent, but now we should know that, but it's not a threat to bitcoin. Maybe some other projects that could be a treat to them. They even take a crusade against privacy coins already and not might be looking at those stable coins and others. Tether used to be the target since 2018, but maybe they know it's hard to bring them down.",

Whenever a first or second iteration of a technology that makes sense and is useful gets killed, rest assured a third iteration will come. We might not be there yet that there is an algorithmic stable coin we can fully fall back on, but if governments decide to kill stable coins backed by their own treasury bonds, the only way out will be a decentralized solution and I wonder if that is a solution the government would like more than a stable coin they actually have control over? I doubt that they will kill stable coins. But I am sure that they will shove regulation down the providers' throats. But not too hard, step by step such that a provider has more reason to comply than to deny.",

On the one hand, it's smart to warn people what they're getting into so they don't knock on the wrong door later when things go downhill, but on the other hand, let everyone decide what they want to invest their money in, as long as it is something legal.However, what can be interesting about this statement is the moment in which it was made public - and the data for March 2023 say that in this month alone, about $286 billion of deposits were withdrawn from banks, and a good part of that money went to institutions like Fidelity, JPM or Goldman Sachs. Given that some of them also have links to cryptocurrencies (especially Fidelity), we should not be surprised that such statements are being released right now.On the other side of the big pond, similar warnings could be heard in the past.QuoteCryptocurrencies “have no intrinsic value” and people who invest in them should be prepared to lose all their money, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said. Bailey, who was formerly the chief executive of the FCA, has long been a skeptic of crypto. In 2017, he warned: “If you want to invest in bitcoin, be prepared to lose all your money.”Source",

Essentially, these exchanges or organizations offering those stable coins are making the same mistakes as banks. Their balance sheets must be faulty as well and carry assets that need to be devalued, but then their promise that every stable coin dollar is sufficiently backed doesn't hold true anymore.",
