I donâ€™t quite understand what your post entails but I will this quoted part. To the best of my understanding almost both of these two things begets each other. Reputation is gained through the knowledge one shared on this forum, it is also gained by the quality of service provided by a member on the forum. These two things actually brings about reputation on the forum. Now if you look at these set of people they actually started off with quality posts and also on it which begets merit, because merit is awarded to either the knowledge shared or quality service rendered. So the main thing is to make quality posts and things that could make the forum better, these will bring about both things. As for which is better then my answer is reputation. Because it also brings about merit",

Merits comes by creating a quality post or comments in the forum. So both are essential but the important one is to have a good reputation meaning you can be trusted by everyone but ranking does nothing over here. Merits takes you to the next rank, reputations brings more closer to everyone in the forum because of your honesty and sincerity in everything you do.",

It depends on the persons goals. If someone wants to join a campaign and earn some bitcoin, he will want to have higher rank and earn more. But if someone is just posting and enjoying himself or herself, he will not that consider merit. But if someone is contributing something good on this forum, he will have reputation. The act of having good post itself is part of reputation and merit is given also. I mean not having enough trust or people adding you to their trust list does not mean you still do not have a good reputation after ranking up and join a good campaign. Assuming you want to borrow money, the campaign you join alone gives you the reputation that will let you be borrowed the money. So merit is also very important.",

Creating good quality post earns you merits which enables you to rank up. Same thing goes for your reputation. When a user is fond of spamming the forum with wrong information, or creating services that are unreliable putting forum members at risk, not returning loans or causing trouble on every board of the forum, he ends up damaging his reputation and receives a negative trust from forum members. Just as you will want to grow your rank, you also should maintain your reputation here on Bitcoin talk. An account with negative trust would have no meaning because no one would want to engage with you even when you have a high ranked profile. a good example, is the profile of ThuleRank: senior memberactivity:938Merit:276Trust: -9",

The most important thing is to stay honest and share your knowledge. Because both reputation and recognition follow who you are, and not vice versa. If you try to look like someone else, the truth will come out sooner or later anyway, so it's best to develop yourself, and others will appreciate it. If you are active, if you reach new heights and share the experience that you get, recognition will come over time, and a reputation will be formed. It's the same on forums and in real life.",

Merits are like recognition for your positive contribution in discussions and sharing of quality information. You need them to rank your account, if that is important to you. Reputation, on the other hand, is about your trust. A good reputation means that other members trust you, or had positive experiences with you, be that as a trader or as a person. A bad reputation means that people are less likely to trust you and may be wary of dealing with you.",

I don't know but I find it hard understanding some part of your write up... But I will do my best. Both reputation and merit are important on the forum but are different from each other. At the same time one cannot be isolated from another as they are both important. Merit is what you earned by your contribution on the forum by the quality of your posts while reputation is you been able to standout in a particular area because of the quality of services you provide or your vast knowledge in a particular area or field. In other words, it can be said to be being able to create a niche for yourself in a particular area.",

Â It's important to be patient, stay committed, and maintain a positive and helpful attitude throughout your interactions with the community. Â Share your knowledge generously and participate in discussions with a positive and helpful attitude, in that way, it might forum members will appreciate your contributions and remember you for being supportive.When you didn't do the right thing, merit is useless, and even if you've reached a high rank but your reputation was ruined, it becomes useless because you can't be trusted by anyone else like dealing with some stuff, joining the decent campaign,s and even in trading.",

Both are different things have different meaning but highly dependent on each other. Many members have already gave their opinions about the definition of Merit and Reputation, so here is what i have to say.For example:If you are referring, to those reputable members who make a point like their opinions on some topic and other members give a thought before replying to that post. Like if I take my example, I would have thought either I have to give a legit answer without any favor to OP's point, which could also bring me some merit too. Or I could give a fair answer without giving any favor to OP's point. Which could bring me reputation but also merit too.Here is a thing to consider both are two different things. If member A is giving you merits due to some post you made him believe that you have good point but there must be another member B who will not give you any merits because your post was not good enough for that member. Which indicates Merits are also distinct like in Set. Same statement goes for Reputation. Because one might respect your point but at the same time other will not. So, both are different but highly interconnected.",

To be practical Reputation will not upgrade your Forum rank but who is hunting merits in a right way he will have a good reputation. I will not say that forget about reputation and hunt merits but my speech is that contribute in the forum in a right way , Merit and Reputation both will start searching you.Sometimes we see some are trying merit phishing and they repeat same topics several times and also some make posts from a false story. So they should avoid it because forum members aren't fool at all and if they are caught, merit and reputation both will be gone.

You are doing the same thing you are condemning others are doing. How are we going to believe this post is no also about getting merit too. Nobody should condemn anyone for writing for merit. It is not a bad thing to want merit because getting merits proves that the members are making constructive posts and we all need it. Everyone needs validation from others at some point. Writing for merit does not affect anybody's reputation provided the person is not begging the merit or doing scam activities.",

I never liked questions like this, when they offer to choose from two answers, driving them into boxes. Why can't there be 2, 3, 4 or more answers (alternative solutions)?Both parameters, that merit, that reputation, in the long run, are important on the forum. What is less important, what is more, I suppose, depends on the stage at which the account / owner is located. You, as a member, are likely to seek merit, which will allow you to increase your rank, which will indirectly also pull your reputation up. When you reach high ranks, merit will fall into the background and reputation will be in the first place. But ultimately, it seems to me that there is some inseparable relationship between merit and reputation.",
