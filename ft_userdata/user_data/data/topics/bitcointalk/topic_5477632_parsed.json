We made profit alreadyDiscord community, seems interesting. I understand your points, you're desperate to increase your community, I get it. But these proceeds ought to be done in a more precise measures, not everyone would jump into investing in this project and besides its a new one with no roadmaps that declared it to become safer for investors. Perhapes we should not be in a hurry to grab this opportunity, rather we take out time to ensure we're investing on a promising project, besides you wouldn't blame anyone that counter your opinions and ads with negativity, you don't how the terrible awful events they've passed through.",

We made profit alreadyWhat made you come here and advertise your community if you are making a profit and everything is good already? We are here, it's also a community and we love it here, we don't need to go somewhere else just to get signals or information or anything regarding cryptocurrencies or shitcoins which are nothing less than a gamble if you invest money in them. I'm not trying to target you or anything, but most of the time, such communities or groups are pump-and-dump communities.I've personally never been a fan of communities where the users of the community or the creators would try to show or act like they are making a lot of money or profit because of being a part of that community just so that it raises some interest in you regarding the community and you possibly join it.",

I think you need to be able to find important information on cryptocurrencies yourself. Trusting anyone is riskyagreed but i also think it depends on the personit’s okay to have a community where you can find multiple altcoins such as this forum we can talk about different altcoins and do research ourselves and make decisions based on what we’ve researched it’s jsut good to have a compilation of possible altcoins to invest in",

Going through the comments on this thread, it's obvious that the trust rating of the OP advertised community is very low, guess he should have done his home work well and tested it before bringing it to a forum of intelligent minds. I'm skeptical about opening links from unverified sources, even if I wanted to open the discord, going by the comments of members I probably won't. This is an anonymous forum and I'm careful in doing anything with anyone outside the forum, especially with newbies, so I don't get scammed. I however wish OP the very best in promoting the community.",

I however wish OP the very best in promoting the community.From my observation the op sounds so desperate and eager, if I may ask why promoting your community here with no proper back up or proof, I don't really understand the intention of the op because in this forum no one is ready to be fooled and what the op is trying to do looks funny, opening the link is not the problem but from what others are saying there's no need but when I tried using the link I didn't see anything it looks confusing but there's no need stressing myself secondly I can't just join the community without having proper information about the community, wishing the op community good luck but he should not expect such from this forum",
