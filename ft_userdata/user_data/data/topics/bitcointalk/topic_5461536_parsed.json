Telegram: @SirAkka007You posted several hours ago but I think you have not yet received your desired candidate. But if you try to get the freelancer from freelancer.com or upwork.com then you could be able to reach the perfect candidate. I think if you do not yet get a good/perfect candidate then please have a try on the freelancer.com or upwork.com",

So, the final conversation (deal) should be made on the forum post or forum message to avoid scams as well as loss of evidence of the deal.",

I think if you do not yet get a good/perfect candidate then please have a try on the freelancer.com or upwork.comWould be pretty hard to find someone on those freelancer websites, coding a mining pool is a very \"specific\" field, it's not enough to be an excellent programmer to write a whole mining pool up and running in a reasonable time, it is doable, but the research time alone is going to cost OP way too much, it would be better to post this in the mining section and/or on mining telegram groups.People like CK and Kano have some solid pools running, with the majority of the pool code being open-source (but outdated), it would be a lot better and probably cheaper to just hire people like them because that1- You get a mining pool made by someone else who has a mining pool running for years (nearly zero bugs in production)2- They have the code ready, with just a few modifications you could have it up and running (way less time than being done by someone else with no background).",
