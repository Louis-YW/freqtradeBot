What do you thinkApart from the economy, if one grows in a society that see's nothing wrong in ending your own life, someone can easily nurse that thought. For some other people, things are hard for them, they wonder what the point of living is, they become tired and decide to end their life since their situation is looking hopeless. Some others cannot face and handle shame, failure, disappointment, heartbreak and disgrace, so ending their life becomes the better option, their escape route.",

What do you thinkThe economy is just a part of life, we humans each have a situation and face many different bad things that lead to negative thinking, such as love, work pressure… there are too many reasons for a person to commit suicide. For those who are contemplating suicide, I think it is possible that they have been through inner torment as well as have endured something so bad that there is no better way. Suicide is evasion of human responsibility, not liberation.",

The only thing that I can think of was to be the original creator of something. What he created was destruction.God, however, used destruction better than Satan. We simply haven't seen how, clearly. So, people go on following Satan and self-destruction.Btw, how is God using Satan's invention better than Satan himself? God is using destruction to destroy itself. Heaven will be the result of the finalization of the destruction of all destruction.Join us in Heaven by turning to believe in Jesus, the true Savior from all destruction.",

What do you thinkHopelessness is the main reason for suicide. When people feel that they have no reason to live they simply think of ending their lives. Most people commit suicide because economic hardship has made them debtors. Some of them have lost so much money because of business failure and most of these funds were borrowed. Some of them prefer to die than go to jail. The highest rate of suicide among youths in my country now is heartbreak or relationship problems. When these young people are dumped by their lovers they become angry. We have had cases where they kill their ex-lover and commit suicide.For me committing suicide is not an option. No kind of economic challenge can make me commit suicide. Because I know I can overcome any challenge I am going through. Someone has gone through what you are experiencing and overcome it.",

What do you thinkLosing faith in life and having no motivation to hold them back, or perhaps because they are too much to endure the oppression, they will choose death to free themselves. What is alarming now is that the suicide rate occurs mostly among young people, young people with impulsive thoughts.Last year, a tragic case of suicide happened in my country for a student, just because his parents forced him to study too much, he chose to commit suicide by jumping from a building. As parents, everyone wants their children to study hard to become good people, but in his position, he thinks that he does not live for himself but lives for his parents, his youth and impulsive thinking have caused trauma to an entire family.",

Evolutionarily, people more prone to suicide would not have reproduced and passed along these genetic deficiencies. Seems to me it's more of a recent phenomenon in human history.Plus suicide is more common in the developed world with a higher standard of living than it is in third world countries with extreme poverty and the treatment is take a depressed person and pump them up with as many SSRIs as the dosing will allow and hope for the best. It's possible SSRI's might be contributing to the suicide rate but who knows.",

I’ve seen plenty of people throw down controllers and shit off their machines because what was supposed to be fun turned out to be upsetting instead. I’m sure a lot of people feel that way about life. They set out to do good and have fun, but then maybe through circumstances they couldn’t have foreseen, end up in misery. Maybe they feel like the bad outweighs the good and they don’t want to continue anymore. It’s easy to feel that way when things are going bad. You just need to remember that things get better.",

There are hundreds of thousands of examples that lost everything they got, started from nothing and made a bigger fortune than they previously had.All you need to do is, not repeating your mistakes.

Gender identity and pressure from society makes you seem like a failure. There's no meaning in life.Honestly i could just go on, but it would get way darker. World is a scary place and not everyone has same cards to play it with. I choose not to do it because my life is pretty good and i would die anyway at one point and i can see no reason to speed it up. But i totally understand people who want to end theirs.",

What do you thinkThe major factor is mental healthOnce your psychological state is messed up, everything comes crumbling down. I say this because I was in such a situation at one time. The situation was so challenging and as a young man who was growing up there was no one to talk to so my mental health went in to a mess, and before I realized, I was hopeless and thinking life is not worth fighting for. Please take note that I am one person who always thought that suicide was something so stupid.What helped me is one someone old enough talked to me. Everything changed, and I started living positively, but if that person hadn't talked to me, I don't know where I would be right now. I also learned that not to blame people who take their own lives.",
