Intel currently has no competitive solutions for modern Nvidia products. Their processors are inferior in performance to new solutions from Nvidia. AMD has not yet presented competitive solutions either, and they still have not figured out the overheating problems of the new X3D processors.",

AMD would need to create their entire version of something CUDA like and then try to steal market share when NVidia is known for the currently hyped ChatGPT.AMD seems really behind. They would almost have to create something better than CUDA.",

She spoke following a keynote presentation in San Francisco during which Su showed an AI system on the MI300X chip writing a poem about the city.Nvidia, whose shares have surged 170% so far this year, dominates the AI computing market with a market share of 80% to 95%, according to analysts.https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-likely-offer-details-ai-chip-challenge-nvidia-2023-06-13/",
