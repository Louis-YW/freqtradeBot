And also the dynamics of supply and demand in the Bitcoin market, and demand will increase and can increase the price of Bitcoin gradually as supply decreases.And what I've done so far is continue to make regular purchases within my means and will probably only increase my purchases when I have more money, and the DCA method is the best way for me to do this. Because I don't have the ability to make large purchases and hold them for the long term.",

History has shown that Bitcoin might not get to its highest price during the halving.

However, the investors that will make good money from the bull run are those that have planned for this season. Investors who bought Bitcoin when the price was low are the ones who will largely benefit from this season.

When we talk about halving, two things - bull run and price increase.That's what we're all excited about and whether you hide it or not, everyone is talking about new all time highs at this bull run and that's what this halving is all about.And soon, we'd see more of it because this is just a 4-year cycle and time nowadays is too quick passing by.",

From my research I understand that after supply is cut in half, which will create scarcity, demand will become greater than supply, and eventually that is when the real bull run will start. I believe that because of the Bitcoin ETF which made it possible to see a new ATH before halving, that we're going to experience a massive bull run in this season, and every investor will likewise reap massive ROI.",

Some retail investors will feel it is uneventful and sell their holdings, and miners will also have to sell more of their mined coins as they need to cover their costs. Typically this results in a drop in the price in the weeks after so I can see that potentially happening. It's all noise though, as long as you're dollar cost averaging you'll be fine..",

I've only read or heard about the bitcoin halving event before in history. But never had the real experience but maybe this year I will get that experience through the fourth bitcoin halving.When I first heard about the bitcoin halving I thought that since halving means \"to cut in half\" when the bitcoin halving happens the price of bitcoin will probably be half of what it was. As I thought that if the price of Bitcoin is $50000 then maybe it will drop to $25000 during the halving. But I think this idea was wrong because when I started to Google the content related to Bitcoin halving, I found that it is said that during Bitcoin halving, those who are bitcoin miners are given half the reward ie they get fifty percent reward.",

The strategy is nothing but DCA and having a back up amount to buy BTC in bulk when it dips like we have seen whenever it reached ATH it dips by 10 to 20% which happened this time before BTC crossed $40k, $50k and after it crossed the previous ATH. I am just accumulating BTC as much as I can but doing it gradually to avoid being left out during bull run. DCA doing make you panic.",

Seems need prepare with bad happening later if possibility bitcoin will raise new higher price left several days later before halving always has opportunity dropping to lower price. I don't sure with this halving edition worth to buy back bitcoin right now because many time bitcoin get correction drastically after success achieving new higher price. For new ATH seems difficult before halving left six days later, I don't quit well believing how potential with bitcoin price reach above $80k or keep going down exactly after halving time. Do you want to invest in bitcoin right now or waiting after halving and opportunity get correction to buy bitcoin has more lower price.",

Bitcoin can bring huge profits when the price reaches its highest. Bitcoin returns are not the same as returns on valuable assets such as gold.

Due to the hype around the halving, Many new investors have set unrealistic figure in their minds as the figure that the value of bitcoins will get to, I believe many people's expectation will be cut short because Bitcoin may actually not perform as they expected and they may not become the millionaires out of the halving like they planned to.
