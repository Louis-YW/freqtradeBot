Although I'm not an expert in trading but with my long experience in trading, I could say that losses are inevitable, and never seen any platform that would beat the market volatility. Yes, because no matter what we do, we can't make all things right which is why losses are possible even though you are an expert. Trading gives you no assurance and how much more these bots which is also reliant on the user.",

Most times the people who talk good the most about trading bots are often part of the team that own it. People will pay to use these bots, getting people to pay to use these bots is part of the profit generating process. I advise you do not give too much believe to bots even though some may work for a while. If you want to be a good trader, you have to develop the skill you have and try to become more efficient. That is one way to stay long in the market.",

Yes I got this notification from the bot and I did reply on that post but didn't find anything interesting in that thread but come here again to see that this user who made account long ago also come online to post this same project, he focused was to promote this so called site.

Last time it read that it was currently available in 20+ exchanges, even though it wasn't. Was that such an obvious scam that you decided to tune your lying down? And one of the partners is still binance, which is a lie too. What ever you do people, do not connect your wallet for an airdrop or buy this! It's such an obvious scam i don't feel i should be explaining how.This was earlier shill attempt with other account: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5466111.msg62816270#msg62816270",

That’s true, only those on top can benefit from this and if there’s a fee for this, I’d rather not to grab it.This is not new, many trading bot or trading signal are being offered in Telegram or any platform, again if you want to have a more safe trading experience better to trade on your own and analyze on your own. Also, if you are planning to use trading bot, then better to go to the best option available in the market.",

We all know there are plenty of people in the market who give good reviews, and many of them even take money for positive reviews to attract investors to their products. If you're thinking of using it, I suggest starting with a small capital to minimize your risk. Personally, I wouldn't recommend using it unless you have a solid understanding of how the future trade market operates.",

However, they are not a guaranteed path to success, and there are risks involved. It's essential to thoroughly research and test any trading bot you plan to use and consider how it fits into your overall trading strategy.",
