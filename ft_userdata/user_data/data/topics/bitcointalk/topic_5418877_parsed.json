  "content": "Hello!Thanks for stopping by. We at the Fennec team have posted on BitcoinTalk.org recently, but are back with some major updates. We are looking for constructive criticism, as well as new community members. Please see our recent thread in the \"Mining (Altcoins)\" section of the website for more details. For now, we are simply going to post our current roadmap, our LinkTree link (to provide access to all of our socials), as well as a synopsis of the project. We hope to see you around or hear your thoughts about what we're working on! Please come to the Telegram group for more details.----------------------------------------------------------------------------ROADMAP--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Q4 2022- Creation of the Fennec Social Media Platforms (Telegram, Discord, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram)- Creation of the Fennec Website (www.FennecBlockchain.com)- Creation of the Fennec Cold Wallet Apps (Compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac)- Creation of the Fennec Coin and Mining of the Genesis Block- Creation of the Fennec Network Block Explorer- Creation of the First Fennec YescryptR16 Mining Pool- Creation and Maintenance of All Servers, Firewalls, HTTP and HTTPS Protection, DDOS Attack Protection, as well as TCP Protocol-Employed Protective Measures.- First Exchange Listing (FinexBox)- FMiNE Wallet Sales and Airdrops (Peer to Peer Sales to Distribute Fennec to the Community)- Creation of the Team Gnosis Safe, Selection of Key Holders for the Safe (https://gnosis.io/safe/)- Intense 4chan Community Recruiting/Outreach- Bounty Hunts (Guerilla Marketing, Incentivized with Airdrops and Rewards from the FDRoP Wallet)- Meme Contests and Invite Contests (Incentivised with Airdrops and Rewards from the FDRoP Wallet)- First and Second Market Capitalization Listings (CoinGecko and CoinPaprika)Q1 2023- Standard Codebase Audit Certification- Increase in Marketing Efforts (Maintaining 4chan Presence While Branching Out to Our Other Socials)- Second Exchange Listing (TradeOgre)- Increased Intensity of Bounty Hunts (Guerilla Marketing, Incentivized with Airdrops and Rewards from the FDRoP Wallet)Q2 2023- Third Market Capitalization Listing (CoinMarketCap)- Third Exchange Listing (Bittrex)- Fourth Exchange Listing (Currently Choosing Between Nearly 50 Intermediate Exchanges!)- Increased Marketing Pressure (Paid Calls, Videos, and Extensive Guerilla Marketing from Within the Community)- Get Our Mining Pool Listed on https://whattomine.com/Q3 2023- Maintenance of Marketing Pressure from Q2 2023- Fifth Exchange Listing (KuCoin)- Ledger Support- Wrapped Fennec (ETH, BSC, Polygon, and More Networks if Possible!)-------------------------------------------------------------------END OF ROADMAP------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------SYNOPSIS--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Fennec is a Bitcoin fork with a strong community outreach effort. Over the next 6 months, our goal is to have 1000-2000 members in our Telegram and Discord groups. Because Fennec is not a BSC, ETH, or other L1 Smart Contract Token, it has a very unique set of traits that signify it as an asset with greater potential price appreciation. This project is going to be a long one, and a slow one, with CEX listings coming every several months.Fennec can be mined through the YescryptR16 algorithm. This will allow for sufficient network security and support, as well as an opportunity for community supporters to acquire extra Fennec! Proof of Work cryptocurrencies tend to gain the most value over time, because they are consistently invested in through energy costs and network maintenance. The fact that Fennec is being mined on YescryptR16 means that many old GPU/CPU miners could be put to work by mining Fennec! With the ETH merge, many of these CPUs/GPUs currently have nothing to mine. If Fennec becomes popular, it will give these CPU/GPU miners another chance to be productive. This will give us many more potential miners, which translates to a more secure network and a higher potential for price appreciation! For this reason, we have chosen to go with the YescryptR16 algorithm. Plus, we won't be overpowered by ASIC farms and such.Because this is not a BSC, ETH, or other L1 Smart Contract Token, it is not listed on DEXs, but it can (and will) be listed on CEXs that do not require KYC (Know Your Customer/Identification). The roadmap will disclose much more, but for those who are interested in creating a lasting community, Fennec is a great place to start! Coins are different from tokens in the sense that their volume is much lower at launch, and it progressively ramps up over time as the community builds and exchange listings increase in quality and variety. This is very different from the very common 2-3 hour P&Ds (Pump and Dumps) that are seen on BSC and ETH.The roadmap will explain much more of how we plan on going about making progress in the Fennec project. In the meantime, we are working on creating the logo, the code base for the coin, the cold wallets (compatible with Mac, Linux and Windows), as well as the block explorer. Because Fennec is on its own chain, it has its own exclusive block explorer as well. The community building efforts have simply just begun, and it is fair to say that our community is in its infancy. Come see what the fuss is about over at Fennec!---------------------------------------------------------------------------END OF SYNOPSIS---------------------------------------------------------------------------Please visit our LinkTree for more information about our project (www.LinkTr.ee/FennecBlockchain). Telegram is our most active community. We will be launching in about 3-4 weeks, and providing updates and marketing the entire way through. Thank you for your time, and have a good rest of your day.",
