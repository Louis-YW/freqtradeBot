  "content": "Well its been time since i am dealing with MiLkZ ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=408677 ).I have bought thousands of Amazon giftcards from him (which can be found in my profile as feedback before he deletes it) ( Proof for that: https://prnt.sc/_BO6cFMg72zo )Consider our long term business i requested multiple time to post positive honest opinion based on our trading experience..Many times he lied me that after the NEXT deal between us he will do it.Sadly the truth was different, because every time i made new trade with him, he came up with new excuse..One day he just show his real face and requested payment for feedback after asking me how do i make my money online :  https://prnt.sc/WDkwDgwuyuK9I am pretty sure he will say that was joke or anything to twist that again but i don't really care.I also do not really care about this forum anymore, because i've seen how \"trusted\" many people are around.That was just the last drop.Feel free to ignore the fact he requesting money for feedback and enjoy ur stay in this forum where scams are not moderated, and the only way to get positive feedback is PAYING and not doing legit trades.Going to lock this topic because there is no need of comments on it, i just wanted to show the real face of this guy.*P.S: After i refused to buy Amazon from him today, he simply deleted ALL the conversation we had on telegram Lucky me i saved the most spicy part...Proof that's his telegram:Quote from: MiLkz on November 28, 2020, 05:14:59 PMApple/iTunes Gift CardsThese can be used for both the Apple store and iTunes.  You should be able to stack up to $2000 in your Apple account to make larger purchases on Apple.com.Stock:0x - $25 per cardPrice: 82% BTCSend a PM if interested.  Fastest contact via telegram: @M3lody",
