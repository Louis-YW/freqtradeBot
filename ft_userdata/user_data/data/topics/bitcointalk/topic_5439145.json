  "content": "Today I signed up to my LocalBitcoins account and I got this message.QuoteLocalBitcoins will discontinue its serviceDear Valued Customers,Originally LocalBitcoins was established to Bring Bitcoin Everywhere and drive global financial inclusion. We have honored that mission for over 10 years and we are proud of what we have achieved together with all of you, our loyal community.We are therefore sad to share, that regardless of our efforts to overcome challenges during the ongoing very cold crypto-winter, we have regretfully concluded that LocalBitcoins can no longer provide its Bitcoin trading service.We encourage all customers to withdraw their funds from LocalBitcoins and we ask you to proceed with withdrawing the Bitcoins from your LocalBitcoins wallet. You have 12 months to withdraw, however of course we encourage you to proceed withdrawing sooner.Thank you for being a part of the LocalBitcoins family! It has been our honor and pleasure to serve you over the last decade.Timeline for discontinuing the Bitcoin trading service:2023-02-09 Suspension of new sign ups2023-02-16Suspension of trading on LocalBitcoinsSuspension of using LocalBitcoins wallet (with exception of withdrawing one's funds)After 2023-02-17 LocalBitcoins customers will only be able to log-in to withdraw their Bitcoins. The trading and Wallet services will no longer be available at this point.We thank you for choosing LocalBitcoins for all these years and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.Is this even true? I can't believe that such a great crypto company is closing down. I haven't seen any news about this anywhere on the web. Are there any Localbitcoins users here? Please share your opinions.",

I was suspecting the stress of the company since last year, it seems that their services are not widely spread as many might think.Exchanges and exchangers are their archrivals, and unfortunately for them, internet schemes are not like those of old that comply with what \"LocalBitcoins\" would dominate. The exchanges and direct exchangers provide their servers directly to people, so, a company with a direct P2P model may not be needed like before.But on login in myself, I could see that they are still active, maybe you have mistaken their renewal for closing down, perhaps they changed their mind.",

Can't even find the announcement unless I type in service_closure/ on the url.  More importantly, I am pretty sure there's more to the story behind \"crypto winter\"",

The cost of operations is going up and the larger places are putting a squeeze on profits.In a peer to peer environment like they have, I can see profits shrinking to the point that it's not worth doing it.They are not doing a cut and run but an orderly shutdown, so it shows they are at least a serious operation. Gives them credibility if they want to start something similar at a later date.-Dave",

I can't believe that such a great crypto company is closing down.I don't find this news surprising, LocalBitcoins losing it's popularity since it enforce mandatory KYC. People who don't mind handing their personal data is more likely to use centralized exchange. And those who have serious privacy concern move to different P2P website which has none or optional KYC (such as HodlHodl).Also, I think a lot of people now found regular trading partners and they started to loose their commissions.I know I did this YEARS ago when they took the F2F cash out of the options. I knew how to contact the people I had done deals with so I picked up the phone and called them.Probably should have done that before then to save the % that LBC charged.After that they stopped offering service where I am so I really stopped caring, but if someone sent you Zelle or cashapp or any of many of the other services that they offered if you trust the other party you really did not need them anymore.-Dave",

They have the capability to become a huge exchange like Binance before but they didn’t pursue full potential of CEX.This news is legit.",

I wonder if it is increased regulations and KYC requirements that have shut them down. I do not think the company is based in a country where it is banned to use btc and it comes at a weird time for it to shut down. I thought it would be sold instead of shutting down because it is one of the most known exchanges in the btc community.",

Also, I dont think many ppl were using localbitcoins recently, I heard they got high exchange rates and not very suitable and user friendly for recent users. Hence, they got forgotton because they couldnt catch up with the ppl's changing habits/behaviour. They should have built a better app like binance/bybit to catch more attention of newer generation, but they just got stuck with the old boring theme.",

I mean I myself uses many times these P2P exchanges to buy and sell the Bitcoins. To be honest, I was using Localbitcoins and LocalCryptos mostly to do these types of deals. But Now both are shutting down their operations. And currently, I dont have any other option than using Paxful. But I don't want to use Paxful, as their support team is shit and they have plenty of scammers. So If bitcointalk introduces something like this, then it will be really great for the users who are really dependent on P2P deals. Else If possible, suggest the other best and legit alternatives.
