This means you would need to send a separate request for each address you want to check, which can be less efficient than a batch request, especially for a large number of addresses.An alternative to blockchain.com could be the Blockcypher API, but I have no experience with it.",

The server can spit out that file within 46 seconds 2. OP mentioned \"bulk\", and I don't consider his 100 address test to be bulk.3. The data is updated daily. I assume OP is trying to brute-force Bitcoin addresses, in which case that doesn't matter.Even if it takes a few minutes to download, after that you can check billions of addresses per hour.@OP: what are you trying to accomplish?",
