You are not to open a business that only accept bitcoin but you should also accept fiat because fiat is the primary currency while bitcoin should be the secondary. Bitcoin was created to be an alternative currency to fiat and not to take over from fiat. No customer or seller using bitcoin that wouldn't have fiat, that is why at the time that the transaction fee is high, you should tell any customer that want to buy your goods to pay in fiat.I don't see the high transaction fee a barrier for people doing their buying and selling of goods local place, it might be a barrier for international business people but they will still pay the fee, if they love making payment with bitcoin. OP, you can still accept bitcoin as an option of payment, because the high transaction fee will soon subside.",

Wetin you go just do in times like dis na to just go back to dey use Naira until everything stabilize that's if you no wan use the lightening network solutions as no be everybody dey like am as e dey complicated somehow. Make this congestion no discourage you to no accept Bitcoin, me I believe say a perfect solution will be implemented soon as e good make this congestion dey happen make the developers know say dem get a very big challenge wey dem need address before Bitcoin get more global acceptance make this kind thing no happen when Bitcoin dun go more global.",
