Don't fall for it. If it's too good to be true, it's probably a scam.This happens even to people who have previously invested in cryptocurrency if they do not conduct adequate research on the project team, their road map, and their genuity. Just because some projects do more than 10x as soon as they are listed does not mean that others will also have such pumps if it is a legit project, while some projects are fake, they are only there to get the early investor's money and move on, we need to be very careful on the projects we invest in.QuoteAnother method of crypto scam na airdrop. Airdrop dey pay before but it's most likely an avenue to scam now. Run away from any airdrop that request for your seeds phrases or private keys to participate. Airdrops na one of the easy way for scammers to get people wey dem go scam because we too like free things, na why scammers they use the airdrop to get some of our vital information to do their job.Most times, people go tell you say them make am through Airdrops which is a past glory because 99% of Airdrops now no de pay, instead they waste your time and still look for way to scam you join.QuoteLast but not least, keep your assets safe and never share your private keys with anyone or any websites offline and online.
