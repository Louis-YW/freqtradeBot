If you can post the models of the miners will be able to give more advice on how to go about this process.",

      "body": "Hi thanks for your replies. I have 3 x 120th s19, 2 x 110th s19, and 1 100th s19 pro. I have tested one by one but same results, the same two will come online but none of the others. I haven't turned of DCHP mode. I mine to Luxor pool I did a reset on two that weren't connecting by holding down the reset button but nothing changed. I can see them through the router for about 5 mins after plugging them in, but their ip addresses don't load, and then they just disappear Thanks again for any advice you can give",

The other 3 don't have oneWould turning DCHP help and reset everything? If the other 3 units do not have an SD card slot but there is a Micro/ OTG USB slot you will need a USB adapter or USB port to USB female connector to be able to flash the SD firmware to these miners that do not have SD card slot.Check this guide below for non-SD card slot units.- https://www.zeusbtc.com/articles/asic-miner-troubleshooting/1187-s19j-s19j-pro-control-board-program-recovery",
