  "content": "A Bitcoiner has taken the bitcoin lightening network to a whole new level by implanting a tiny payment chip into his hands so that he could perform NFC contactless payment through the lightening network.F418, a Swiss IT expert, had a Lightning Network (LN) payment chip surgically attached into his right hand.According to sources, F418 claimed that he explored with lightening network payments and physical enhancement for amusement, He does not advise Bitcoin aficionados to do what he did and take control of the layer-2 payments network, or lightening network, he said ,\"The purpose is just to demonstrate that such things are feasible and attainable.\" He noted that while most individuals hold cards, his hand stands out because of its epicness.At first, his efforts to purchase were unsuccessful since F418's initial implantation was \"Flawed.\" F418 was unfazed and went to a medical practitioner to have the implant removed surgically before attempting again.However, the second effort was successful. He no longer needs to reach for a Bolt Card or a smartphone to make LN payments because the chip is conveniently positioned in his right hand.F418 does, however, highlight several hazards associated with the operation. Medically speaking, the procedure is harmless, but \"the only issue with the implantation is that you can't truly guarantee their safety. You can only withdraw via LNURL(whatever this mean.), therefore it's not as secure as the Bolt CardAdditionally, according to F418, removing the chip from the body is not a smart idea if you make an error during the implantation process. F418 said that it's best to get it right the first time because doing it incorrectly could injure or infect someone.In short, the NFC chip inserted in F418's hand functions in the same way, allowing him to make LN transactions without the need for a physical object like a smartphone or card. To start a payment, he only needs to place his palm next to an NFC reader that is functional. It's perhaps the most practical way to pay using bitcoin because it enables rapid and simple payments without the need for any extra hardware.The fact that a Bitcoiner has essentially taken control of the Lighting Network into his own hands is a brand-new development and a huge step toward easing transactional processes, But also for the love of Bitcoin, would you ever attempt a thing like this if you know how to?, or advice some one you know to do this?lets discuss.Read more on: Remitano.net",

      "body": "Pretty cool but also pretty concerning, specially since we have an important part of the population here in the west which is worried about chip implants sponsored by governments or corporations. It is already bad the way they use our phones to spy on us.Still it just shows the enthusiasm some people in our Bitcoin community have, nothing wrong with it as long as it pushes creativity, technology and ethics further to the future. I wonder if it would be practical to do the same for on-chain transactions.",

      "body": "What an innovation! Bitcoin technology is constantly evolving, and I am truly impressed by the idea of implanting a chip into your hand to act as a payment method. However, even if the chip is accepted, I don't think the majority will support the idea because having surgery just to make a payment doesn't seem like it's worth it to me, especially considering what the op said about getting it right the first time or risking injury or infection. For me, the innovation is good, but I sincerely disagree with it",

      "body": "the chip is not a lightning node or a codebase of converting private key to public key.. nor doing any signing or commit process inside the handits just a chip containing the LN URL of a channel you have open... and a private key(hsm_secret) and that is allits then the reader(other device) that does the processing. meaning you are handing(literally) a private key over to a middlemanwho uses the key to authenticate your authorising the payment.. well technically the merchant is, by using your keyalsoLN payments are not bitcoin. bitcoin never leaves the bitcoin networkthis chip example is a key to a wallet/channel balance in a lightning node somewhere else that needs to be online to allow paymentall it is doing is storing a key without a bit of paper or plastic or device in a pocket. becasue its in your hand physically beneath the skin.. easily stolen by someone with a reader brushing passed your hand and scanning the RF chipnext invention.. needing to wear gloves all day with a \"faraday cage\" mesh insert in the glove to protect your hand",

      "body": "I am viewing this news with some amusement. Of course, this is not for anybody and definitely not for me as I don't want anything implanted into me except maybe if I be paid at least 1 Bitcoin to do so - and I doubt if there will be a sponsor for something like that. I am taking this as just another example of something extreme though it would be good to see how things will develop around this technology. Maybe people who are planning to relocate to Mars decades from now can choose to have this implanted on their bodies.",

Personally I would not do it since it's easier to put a card into something that will block the reading of the NFC or anything else easier then it is to put your hand in on.
