If he is not answering you, you can use child-pay-for-parent to pump the fee on wallets like Electrum or Bluewallet. If you use child-pay-for-parent to pump the fee, use 26 sat/vbyte.By using child-pay-for-parent, you will send part or all the coin in the unconfirmed transaction to another address on your wallet. Before a miner can include your transaction (child transaction) into a block, the miner has to include the parent transaction (this unconfirmed transaction) into a block, but the fee you will pay for your transaction should be enough to get two transactions confirmed, this will make a miner to include both transactions into the same block early.",

The least seen recently is 14 sat/vbyte. You can wait because maybe the mempool can become less congested, but the probability that the transaction will be confirmed is very low. Do not accept the transaction until it is confirmed. And always tell him to pump the fee.",

He will pay $67 if it is Binance pool. But, provided if he is a Binance user.But generally, paid accelerators are not advisable to be used due to the high fee needed.But because the transaction is supporting replace-by-fee, I think the best option is to convince the sender to increase the fee.",

You can wait until next week since the transaction was created a week ago.After this week if the transaction is still unconfirmed you should contact the sender because it will automatically rejected by the nodes and tell him to use the fee recommended by mempool.space.",
