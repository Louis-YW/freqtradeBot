Unsuccessful block attempts are seen in the system as \"Orphaned\".2. Opening multiple tabs in the Bowser tab and mining seems very dangerous for RAM I guess. I tried opening 10 tabs and I think there was a problem with my RAMs. I think that opening many tabs does not contribute to mining. Therefore, I continue with ONLY one tab.Have good mining.",
