  "content": "Mineable dollar pegged stablecoins can be generated and it ain't out of thin airMiners consume energy and this energy has a price value, if stablecoins use this mechanism then the generation of an equivalent amount of USDs are possible, further more we have resources like clean energy which we are wasting, we should use those resources (solar/wind etc) energy to generate stablecoins, this will bring more money to the blockchain ecosystem, furthermore we can overcome the cryptocurrencies aka forked projects being created nowadays. This will also make our economy better as governments can use this resource to create more jobs, do more development and a little poverty can be overcome",

Then why they want a better rich economy?The politics is just most the dumbest ideology as there is no philosophy behind anything, Incompetent people are controlling governments, even banks can allow people or governments to exchange such stable assets with dollars and those assets can be kept as a securityQuote from: mk4 link=top :)ic=5412710.msg60897428#msg60897428 date=1662546522Quote from: DashingAgent on September 07, 2022, 10:18:28 AMI think if governments do it, they can create a tax free economy which can reduce the risk of money laundering, and it ain't necessary that those assets are pegged to a dollar, it can be pegged to a unit of gold (true digital gold)If the federal reserve wanted a peg to gold, they'd have done it already with normal fiat currency.
