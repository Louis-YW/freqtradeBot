C++ for a command-line frontend is OK, but the mining library itself must be written in pure C (no STL constructs) or even better in assembly, for maximum performance.I'd stay away from all other languages including Rust.",

So maybe best to use what's already available (if it's about performance), as I described above. Or use any language they like, if it's about education / learning, because performance doesn't matter.We really need more information about the actual end goal, otherwise it's another https://xyproblem.info/.",

Web languages, Python and C# won't help you at all when trying to write highly optimized low-level code.Anyhow, could you answer what your actual goal is in the first place? Is it just a coding exercise? If so, the answer is: 'The best language is the one you're comfortable with and that is fun to write'.If you want to develop something that competes with existing software, maybe just fork what already exists and optimize it further.If you want to use it for Bitcoin mining, don't even bother with programming languages and go for FPGA or ASIC design, which is a whole different beast; you'd be looking at learning and understanding chip design, then implement it in VHDL or Verilog, as tromp suggested.",
