When i was growing up there was this land situated in an interior bushy path. Then the land sold for cents we ignored it because it was in a bushy area but today the same land now worth thousands of dollars. When it comes to landed investment bushy areas are the most preferred by me because of what i learnt while growing",

I think this has happened in a lot of places where land becomes more expensive because the area near it become more desirible and maybe easier to access. (there will be a lot of occasions where villages have been built near good transport links after they've been built to transport grain for farmers for example). Remote areas stop being remote if they've got a train station nearby that connects them to larger cities.",

Real Estate is one of the best, if not the best investment there is. As our population grows, there will be less and less space for everyone.If youre looking into buying a property that is \"bushy\" , or far-flung, I would suggest picking a property where you can grow fruit bearing trees. Also it is best to consider a property that is not within fault lines.The only instance where your investment shrinks in real estate is if the property would be considered unsafe for habitation. This could be because it is prone to natural calamities such as flooding and earthquakes.",

In my country and I'm sure in many other countriesthe tricky part is developing that land to something other than agricultural. I know somepeople who bought land and were hoping to build houses on it but the permission wasrefused, the only thing the can use it for is still agricultural purposes.So to the OP's question:QuoteDo you think buying your first landed property in a bushy area is a good investment for the future.?In general, yes its a good investment provided you know it can be developed for whatyou want to do with it.",

Every where is developing and it’s how fast an area is developing compared to others, when you look at things this way you would be able to see potentials in places people ignore. Before you purchase a land property you have to bare in mind the cost of the land, and your thoughts about your future ROI from that property. An area might be bushy but for now but with the right research you may just predict accurately the future potentials of the property.",

Since it was their only inheritance, a piece of land that had to be used in the future. Speaking of land for sale, it depends on how much potential an area has to produce seeds of wealth. The potential of natural tourist attractions is very strategic and also has good long-term prospects.

There is nothing wrong to call such environment such names though but what is wrong is not to buy any land in the so called developed area at the end of the day because in the future that underdeveloped area will metamorphose to developed area yet you don't have any to call your own. Buying of land is good investment depending on the plan you have for it and sometimes, it is also good to buy for keep instead of leaving your money with the bank. Land appreciates with time and you can't say that for money in the bank. Land appreciates with reasonable percentage.",

In general, buying undeveloped land can be a good idea if the buyer has a specific use for the land in mind and is willing and able to develop it themselves. However, buying undeveloped land can also be a risky investment, as the value of the land may not increase as much as the buyer expects and the development process can be expensive and time-consuming.

Its hard enough to just stay in the remote area where youre going to travel half a day for groceries. Its necessary to have a grocery stores nearby, schools and hospitals which a real property investor would look for before buying.Near my place is a tourist destination but its not very developed down the mountain but we do have a Chinese company operating which somehow made the community busy. With this company, the price of the lot somehow had risen.",

It depends on how much time and money you want to invest in a big project like that. My grandparents were the first to buy a piece of land far outside of the city. We still have the aerial pictures from back then, there were no roads, no lights, no infrastructure, only our house. And now 80 years later we live inside the city. It's hard to predict how big cities can grow, but if you are willing do wait all your life then everything is possible. The problem is that my grandparents invested so much time into building up the house and garden, and they had to pay for so many things, like development of roads, canals, traffic lights and later even the Internet cable. All the people who moved later in the area didn't have to pay for all these things, they had to pay for much higher land prices.",

If you believe that someday it will be a great place where land developers are going to come and make it as an urban place, your investment has been worth it. But eventually, majority of the land are going to rise in prices because development is continuous per area.
