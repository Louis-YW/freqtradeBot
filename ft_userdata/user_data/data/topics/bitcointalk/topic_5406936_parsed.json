I think SOL is garbage though considering that the chain broke over 8 times in the last year. How can you trust your funds on a platform like that. I much prefer Polygon and I'm glad that DApps like MAXX Finance and Qi DAO are launching on Polygon instead of Solana. I feel much safer putting my funds on Polygon.",

We can see massive holdings of whales in this solana network hence retailers should be wary and watch out. Most of the uptrend are being manipulated by them in my opinion.",

Well, just maybe, we can't be sure if that in the first place, and in besides, predictions are bound mostly wrong. At these bearish moments, we can't simply just think about a huge pump without manipulation. And who knows, if this is just a trap for us. Just look at the price trend of Bitcoin, it is still low and declining. I used this as a basis of my analysis which gives me some insights into that Solana doesn't have a pump indication.",

SOL which also experienced a deep decline, I think some people consider it feasible to invest in these assets.regarding the video the OP linked, I think it just contains the usual information you might read through other platforms. some are more related to market analysis information than SOL. I thought the OP, just wanted to share this information. or the channel could be his",

One thing in particular can be said that if the price of Bitcoin decreases or increases then its effect is on all other tokens or coins. As the worst period is currently going on due to which Bitcoin was hovering around 19k to 20k for a long time. A few days ago it was noticed that the price of Bitcoin has increased slightly. Due to this the price of all other tokens also increased. I will say one more thing that the current bear market is going on. So if anyone wants to invest or trade then think carefully.",
