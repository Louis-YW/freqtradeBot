If your USDT is on Ethereum there is Railgun which can be used to shield your tokens. You can use decentralized exchanges to make a few private swaps and then move those funds into an unshielded wallet.",

However, sometimes they are short in reserves for XMR.Quote from: ZeeshanTrade on October 01, 2023, 04:19:33 AMand then where i mix the XMR ?You do not need to mix your XMR. The XMR which you have cannot be traced as to where they come from and where they are deposited. That is why we call XMR, the privacy coin.",

That is a long process when he can just convert the USDT to monero and convert it back to monero which is a shorter process and the fee would be less than convert to bitcoin and using s mixer. The only time I prefer to use or involve bitcoin is when I want to mix bitcoin.Quote from: ZeeshanTrade on October 01, 2023, 04:19:33 AMHow do i convert my USDT to XMR (i have them on trust wallet) and then where i mix the XMR ?I did not see monero/USDT trading pair on Bisq. You can first convert the USDT to bitcoin on an instant exchange, then convert the bitcoin to monero on bisq.network, convert the monero back to bitcoin and exchange the bitcoin back to USDT on an instant exchange.To do that, you can use https://exch.cx/ for the instant exchangeUse https://bisq.network for the decentralized exchange. Or to make it simple, use Tor on https://exch.cx/ to convert it directly. But https://exch.cx/is an instant exchange.",

I hope the exchange will support it, it is not that old and they will support more coins later. Only ERC20 USDT that the exchange is supporting for now.

Since its an erc20 too why not convert first to ethereum then mixed it then convert to usdt after that. I think its the same principle if you want to wash off your address and gain some stablecoins through ethereum network. If Im not mistaken tornado cash has a lot of option but didnt used or tried that out yet.",

It is best to clarify the question first. USDT cannot be mixed with other coins unless you exchange it first on an exchange, otherwise I don't know. The question is why do you intend to hide it, because too large or want to set aside some USDT, sorry. Comply with your country laws or regulation when you register exchange. Even if you later want to exchange USDT for XMR. Some popular exchange platforms that allow this include Binance, Kraken, and KuCoin. Yes, almost all of them do KYC.",
