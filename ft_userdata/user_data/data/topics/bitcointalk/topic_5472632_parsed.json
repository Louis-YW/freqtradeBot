They claim to offer many new things for crypto with flexibility and fashion as one of its focus. I don't think that's even necessary for a HW. I guess they don't intend to target security-aware people in the first place? If that's the case, we can only wait for the news when one of these wallets gets hacked or people lose money from dumb stuff.",

The ring doesn't have a battery, so it will be interesting to see what powers it. Backup cards will work if you break your ring, it gets stolen, or you lose it.

Or you'll just take it off somewhere and lose it. Like a banal ordinary ring. Carrying such a wallet with you is completely unreasonable, but only if the balance of this wallet contains only small change for pocket expenses, like buying coffee and a donut with chocolate glaze. Wouldn't it be a little expensive for such a wallet?\"Tangem Ring will come with a price tag of no less than $200 for the end consumer.\" - SourceThere is one more point: this device works through a smartphone application and an installed application and doesn't have physical buttons for confirming outgoing transactions as on traditional hardware wallets, which is protection against online theft. How will this ring be protected?",

I am not a fan of the idea either. But hey, you don't have to wear it all the time like your wedding ring. Put it on when you intend to use it and take it off when you are back home. Not all jewelry that people wear is valuable. Some people wear friendship bracelets or bracelets their kids made for them. It's not worth a cent and may look bad, but had sentimental value.",

Yeah, I even made a complaint thread about them a few years ago, but in the end I didn't get scammed.  Changelly has been around for a long time and I thought that they were at least fairly reputable even if there have been some scam accusations against them.  I don't think that's too far off-topic--and yes, I did read SFR10's post.What I can't stand are these partnerships HW wallet manufacturers enter into (Ledger went way overboard with that), and even some software wallets like Trust have done it as well.  It sort of feels like the evolution of Google, where once upon a time it was a simple search engine and was excellent in carrying out its purpose.  And now?  You search for something and the only thing you get 90% of the time is advertising thrown at you.  If I'm looking to buy a HW wallet, I just want a device to keep my coins safe and I don't want constant reminders that the manufacturer is in cahoots with various services of varying reputation and is pushing me to use those services.It feels fakkin' icky, you know?",
