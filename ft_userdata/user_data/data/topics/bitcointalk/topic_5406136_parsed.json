This lawsuit will be damaging to twitter in the end because they will have to publicly disclose information in the court.Will they settle for a lower price instead or will twitter open to disclose data which Elon's lawyers will ask?",

It has now taken 1 step back, but I think only to take 2 steps forward. Judging by Twitter's politics, it doesn't look like a grandmaster at this game.",
