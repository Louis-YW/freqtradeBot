  "content": "https://mailchimp.com/january-2023-security-incident/Oh snap, it's just the start of the year and we just had another Mailchimp hacked (for the nth time). Not really sure how their security is, or how their contractors and employees security hygiene is, but their job is very sensitive and it's client facing so we really don't understand how many times they will be hacked before they learn from this mistakes.The reports says 133 Mailchimp accounts has been breached, so that is a lot.One confirmed victim is WooCommerce -> https://twitter.com/Arm_i_n/status/1615719010921844737/photo/1Here is the previous hacked: Mailchimp was hacked again, exposing DigitalOcean customer's email .Again 133 accounts, and most probably there could be some crypto related accounts that is included in that list and maybe in the next couple of months we will see an increased of phishing attacks.",

      "body": "These hacks of service providers are dangerous for people or companies that use a single main email for all registrations on multiple platforms.To decentralize risk and reduce risk from such hacks, data leaks, we should use different emails for different usages. Main emails for registrations on biggest platforms. Sub emails for registrations on new platforms if we want to explore them. Special emails for financial things if necessary.I know practically many people use only one email for many registrations on many platforms including newborn platforms that have yet been verified about their security.[Guide] How to know if your email address was part of any data breach.https://haveibeenpwned.com/",

      "body": "Social engineering to obtain credentials should not be enough, if a company knows how to upper itâ€™s security measures. They can at least resort to authorizing a restricted set of IPs to access the internal systems remotely, as well as 2FA for employees. Though the technical details have not been provided, nor will we likely see them, it does seem like quite a bit more can be done. They could even monitor in real time who accesses what, and setup alerts if a certain user access starts to show abnormal activities (i.e. multiple or mass customer data downloads, and so forth).The only nominally known client (company) affected so far, WooCommerce, is no minor fish, and could potentially hold millions of records for all the customers and related end-customers that have a relation to the ecommerce platforms running on their software. There is no current indication to the number of downloaded records, not their exact nature (likely in the same line as last time), data which I hope to see around at some point.",
