I was going to ask how you can cheat a casino but even with a trick on the machine, the probability is very limited for that to happen Quote from: Stepstowealth on June 22, 2023, 03:12:12 PMWill you bet on fixed games if you get the tip early? Is anything wrong with fixed games? I don't think so.If you as a bettor have a chance that a football match for example has been fixed, you can bet on the direction for winning your bet and that is not you cheating. In this case you didn't cheat but those who fixed the game did.",

I will play in casino because I want to be entertained not to cheat and also I don't want to be punish by any consequence of that action.",

There are some people that can be decoyed to pay and are scammed, given what would be used to do the cheat a casino or sport betting site and they lose again. They are scammed and they lose money to the gambling site. Two losses at once.",

However, any rewards coming from cheating doesn't bear fruits in someone's life. You can observe examples around you, involving people you know or famous people and you will see when they deceived others to achieve their goals, it will look like those goals have actually brought more trouble than plenitude to them. So I guess you don't want this for your life, so just don't cheat.Follow the righteousness path, even when things look unfavourable to you and good opportunities will appear for you later, in a legit way. This recipe can't guarantee you will reach the top of the world, but it will guarantee you live in peace, with integrity, having everything you need to survive dignifiedly.",

There is a low probability of me betting on it, but that's only if it comes to me freely because I'll never go out to search for tips from a scammer to win a bet, it's now obvious that most of those that claime to have info about a game do not have anything they are only waiting for you to take the bait so that they can scam you.And as for other cheats like; creating multiple acccounts, going against the ToS of the casino so that I can make more money, Nah!!! I ain't gonna do that because not only do I go against the laid down rule I also risk my account getting blocked along with my funds.",

OP meant no offense; he was simply expressing his perspective that if we were given the opportunity to cheat and go subsequently to our guiding principles, I would gladly do so.

While I think there may be some tricks one could try but most areas in a real-life casino are monitored by cameras. So even if you were to try cheating or engaging in suspicious activities you'll be caught imoSpeaking of cheating in a casino, this reminds me of an anime called Kaiji, specifically in season 2. In that season, the main character actually managed to cheat a slot machine and make a lot of money after being in debt for a long time. It was quite an interesting gambling anime.

I think it's acceptable to buy a fixed game and place bets on it early. It might be considered cheating in certain points but at least you are paying for a service. Personally, I don't view it as cheating but I would never engage in manipulating slot machines or using tricks in a casino.",

There is always risk involved in anything. I’m sure even fixed games don’t go the right way all of the time. Same with commonly used strategies and exploits. If I found an advantage and it was legal, I would certainly use it. If it were an obvious bug I would even probably report it once I was convinced I had found an exploit. I think that would likely be appreciated.",

One reason why gamblers are sometimes banned/blocked is that they violate rules, not necessarily cheating but because they got away with violating rules, they will also think they could get away with cheating. And so they cheat and we already know how it ends. Most of the time, they think they could get away actually but when the casino investigates they find many issues. And sometimes you won't see casinos explaining what and how is because they don't wanna give the public the idea of how those cheaters got caught.",

Will you try a trick to win on casino game machines if you were told and it is a 100% working trick to cash out? Will you bet on fixed games if you get the tip early? It is easy to talk about the hypothetical scenario of cheating in a casino, but everything is completely different when such an opportunity to outsmart the casino and take possession of a large amount of winnings appears in reality. I didn't have such a dilemma and I don't want to fantasize about what I would do. To be honest, I don’t know exactly how I would have acted: I deceived the casino for a big jackpot or not.Each of us who write in this section has ever lost money in a casino and I believe that almost everyone believes that this was unfair on the part of the casino. Everyone understands perfectly how casinos work and how they pull money from their users. My point is that every gambler believes deep down that his past losses were unfair and therefore entitled to revenge. This means that he has the full moral right to return his money, even with the help of a dubious method using cheating in a casino. Do any of you think the same?Personally, I don’t have a problem with gambling (I don’t gamble at all), which means that even with access to information about the possibility of cheating in a casino, I would not do it. More likely.",

I'm not naive to think that there's a way to cheat on the system. If someone tells you that then there could be a plot that's being set against you. And if it's about fixed games, I don't even think that it's even possible to get a tip from anyone even in the slightest possibility.
