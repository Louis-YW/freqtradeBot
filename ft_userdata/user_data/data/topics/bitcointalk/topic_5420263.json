You could have sold during last year's ATH and bought back now, during the dip. I didn't know about FTX.com either, but this single incident was enough to send Bitcoin down to $15.000 within one day, which is worrying to say the least. I can't blame people for being emotional over their own money. It's hard to process that our funds are now worth more than 15% less in value, in a matter of a few hours.",

I haven't sold at 60k because I know BTC's value. If it gets back to 60k I still won't be selling.60k is pennies if you see the whole picture. But only a few see the whole picture. In the future owning 1 single bitcoin will be huge. But it won't be available for everyone.Someone who is selling today is a big chicken if you ask me.

On the other hand, buyers are happy, its' on a sale, they can buy huge amount of bitcoin again and fatten their wallet because others have 'chicken out'.They might regret their decision to sold though, when the market bounce back after this nosedived.",

Less drama, live longer.You may believe the panic seller is chicken I may somehow agree and also disagree because the market is replicating the same thing that always happened every 4 years although it always comes with different influences.If you remember in the year 2018, the crypto market experienced a type of market correction after the moment Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak claimed to have sold all his holding to exit the market in other for him not to play dupe by the market. This year's market was triggered by CZ's statement about FTX tokens and exchange.",

The ones who sell when the crypto market is down.Okay, right. I get your point now. However, from my point of view, for how long will someone be able to hold on? Don't we have to cash out and convert to fiat at some point? I'm confident that Bitcoin will be worth more than $70.000 again in the coming years, and I'm willing to hold until then. However, I find it sensible to sell after overcoming the bear market. There are no guarantees that Bitcoin will keep rising to infinity, and honestly, what's the point of holding it and never selling it?",

If only weak investors are aware of this and not only basing on the current price, probably they will not panic to sell at loss. Unfortunately they're thinking negative thoughts during this time.Well, it's understandable to have worries and fear but if you know what you're getting into and has knowledge about it then you'll understand that it's only temporary. Nevertheless, the price is quite cheap, a time to buy, so take advantage it if you're bullish in Bitcoin's future.",

How much can people deprive themselves of by expecting a high price of bitcoin? I always want to ask such people: “How many years of life have you measured out for yourself?” It is necessary to live life in youth, when you want everything at once, and to get rich in old age when there are no former strengths and desires, I do not see much joy in this.Bitcoin is rising; if you see profit, withdraw; don't be a fan. Of course, a pillow in old age will not hurt, but who knows if someone will have old age and whether it is worth limiting life now?",
