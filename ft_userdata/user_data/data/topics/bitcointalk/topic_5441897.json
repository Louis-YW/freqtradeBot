The coins are never in a wallet, they are on the network. The wallet only handles the keys (and shows the amounts).This being said, as long as you have a properly backed up seed and nobody else has access to it, you're good and you'll be able to recover your wallet/addresses/keys. It's preferable to do that with a/another hardware wallet for obvious reasons.",

The question is simple, do you have a copy of the seed words that you are supposed to have used previously? In any case, if you have the seeds of any of the two wallets, you can make some attempts before asking, and this will not affect your savings.Assuming you lost your bitbox wallet, can you still use it on electrum after it is lost?",

This means you can opt to use an alternative hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor, or a software wallet like Electrum. Your seed phrase serves as the master key, rendering everything else irrelevant.",

Your computer sends the unsigned transaction from Electrum to BitBox. Then, BitBox signs it. Then it sends it back to Electrum. You're essentially making usage of Electrum with the exception that the creation of signature doesn't happen on your computer.",

The coins are not in a wallet or a seed. They are on the blockchain and anybody can see them as long as he knows the address(es). And that's OK. However, only the person(s) having the private keys (which are created from the seed) can spend the coins. And that's where BitBox helps in a secure manner.",
