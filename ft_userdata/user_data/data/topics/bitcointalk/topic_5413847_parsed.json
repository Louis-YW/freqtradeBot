They only lack few important cryptos at the moment which I believed will be added soon.

      "body": "LOL, what do you mean that scammers don't have a chance on your platform? We have seen lots of project being listed to even top tier exchanges, but the thing is that if they don't do any development then for sure they will be delisted in the next couple of months. Of course there is the security questions, there are a lot of hackers looking to exploit and steal everyone's money in an exchange, even Binance has been hack before. So there is no safe exchange anymore. You guys should be awake 24x7 to watch your operations for any cyber threat. And then there is also the question of wash trading. A recent report shows the majority of exchanges are doing wash trading.",

Quote from: Kemarit on September 17, 2022, 08:56:35 AMA recent report shows the majority of exchanges are doing wash trading.  That's true, i came across a thread which says  forbes claims half of bitcoin transaction are false which is equally one of their claims wash trading, indeed there are alot of wash trading out their but we should not just justify all exchanges to be the same. Quote from: Kemarit on September 17, 2022, 08:56:35 AMYou guys should be awake 24x7 to watch your operations for any cyber threatThanks for this advice, to me the safest place to store crypto is just hardware wallet or any noncustodial wallet which owners have the right to and only them have access to the wallet, unless when the user is careless enough to allow his/her phrase/private key to be compromise.",

If you mean hackers, there's no any centralized exchanges that invulnerable against hacked. Binance as everyone said the most trusted and popular centralized exchange can still got hacked on 2017 if I'm not mistaken. If Quidax become more bigger, they're just waiting until there's a hacker can find the vulnerability of the exchange.",

I am not the owner of the site, its and i don't think they are listed on coinmarket cap either, its an exchange i used to trade which its among the exchange which support my local currency (NG) really don't know much about exchanges. like i said i can delete the post if its said not to be safe or seeing as a paid promotional post.

Yes the exchange I believe is Africa owned, because it was introduced to me by my friend (Nigerian)when it comes to performance i also believe they are doing well, base on the few times i traded with them.
