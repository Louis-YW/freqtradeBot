  "content": "If you are a Bitcoin investor, and read news on social media or in Bitcointalk forum, I am sure you already know about the term 'HODL'.What is this and what does it mean?I always recommend newbies to Search before posting and if they practice it, they will find some resources about HODL term.[Guide] Searching effectivelyThey can find results in this forum or on other sites like Coinmarketcap.I AM HODLING is where this term was born, by @GameKyuubi, in Bitcointalk forum.Understanding HODL (Coinmarketcap)QuoteHODL = Hold On Dear Life.Above is for the first question.The second question, for Bitcoin investors, can be explained with the following chart.https://hodl.camp/Click on some icons at the top right corner to customize color of the chart.As of writing, the HODL line is 5 year and 1 month. This line changes with Bitcoin prices and with time, stay updated by using the chart.I quote the guide from HOLD camp.QuoteWelcome to Hodl Camp.This is an interactive graph on the profitability of hodling bitcoin. Read the whitepaper here.Time flows diagonally, from the upper left corner to the bottom right corner.It starts on 2010-07-18 and ends on 2023-12-20.By moving the mouse or tapping the heat map, you will traverse all historical entry and exit dates. Pin the marker by clicking and move around with WASD keys.Moving vertically changes the entry date. Up is earlier, down is later.Moving horizontally changes the exit date. Left is earlier, right is later.Where the lines cross, the color shows the profitability, green for positive and red for negative.The green scale is log10, the red scale is linear.One pixel is one day. Zoom in () to see more detail. Zoom out () to see the bigger picture.Drag or scroll to move around.Next to bitcoin denominated in U.S. dollar, it's also possible to plot the price of bitcoin denominated in troy ounces gold (XAU). This eliminates the influence of price fluctuations of U.S. dollar and instead uses a hard money: gold.Change the color map () if green/red doesn't work for you.Now, let's see the chart with default settings.You can click on the Eye icon to change color settings. Below are some of color settings and how it looks. Choose one color setting you like to use.     When you hover mouse on the HODL map chart, you will see Entry date, Entry price, Exit date, Exit price and Profit/ Loss. This feature is a quick tool to check profit, loss with an assumption that you buy bitcoin at a past year, hodl it like 1, 2, 4 years and how it turns out to be Profit or Loss for you.If you don't like this HODL map, you can use alternatives likehttps://dcabtc.com/https://costavg.com/",

Yeah it's better to not get into all this technical staffs unless you really want to learn it. HODL should be simple. Just keep on accumulating and forget about them unless you have an emergency and you need the money at once. Don't ever check Bitcoin price on a regular basis. That creates a FOMO and people usually fall for it. Bitcoin is like bluechip stocks. The longer it stays in your account, the better return it gives. You can use any simple portfolio apps simi6to the CMC one. Keep it simple!;",

As long as you know how to save money in a bank, which is a practice that many of us have tried in different times in our lives. Id you see that the money is very important to achieve something good, you will save it so that you can achieve your goal. This is the same thing with bitcoin, the money that you are saving in the bank, just use to to buy bitcoin and keep piling them up in your self custody wallet until you have reached your bitcoin target. It is good to have a bitcoin target as this will give you a better chance to increase your bitcoin portfolio and also be patient with hodli.",

Invest in BTC for long-term investment and enjoy life by earning a profit. By the way, HODL is a unique strategy that can give you a profit. However, even if you don't know much about cryptocurrency and know some basics, HODL can organize your profit. Just simply buy the Dip and HODL will give you a profit in return. Anywhere when I hear about HODL, I am delighted because, from the beginning till now, I have made the most profit in HODL, i.e. Bored in Buy the Dip and HODL. I had also made a profit by diversifying his portfolio under DCA for HODL. So I was a little excited after hearing about HODL.

Bitcoin surely does seem to possess some Lindy effect qualities in which the longer it is in existence the stronger it seems to get.. or at least the more we might be able to conclude that it is is going to continue to exist, even if the returns might not be as great (in terms of percentages) as they were in the past, but part of any investment is not ONLY considering upside potential but also getting some value in the solidification that lesses downside potential... while still not guaranteeing any of these price performance matters in either direction.Quote from: MusaPk on December 26, 2023, 07:51:33 PMQuote from: tranthidung on December 25, 2023, 09:20:03 AMI agree.DCA saves time and headache but more important, it is more effectively than trading and other investment methods if you take your health benefit into consideration.I just have a small working on DCA vs LUM SUM Profit.

Just like we can't compare Apple with Oranges, so better not compare DCA with Lump Sum.I don't have any problems comparing them, but yeah, they are different categories of things and each of them can work well under certain kinds of circumstances, and surely a person who has a lump sum available has options regarding how to consider investing, whether that is lump sum all of it or to perhaps lump sum part and maybe even DCA other parts and buy on dips with other parts. A person who does not have a lump sum available has to just deal with cash as it comes in, and in some cases, there are folks who do not have good habits of saving and/or investing and maybe they don't even really know how to do it, so DCA would likely be better for them because they can just choose an amount to invest over whatever period of time that is based on how much disposable income that they have, and if they were to save it in cash and then invest it later, then that may or may not be practical, but it could end up being a form of lump sum that is buying on dip if they really think that there might be utility in terms of waiting when they get into BTC.. which it is never really clear when those periods of long and deep correction are going to happen and at the same time, even if they happened in a certain pattern in the past, it is not even close to assured that such long and deep corrections are going to happen in similar ways in the future... even though bitcoin's ongoing volatility is likely inevitable, we just can never really be sure of the direction (especially in the short-to-medium term, even if even if we can develop theories and even probabilities).",

however, I am not even sure how useful that is, even if the the tax man frequently forces us to jump through those kinds of accounting hoops.In any event, many of us who have been a long time in bitcoin have also experienced upside and compoundings (and exponential growth) of the value of our BTC holdings, but you are still not going to get me to suggest that any particular coin that is bought now, in the future or even past coins are guaranteed to be in profits in the future or even including that past coins that are currently in profits are going to continue to be in profits, even if there is a whole hell of a lot of cushion between current price and the cost basis.  On the other hand, I do have a lot of reliance in the 200-week moving average, even with my own calculation of personal strategies and even attempt to provide frameworks for how to think about the value or our BTC stashes (looking at my ideas behind sustainable withdrawal).. and so in that regard, the 200-week moving average has always gone up, and its worst performance period was between about June 2022 and November 2023, even though it still went up 20% on an annualized basis during that time (as you can see from my entry-level fuck you status chart).  Another thing is that the 200-week moving average is not guaranteed to continue to go up even though right now it is going up around $25 per day and likely to on track to having at least a 30% annualized performance for our current six month period between December and May..  So even though I consider BTC going up as not guaranteed, I still consider that any of who have stacked enough BTC could likely employ BTC stack management practices that allow us to have good chances of being able to withdraw BTC at higher rates than we would be able to sustainably withdraw in traditional investments, so I largely use 6-10% as sustainable withdrawal, even though I throttle those values if the BTC spot price start to get to become less than 25% higher than the 200-week moving average... so surely I consider there to be a lot of power and value in terms of building a BTC stack, but you are still not going to get me to claim that there are guarantees of UPpity BTC price moves, even if the 200-week moving average (which is a lagging indicator) has never (so far in BTC's price history) gone lower than 20% annualized.",

Before making any investing decisions, think about your risk tolerance, financial objectives, and understanding of the bitcoin market.Volatility is only a big concern if you plan to hold bitcoin in short term. If you hold it long term, like about 5 years, volatility is not your concern because price is strongly upward.ROI chart shows this fact https://casebitcoin.com/charts#roi_chartChoose different time frame like 1 year, Year to date, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years and see different ROIs. With 5-year ROI chart, I am sure you will see no concern with Bitcoin volatility in short term.",
