Why don't you drop a picture of the casino or the name of the casino so that we can access it by ourselves. I smell something fishery from your thread and claims because you are a newbie and have zero reputation,there is high possibility that you will start asking for funds.I believe all your receipts and videos are fake as it was planned by you guys. Please think of how you can learn and grow here instead of having the mindset to scam people because nobody will fall for fall. Be careful with OP and you should know that you are on your own if something goes wrong between both of you when you fall for his plan.",

Anyways I became curious when I saw this post of yours and what made me pick interest was the fact you requested that prospective clients pm you separately which I see as funny and fishy. You claimed you do not know how to upload pictures here but you know how to create a topic. What stops you from upgrading your account to a copper member so you could be able to do that. Nevertheless, the way and manner at which you started looks questionable OP and here you are  telling members about Facebook page for a setup process who does that. Do you think members here would fall so cheap for your gimmicks. I would not be surprised seeing a newbie account testifying to your work as that has being the usual way scammers do.",

If your interested pm me I'll send you my Facebook and we can get you setup.man I confess that this whole story of yours is very strange, because as @Cantsay said, days ago you were looking for a site that offered Cockfighting bets, but to add what @Cantsay is that in the same thread you were asking about Cockfighting you said that you had many accounts of many sites that offered this type of bets but that the problem was that they asked for your phone number, they asked that you have a bank account in Vietnam and that created constraints for you, for example having to depend on people like that countries, so it is something that you cannot directly take into account, so why do you insist on betting on it under these inappropriate conditions? this is my first point that I keep asking myselfnow going to the second point and that you are offering a service equal to the services that I said were inappropriate, for all people to understand what I am talking about, I will put what you yourself posted a few days ago:Quote from: Comicking on August 21, 2023, 02:48:54 AMQuote from: btc_angela on August 20, 2023, 07:18:02 AMQuote from: Comicking on August 20, 2023, 06:10:10 AMAnybody know of any crypto casinos that offer cockfighting? preferably vietnamese thai cambodian or filipinoAs far as I know there is none that supports cockfighting on crypto based casinos, sorry to burst the bubble for you.But if you are looking for none crypto casinos, there are a lot, but it is supposedly local though. So if you are outside of the country then I don't think you can bet or even access the online cockfighting site as it might detect your IP although you can get away with it by using VPN, but I don't recommend it.Yes this is the problem ive been having. I have SEVERAL 100% legitamate cockfighting casinos but ALL of them require you to have a vietnamese/cambodian/thai bank account, and phone number. Perhaps if I could get in touch with somebody in one of these countries they could help me, but then I will be completely at the mercy of this itermediary trusting them to handle my deposits, and withdrawals! I really find it shocking that there are no websites that are more international. Not a great business model. Literally trying to give these guys thousands of dollars and they cant take it.see that what you are saying is that you cannot create a bank account in vietnamese, cambodian and thailand, so I also assume that you cannot create a bank account in the philippines, so how are you coming to this thread to make this proposal? My assumption is that you want someone from this forum who is from the Philippines and has a Philippine bank account to create an account on these cockfighting sites and keep betting with your money and then, when withdrawing, that person sends you a part of the money.Now something I can't understand, and because even though you have paypal on these sites, you still need someone from the Philippines, wouldn't it be easier for you to create a paypal account and use it on this site? if you already have a paypal account everything will be even easier for you. my advice: do not use methods like these to continue with this type of betting, if the sites are not evaluated in your country then do not use them, using other people's accounts even if it is indirectly is not good and is not reliable, people can just disappear with your money and you can't complain",

You can still upload your images in a hosting service like imgur and post the links here, so we can check on your receipts.Also, It is very suspicious that you are talking about such service and you only offer to share details to those you contact you privately, it is very shady. I would advice anyone interested in OPs offer to proceed with caution, there are already enough red flags in his behavior and the secretive nature of the information he alleges to have within his power.

The operators could just vanish all of a sudden. They could lock accounts and freeze funds. There can't be accountability with an illegal gambling operation. There is no house edge in cockfighting, but the platform always takes a good deal of share.
