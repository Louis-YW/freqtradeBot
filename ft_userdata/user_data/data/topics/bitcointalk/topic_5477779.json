That too selling a load of 1.5 BTC which is no joke amount at all as far as INR is concerned.A lot of red flags to consider here in my opinion.",

Good note, I donâ€™t know why he decided to post using this account because it seems to be an old but useless account, but the amount is large and it is better to be careful when making a deal with this person. I do not want the amount of 60k to be huge in India, but it is definitely not small.",
