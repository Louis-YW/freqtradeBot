      "body": "Centralized Exchanges these days almost have KYC (most of the trusted) so if you want to be more safe. Go for these platforms that already working, like cryptoadditchie suggested above.Among the list above, I only tried Stargate Finance. But I can suggest here, like using Orbiter. I already tried this bridge platform for most of the new layer-2 networks.Another thing is seems most bridge platform these days are almost  the same fees, it will only depends on which network are you in.",

You can go via polygon zkevm or via exchanges, mexc doesn't require kyc yet so you can use it. [1] https://www.layerswap.io/app",

I checked out and Polygon zkevm, Zksync and Linea available for bridge. The minimum amount is $25.  official website link belwohttps://rhino.fiIf you want to exchange lower than this then site mentioned by Libert19 is best one and I used many times for Starknet and Zksync bridgeAre you using these networks Zksync, linea for airdrop speculation purpose, If yes then I will recommend to use official bridge one because most of the time they require this step and also volume and number of transactions plays great role.",

Thus, the cost of transferring ETH from one network to another will amount to several tens of cents.",

I was using these two sites for bridging, and they have worked fine for me till now. Symbiosis: Have a wide range of supported currencies, including USDC, USDT, and DAI, along with ETH as a native currency. Orbiter: You can bridge mostly ETH and USDC.",

I'm aware of bridges like Orbiter Finance, but that's a bit too expensive (for the small amount I'm trying to move).I think almost all bridge platforms require transaction fees, if you ask me, it's \"expensive\". I've tried maybe but at that time eth to bsc. I did not try with other networks bsc to polygon (matic) or others but if you have assets yes approximately under $20 I think it will be difficult to find a bridge with a small fee. Perhaps you can try off-chain which does not require gas fees when transferring assets between users on the same platform, such as using a centralized exchange. But still these usually require KYC verification.",
