Actually it doesn't happen on hardware wallet only, the other non custodial wallet also can generate many public addresses.So hardware wallet and metamask are different.",

You can connect hardware wallets (Trezor, Ledger, Keystone, etc) with your Metamask wallet and use it exactly the same way but with more security because you need to confirm transaction on your device.There is also option of using Trezor Suite or ledger live native wallets, and you can rename wallets anyway you want, or generate multiple addresses.I only suggest using open source wallets.",

      "body": "You started this discussion saying that you now know the difference between a closed-source and an open-source wallet. If that is true, you should know that SafePal is not open-source. If that's an essential element for you, you ought to better look elsewhere. Some other things I remember about this hardware wallet is that it doesn't have any coin control features and apparently it doesn't allow for the creation of multiple accounts. So it's not for you. It used to have mobile-only support, no idea if they expanded to desktop devices in the meantime. The SafePal was also tagged as potentially vulnerable by a security reviewer. If you carry out a search on this forum, I am sure you will come across that report and several other threads discussing this particular wallet.",

Yes, you can have 2 'accounts' on hardware wallets!
