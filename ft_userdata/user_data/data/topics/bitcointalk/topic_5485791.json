  "content": "There are many types of Bitcoin investors, some invest for long-term holdings, while others invest for short-term holdings. But one thing is true, those who invest in Bitcoin for short term are never able to achieve anything big. On the contrary, they face more losses.every Bitcoin investment should be long-term. Because we have seen that even at the end of 2023 the price of bitcoin was 42k and as the year 2024 falls, the price of bitcoin has crossed 50k and currently the price of bitcoin is 52k. So now consider that those who invested in Bitcoin in 2023, when the price of Bitcoin was hovering between 26k and 27k, have already received double returns. So those who have been patiently holding Bitcoin since then have already reaped double the return on their investment. Now another big opportunity is going to come in front of us. When the price of Bitcoin will increase much more than that. So I would say, those who haven't invested in Bitcoin yet, make a final decision to invest in Bitcoin for lone time Holding now and hold until the next ATH. You invest in Bitcoin and keep your Bitcoin holdings safe, because the next bull market is going to have the power to change your life. So just Hold bitcoin for long time.",

This is the same with bitcoin, and this is why you must invest in a long term so that you can limit the risk and be sure of some profit in the long run. The investors that are in good profit are those that bottom during 2022 bottom line of 16k, and those that are hodling for up to two cycles now. However, it is not still late to benefit from bitcoin if you start now.",

Right, and so this is why the market is very volatile, one of it's nature that most of us take advantage of it, some sellers and then others waiting to scope that BTC and fill their bags. For those who are holding it though, not the right time to sell, unless it's necessary (there is an emergency and you needed more money). But the best selling time is near the top of the bull run, you just have to time the market, or just sell in small portions, in my opinion. Anyhow, still plenty of time to accumulate sats before the halving in April.",

For better profits I believe an investor needs to hold that investment for at least a decade.It's expected that in future Bitcoin will gain value of at least $1M a coin and the ones who invested in Bitcoin during last bear market would reap so good profits by holding their investment for a decade.

Because bitcoin price movements tend to have the same cycle for every bitcoin halving. So it becomes more profitable if stored for the long term. In the short term, I think we can still hope for far more from altcoins even though they have the same big risks. But in the long term Bitcoin has proven that loyal holders always have a profit as long as they hold strong until the target price is reached.",

Remember that BTC has a limited supply, and with this, the level of scarcity will increase over time. That's what makes @OP believe that long-term investors benefit more than short-term investors.Z.H.I.E.N.D",

Day trading is a very bad idea, and trying to predict weekly or monthly trends is not much better, but betting on the halvening cycles isn't bad even for beginners. Most important is not getting too greedy and actually sell during the bull run, and then not get too greedy in the bear market and buy before the price starts bouncing back.",

Dont make yourself invest with loan money or life savings so that whenever the price would really be going down then you wont really be having that kind of panic mode. You would really just that easily be able to move on and wont really be that impulsive.",

DCA is friendly for everyone if they already have a consistent income from their work, ideally like that but that doesn't mean people who don't have passive income can't invest, it's just that there are fundamental differences when faced with a situation of urgent need. Therefore investing in Bitcoin is better to ensure that the income of funds is consistent and also gets maximum returns.

And it may only be used for individual transactions if Bitcoin is prohibited from being used as a means of transaction, and if it is allowed, perhaps only a few shops or sellers will accept Bitcoin as a means of payment.So in my opinion, even though Bitcoin is better used as an asset or investment, that doesn't mean they don't use it for transactions because we don't know about it even if it's only in small amounts. And I'm sure that eventually Bitcoin will work for transactions and investments and it's just a matter of time.To be honest, although I use Bitcoin for long-term investment. However, I have also used Bitcoin several times as a means of private transactions between Bitcoin users because of its convenience, speed and distance.",
