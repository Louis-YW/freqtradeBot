It has a strong fan base, no doubt. Besides, it's the pathfinder in this game. I've continued to wonder how a crypto without a smart contract or any other utility apart from payment and not even a PoS can still retain the number one spot and doing well in terms of price while Ethereum with all its innovative help to other projects lags a distant second. Maybe there are stuff about Bitcoin that has eluded me on this. We sure can do with experts' input and comments on this puzzle here.",

Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that is truly decentralized. None of the altcoins can provide bitcoin's security and decentralization.The total hash power in bitcoin is very much higher than (POW) altcoins and as the hashrate has been distributed around the world among thousands of miners, the cost to perform an attack in bitcoin is very very much higher than altcoins. In POS altcoins, there are significant number of pre-mined coins. The owner of those coins (the team) can stake them and have control over the network.",

Bitcoin was the first. Most of the rest are just copying what Bitcoin has done or it's doing.2. Bitcoin is accepted in more places than the altcoins.3. Historically many altcoins are traded vs Bitcoin and not fiat directly (or have important coin-vs-BTC markets) making easy all of them fall (vs fiat) when Bitcoin price falls; even more altcoin markets are known to be more volatile than Bitcoin's4. A very important factor is the mining. Bitcoin is not only very scarce, but also expensive to mine, incredibly expensive to (51%) attack, it's properly decentralized (unlike some known altcoins where a small number of entities are nodes, pools, validators, whatever).5. Back to volatility: since Bitcoin market is less volatile (and a bit more predictable) than altcoins' institutional investors also seem to prefer bitcoin6. Brand name. Bitcoin si the digital gold. The altcoins are \"just shitcoins and scam\".",

Bitcoin remain the most decentralized, the creator (Satoshi Nakamoto) is not known unlike other cryptocurrencies and has no control over bitcoin and remain unknown, unlike altcoins.Bitcoin truly has the strongest blockchain. The confirmation time for a transaction can take 10 minutes but it helps the security in some ways. About fee, bitcoin transaction fee is not high, I did not spend up to or more than $0.06 in the last transactions I made, although, the mempool is not congested, but the mempool is most of the time not congested or getting congested.Exchanges and other centralized platforms can charged extra fee which makes some people think bitcoin transaction fee is high but actually not high at all.

I see all of those other coins that have a lot of utility and practical use when compared to bitcoin, but they don't have the market cap. The market cap is just a manipulation of numbers that you don't need to pay too much attention to. If you look at a coin that is in 2nd place by that criterion, then you will see that its market cap is about 3 times smaller than Bitcoin, but that the circulating supply is as much as 6 times larger. Don't let this ever be the main criterion by which you will judge how good a project is.Quote from: Bhig Daddy on June 20, 2022, 10:01:28 AMAccording to what I've learned, it has extremely slow transaction speeds and higher transaction fees than other coins. It's doesn't appear to stand out from the crowd, yet bitcoin remains number one, is there something I'm missing here? I looked online but couldn't find anything that answered my question. ThanksFor a start, Bitcoin is the first successful cryptocurrency that is also unique because it is completely decentralized and based on the POW which, although energy-intensive, is far fairer than the cryptocurrencies that are using POS. Transactions are therefore much more secure when it comes to Bitcoin, so even though they may not seem fast enough, we have one confirmation block on average every 10 minutes - and if you can look at mempool and pay the appropriate fee, you can get confirmation of your transaction pretty fast.",

Any crypto have big market cap and daily volume trading will increase the fees since the network is busy also other users want to pay more higher. I believe if those shitcoins have same market cap and daily volume trading, the fees will high like Bitcoin or higher, take a look how centralized Ethereum charge insane fees when the market bullish lol.",

Just imagine Bitcoin having half of the attributes of ETH like its smart contract and others in addition to what it already has. Just imagine that The last time the mempool was congested recently was not up to 2 or 3 days which require people to pay not more than $1 or so for one input and 2 outputs transaction, and that was when the price plummeted recently as many people are moving their coins to exchanges to sell. The last mempool congestion that last long that I could remember was early 2020, first quarter (last 2 years).  I understood mempool congestion could be frustrating at times. Nonetheless, this does not still change the fact that many people thought that bitcoin transaction fee is high, but which is not, although altcoins fees are cheaper, but not that bitcoin transaction fee is high, most people are just deceived by exchange withdrawal fee. Only what they can say that could be agreed on is that bitcoin confirmation time after a transaction is broadcasted is not instant, and like I have once commented about it, it helps to reduce the chance of chain reorganization which can be used by some miners to manipulate the blockchain.",

Bitcoin the king is the truest decentralized cryptocurrency, while some altcoins may claim that they are decentralized, they have some kind of centralization behind the scene. 3. The PoW security system of bitcoin is secured that it cannot be hijacked. This cannot be said of other cryptocurrencies. 4. Bitcoin as the oldest, has passed some tests and crossed a decade which so many altcoins will not be able to accomplish. 5.
