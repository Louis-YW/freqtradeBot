But banks try to control money supply when it's needed, but crypto-currencies can't. That's why the banking system is still strong and people trust it the most. And it has government backing other than our crypto-currencies. What we need is to update the banking sector into the crypto world with government support.",

What we must understand is that the money supply is not something that is under our control. At least it's not directly under your control even if you are the president of the government. And that's why bitcoin was created. The economy can be big but when there is less demand, this means a recession, and when there is a recession, the money supply decreases which means that fiat loses value.If we have a straight forward view, the world will slowly but surely shift to a new monetary system that does not depend on this important weakness in human nature.",

That would be the form of the new generation which wouldn't have complete control over anything. There are pros and cons between centralization and decentralized but that's just the reality and that should be the fact in which you are going to choose one. Maybe it's best that you would go to get both in such a way you could protect yourself from both risks.",
