  "content": "For those of you who don't know, Nigel Farage is a significant political figure in the UK and the EU. He is a wealthy banker/ investment manager, and is famous for his Brexit activities. Recently his bank closed his personal and business accounts, and six alternative banks declined to open accounts for him. I understand that he may be considering moving out of the UK to preserve his businesses, and to continue to work for the completion of the Brexit process in the UK.  With the decline and problems of the European Union, it looks as if the oligarchs are working to replace it and expand its sphere under the WEF. This is likely to include the US and the UK in the future. I suspect that the sanctions on Nigel Farage's banking are intended to weaken his political power. However, we know from the experience of the US, that the imposition of sanctions tends to weaken the sanctioner, and to strengthen the sanctioned. One obvious path for Nigel Farage to take is to increase his support for Bitcoin. He has stated publicly that Bitcoin has a great future, and his experiences would tend to emphasise this.",

Its extremely troubling that you can be effectively excluded from society by a bank. this has serious implications for all of us.We know that they are pushing toward CBDC, this is a communists wet dream since they'll be able to dictate to you what you earn, your total worth, what you can spend it on and how much you can accumulate. They would basically have total control over every aspect of your life, if you said or done the wrong thing or something they didnt like or even didnt understand; boom no more money at the push of a button. We've already seen other examples of this with the trucker's in Canada and Paypal blocking useage etc etc.As for Bitcoin, while it is a decentralised network, it is not an independent network. It still relies on the presence of ISP's and network providers who lets face it will primarily listen to government legistlation rather than an individual or group of individuals. If governments decide, they could pull the plug on Bitcoin overnight rendering it useless.We are heading to a time of communist dictatorship at a frightening rate and worst of all people seem to be oblivious to it.Its going to come as a hell of a shock for some.As to what to do about it, only time has that answer.",

BTC cannot help him in this situation, even if he increases his support for BTC, being a big businessman he can't just move all his funds into BTC, he needs to operate using a bank account and clearly he can't do that in the U.K. for now, he will probably leave the U.K for somewhere else. Though this proves that a censorship resistant and permissionless system like BTC is the only way to escape government control.Quote from: Nexus9090 on June 30, 2023, 11:51:56 AMIf governments decide, they could pull the plug on Bitcoin overnight rendering it useless.I don't know how the government can possibly do that when they do not control BTC, the price of BTC will take a hit temporarily if it is banned by a major world power, but it cannot make BTC useless, nothing can stop BTC from being used for the purpose it was created, borderless payments without a central authority.",

I'm not from UK so that's perhaps why.He will open bank accounts in Europe or somewhere else. He won't be banned from everywhere in the world.

That's the true beauty of Bitcoin. And hopefully with his political connections, he will be able to convert his bitcoins to fiat if needed. I feel good because a politician will be forced to test the power of Bitcoin and may become a powerful voice amongst the policymakers to support its growth.",

But, after reading your post, and doing some research about Nigel Farage, I found out that he was badly attacked by the government as they closed all his personal and business accounts, and I believe that anyone who talks about something that's against the rules of a government, and central banks faces such kind of treatment. Although, I'm still suspicious that if the guy was favoring Brexit process then why they are treating him this way? I'm pretty sure that he has learned his lesson that even doing everything for banks and governments you will still have to face hard times. I'm also very sure that the guy will give up on the banking system because he didn't received the rewards for his sacrifices, but was punished for the sins that he hasn't done. I'm very sure that Nigel Farage will move to Bitcoin and he will give up on those traditional banking systems for good, and he will be a very helpful figure for the growth of Bitcoin. Let's see what the future holds for us and how many of Nigel Farage like bank account holders will be kicked by the banking system if they believe in the freedom of speech. Only and only Bitcoin is the savior of such people, and I'm pretty sure that one day almost everyone will use Bitcoin.",

Did Andy Cecere (CEO of UBS) find out he was sleeping with his wife? Did he lie on some forms? It's amazing how many times people scream they were targeted and then we find out, no there were many and good legitimate reasons for what happened.Not saying it's right that things like this happen, but with only 1 side of the story it's not noteworthy. Even here in the US there have been a lot of people that have been 'unbanked' for reasons that I would think are BS but were costing the banks money so they got booted out. And then since we have places like chexsystems here, no other bank would take them.-Dave",

He has stated publicly that Bitcoin has a great future, and his experiences would tend to emphasise this.Nigel Farage's dilemma shows the importance of Bitcoin. It is a clear case of financial persecution because of a person's personal views. The government wants everybody to behave like puppets while they become puppet masters. Nigel even claimed that the government has also extended this bank account closure to his family members. Nigel has been accused before of receiving funds from Russian backed media firm to the tune £550,000 without evidence. And he has claimed that received less than £5000. Very soon people will be with different political views will not survive in the present world. Where will he move to? Maybe El Salvador. The entire banks in Europe and the US have the same ideology so I wonder which bank will accept him. Leaving Britain might not be the best option because he might still face the same fate in other nations. Turning to bitcoin will be a good option because it can help him keep his funds safe in a decentralized form. Nigel sees Bitcoin as a means to ultimate freedom and has been a supporter of Bitcoin. He might not be a billionaire but he has influence and followership (about1.7 millionn), so he can attract more people to Bitcoin.",
