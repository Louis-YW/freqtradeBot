If you are in same position like me, no matter how much you like someone or want the best for them do not help them to invest in crypto, they are lazy asses who can't get anything done on their own, and this type of game I don't play it because, in the end, you will become their enemy.  It's already happening and I just ignored them. Is anyone seeing the same thing in their city or country?",

Is anyone seeing the same thing in their city or country? There are so many people in our country because of ignorance and their perception of Cryptocurrency, choose to rely to people who are long time investors to pick the right coins to invest, they claimed to be overwhelmed by the technology behind it and you are right, too lazy to learn how these things work because it really takes time and effort to learn how to invest and profit.",

For example I have personally faced people, who have asked to advice which car to buy, but later, if something breaks in it, the person that helped them to choose that car was responsible for it. Or I was asked to help to choose a laptop. I have suggested either Macbook or Lenovo. The person have said they are expensive and bought cheap Toshiba, that turned into crap after a year. Me and laggy Windows were responsible for users bad experience... Same goes with investment, purchase or taking a decision in something.",

What you are doing is also very good because remembering that everyone should be able to know the level of risk that must be faced after knowing the level of profit that can be obtained. Actually telling someone or everyone for these two things is also not wrong, because telling both of them at the beginning will not hurt unless what we tell or you suggest is indeed a person who is basically lazy so whatever method you give him he will not develop.QuoteDo not waste your time on people who are not ready to work and take responsibility but want all the goodies for themselves.We do need to filter and choose the right person to tell anything related to crypto, but at first we also don't know how much responsibility he has for himself so we need to try to tell him first before wasting more time on him in crypto matters.",

I have noticed that most people from African countries care very little about their own safety and do exactly the opposite of what an average investor from Europe or the US will do. If you want to spread knowledge about Bitcoin, you have so many opportunities thanks to the Internet, don't expose yourself in the real world and pretend to be a financial advisor.",

If they always ask you about basic things which they can easily know if they just do a research then don't feed them the information since they cannot learn easily with that. If they get dismayed about what you tell them then they are not really worth your time since if they are interested to know more about crypto they do more effort by themselves to get other information to enhance their skills and learnings. But if they are their because they know they can earn and always after with money then for sure they provably will not last long because for sure their expectation might not meet in short period of time.",

So everyone no him for that in society, so with that knowledge people believe he have people  start coming to his side to help them invest in crypto and that is how it got start, so like 20 investors was under him with peace minds, but when people heard that market crash they start coming to him to withdraw their funds but it try to make them understand that is just a matter of time but don't gree.and with that he was frustrated by issue. From there people started describing as a bad person in society and call scammer, so with that he have sell most of his properties to pay those people back and get free from them.

They want to copy my trade but I’m not comfortable doing that since I ‘m taking risk for myself and I don’t want to be blame when they lose using my trading advice.
