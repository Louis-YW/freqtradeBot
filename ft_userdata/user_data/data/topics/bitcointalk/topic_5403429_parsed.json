NFT in a nutshell.Honestly, it's pretty cool to see that these large enterprises are able to come with something related to NFT giving the artist some credits for their hardwork, at least in blockchain. However, I am pretty sure that this function can't be accessed to an Adobe products bought in greymarket, no?Also, if this beta have been successfully integrated in Photoshop, it won't be surprising that they will do this for Premiere and Illustrator too!",

Is that what you are talking about?Quote from: Maus0728 on June 21, 2022, 11:56:59 AMHonestly, it's pretty cool to see that these large enterprises are able to come with something related to NFT giving the artist some credits for their hardwork, at least in blockchain. However, I am pretty sure that this function can't be accessed to an Adobe products bought in greymarket, no?I do believe that if you don't have a genuine Adobe Creative Cloud license, it wouldn't be available and definitely would affect your exportation or something if you were to try to do it. Quote from: Maus0728 on June 21, 2022, 11:56:59 AMAlso, if this beta have been successfully integrated in Photoshop, it won't be surprising that they will do this for Premiere and Illustrator too!I think it comes in all of the Adobe products. Hmmm. But I haven't tried to export it. For sure, you would be able to utilize it to its potential.",
