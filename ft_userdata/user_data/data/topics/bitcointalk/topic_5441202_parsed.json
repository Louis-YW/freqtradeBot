So this is entirely your fault and as we know Nigerians like taking advantage of every situation.",

When e been still soft I use the last 3k old currency wey been dey my wallet use buy soya and the aboki man collect although other places including taxi no dey collect. Most places I believe the old naira no get value again especuas Buhari been come out give order few days back.My own confusion be say, why dem go allow the old 200 hundred naira note dey circulate with the new 200 Naira. That money they confuse me die. Dem for just lock up make all the old naira currency go out of circulation, make we surfer am once and for all. Now how dem go do the old 200 Naira when dey wan stop him circulation. Person go come surfer this kind thing again wey be say you need use your money or e become worthless.",

I no dey harbour money for house before or like keeping cash, so d tin no really affect me even when the deadline been near. We for naija like doing tins at final minutes and e no make sense because na we go still dey suffer am pass. N300 suya given to you after paying N1000, omo dis is bad and e no make sense at all. Naija people always looking for way to extort their citizens, although I no too blame the aboki man too sha, what if him too no get who him go give or where to deposit for him.",

The thing be sae many people never know sae the federal government don talk sae the old naira notes don turn to legal tender as em be before and upon that em d very scarce join. But come to think of it, why you know follow others deposit the old naira notes when everyone dey rush deposit theirs? You get mind be that. Em be like sae you know sae federal government go later reconsider the old naira notes back. As em be now, I need the old naira notes badly. Running bank transfer and POS transactions don tire me cos I get so many hanging failed payments wey d debit me wey I need to rectify with the banks wey I d bank with. My matter with them no go be here cos em long",
