I have been really interested in cryptocurrency lately but had no single clue of how it really works.I then met with a friend, not just friend but a very long time friend, who have been thriving in the crypto space for guidance, and he kept giving me series of web links to go study and get back to him when done.This is one thing I'm not really good at, which is reading for long and even writing.I tried twice but couldn't and kept going back to him to just summarize everything and show me how to start making a living out of Bitcoin just as he was doing, but he kept referring me back to the links he sent and each time he did, I really feel bad and thought he never wanted to help me.Two months back I took the challenge and read all he gave to me and not just once but about thrice this time, got all I needed and went back to him, but on a different note and then he told me, \"WE DON'T CUT CORNERS, TO MAKING A LIVING GENUINELY.\" I felt that really hard and one thing he always kept singing was that I always buy Bitcoin at every opportunity that I have and today I'm so glad to announce that I was able to buy about $60 worth of Bitcoin, glad the journey of a thousand mile has began on the 28 of October 2022, And I hope it leads to greater opportunity in the industry, as I'm willing to learn ways.Please join me celebrate my little beginning as I hope to update the community about my progress.",

Bitcoin has been making lots of people happy since its inception.However, living out of bitcoin might be difficult from now on. I am not saying it is impossible but the growth may not make you that happy. Maybe you can double or triple your money but will that be enough for you? That would make lots of people happy but I am not sure about you.You should probably consider the other investment options too if you are aiming to get retired.If you are thinking about becoming a trader, then that's whole another story. The growth potential there is simply limitless.",

It's true for new people who have never buy Bitcoin before will feel excited, but you haven't hold until the bear market make the situation worst like the price is decreased for 50% from the beginning you bought.

This amount ain't little for someone who has been eagered on learning on how it goes and join us being one of the bitcoin holders.Just a little warning, holding bitcoin is addicting and I think that $60 will be soon added more by you as you think that the more you have, the better and not just holding but also buying.",

Your friend did great to involve you in the crpto space. You will need to keep your bitcoin save from hackers by learning how to store it in a cold storage wallet. If you have any challenge or issues on bitcoin, you should feel free to ask the forum members. When you have acquired more bitcoin and you want to trade,you should consider the know the risk management in trading. Bitcoin Holdings needs patient,you should also have it's volatile nature in mind so that if the price falls lower than this, you should not panic",

      "body": "This is your best step when you first buy Bitcoin which is quite large for you but some people are quite small because everyone always varies in investing Bitcoin in its value.Although this is a common purchase that many people make but you are expressing here as a start of the journey with Bitcoin and so on it may be possible to increase again or increase earnings in trading and also hold for the long term so I guess it depends on the ability how to allocate money into Bitcoin investment.Small celebrations will certainly be meaningful to you when you become big holding assets and this will be remembered in the future as the most beautiful memories that will not be forgotten.The advice above should be a step taken by securing Bitcoin assets in order to avoid a greater risk or being called hackers.",

It's also good that you've started with a fairly small amount, so that you don't risk what you can't afford to lose.Please listen to the points that were raised in the thread about safely storing your coins, though. I'd say the simplest safe solution would be Electrum wallet, but maybe you have other preferences.Also, it's worth thinking realistically about your investment (if that's how you view your BTC): you can have 3x profit, maybe even 10x in a few years, but even that would mean $600 instead of $60, which is good growth but often not even enough to cover monthly expenses if you need to rent accommodation. Bitcoin is interesting, and it has been growing in value over time, but it's not magic and not a solution to all financial issues.",

I know there are many of your type out there doing the same for the first time in their life. The experience is always fresh in the memory as it was the first time you ever did such a thing. I remember my first time of Bitcoin purchase that was years back. I initially was afraid so as not to fall victim or prey to scammers. I waited and waited sourcing for genuine site for purchase of Bitcoin until a friend whom I met long ago who was into Bitcoin and I had no idea. I told him about my discovery of Bitcoin and I am interested in it and I want to buy it he smiled at me and told me more about it there I realized he has been onboard the system for a long time. I trusted him so I gave him the money to purchase it which he did and transferred to my own private wallet. As at then I was so excited because it was my first time of purchasing Bitcoin as an enthusiast in the blockchain. I so much cherish that moment as it is still fresh in my memory. Currently now, anyone buying Bitcoin should be lucky and should find him or herself in a better position as the price is still down for a good purchase.",
