  "content": "First of all, are the centralized finances. We have discussed it in multiple threads about how KYC has not been able to solve many online illicit activities. I read a news today, this is what I found out again:Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-kyc-not-an-issue-as-99-have-nothing-to-hide-industry-execs-sayYim explained that even in traditional finance, where KYC measures are prominent, “there is still money laundering happening every day.”Even despite the rigorous KYC with the submission of identity card online copies, home addresses and the likes, online criminals are still able to do their work. Yet, it goes beyond that, some people can provide you with another person's identity card to be used online. Even if you are not careful, your identity documents can be used by hackers and scammers. Also how about your information that are sold or given to third party. Although, that is not the main discussion. The main discussion is about DeFi, which some people believe are decentralized. Okay, they are decentralized, let us leave that argument for now be in little centralized or not, what about the future of DeFi as more regulations are coming? QuoteDuring a panel session at the World of Web3 Summit (WOW) in Hong Kong on March 29, titled ‘Blockchain Security to Smart Compliance: AML & KYC Solutions in DeFi,’ industry leaders endorsed KYC in DeFi as a solution to tackle Anti-Money Laundering (AML) issues.Dyma Budorin, CEO of smart contract auditing firm Hacken, warned of the prevalence of tools readily available to hackers to “launder the money” stolen from DeFi platforms, which he described as the “biggest issue” in the industry.He explained that hackers can easily steal millions of dollars and launder the funds into various wallets – “to make clean money again” – making it difficult to track the source of the funds.“KYC is about transparency and accountability. I don’t think it’s an issue for a majority of people. I’m sure 99% of people don’t have things to hide. I’m happy to see it as part of our world.”This only means that you can be in control of your coins but you have to provide KYC before you can make use of those smart contract decentralized exchanges. Which means smart contract decentralized exchanges will begin to have privacy policies which is used in anything that is centralized, then becoming more centralized. QuoteYim cited the concept “anonymous traceable,” as an example of a balance between anonymity and compliance, as individuals can remain anonymous unless called upon by law enforcement – adding that it will protect the good people, while still getting the bad people.”What is the meaning of that? To remain anonymous unless the government wants to know you or looking for you? Anonymity is not like that, it has been twisted. You only remain anonymous when only you know that you are the one that is doing something, that thing can not be linked to you by anyone else. Once your identity can be linked to the government or anyone, that is no more anonymity. How bitcoin can be involvedI hope that bitcoin developers will not created anything related to smart contract that can lead to the existence of DeFi on bitcoin blockchain, if anything like that is created, more regulations in the future can make bitcoin to be centralized just like other altcoins.",

      "body": "You've made a good analysis however I do not believe that if DeFi and smart contracts (which are already coming to life thanks to Taproot) were introduced to Bitcoin, that every single smart contract/defi application would then require KYC because regulation says so. I don't believe that it's technically possible to enforce KYC across every single decentralized application and/or smart contract by default.Regulators and spokespeople have always said that they would introduce ridiculous measures. People have always digested the information that there is no other way outside of what they are saying...and yet, here we are. We still have privacy tools, we can still exchange and trade our coins without KYC, and there is always a counter-party who are working in the shadows to defend our freedoms. I believe that no matter what happens with Bitcoin, DeFi on Bitcoin and smart contracts, there will always be a way to maintain freedom and privacy.",

I'm generally in favour of KYC for big accounts and big transactions because big-scale money laundering is what should be the main target. If it's small transactions, does it really matter where the money is coming from and whether it was taxed? More importantly, it's not realistic and not very productive to focus on so many people when you can instead try focusing on the big guys. So an approach that requires KYC when a certain financial threshold that the majority doesn't pass is reached and/or when there is a decision of the law enforcement (as the op notes) or suspicious activity was noticed.Bitcoin itself is safe, though. It's more about additional projects and services, which one can choose to avoid.",

I don't think achieving total privacy is possible considering some other countries requires you to provide KYC for their very own service providers (wallets), just like the case here in my country. Yes, we have freedom in terms of doing transactions outside our wallets, but once it goes inside our own wallet provided locally, the whole story changes. Whether we like it or not, we couldn't take our money outside or transfer it not unless we provide personal information for verification, the worst part is that, now it has been slowly implemented that whenever you try to transfer crypto from external sources, they will ask you for what purpose, where it came from and how much you are going to send/receive.I'm not totally against being verified and doing KYC since I am not doing something illegal, but that's the whole point of someone who's against KYC.",

The ability to make tokens on Ethereum (and other L1's) has turned the whole smart contract industry into a gambling endeavor. I don't ever see this coming to Bitcoin, at least not on-chain. The fact that Bitcoin doesn't have tokens shields Bitcoin from all this crap. The ability to make tokens is kind of ruining the smart contract world. If it was just making apps with ETH that would be interesting, but every app is now just a token scheme which turns into a pump and dump. Apps and tokens and such things will remain on Bitcoin as side chains and other layers. Bitcoin's on-chain programmability will continue to increase I think but I don't think it'll ever get to the point of Turing completeness to allow anything to be built on-chain.",

BTC is called the \"only true decentralized network\" for a reason.I know BTC does not have features like yield farming, staking, smart contracts, lending platforms, etc, but it does not need it, its algorithm is pow, and some of these features are only better on pos networks, maybe that is part of the reasons why eth moved to a pos network. Many of these dapps leave their network open for hackers and scammers, so BTC does not need them, there are good decentralized exchanges like Bisq and the pow algorithm has provided enough security for the BTC network, so i don't believe any of these 'defi' protocols will be added to BTC's network.",

      "body": "You said, BTC should not come up with DeFi as I know Defi And Decentralization has a different meaning but have some similarities too. Both tend to provide total anonymity but which is more trustable and old? is BTC. Just like Ethereum is based on POS and any app or technology of finance based on it has finally met regulatory authorities to prove their identities and i think that is good for BTC until BTC is not being used as a base to launch coins on it. which i think is becoming possible with the new technologies of taproot like these. Now if we talk about the users of BTC who are making trades in it like the ones who buys and sells it. Do they care about doing KYC in order to perform transactional activities on BTC? like from the stats I can see not, the trading volume of 408 decentralized crypto exchanges is $2.43 Billion while the trading volume on Centralized exchange is $56 Billion. As these numbers are showing that, people do not care about doing KYC or hiding their identities. Now if new coins are going to use the BTC blockchain then what will the impact of tokens based on POW consensus make on coins based on POS consensus? if BTC goes towards DeFi, it will become centralized (like will be criticized) well, it is decentralized and it is being criticized by authorities but authorities are using loopholes just like a political person, they try to target people using the hacks, events of money laundering, etc. to scare them from the use of BTC. overall, the decentralization of BTC depends on proof of work, like until anyone joins the mining of BTC with anonymity then it's safe. But the question is does the identity of BTC miners are safe? I don't think so.From my perspective, I can say if BTC approaches towards DeFi then people are not going to care about the KYC problem if it happens then we are going to see too many regulatory bans as the authorities are implementing currently on DeFi technologies and still they say BTC is the root problem.",

True, regulations offer user protection and hinder criminal activities, but excessive control undermines decentralization and privacy - DeFi's fundamental tenets. Striking equilibrium between compliance and anonymity is imperative to shield both virtuous and nefarious actors.Bitcoin's potential DeFi integration, though feasible via smart contracts on its blockchain, mandates developers preserve its decentralized essence.

While there is debate around the degree of decentralization in DeFi, it is clear that the technology is disrupting traditional financial systems and providing new opportunities for innovation and investment. However, with increasing mainstream adoption and attention comes the possibility of regulation, which could have a significant impact on the future of DeFi.From one perspective, regulation can help legitimize and stabilize markets, leading to greater investment and adoption. It can also provide a framework for addressing issues around scams, scams, and other risks associated with DeFi. On the other hand, excessive regulation can stifle innovation and limit the potential benefits of decentralized finance. It could also lead to a shift towards a more centralized structure, undermining core DeFi principles.I think it is important here to approach problems with an open mind and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.",
