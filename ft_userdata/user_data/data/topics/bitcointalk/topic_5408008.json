So I don't see any cuteness in anything now.QuoteAnd even third time can be same scheme becouse older generation dont teach younger generation Do you already have an idea to teach the younger generation from now on? if so, where did you start to teach the younger generation?",

But the world has changed a lot in the last hundred years and I would not directly call the current situation the Great Depression Two.I agree, there's no put of comparison, the Great Depression what very different from what we are seeing right now. It all started with the fall of stocks and then bank runs.In any case, there are lessons to learn that time, that can be applicable to the current situation that we are in. Recession, the war, sinking economy. Nevertheless, as our grand fathers survived during that time, and so we are in 2022 up to the next 10 years.",
