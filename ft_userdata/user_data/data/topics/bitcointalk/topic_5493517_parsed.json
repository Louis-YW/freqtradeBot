Are you being tasked to endorse that link or you just wanted to randomly post that everywhere? Anyway to op there’s lots of messaging apps these days that have end to end encryption and you can send voice messages as well. If it’s call you want then I’d say pretty much any application will be safe with calls",

A and B talking, with C knowing fuck-all.What would you say is the most safe tool to use if I want to communicate sensitive information to someone with my voice?This thread can also serve as discussion for best practices when verbally communicating bitcoin.~bestIf the communication is somewhat asynchronous, you could get away with recording your voice, encrypting the file, and sending that.Of course it is not super practical for a one to one communication. In that case, the best is to go to somewhere private, or where there probably isn't any device spying on you, say for example take a hike to a national park, or in the middle of a forest.But the best of all is to not say you own Bitcoin.",

A and B talking, with C knowing fuck-all.What would you say is the most safe tool to use if I want to communicate sensitive information to someone with my voice?To start your communication about Bitcoin, keep it simple like you are talking to kids.Use simple examples to describe about Bitcoin, its blockchain and use cases.

But, telegram is not bad if you want to send voice messages. But, if you want to frequently write text messages, you may try PGP encryption if you want. You can encrypt voice files as well if you want. I have a couple of tutorials about PGP encryptions and one of them has over twelve translations. You can check [Android Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message and this thread is available in 12 more languages. You can also check the Windows version Re: [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message - Fingerprint and for Linux as well [Eng: Tutorial] PGP Signature - Encrypt/Decrypt message (Linux Only)",

      "body": "If you're worried that you might divulge information that can lead you to be a victim of social engineering, probably the best thing that you can do in my opinion is to shut the fuck up about bitcoin all the time, don't let people know that you've got bitcoin or that you're invested in cryptocurrency without you knowingly giving away the fact that you're invested in bitcoin, that's the best practice. Keep a low profile and make it look like you're not invested in anything and you're also going to have to deal with people that will talk first about their investments, remember to not falter and do some kind of stupid thing like also sharing the moment that they share their story, confirm that they're invested in it and even at the point that you confirm it, it's probably best that you don't tell the whole truth, it would also help that you don't carry all your bitcoin in just one wallet so you avoid losing everything once one of your wallet gets compromised.",
