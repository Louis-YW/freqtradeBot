      "body": "The site is more similar to the crypto hyip projects that were popular at the time, offering a high percentage by attracting new investors, apparently for this purpose the creators used the name of a popular miner.To be honest, I have already thoroughly forgotten the topic of such pyramids, but after looking at the site I remembered those times. The Twitter account of the project is designated as joined in 2015, and the first tweet was made on July 22, 2023. I would recommend treating this cloud mining very carefully, as well as other companies of this kind, otherwise you will simply lose your time and money.",

No legit business could offer that kind of ROI. Since scams are not moderated here, I doubt that mods will delete this topic (unless maybe on the grounds being in a wrong board).",

You can see that According to the latest financial report of MINING COMPANY SERVICE LTD, (again, this does not mean at all what is it about cgmdminer.com ) presented on 2021.03.31, the company has cash in the amount of £2,790.00, total assets in the amount of £100,275.00 working capital is £1,638.00 Compared to the previous year, the company reported a decrease in cash by -1349.35%, total assets decreased by -26.37%. So the profit calculator is on the site cgmdminer.com it is made simply to mislead and in no way reflects the financial capabilities of the company itself.https://uk.globaldatabase.com/company/mining-company-service-ltd",

Therefore, this project is not cloud mining, but Ponzi/HYIP.Yes, what you say is completely correct. I have tried cloud mining previously. They do not give a fixed percentage or a fixed income, but rather they give you profits (fake, of course) according to the hash power you buy.Previously, in my beginning, I purchased hash power for Bitcoin mining from the cloud mining site \"genesis-mining\", and they gave me decreasing profits every day until they became 0 because of their claim that the difficulty of mining increases and the profits decrease. In the end, I was not able to recover the capital.",

If it doesn't harm your privacy, post the transaction ID and we may help you trace it. If your coins reach a central service and local laws are cooperative, you may be able to freeze or recover your money (you don't have a good chance, but it's okay to try).",

Because simply put cloud minings are 90% scam. If you find a legit one (since there is) it doesn't mean you can make profit too fast, they have calculator on what month you can ROI not just in 3-7 days.",
