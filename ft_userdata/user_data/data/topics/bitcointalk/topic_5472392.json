  "content": "Hi everyone,I've been experimenting with deriving a Taproot Bech32m address using Bitcoin Core 0.22.1 and noticed something interesting. It seems that Blockstream's explorer on testnet3 is still displaying addresses in the Bech32 format.I sent a transaction earlier today to fund the wallet for testing the preimage condition.Bech32m Transaction:However, when I checked the transaction on Blockstream's explorer, the address was shown in the Bech32 format.Blockstream Explorer (Bech32):I understand that updating explorers might not be the top priority, and I'm not raising this as a complaint. I used to run my own block explorer in the past, but lately, I've been using online services for convenience.I'm curious about how the Taproot rollout has been going overall. I'm genuinely impressed with the careful thought, planning, and execution behind it. Taproot seems like one of the most significant changes I've witnessed in Bitcoin, and I'm just starting to explore the exciting possibilities it brings with its added functionality and privacy features.Would love to hear your thoughts and experiences with the Taproot upgrade.",

      "body": "Hello everyone,Sorry for the delay. I was away for a few days. Thank you for your  observations and clarifications. You're correct of course, and I appreciate the insight provided here. It seems I had mixed up the encoding formats. Your detailed responses have helped clarify the matter.Finding a suitable Bech32m library indeed presented a challenge, prompting me to improvise a bit by hardcoding the Bech32m constants into the existing Bech32 encoding scheme. It's a workaround, but it served the purpose for the task at hand. I've added a collection of tools to a GitHub repository which allows users to generate a Taproot address, tweak public keys, and set spending conditions.For anyone interested( I hope useful to some folks) https://github.com/test-sum/taproot-tools",
