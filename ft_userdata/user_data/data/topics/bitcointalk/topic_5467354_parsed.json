The only thing that will happen is you will indeed be able to import the wallet or open the wallet but you cannot sell or transfer the token (airdrop) and if you did sent ETH for example to the wallet then the scammer will transfer it to their wallet right away and the next thing you see is there is no balance left. Anyway, that kind of scheme is already known by most people but thanks for sharing for others to know as there might be someone who doesn't know about this scheme.",

      "body": "Airdrops are means by which scams  take place. Most airdrops received are basically from hackers who accessed people details as a result of their hack. It is not advisable to use your main email for most online crypto stuffs because you never can tell when they will carry out their acts. Most at times, they send malware with airdrop links for their victims to click and fall prey of their act. Once clicked they infiltrates their victims details and use it to take their assets and funds. Aside that, your social media accounts too can be porous because they would definitely send you link to click there and if care is not taken and unknown to you you click them you can be hacked and your account taken over and used for ill act by scammers. So one would need to be very careful how they click links they see in their message box.",

Once many people get a few token they tend to focus on that project and this way some could even invest into it. This way the community of the project increases. This was the aim of airdrops during the early days of cryptocurrency but right now this airdrops are strategies by scanners to get into once wallet. Immediately an airdrop demands purchasing gas fee then it is likely a scam. Another is the linking of once wallet directly to the site of the project doing the airdrop.",

The easiest way is to send a mass email offering the promise of free profits, then they will ask for a certain amount of funds to be transferred or worse, they will send a phishing web address. I am quite careful in reading emails, if it provides an offer with big profits and is not logical then I will ignore it.I think the era of altcoins is over, although there are some airdrops that provide tokens for free and have high prices such as uniswap and sui, but they are very rare. I don't want to expect much from the airdrop",

And it cannot be denied that this is still happening today so we need to provide a better understanding for beginners in terms of entrusting airdrops or messages about airdrops that come in via their email messages.I will not blame airdrops completely for this kind of event because of the many airdrops there are definitely still genuine ones like those made by well-known exchanges now. But because there are now more and more airdrop makers and most of them were deliberately created by irresponsible developers. So we airdrop lovers really need to be careful about this because fraudsters will never stop making traps for everyone through anything, including through airdrops.",
