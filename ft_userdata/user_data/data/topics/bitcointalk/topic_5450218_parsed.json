Please do not post consecutively more than once in a 24 hour period. If you want to reply to multiple posts, edit your previous post and put everything in one post.To reply to this thread, the idea is good but it is only good for the purpose of tracking data, as you said. Any speculation or trading is illogical. On the other hand, a betting/prediction system surrounding the NFTs and their data (i.e. predicting the evolution of a brand/make/model, its value, future data, etc) might be something that could add a monetary aspect in a logical way. Liquidity of the NFTs themselves on the other hand, that's something that you could only make successful with a very large amount of initial liquidity to distribute across all of the NFTs that you are using to track data. Another question is, if the NFTs are meant for tracking data, then how are they actually distributed? Following this, if they are distributed, then what purpose would there be in distributing them and holding them?",

The carbon footprint of a car is dependent on various factors such as its age, mileage, and average fuel consumption. By estimating the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that a car would produce over the next ten years, we can determine its overall impact on the environment. It's important to note that burning 1 liter of fuel results in the emission of 2.3 kilograms of carbon. Hence, we calculate the car's current carbon emissions and make projections for the next 10 years. Because the car has been scrapped, future carbon emissions has removed. What is the better way of removing all the high pollution cars from the city areas?",

I'm not talking about the environmental benefit because it's here and without your NFT. I say why worthless NFT would convince me.And if you want to say it's not worthless, then tell me what will give it value.The main challenge we face is how to effectively remove highly polluting cars from our cities, as following the government's current plan will result in millions of these cars still on the road by 2040.Personally, I have committed to using up to 1% of our trading profits to buy back high-pollution cars and transform them into NFTs to address this issue. This approach has the potential to be highly effective, and investing in NFTCar NFTs with prices lower than APEs could be a more sensible option. I believe that buying back and transforming high-pollution cars into NFTs presents a promising solution to the issue of air pollution in our cities.I haven't bought APS-s, but I would love to trade those types of NFTs. With our NFTs, carbon reduction is 100% verifiable. Each NFT marks the removal of 1 ton of CO2 at the cost of 80 USD per ton.  Each NFT is tied to a specific car through its VIN for verification.Today there are billion spent to fight climate change, but nowhere can you follow the trace of spending or calculate real CO2 reduction. 90% of climate change-related projects are just scams as well.  I think that is kind of attractive for all the trading communities of the future. So, in the end, we need some solution to rely on and something we can verify.",

It’s effect won’t be much. I’m not sure if this project is promote the pollution free mining or is it self contained project to drive NFT sells through carbon emission free technique. But yes, this is good initiative. However roadmap needs to be Far clearer than this post. We can have excellent projects like this but again there are few posts above me which are reasonable one. How do we know it’s carbon emissions free?",
