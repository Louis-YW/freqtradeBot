Agreed with you and their is always some degree of uncertainty and doubt but with good background and proper roadmap, a project can convince its users to stay for long run and this could create more opportunity for so many users. In Africunia project they already set a good example in financial sector by spending large sum of 5 years and now with their AFCASH token they are getting much support form community. That's how you get a good mark.",
