  "content": "Hello everybody,I am a newbie member of bitcointalk forum. I want to share with you the story of how my life has changed because of Bitcoin. I think this story inspires some of you who are still hesitant about Bitcoin.I live in Bangladesh, a country with a very poor economy and bitcoin banned. I am a teacher in a local school. I earn a small amount of money which ends up covering my household expenses. I had no savings, no investments, no hope for the future.One day, I came to know about Bitcoin from one of my elder brothers. He said, Bitcoin is a digital currency that was coined by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009 and Bitcoin can be traded online. He also said that the supply of bitcoins is limited. There is only a supply of 21 million bitcoins, and this causes the price of bitcoin to increase over time.I decided to learn more about Bitcoin after listening to his words. I found this Bitcointalk forum after searching on YouTube & Google. From here I have read many posts about Bitcoin which explain the basics of Bitcoin. I was surprised by the demand for Bitcoin. I then decided to buy some bitcoins with a small portion of my salary.I bought 0.01 BTC with 10000 BDT from Binance Exchange in September 2020. 1 BTC cost about 1 million BDT then. I stored my bitcoins in a secure wallet that I controlled myself. I didn't tell anyone about my Bitcoin trading because I was afraid of being scammed or hacked.I continued to buy some more bitcoins with some of my salary every month.I learned how to use bitcoin better, like using different wallets when making transactions, using VPN to protect my private information and using a hardware wallet to store my bitcoins offline. I became more familiar with Bitcoin.At one point I noticed that the price of Bitcoin was constantly rising. Bitcoin price reached 2 million BDT in December 2020, 4 million BDT in March 2021, 8 million BDT in June 2021 and 16 million BDT in September 2021. I was once again surprised by the demand for Bitcoin transactions. My 0.01 BTC is now worth 160,000 BDT, 16 times the price of Bitcoin in one year!I realized that Bitcoin is not only a digital currency, but it can create financial freedom for many more poor people like me. I decided to buy some more bitcoins and I will make my life better and more comfortable. I quit my teaching job and started working an online freelancer so that I can earn more. I bought myself a new laptop, a smartphone and a computer. I helped the poor with some expenses and loans.I still have some bitcoins in my wallet, which I plan to keep for a long time. I believe the price of Bitcoin will increase further in the future and the demand for Bitcoin will increase. There are other aspects of Bitcoin such as: Mining, Lightning Network, Smart Contracts, etc. I want to learn more about and contribute to the development of Bitcoin.Bitcoin has changed my life a lot and I want to express my gratitude to Bitcoin. I would also like to thank this Bitcointalk forum for providing a lot of important information about Bitcoin. Give Bitcoin a try, Bitcoin will surely change your life too.Thank you for reading my life story and have a good day!",

As you mentioned, Bitcoin has the potential to change lives by growing in value over time. That's why it's recommended to hold onto it until a bull market and then sell to make a profit. Many people miss out on this opportunity for various reasons. However, I believe that as Bitcoin adoption continues to rise, more people will realize its power and embrace it.Quote from: Spark22 on September 30, 2023, 04:36:32 PMI didn't tell anyone about my Bitcoin trading because I was afraid of being scammed or hacked.There's nothing bad in telling others about your Bitcoin investment. As you will also be helping to facilitate Bitcoins adoption. The only thing that can expose you to scam or hack, is if you are unable to keep you keys safe and away from the internet.",

However, as much as it is really inspiring for people to read this and try Bitcoin I'm sure there are other platforms you can share this to in order to encourage anyone to give Bitcoin a try as I am sure almost everyone in this forum are already using Bitcoin. However, I am not one to rain on someone else's parade hence I am wholehheartedly happy to know the positive changes that has happened to you.",

Let's use USD dollars to profit multiplier, You said that you purchase Bitcoin during September 2020 which according to the graph is 10K will be your lowest buy price at that time. Assuming you take profit on all time high which is 67k will give you an ROI equals to only x6.7 of your investment and not x16 which you are claiming.During ATH, your 0.01BTC is 670$ which I'm not sure if sufficient to purchase all the things that you listed above including giving loans.Are you sure about your purchase date? But this amount is really huge for people that lives on a 3rd world country like me. Good for you to have this kind of Bitcoin experience even though you invest only 3 years ago.",

Reading stories of how Bitcoin has impacted positively on the life of individuals give me great joy. It also serves as a source of confidence for newbies to keep believing in Bitcoin even in the face of fear and uncertainty.  I am also pleased that you have the zeal to learn about Bitcoin in this forum. It also amazes me that you have been visiting the forum for the past three years and failed to open an account. Why the sudden change of mind after these years? Nevertheless, I wish you all the best as we learn and contribute to this community.",

By keeping it a secret without telling anyone, it is a good step for you to take because privacy needs to be maintained.Keeping bitcoin transactions and purchases secret is the same as keeping other people from identifying our bitcoin address. If the public already knows our bitcoin address, privacy could be threatened.Congratulations to those of you who have experienced change because of Bitcoin. Hopefully your inspiring story can happen to me someday as I am currently walking along the road to bitcoin freedom.",

Good for you to have this kind of Bitcoin experience even though you invest only 3 years ago.After reading the OP's post-history, I'm beginning to suspect the entire story. If someone has some Bitcoins in their wallet and has been on this forum for more than two years, he or she should know that bounties are not profitable enough, and for the OP to start applying for bounties, this shows that he did not hold such an amount of Bitcoin in his wallet, and the loans he claimed to have been given may also be faked.Nonetheless, learning about and investing in Bitcoin is beneficial since it provides us with financial freedom. When we invest in Bitcoin, we have the potential to profit in the future since it has a clear future and is a transparent currency that is decentralized, which means that the government cannot control your Bitcoin in the same way that other financial institutions do with fiat currencies.",

I did too many things when I joined crypto especially investing in bitcoin! I've lost a lot of money! Then I realized whether I would leave this or continue it but for the better.So I kept going. Most of the time now I invest heavily and just survive. Just put in bitcoins that you have researched and trust then Invest in them and away you go. I invest every week because I do the DCA strategy, regardless of the downturn. Dollar-cost averaging is real. HODLing is right and must be done because soon we will have a Bitcoin Halving!

And I guess everyone's life here that has been touch by bitcoin has someone change, we become financially freedom, although some of us here could still be un-banked, but that's why bitcoin or to some extend some crypto's are here for that purpose. I just want to reiterate though that we shouldn't take advantage because of the profits that we are getting. Still we have to diversify to other investment as well so that we can built wealth continuously.",

I think that there is a chance to get some profit out of btc savings in a couple of years. Moreover, in case of dollar (or other fiat) inflation there is a chance to save the invested money (however, its just a chance, not guarantee)...",

You’re trying to create copies of yourself that might teach your children tomorrow.Even still, the teaching job can’t effectively have much defect on your online activities and awareness. You’re still going to create time to attend to that.Surely you know what’s best for you but, I don’t so much like the idea of having to quit a job to be more engaged online.",
