See am as he talk Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on August 11, 2023, 08:10:42 PMBefore I begin congratulate everybody I want to clear the board that the board don't have a merit source. I wasn't assigned as the merit source for this board so before you think I'm obligated to the board use ur head again. We need to go to meta and support every merit source application as in all e benefits the boards as those appointed to oversee the board will be obligated to distribute merits in discussion, I 'mostly' focused only on topics as that's what starts a quality conversation. Na e make other of our other oga them like Charles-Tim, Igebotz de try apply for merit source so we go get our own merit source for here and so merit no go too dey scares for our Nija board. If you observe some other local board, them members dey always get merit Wella because Dem get merit source. The other way too be say we fit help our self, no be only meirt source go fit help. If you come across any post wey make sense Wella and u know say e deserve merit just drop if at all, this one go help that person motivate am to do more better for we local board. Quote from: Onyeeze on September 02, 2023, 07:43:50 PM~As of this issue of pidgin or English, Dem don first settle am for before @Onyeeze. our people dem dey fit speak both English join pidgin sometimes sef we fit mix the two. As long as you dey understand watin the person the relate that wan no fit be issue na. Sometime e fit get thread wey person go wan make and to am pidgin no go sharp so e go decide to leave am for English. And if some people wan reply them go also love to use English. So e go depend on their choice.",

Why is it that when people tell someone the truth, they get angry? Please, because I go like someone to tell me why oh? Because can you @ O.P point just one statement which Charles Tim said that is false (i.e I mean just only one). Because truly for this forum, he sabi pass you by far, he has been here for many years & you are just few months old here. So the attack you just made was not necessary my guy. Because I swear to God if someone had told me earlier before now that you are a Nigerian, I no for believe, because from your post history, it shows no sign of you being a Nigerian, which if someone had pointed that out, it's left for you to have accepted the fact and try to improve next time by making yourself known among your brothers & sisters, than arguing. Because base on this, I just made small digging into your account now and saw that you made just only 3 post since January till this date on Naija local board (i.e 2 in January & 1 in February) and that was the end until this very moment, as shown below,Quote from: Onyeeze on February 07, 2023, 10:13:55 AMSince 2015 another party called all progressive congress take over power things have not be going well for our country Nigerian, the statistics shown that since 2018 we have experience hardship.2018 /2019 = coronaviru2020 / 2021 = End SARS2022/2023 = fuel scarcity / bank, POS challenges due to implementation of new currency.So abeg, what we need here is a united Naija local board, and as such, let's not forget to give respect to whom respect is due, because if not for senior men like Brainboss, Igebotz and Charles Tim, I no dey sure say we for get this small spot wey we fit call our own for this forum, and they deserves our maximum respect.

Well educated people educated people can't be idle. And I am very happy that we have Charles-Tim, Igebotz, Brainboss, Smartvirus, Davidvictorson, Abdico, Zlantan, Agbe, P P, Santoprinces Wiwo and others. And if you look at these senior men which I mentioned just know dem dey respect themselves and others in the local board and the forum at large. And if Charles-Tim sae something wey u no like there is a way u go address di issue because if care is not taking, im fit senior u for real life and also in di forum. Really I no like di way u insult am at all. And weti im tell you na di truth,  and me I strongly believe that you be senior man alt. If not u no go get dis kind liver like dis. If you are looking for help in di local board, it is very easy, you just need to create a quality threads and definitely even Charles-Tim will give you Merit, I have seen him given merits to people in dis local board time without number. Let me tell one thing, in my field of study, I understand body language very well. Dis thing you just displayed here is not only you but from a group people displaying their displeasure on Charles-Tim and you pick up the challenge to confront im. Let me give you story again since you are a Senior Member behind the bar. Someone in the Russian Board was also posting like you and a legendary  and reputable member in the board brother him to Meta and create a thread for im and finally di guy was given a red light and di forum show im di way out. I know dey tok sae dem go do u but I just dey give an instance. And weti you do, I know like am. Please make we dey respect di elders. Na dis kind things dey pain Bitcoingirl-club. Nai make im dey have disagreement with JG and others. Please let us be one, if you hurt one, you hurt all. I know u have supportace but even at dat let love rule.  You have to wear thick skin because definitely attacks must come. And what you said, will never reduce di attacked that are coming. You just have to wear thick skin. Please learn from experience Users.",

OP, your matter no bad o but dat one no matter now for this local board. Since dem say dey don already debate am before for the local board on which language dem go dey use for here and dem go mostly for both pidgin and English. Make e just be like dat for now. Me I know many people for dis our same naija wey no fit communicate for pidgin even if dem dey understand wetin dem dey yarn. The main tin na him be say make d person wey dem dey follow talk understand wetin dem dey yarn am.QuoteAnother tin wey dey important we wey b naija people suppose dey do, na to help our country people make dem grow becuz na una people go still help dem to grow, we no go expect make person wey from another country dey carry una brothers and sisters along, make una dey try dey show love the wey brainboss dey show people love for the community, make una know sey injury to one is injury to all, and when we urinate together it will come outside foam.E no really mean say na person wey dey same local board with you go help you grow for forum. People dey comment and contribute for different boards, so dem fit get help to move up for d forum from outside. For dis local board, na only one merit source dey and e no dey really help our members for here grow like others. I believe say if we get more, the help wey you dey talk go come if you continue dey contribute for the local board wella like odas.",
