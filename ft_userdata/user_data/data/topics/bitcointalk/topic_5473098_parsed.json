  "content": "Will it Hold? BTC Targets $40,000When you check the October 2023 Non-Farm Payroll data you will notice Without a doubt, the bulls continue to dominate the market as the Bitcoin price surged to a new annual high of $35,400. Given that Bitcoin miners control 10% of the total BTC in circulation, their trading actions have an impact on the BTC price.  Indicators presently suggest that BTC miners have adopted a bullish attitude during the week, and if they continue to accumulate rewards, we might witness further gains up to $40,000.Secondly, Sources from IntoTheBlock shows the demand for Bitcoin has exceeded supply judging from the data available at the aggregate order books https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/BTC/deep-dive?group=exchanges&subgroup=order-books&chart=all. If this holds through then we expect the market for this week to remain bullish. However, there may be little contrary arguments.A critical point to note is that everything being equal BTC price may likely defend the $33,500 - $34,500 zone and prevent bearish reversal.I did my analysis on a weekly based and it may be subject to my bias. Feel free to contribute and possible show areas that are worthy to note.",

If you have money available, you should focus on buying Bitcoin and HODLing as these prices will never be available again in the future.",

Anyways, $40k is not such a huge gap from where price is at present because I remember of recent when Bitcoin gained by over $5k in about 24 hours. With Bitcoin, nothing is impossible because the volatility is high. I am actually projecting something close to the ATH or at least $45k before the end of the year. This is because next year's bull run may actually be more explosive than previous ones so thus year will set the stage. While we are also looking at the price, let's endeavour to accumulate as much as we can as we approach the end of the year.",

We are not in the bull season and there's no need to get my hopes high. About hitting the $40k in November or December? Very likely, I think if any of the Bitcoin spot ETF gets listed, this is very feasible and we may even get to see $45k or $50k.",

He put some numbers in their based on the past historical logs, you might want to check it out. And see if it matches your prediction and others members.And as you have said, we need to continue to accumulate, just to be ready for the next block halving and the bull run next year.",

BTC Targets $40,000Although the future market of Bitcoin cannot be said with 100% guarantee that the price will increase or decrease. But my question is here why the target is only 40k for bitcoin?Still if I have to say I don't think it will touch 40k anytime soon as bitcoin halving is still some time away. Moreover, Bitcoin price recovery will start after the end of the halving season in my opinion. It is true that miners control 10% of Bitcoin's circulation, but I don't think there has been any situation yet that the market will be bullish and touch 40k due to the attitude of miners. I think that the current pump of Bitcoin is temporary. Maybe we will see Bitcoin price below 30k or around 30k again. So my suggestion would be to start holding for long-term without keeping 40k as target.",

I predict that Bitcoin will reach as high as $40,000 this year, and even as high as $45,000 though this is just me being too optimistic with Bitcoin a few months before the halving happens.One big news, and it might push it's price even higher. That's what I'm thinking right now. We didn't even know that the \"TICKER SYMBOL\" thing will happen, and it pushed it's price upwards. I don't know what can cause Bitcoin to reach $40,000 right now, but maybe something ETF related might do it. Overall, this is just a prediction, and we can't predict the market with 100% accuracy.Just continue on what you're doing. If you're doing DCA, continue doing it. If you want to buy at once, do it. If you are just waiting for the bull run to happen so you can sell your assets, do it. As for me, I'm just waiting for the bull run to happen so I can sell all of my assets already.",

And it seems just like any other resistance, it seems to be very difficult for now to breach it unless we have significant good and positive news in the market.So for now, it's hard to say at least that we will go to $40k.We might be seeing another sideways patterns that we are more familiar with as we have it in the last 6 months or so.",

The weekly RSI is above 70, which indicates that Bitcoin is overbought. This could lead to a short-term correction, but the overall trend remains bullish. The MACD is crossing above the signal line, which is another bullish signal. The 200-week moving average is at $31,500, which is a key support level. I think that Bitcoin is well-positioned to continue its rally towards $40,000 in the coming weeks.
