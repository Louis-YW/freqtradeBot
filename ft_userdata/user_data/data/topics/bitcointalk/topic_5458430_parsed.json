If you gamble 3-4 days a week and can control yourself well, you are not one of the ordinary guys. In my case, I like gamble more than anything. I was trying to gamble as a major income but failed again and again. That's why I decide to stream every gambling thing about myself. Hope this is the way to pull me out the hell.

They are more men and boys in gambling, but It is not only boys who gamble and go on to become addicted to gambling, there are women who are active gamblers and are having a difficult time stopping because they have been addicted for a long time. To make things worse for them, they find it difficult to seek help because of how they can be seen as irresponsible if they speak to people about it.Quote from: kk5526682 on July 03, 2023, 12:18:54 PMEven you can talk to me.

Sorry what did you mean?If you know gambling is only for fun, you don't need to quit because you wouldn't become an addict or ruin your life to gamble most of your money to get profit.The problem of why people should temporary quit from gambling is when they gamble in order to make more money. But gambling is full of luck and there's a house edge, you will high likely lose and the house will high likely become the winner.",

But some people are addicts to the extent gambling become a problem in their lives, which supposed not to be like that.In the beginning and for the first step in the experiment, indeed everyone aims only to fill spare time when they are bored and relieve stress due to work, but it cannot be denied that addiction can come at any time. I think addiction or not depends on each person's personality, if they have a weak mentality or are easily provoked it is very likely for them to be in the addiction stage. I hope someone doesn't take gambling too seriously because yes we know big risks will come to him. Initially they only spent 5% of their salary to gamble, if they are already in the addiction stage, it is very likely that one day they will spend all their income just to gamble and they cannot enjoy the results of their own salary.Quote from: Oshosondy on July 03, 2023, 12:30:54 PMWhy? I can advice only addicts and punters that are not gambling responsibly to quite. It would be very accurate to say that it is not easy for a gambling addict to quit, only he himself can agree with himself not to do it again. Even though on the other hand it is very difficult to stop but I think it is possible to reduce it. If indeed there is someone who can help me to stop completely please tell me what steps should I take first.",

That's all I want.I understand that even smile can be a therapy to heal someone but that is not just smile that will do the remedy or magic but it involves other support given to the person. My point is support to a gambling addict involves physical help like as I have mentioned earlier which will make the addict refrain from the act, like if you restrict his movements, seize his phone which is easily done through the wife, family relatives or friends. Even a mad man can be resuscitated if you limit him by moving out like quarantining him and make sure he heeds to the medication routine.But only sending instructions through YouTube streaming on how to stop addiction do not produce the physical help needed if there is nobody to support.",

Because you need to rehab yourself when that's the case, but if you're not at the level of being an addict, it's easy to get out of there for sure.Some habits were not easy to do without especially when they have escalated beyond the gambler's control himself, people begin to see other side of him and he himself couldn't do anything in control of the consequences because it has turn addiction, let's be very careful with the knowing those whom we are standing with.",

Gambling is something that does not stand in the middle, what I mean is that in gambling there are only 2 possibilities, winning and losing. and of the two choices, defeat is something that has the greatest chance.",
