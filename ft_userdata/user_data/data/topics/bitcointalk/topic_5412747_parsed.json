I ask how is this done that it is that easy and everyone here is not yet made. Come of it and be useful to yourself. Cryptocurrency can only give you the opportunity to create wealth if you take the right investment chances and not investing in shit projects that you never get to make any profit until the coin is delisted from an exchange   Coins can be delisted especially shit projects and you lose all your investment. Also you can invest in certain project yet you don't benefit from it . Be wise and don't only think of crypto as secured.",

But there is nothing you can do if you fall into the fraud circle yourself. In fact, you may know that no third party has a hand in this crypto currency. So if the person you deal with here is trusted then you will never get cheated. But these crypto currencies can be scams, especially if you are investing somewhere you should be aware of them.Because this cryptocurrency has not yet been validated by all countries. So there is nothing you can do if you get scammed by investing there. And no one can pay the security of that invested money. And no one will take responsibility for it. In a word, there is no security in invested money. So invest carefully before investing. You will get your security in that",

You certainly can't say that to someone who lost all of their money trading bitcoin or any other shitcoin, or to someone who took a loan to purchase bitcoin at its peak before subsequently selling it at a significant loss.Sure some of them are thankful, but also some of them hates for what crypto does to them.The truth is that everyone has his own side of the story, some get in on a smooth ground while others learnt their lesson the hard ways, but we should never forget that life still continue but the worst that could ever happen to someone in crypto is when the same mistakes repeated itself over such user the second time, and there's nothing to use in avoiding making mistakes in cryptocurrency than when you sit down all by yourself and begin to learn and make discoveries.",

It is the same thing to those stock traders that had invested in the \"right thing\". You could be rich, but that does not make someone \"secured\" fully. They could went through a lot of debts that they need to repay and would make them broke after all the repayments.By the way like lovemayfamilis, maybe remove the word \"should\". I am thankful for knowing crypto especially Bitcoin, but I should not be \"so obligated\" to do so.

Crypto has improved the economic conditions of many people, the more we know about it, the more chance we have to benefit from it.OP, don't forget that you should also thank the inventor, he is a satoshi.

However, for some, who take another business aside from crypto, they also made successful remarks and become hugely profitable. So probably, it’s not about crypto or other businesses that make people rich and become widely successful, but it’s more on the attitude of a single person towards business and being knowledgeable and skillful in everything he does.",

Crypto has a lot of risks more than we can imagine simply because of its unpredictable market movement. The reason why some people never make it until the end and reach the heights of success because they quit along the way and lose their money. Most likely, those people who never stopped believing and hold on to their crypto dreams have survived and succeeded. Obviously, it’s not just crypto but definitely in all businesses. There are no safe investments as they have their own set of risks, but it’s up to the people how they can lessen and manage the risks, and still become successful in the end.",
