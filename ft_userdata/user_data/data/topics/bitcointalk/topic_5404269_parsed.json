  "content": "Asking for an opinion before investing in a site is good. But behind that, some scammers take advantage to share their sites. It becomes more clear when OP doesn't agree to hear a negative opinion. So here is the thread you may like to read. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5404211.0 (archived). He is promoting a website (likely a scam) and overacting when Potato Chips leaves his true opinion. I said he is promoting it because he is posting this link on multiple threads. Check his post history.I am pretty sure markvin is involved with that potential scam site. Still, I haven't tag him. I will see the community response.",

Just report him to the moderators for advertsing a site with low value posts and let us see how the moderators handle it. I don't think you should tag him yet, unless you are so sure that the site is a scam one, i know trading bots sites are scams, but people who try to use them are also greedy and do not want to learn how to trade the correct way, but believe they can make quick money trading with bots.",

The above thread is funny and the originator of the thread is unserious. First, you played neutral to ask the honest option of the community about a project, maybe to tell if it's safe to invest. Then a user gave an honest opinion and the op immediately attacked the reviewer.Well, it's obvious that markvin is directly involved in the project. It is also obvious that he is spamming the forum with his project. What I am not certain about is if the project is a scam because I didn't click his link. But from the method used to promote the project, there is 80% chance that is it a scam project.",

He isn’t genuine, I suspect is intentions is to scam, he makes these posts about an investment platform and waits to see who comments so he can send a personal message to those who show interest. I’m glad the community saw through his lies, a tag would be appropriate. It looks like he is trying to lure people to his fake investment platform.",

This means that the number of visitors to this website is quite low. You can expect this from a small, starting or niche website. A popular website however should have a higher Alexa ranking.From several explanations, analysis and findings in intelfin.io review, Meaning and conclusion:QuoteWe identified keywords that indicate that the company may offer very high-risk financial services, meaning services that may offer a high return; but also a high likelihood of losing (all) your money. We advise you to be very careful.For that, be careful choosing your current crypto trading or investment site, the risk of losing your money is greater, than expected.",

An account spamming the link doesn't prove much. I haven't created this thread for spam at all. I know spamming is different from than trust system. The information you will find when you simply visit their site. Their bot service will give you a high monthly return like 22% or more. It is quite impossible to get the same return every month. There isn't a money-making machine over the Internet. So it's a potential scam, no doubt.",
