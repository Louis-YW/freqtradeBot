So if you see these things don't be shocked.Btw, Islam doesn't say that you can't live on earth if you are unmarried, it says that to make it official, just say the words, you don't necessarily need to announce it to the world, though you'd need witnesses if ever there is a need to prove it to others, nowadays it's better if you register it somewhere official.If both parties are willing, they could just say the words before going under a roof together.But you know, when it comes to saudis, double standards are natural.",

I saw something where the team he joined now has more instagram followers than a number of big European clubs which is crazy really.I also saw it being reported that Ronaldo will potentially help lead Saudi Arabia’s bid for the World Cup to be hosted there. Maybe that’s the real reason why he is being paid so much tp be there. The business opportunities & exposure that comes from hosting a World Cup are huge as Qatar is now finding.",

      "body": "There must have been a great plan and thought prior to Al Nassr cutting £173m paycheck each year for Ronaldo playing for the football club. In all things it is Saudi Arabia, just goes to show they will change their beliefs in the name of sport and money. There must be other stipulations within his contract that probably will not be released to the public. Like things that Ronaldo cannot do in the while in Saudi Arabia. I really do not see any negative to this idea, Ronaldo is not above the law, he is a well renowned soccer player that wants to do what he does best. Saudi Arabia is giving him the opportunity to make the football team win alongside making sure that the deal was right with his paycheck.",

      "body": "Well, was anyone expecting anything other than the rules being bent or interpreted differently to suit some certain influential people. Rules being bent for people happens all the time and the fact that it is happening now and again shows the desperation of the Saudis in having Ronaldo play for them at all costs. Knowing the spotlight and attention of having Ronaldo on their turf brings, they will bend and break more rules to have him stay and play football there.",
