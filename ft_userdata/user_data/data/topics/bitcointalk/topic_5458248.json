Although SEC says that the application inadequate.QuoteFeedback from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications filed by Nasdaq and Cboe on behalf of investment giants BlackRock and Fidelity as inadequate is “not an indication that the product is not viable,” says a person familiar with the applications, who requested anonymity.https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenehrlich/2023/06/30/secs-rejection-of-bitcoin-spot-etfs-is-more-speed-bump-than-stop-sign/?sh=d2eb17737559And yet the price didn't move a bit, actually it went as high as $31,000 before it goes down on a decline to lows of $30,000 and now trading at the middle, $30,500. So it's just a timing, so maybe if July has another good news to boot then the bullish sentiments might continue, IMHO.",

      "body": "I hesitated, but instead chose \"No\" to answer your question on the poll.There are actually a lot of factors I could consider choosing \"no\", and one of them is the similarity of the pattern between the 2020 halving period and the 2024 halving period. If the pattern true, then I think we will go lower this July. Things may change and we get different realities, but I've just ignored a lot of worries about that. Keep hold on, that is my current plan until at least 18 months after the 2024 halving.Going back to July, I think we're going to be in the $28k - $34k area. $28k is the support I am considering, but if bitcoin can break the $32k resistance then I hope $35k won't be difficult.",

The market has been resisting to go below $30000 and the market seem bullish as of now and we do not know what would happen. I think the bulls are still buying and this may increase the price further, but also the market can be deceiving at times, this makes me not to know what would happen. But if bitcoin increase above $32000, likely we are going to $35000. If Bitcoin does not pass $30000 to $31000, it is possible that the price may fall back below $30000 again. But as of now, I can see the bulls at work. I will choose sideways though.",

This 3rd quarter was probably have the chance to see the price of Bitcoin will move and getting a distance from the $30k barrier. I have the insights that we will reach $35k this month but still with some corrections moving it up and down. And that person can be right in his assumptions, rise is probably what we are going to experience this month. However, this will also change depending on how the community responds and manage their emotions upon reading the FUDs.",

So then when November 2018 came around, people assumed it would rally in that month since it did nothing for most of the year. And what happened instead? Basically complete opposite.Hence you can’t really use this as an indicator. I think it’s just completely random at this point. Only bearish months I can tell fundamentally are in March-April of the prior year was bullish due to tax selling. But that happens maybe once every 2-3 years.",
