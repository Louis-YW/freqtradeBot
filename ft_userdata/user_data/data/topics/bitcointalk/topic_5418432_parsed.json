They are supposed to be arrested and punished rather than negotiated with. You tell them things they must do, if what you tell them are right they won't disobey otherwise they will be punished and you will witness this happening. This is the use of the power and authority that have been given to you which your opponents don't have. You are trying to make them feel important whereas the truth is  they know they don't have that much power and authority. Do what is right and stop listening to the enemy or I will do your job for you to end the terror and shedding of blood. I'm quite pleased with what is happening in Ethiopia, unfortunately the government is trying to negotiate with the one it called terrorist mainly because of pressure from outside forces with hidden agenda. Ethiopia seems to be doing its job fairly well but it somehow want to negotiate with the the group it has already defeated. Isn't it strange?",

I don’t think there is are anybody or government that is pleased to negotiate with terrorists. But sometimes these terrorist group holds the government or country to ransome. Sometimes they might take up arms and destabilize the government. And most times using force would lead to more destruction of live and properties, hence the government would want to negotiate to avert these negative occurances. There are times when people are kidnapped by terrorist or a whole section of a country is captured by these terrorist groups forcing the government to negotiate.

Ethiopia seems to be doing its job fairly well but it somehow want to negotiate with the the group it has already defeated. Isn't it strange? I assume you are referring to the Ethiopia's region of Tigray as terrorist? I think the civil war between the Ethoipian government and the Tigray region has a tribal and political undertone. Hence calling them terrorist might be inappropriate because to many they freedom fighters laboring for more autonomy and freedom. And they have not been recognized as a terrorist organization by any international organization.",

Take out a bunch of terrorists during the negotiations, that way.Besides, diplomats need something to do. After all, they gotta eat, too.",

This is what shown to us now what we see so we just assume who are terrorist and who are guardians as per the media portrays.Okay about the topic no one really start negotiating unless the opponent has something powerful than yourside or simply don't want the casualties on both the sides. If every government thinks in the way you are saying the soldiers who are also the innocent people has nothing to do with the political war is going to be killed.",

Sometimes it gets necessary to have some negotiations though you were dominant in the past. Something happens for some reason, and sometimes, we must go with the flow to bring things back to normal. So I don't think there is something weird with this.",
