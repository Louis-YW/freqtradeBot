Heart warming message from Roman about our proposal. A little about Roman:Precious artworks inspired by different cultures and ancient traditions: Opalinski masterfully connects the gold glories of Byzantine art and the aesthetic of eastern icons with a touch of French Impressionism. Born in Western Ukraine, Opalinski grew up in between different cultures that inspired his way to create compelling boards with mix media. Since childhood he was surrounded by stunning landscapes and Ukrainian folk art. He graduated from the Lviv State Institute of Applied and Decorative Art and he always searched for several means of expression by combining passions such as painting, sculpture, and metalwork. Opalinski has participated in many National and International exhibitions in Poland, Germany, The Netherlands, France, Slovakia, Italy, Switzerland and London. Selected for the Chianciano Art Museum and the London Art Biennale, Opalinski won second price at the Chianciano Art Biennale as well as awards all over the world. He creates unique works on wood where the east meets the west: inspired by old orthodox icons Opalinski elaborates his stunning works in a way never seen before. Fairy-like atmospheres and enchanted lands, where graceful figures give life to stories which weave together. Opalinski gives us new emotions every time we admire his artworks, discovering the endless elements of a rich and articulated creative narrative. Like in the ancient cycles of frescoes, we perceive a great story telling, but focusing on specific areas of Opalinski’s boards we discover small sequences of fiction and several different figures, encased as gems in the precious golden background. Stylistically, the Ukrainian artist has a characteristic uniqueness: he incorporates the frames into the cosmos of the story represented, painting the surface of that border untouched by other artists, creating a harmonic and intense masterpiece.  ...    ...  Some more are here:Painting 2Painting 3Painting 4Painting 5Painting 6Painting 7 Also, 5% of each sale will be donated to Redcross for Ukraine crisisPlease message for any questionsEdit: Loading the paintings is optional.
