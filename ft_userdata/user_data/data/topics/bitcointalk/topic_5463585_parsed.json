But you should know that sometimes Bitcoin takes time to reach or never reach the price we want. You will make a profit if you can still hold your Bitcoins until they reach a high price and then sell them according to your target selling price.And if the Bitcoin price stays below your target price, you may be left behind to buy Bitcoin at a lower price because your target price is lower than the market price. You could set a buy price target in several orders and divide the money so that you can still make a profit if one price target is filled and the price immediately increases.And please remember that the current situation tends to be sideways, so you could lower your buy and sell targets so they can be filled and make a profit. And try to analyze based on the movement of Bitcoin every day so you can see what the pattern is like.",

It would be good if you can provide a chart so that we can really get what you mean. What I see in the current situation in the market is just a retracement, and I consider that Bitcoin is already bullish base on my TA. We expect that there are always a manipulation in the market.However, there are many strategies out there that makes someone profitable but I swear that not all strategies would work to all traders. If you're really profitable with your strategy, you can keep doing it. Trading is not just about strategies but also how we can really make profit in the market.",

And they think the next week's market will sweep both the weekly highs and lows. Some traders mark the Monday High and the Monday Low and they think the market will grab the liquidity set on the first days of the week for the trading markets.Similarly, you are playing with last month's high and low, which I think can be used as one of the confluences to take the trade along with many other measures of course. You cannot just use this to always trade as this is also not a 100% accurate way to place your trades.",

So your sell orders remain. Next month you set new pairs with new money.You didn't mention how long you do this already, but there will be times you will have many open orders and need to invest more and more to follow your strategy.At least it's not ideal to have no stop loss and no money management. You do not significantly profit - or avoid losses - if price go one direction. At least I would recommend to do some DCA if prices go southwards and read a bit about money management (there are many ways to do it more smart).",

If you already had your order executed before creating this thread, that means you did not buy at the low because the market dropped about six hours after you created this thread. These are the reasons why some experienced Bitcoiners usually say that those who invest in Bitcoin with the aim of making a profit within a short period of time will not really make much profit. If you are buying and selling less than 100 bitcoins for that range of your price target, then you will not really make much profit. Why not just accumulate your Bitcoin and hold it for a longer time until the bull market comes? If you are too hasty for a short-term profit, you might not be very profitable.",
