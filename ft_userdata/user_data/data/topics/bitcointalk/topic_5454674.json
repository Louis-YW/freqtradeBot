But right now, brc20 is taking the crypto community by storm. I think the early supporters of these brc20 projects will be rewarded immensely just as btc in its early stage. Although am just getting to know about the stable coins from this thread but am already familiar with some of the btc ordinal projects. I even got myself a .sats domain name just incaseÂ   who knows how big the brc20 will blow.",

It's obvious that it's the new hype right now, just a couple of months ago when it was developed and now it's taking the crypto market. Although want bitcoin maximalist doesn't want is that it run on top of the bitcoin's blockchain causing the mempool to clogged and with that, the fee spike.The thing is that when bitcoin's developers started to close that loophole, then maybe BRC-20 will be on the side then as everyone is being affected by it negatively so I wouldn't be surprised of a patch before the end of the year.",

BRC-20 might be the next narrative on upcoming future to come or something would really be in trend but im not really that so sure if it would really be that significant but we are already seeing gradually that there are projects which are on BRC-20 and speaking about their prices and value which is really that increasing on the time that i had checked out which means that investors are starting up to consider out this space and i wont really be that shocked nor really that having that reaction if this would be the big thing.The issue on here is about on flooding out the network which is something that pushes up and resurface again about the scalability issue of Bitcoinwhich it would indeed in fact affecting that fee price which its never been that ideal if its really on the roof.",

I don't know if this is the next short-term trend in the market, but it is having a big impact on bitcoin. Since the launch of BRC-20, the volume of transactions has increased, causing transactions to be congested and leading to an increase in fees. Although there are many people who are looking forward to the next innovation of these blockchain projects because the airdrop opportunity is huge, I do not like this one bit because if there is a follow-up hype related to this blockchain, there will be a bitcoin-related vulnerability again.Many have really decided that the blog token will become a new trend in the crypt. I also adhere that BRC-20 will only be a short story. So far, there are no special coins on the ear. But for some reason, many are promoting this topic. Perhaps it is worth having a closer look. Although, BRC-20 does not cause much enthusiasm.",

I mean it's nice that bitcoin gets developed but this seems like a sure way to get the chain clogged. Also, how long does it take that bitcoin gets own version of shiba-inu or pepe, or any meme token really and then crap would really hit the fan. Maybe i don't understand the tech well enough but i don't believe that bitcoin was build to handle this. Someone can correct me because i want to believe that this is good for bitcoin.",

What can happen is almost like the ERC20 of Ethereum where every transaction is expensive and we don't like that. IMO, Bitcoin is made for cheap, fast, and secure transactions and not for this type of project. Maybe for some, it will be the next big thing and they will try to hype it, but let us also look at the long run. Putting the project in another chain will be the best solution but swelling the transaction numbers in the Bitcoin chain would not do any better. It will just scare away investors and probably end up with less demand and usage which may cause the value to depreciate. I am against it.",

For me, initially, I don't really find that the Bitcoin network is capable of any BRC-20 tokens even stablecoins because that's not how Bitcoin is built, we already have Ethereum for it.But if we will just assume about BRC-20 stablecoins, I can say it's the same with other stablecoins which are on another network, as long as they are transparent that it is pegged by real fiat currency 1:1, all good.
