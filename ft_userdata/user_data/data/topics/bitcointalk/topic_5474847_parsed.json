  "content": "I have a modified cpuminer-opt for scrypt-NAH (Strayacoin), which can be found here:https://github.com/catcoin-project/cpuminer-opt-scryptnah.Currently there is only a Windows binary, but if you look at the first commit message there's a snippet of the changes to scrypt.c so you can compile for your system and mine Strayacoin on Linux, Mac, etc.There's also a pool with a modified stratum server at https://pool.larahelpers.com which is the only Strayacoin pool that works with scrypt NAH that I am aware of.  If anyone wants to help me test it I would appreciate the help.  I want to ensure payment runs work properly etc.",
