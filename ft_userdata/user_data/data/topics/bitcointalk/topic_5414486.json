  "content": "I've been able to make a good profit on my Bitcoin investment over the last few years (Because I had been holding it since 2017 and sold it last year). I now have a few other altcoin investments and about $70k (roughly) set aside for mining. I've done my fair share of mining research and am looking for a hosted mining service where my miners can be online in a day or two. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thank you in advance.",

For example, you stated you have a mining farm in Moldova, but there is no further info other than some short videos of low quality. No address, no contact etc. I also need to log in to view further. I think that's not really a good way to market your business (if it is legit).",

Jump on their telegram as they are showing incredible images of infrastructure going in and rapid growth. Nobody claimed they were as big as many others but they are growing and are in the process of adding 2.6MW this week....I'd pick them over Compass any day of the week and I'll stick by my recommendations.   To be clear I have no financial interest in their company I am however a customer of DelMarvaBlockchain.",

Thank you in advance.If you have your own mining equipment, just place it with a third-party provider providing services, if the tariff suits you, for example, in the nearest data center. However, if you are talking about cloud mining, then in this case you are very risky and in your place I would not do this, but this is my opinion.",
