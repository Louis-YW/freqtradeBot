I've seen a lot of threads like this, I hope it doesn't violate the forum rules, otherwise mine and all such will have to be deleted. Regarding deposits and withdrawals, this is for convenience. But a person can use their banks/e-wallets or can ask us to give them Neteller/Skrill etc.You can scam almost anywhere if you want to. Anything can be negotiated if there is a desire to make it safe.",
