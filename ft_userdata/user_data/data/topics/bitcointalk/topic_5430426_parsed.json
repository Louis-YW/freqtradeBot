You have to make it distinct for them to know that it is bitcoin that is transparent, that most altcoins are not too and many are resulting to money loss more than expected. 75% of ICOs in 2018 were scam, there are many ICO that are still scam. There are many other ways that people are losing money just because they are not following the right things to do.",

Because they believe more in what mainstream media are saying, these media prefer to broadcast the bad sides of Cryptocurrency, people believe that if it's unconventional it should not be accepted, I know of people who are involved in MLM and they believe that if Bitcoin has no main or central office then its a scam, I don't waste my time on them they will soon discover the value of Bitcoin.",

They simply follow trends and have a been programmed to believe whatever the media puts in front of them.

It's just human psychology, people are afraid of the unknown. when they don't understand something, only negative things are looked at and something \"unknown\" is belittled. I remember various fears over time that have become everyday things today. When bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are accepted by such, then you will know that the implementation is over and that the mission has succeeded.",

Most of them are those who miss the opportunity to invest below that’s why they making negative comment for FUD to dump the price and make a lower entry price for them. It’s very rare for a people without knowledge on crypto to waste time on making negative comment on crypto.Also. There’s a lot of well known people that making FUD on Bitcoin that turns into crypto supporters during the bear market. Some of them is just doing it to have lower price entry for there investment.",

If you must recommend cryptocurrency to someone them choose bitcoin and also give a sound education about how to buy and sell to them, do you know why they should start with bitcoin, because bitcoin will never scam and run away their entire asset like other coins do, bitcoin can only be volatile when there's a drop in price or a pump in price for them to make profits and will always remain relevance while their entire asset or investment cannot be lost.",

Bank savings isn't to grow your money, but it just to protect your money. Although there's few things like fiat isn't being used for money laundering, banks can freeze your funds and they will ask more verification etc etc that make people mad about it.But it's not like altcoins and centralized stable coins where you wouldn't get any insurance or you can report the CEO to go jail, many scam projects can easily avoid this.After all most people are still using fiat and not use Bitcoin as a currency.",
