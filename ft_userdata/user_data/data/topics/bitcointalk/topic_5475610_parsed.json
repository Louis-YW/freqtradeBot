At the beginning of gambling most of the gamblers use to loss,like you became the Silver or Gold membership of the gambling site.So after you waggered for 50-100k dollars,you will learn what the game you are really playing.After that only you can able to build the real tactics for the game,until you had wager for 100k dollars in the single game.You can't able to learn the particular game,but if you wager the entire 100k dollars in the particular game.You will became the legend of that game and all the next bet will help you to recover the entire loss.But you need to use the tactics without of any emotional involvement.",

      "body": "It depends on the game you play. Some games are built for hundreds of bets at a time. Dice players often make 50+ a day, so after months of playing you get into hundreds of thousands of bets. Is that going to show if you're good at it or not? I say it won't. If you're up even 5% after a month of playing dice you're doing good.In poker it's more of a who you're playing with. You can get a table full of newbies and win and it won't mean you're good. I'd say getting out of a tournament with a profit means you're a good player, but in general being in profit after a few sessions (number of bets depend on the game you play) means you're good.",

Assuming I want to go pro on betting, do you think that this is good enough or do I wait and see what my percentage is after 800 - 900 bets before making a decision? There is not direct answer to this question because the emphasis should not be how good you are as a gambler rather how good is your strategy. I appreciate the fact that you have come to terms that gambling is a game of probability so your sample size should be wide which is already what you are doing. Now let's face the key question. First what is your risk to reward ratio? It is not enough to have a high win rate; what matters is how many losses can a single win cover. If your risk to reward ratio is like 1:10, you just need a single win to cover ten loses. With a win rate of 30% under this arelrangement, you are already a highly profitable gambler. If the risk to reward ratio changes, adjustments can be made to ascertain true position of the strategy. So I feel the strategy should be the focus.",

Assuming I want to go pro on betting, do you think that this is good enough or do I wait and see what my percentage is after 800 - 900 bets before making a decision? I think it depends on the knowledge of a person on the sports he is betting.  Percentage simply represents how accurate and good is the analytic ability of a player. So instead of relying on statistics, why not go directly and ask oneself if he is confident enough with his predictions.  This will answer whether  the person is ready to go forward to a higher ground of betting.If a person feel that he is not good enough for the next level, then he must do more digging and acquire more knowledge on betting, the strategies and find more factors to consider in making precise bet prediction.",

For me it needs to have about 500 bets and that is enough to give you a rough idea of how good you are.However let me tell you that hitting frequency of 55-60% is really low unless you are playing with odds of 2.5 and above,if you play with odds less than 2 you need to have a hit frequency of at least 70-80% percent.However good luck hitting 80% hit frequency within 500 bets as if you have it you are a great pro in the sport betting and I think most people will agree,I personally copy other people bets most of the time as I have no time to create my own bets.",

Assuming I want to go pro on betting, do you think that this is good enough or do I wait and see what my percentage is after 800 - 900 bets before making a decision? It's not about the numbers in my opinion, it's about how much money you made. So it doesn't matter if it is 60% or 800-900 bets. The true gauge is did you make money out of those bets and how much it is? You can only like bet 500 or less but the amount could vary or at least majority of it are good value bets and then you will be on the + side. So for me that will be the best indicator that you are good enough or successful, with the amount of money you are bringing in less bets. And as we know it, the longer you play, the high chance that you might end up losing. However, if you can stir that up in your favor then you might be a better player as compare to the majority of us.",

Theoretically, I would say any amount of bet is never enough to say whether you are ready to hit that 50-60% winning spot because the result relies on a particular day.But practically, if you are hitting that range even after 400 bets then you are already a pro, and over time you will learn new things and it will help to evolve your betting strategies. But just as someone who simply wants to enjoy sports betting irrespective of having the intention of becoming a pro sports bettor just the odds and results decide my winning which I consider as my fate or destiny.",

Since gambling is a game of luck, I think that you don't need to hit between 50-60% before you can say that you are good because I have seen a gambler that won big on just a single game that he played on that day. He just started his first bet and he won big.He should have just walk away with his wins but instead, he thought that he was good and clever to win bug on his first game and he continued gambling, before he knew it he started securing losses which he almost used one quarter of his win on gambling before he realized that he was just lucky and needs to walk away with the rest amount on him. I don't need to prove that I am good by playing more games but the moment my gambling budget is gone, I quit.",

What happens to 1-10.  You can use the scale of 1 to 10 as a veritable means of measuring betting per cent. As gambler, you most know that your failure rate will always slightly come above the winning games. Statistically as a gambler I will not place myself on scale, because at every point that I gamble, I know when to stop especially when the failure rate is high. I just tell myself that I needed to give myself a break. because one thing you must tell yourself is the fact that successful games doesn't come easily. So for me, in a scale of 1 to 10, if I've won like straight 5 games, I will just give myself a break for a while.",

Compare them which is greater than the other. Then you would know how better you've become in gambling. Most times you would notice that the number of winnings is greater now than when you started betting. Unless all your gambling bets are being given to you by professionals or persons who have been in the system for long. Otherwise you would see your progress.However, in my own perspective I would prefer if performance level should be checked based on the ability to always walk away when your ahead.

In going pro you will be expecting to but 80% wins at your total bets, however, assuming you hit 89% wins margin of your total bets but didn't make so much money due to size of odds your strategy allows you to work with,would that still make you satisfied?

That's why in my opinion you have to measure it as followsif you deposit $100 at the casino and place bets and win, then you leave all the profit and withdraw all the $100 you deposited at the casino, after a while you make more withdrawals at the casino and you don't make any deposit at the casino since you withdraw the $100 you deposited, So you are a professional gambler because you will be doing something that few gamblers can do, which is making a profit in casinos. If you manage to make a profit at the casino and don't make a loss, then you can consider yourself a professional gambler. I honestly do not recommend looking at gambling as a way of making profits, it is a great danger to think that way. just look at gambling as fun",

You are right, knowing how good you are should not be judged by your winning rate but by the profits made from a number of bet. Let say for example, one deposit 20,000 and after betting 10 times a day, they won 7 games and lost 3, if the total balance  is less than the initail deposits then you're still running at a loss, but you might lose 6 bets out of 10 and win 4 bets and that 4 bets won leaves a balance more than the initial deposit then that is how you know you are a good gambler. Another thing about betting that most people don't know is that one must have a target, some target double their deposits and some target just 50% extra, depending on their deposits and continue like that on a daily basis and at the end of the day they go leave the site with their profits at hand. Good decision making and contentment is what makes one a good gambler.",
