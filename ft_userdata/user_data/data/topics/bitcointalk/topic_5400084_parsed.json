Investing involves exchanging fiat or other assets for another you expect to appreciate in value over time, but no guarantee that this is going to happen; That's risk.Quote from: Chapsy on May 25, 2022, 03:19:36 AMIf you want to obtain direct exposure to the demand for digital currency, cryptocurrency is a good investment.Majority of cryptocurrencies which are created are bad investments; the market has been filled with so much scam and rehashed projects, finding out a right investment is quite difficult; much easier to stick to bitcoin. Luna has shown that even perceived established coins can fail due to lack of a definite project and actual decentralization.I've seen a couple of threads over theoas days with this exact theme; advising on how to invest. It's good you do a quick search before making a thread.Good attempt however!",

Problems are solved with knowledge. Knowledge improves our reasoning and problem-solving abilities.I would just warn people here that knowledge is not something that must be bought exclusively, but can be acquired using the Internet, reading books or free education. Someone will say that all this can come at a price, but I want to say that you don't have to pay a lot of money to learn some basic and even a little more advanced things if you want to learn something about Bitcoin.What is also very important is the moral and ethical issue when we participate in some crypto projects, and for many, it is not important at all. If you doubt that a project will fail, and at the same time you can profit - will you stay aside or consciously participate in the scam for profit?",

This can be good for stable coins like dai in a way you still earn money when you stake stable coin.But on the other hand, there are some altcoins you will stake, earn more coins, but the value of the coin your staked and that you earned with not worth the value of fiat you initially used to buy and stake the coin because of price downturn of the coin you staked.
