You talked about you being paid for giving out a some code which payment isn't refundable in anyway, and now you have gone down to 10% payment for just a revealing of the code. I still think you need to explain more and give more evidence to prove how credible your idea is.",

Yeah, doesn't make sense for the OP to share his secret techniques hehehe, and so mostly likely it's either not going to work and it's going to be a scam. So for me, nah, not going to bite on this so called prediction with 100% accuracy to win. It's obvious cheating for me and if it is found out by the gambling platform then your money is gone for sure. So just be careful for those who might fall for this trick, just saying. There's no such thing as an accurate prediction. If there is, many could have been millionaires by now.",

I wonder if you are a seer or is there something you are not telling us so, if there is, tell us so atleast the others can have a bit confidence in your offer even if they would find it difficult to patronize you but atleast they could be able to remember or refference you to others who might likely need your services and lastly, with the amount involved in your fee, I do not think anyone would want to take that risk of paying directly to you not when there is no guarantee of the game they are about playing and come to talk of it, just like the previous reply, you are a new bie here with no reputation or trust level so tell me who would take such risk with the amount involved as you have clearly stated.",

Although this is possible but I doubt that someone can really developed a tool that can capitalized on that small time window for delay.This 30K pound price is so expensive for a shady service like this. Even if this is a legit service, Paying that huge amount is very risky since he is just selling the tool publicly that will be soon confiscated.I smell scam few miles away with this kind of service offered here in gambling section.",
