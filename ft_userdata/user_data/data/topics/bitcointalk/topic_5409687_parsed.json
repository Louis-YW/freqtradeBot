I see that if it has no impact to the price of shiba inu. You shall wait until it will be listed on NASDAQ and then so many billionaire can pump shiba inu on nasdaq. Any new listing for shiba inu seems to be a worthless news these days. It seems bitcoin is the only thing that make the price of shiba inu to go up",

      "body": "As Shiba has already been listed on a number of major exchanges, it is only a matter of time and legitimacy before it is listed on smaller exchanges as well. This isn't the kind of news that's remarkable and won't cause any significant hype for shiba.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on August 13, 2022, 06:03:26 AM I have to be realistic if Elon mention Shiba the price will pumping up than other exchange newsI agree, being listed on small exchanges is not a big news right now. If you want shiba to be heavily advertised right now, it's more realistic to have Elon mention it or a big news like listed on nasdaq. LOL, this is the craziest thing I read today.",

LOL, this is the craziest thing I read today.I don't think it has any effect, like today the price more reduce over 10% from yesterday and everyone afraid in going more dump. I admit until this post was created on 13 August, the price was almost 2x or 100% growing up, but it's just a while a day, and some traders sold a lot of.",

It seems that recently SHIB was also listed on a new exchange whose name is Bluebit if I'm not mistaken, and now it's Pantera. So I can only believe that its price will kick in the market if Elon Musk makes SHIB post on Twitter something nice about it again. In this matter, the chances are high that its value will boom again, that's for sure.",

Well, I guess that's part of the PR.But this is shiba inu and there are many exchanges that supports it. Anyway, a milestone is it for those who are actually following its growth?",
