This is always whatI’m thinking whenever the price of Bitcoin drop significantly. It’s a normal correction since we reach 30K from below 15K last year. I think having a 100% growth within a year is already a good achievement for us to less worried on simple price drop like this.Quote from: Victony on April 22, 2023, 09:43:24 PMIt will help those that have long wanted to join the Bitcoin ecosystem quite encouraged to purchase BitcoinI think only those who take profit are willing to enter when everyone is fear to buy. Normally, non bitcoin holder that doesn’t want to buy on current price will always be scared buying on current price. They will always wait for dip and dip until Bitcoin pump again. They will buy when the price is mooning and not dumping because they will always be scared.",

But not everyone is willing to invest they are still longing for a much lower price before they will invest. The long time players in this kind of investment are the most capable in investing in bitcoin and willing to take risk because they are already used to the volatility of the market. Taking advantages of the price drop is worth it if you are aiming for a long term investment.",

This one isn't any different. heck we had a much bigger price drop just like 6 weeks ago.When the price doesn't drop or go sideways occasionally, we end up with something like 2019 when the bear market ended and Bitcoin went from $4k to $13k in like 2-3 months and then we got like 6 months of it steadily going down. The market overheated due to hype of the bear market ending in 2019 and we got a little mini bear market the whole second half of that year which wasn't fun.This year so far the price action has been very healthy. Price has gone up a bunch but every couple thousand dollars it has stopped for a while or dropped back down to keep things in check and keep the price from shooting up too quickly.Like, we want Bitcoin to be working its way through the $35k-$40k range over the course of this summer, we don't want it doing that like next month, cuz that would be too fast. And if Bitcoin had just kept going up from $30k this month, instead of taking a breather with a drop, like it has already done several times earlier this year, we'd been seeing $35k-$40k probably in May and then we'd probably be looking at a couple months long down market in the summer which wouldn't be fun for the market.",

The problem is when we have been in the bear market for a long time, being able to buy cheap. You are looking forward to the price starting to rise, although this year it has started to do so and it seems that we are getting out of the hole.

For investors who are familiar with the crypto market and the Bitcoin ecosystem, price drops can be seen as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin at a more affordable price.What needs to be understood Bitcoin has grown and become increasingly strong in the ecosystem. This is reflected in the increasing number of large companies that are starting to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment, as well as the increasing number of financial institutions that are interested in investing in Bitcoin. So the late end bitcoin drop I think is healthy.",

People who have been buying Bitcoin will be happy that this time around they can once again buy Bitcoin at a discounted price. Those who have been buying in DCA mode will also be happy because this will bring down their average purchase price. But those who have always been waiting for the price of Bitcoin to fall down so that they will buy will never really buy. If they don't buy when the price rallies and they won't also buy when the price corrects because they fear that it will decrease more, they will never really buy.",

It's an extremely understandable thing in investing, but I don't understand why so many people panic and panic when bitcoin drops 5% or 10%. People just always want bitcoin to go up and have the highest price. The price increase really has no effect if we don't have bitcoin in our pocket. It only makes us regret and envy the success of others.",

Investments that understand Bitcoin performance always welcome the correction that has just occurred, they will prepare supplies before the plane departs on the next flight. After putting in a grueling job in the last few months, Bitcoin looks like it's looking to get back on steam for its next pump. What you just saw in the market is a normal correction experienced by Bitcoin, Holders who are afraid of market conditions will immediately release it to people who have the financial strength to welcome the upcoming bull.The market sentiment turned bearish due to profit taking by some investors who had been holding Bitcoin since last year at around $15k, another cause of further Bitcoin decline as Bitcoin holders were unable to withstand the market pressures that invited mass selling. On the other hand this modest decline will reverse course leading to the liquidation of a large number of bullish investors who have always been optimistic about Bitcoin performance to return to above $30k.",

The Bitcoin price could be 5 dollars right now and the Bitcoin blockchain would be as strong as if the price was 60K or 100K.2.There is no such thing as \"impatient hodlers\". The true Bitcoin hodlers aren't impatient. The ones, who are selling BTC right now are the day traders and short term investors. They are not hodlers(or maybe they are hodling a part of their BTC and selling the other part).3.The newcomers to the Bitcoin/crypto world don't understand Bitcoin better than the experienced Bitcoiners.",

But for me, it isn’t something to be disappointed about the price. It’s even a good opportunity to buy more while bitcoin has not reached its peak. And as a long term hodler, I get used to it already and one thing is certain, no matter how deep the correction is, the price will always come up climbing again once the correction is over.",

So keep calm and have some patience - you will be rewarded for that! You are right, what is happening is a correction of bitcoin, not a drop as many are spreading. We went from 15k to 30k, and the correction is predictable. But whether it's a correction, drop, or fall...as long as it keeps the bitcoin price low, it's the perfect time to buy and accumulate bitcoin. This is not the time to panic and find out what caused it, or panic dumping our bitcoins. I feel many people still don't understand the benefits of bitcoin correction and price drop, every time bitcoin corrects, there are many questions asking why, why bitcoin is falling without focusing on buying bitcoin when the price drops.",

It won't matter if you are buying at 25,000$ or 15,000$, if your goal is a new all time high from Bitcoin do not stop buying. Many people lose their cool once bitcoin start losing value, if you don't accept this as the normal thing you will always be in a panic and you may end up taking profits too early or even selling for a loss, Bitcoin market is not for weak people, and weak people in crypto space are those that failed to understand how Bitcoin works. Whatever the case might be, always plan for a long-term hold, a bear market will come to an end when the time is right. When my portfolio goes down 20%, I always get affected, and this has led me to make some stupid decisions that I end up regretting. The first mistake I made as a crypto investor was fear of losing money. Do not make the same mistake, holding is the best way to grow your portfolio.",

Lower prices could get support from mid-term or long-term investors, helping to reduce selling pressure in the market. A falling price provides a more accurate assessment of Bitcoin's true value, making the market more honest. However, price drop can also have consequences, I think lucky investor can still sell their Bitcoin before the price drops, but unlucky investors will lose money when the price drops. Along with that, unstable growth can reduce the reliability of Bitcoin as the currency of choice for investment or use in transactions. The drop in price not only affects Bitcoin but also affects the entire crypto market, which in turn can create instability and difficult to predict in the market. All in all, the Bitcoin price drop can bring both benefits and consequences to the cryptocurrency market and investors, so it is necessary to have a sound investment knowledge and strategy before deciding to invest in Bitcoin or not any other asset class.",
