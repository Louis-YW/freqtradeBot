      "body": "You forget the nukes. But, Russia is being gentle with Ukraine. A few civilians have died, but the precision Russia used to take out the power plants, could have been used directly on civilians.Also, many of the Nato countries have hurt themselves by following US sanctions against Russia. They aren't ready for a fight with Russia. And, all the while, Russia has been making friends around the world, and selling oil to other countries. Consider BRICS.The people of the various Nato countries are becoming angry at what their government leaders have been doing... harming them through the sanctions. Soon the Nato people will have to fight the people of their own countries before they can  even think about fighting Russia.",

      "body": "Perhaps you have seen what I have said many times about guns: \"A 250-pound bully can easily mug, rape, and murder a 90 pound teenage girl. But if girly has a gun, she has a chance, even if bully has a gun, as well. The gun is a form of equalizer. It gives weak people a chance.It's the same with nukes and nations. Nukes are the equalizer.I don't know who is stronger, the US and Nato, or Russia... or China or India or Brazil or any other nation. But nukes are the equalizer that nobody wants to have to use. So, everybody, every nation, will play it safe as they can to avoid the nukes... except Zelensky, that is.",

The American way looks like peace, but loads of people have died trying to make loan payments, when they already paid off their loans with their promissory notes.Check it out here, thoroughly, the whole thread - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5414658.0;all - before you make a final decision that the American way is better than the new Russian way.",
