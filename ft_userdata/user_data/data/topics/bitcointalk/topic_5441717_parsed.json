I have used it successfully a few times, but I never use it as a main wallet.Now, after reading your topic, I opened the application and a window appeared from Google Play advising me to download the update (17 Mega), but it is not obligatory, as I can still use the application without downloading the update.I didn't get any red notifications. Can you mention the source of that notification, whether it was from the Wallet application or from the Google Play Store? I find it strange that downloading the update is mandatory and no announcement is made.",

I can confirm that Google Play also shows me that there is an update for the wallet, so I conclude that the previous version of the Trust wallet may have received some kind of upgrade that informs users that there is an update.Unfortunately, I don't have the funds to try to make a transaction, but after I exited the wallet and logged in again (several times), I didn't get the notification anymore. By the way, it shows me 7.3 as the last version.",

Let's just say the notification is a reminder for the next update  If you want to get another better alternative, using  bluewallet and Electrum for  Android or  Desktop  is the right choice, as what has been recommended by some people in forum.

Blue Wallet and Electrum are only wallets that can store Bitcoin and cannot store altcoins including NFTs.There is one wallet that is similar to Trust Wallet, Stack Wallet.Not only can you store Bitcoin, Stack Wallet can also store other coins or tokens such as Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero and others.So far I have never used Stack Wallet, since the topic Stack wallet for mobile? created by dkbit98, then I tried to learn it.",

In addition Trezor doesn't seem to be able to manage NFTs on its own. You need to use Metamask with it for that purpose https://blog.trezor.io/how-to-use-nfts-with-a-hardware-wallet-9b4308397ea7On top of that some people don't like very much hardware wallets because you need to give your physical address when you purchase them online, while Ledger's customers database had already been hacked and leaked online 2 years ago. They are also not very solid and you need to buy another device when they break down.",

That's my understanding as a genuine app can't send a notification to update and overwrite with a scam app. That's usually the case, but there is no harm in checking their social media or support if we never get any notification of a new behavior beforehand. Not to mention Android is generally not that safe with fake apps. God knows what new exploits are being used to inject an in-app notif with malicious code even if you download it from Play Store.
