Must share your opinion many Thanks Hasn't google lifted the crypto ban on their ads couple of years ago? and from what it looks like, this policy update seems to be about \"Cryptocurrency Coin Trust\". But I'm pretty sure whatever new policy they hand out will be bypassed by scammers lol. This is why I'm honestly not really sure how much crypto ads on google help since 90% of what I encounter are cookie cutter scams.",

Must share your opinion many Thanks It is about time they allowed cryptocurrency advertisements. They didn't allow it before because of the government's stance on cryptocurrency and how it could affect their business if the government decides to take action against them for allowing its advertisement. Following the SEC's approval of the spot bitcoin ETF, many big companies that previously refused to allow the use of cryptocurrency will reconsider because they will have the backing of the SEC, which has already accepted and approved the asset to be traded. Overall, this is for their own benefit because bitcoin already achieved more over the years and its penetration into the world of digital technology is already felt globally.",

      "body": "Bitcoin has become so big in the global financial system that it can't be overlooked. With the increase in financial inflow and the attraction of reputable institutional investors, Google has no other option but to revise its policy. With the stiff competition among these investors, many of them will be willing to spend more funds on advertisement. Google knows that if they fail to revisit the former unfriendly policy, they will definitely lose a good amount of money that would have been raked in from ads.Quote from: btc78 on January 30, 2024, 04:47:46 PMThis is definitely good news for the bitcoin community Right after SECâ€™s etf approval and now google allowing for advertisements, i am sure that more people are now gonna be interested in bitcoin even the general public even google is such an integral software that a lot of people use and put their trust into so them basically promoting bitcoin says a lotI just hope that the advertisements to come out of this would share accurate and reliable information Certainly, it will increase Bitcoin awareness because Google has many users but I am scared that the people will be misinformed. These adverts will not give people the right information because they will direct them to invest in Bitcoin through third parties. This flexible policy could also lead to an increase in the promotion of scams or fraudulent crypto projects on Google",

I think that Google and some other big platforms were sceptic on how to handle Bitcoin so it doesnâ€™t affect the reputation of the brand. But for the government to see meaning in bitcoin, who else would think itâ€™s not worth it? I remember saying something like this before that if one country starts using Bitcoin, another will trust their judgment and join them too. In this case, itâ€™s the ETF that brought the trust.",

Another thing here about google is they are their to serve the public why obeying regulator not to go against any rules which might be part of the reason they have to adjust the policy now and make things a bit easier for their customer now that Bitcoin has been approve even to be traded by their highest stock market, but this could just be a move by google to increase their Ads revenue as many crypto project will approach them to promote there project.",

The spot ETF itself has become an expression of a \"sell on the news\" event, and Google's permissions to advertise the cryptocurrency in January 2024 means creating liquidity for such sales. Indeed, how will Grayscale sell its bitcoins if there is no liquidity in the market? And how will there be liquidity in the market in sufficient quantities if bitcoin is not advertised to the general investor public? After halving, quite a large portion of miners should go bankrupt and this could trigger short-term panic selling. This is likely to be the next stage according to Wyckoff - market movement after distribution.",

Google lifts crypto advertising ban since that time, but reading the details of that news, the permission is related to the United States.QuoteIn a long-awaited reversal of a 2018 policy decision, Google will allow crypto exchanges and wallets to advertise on its platform in the U.S. But not everyoneâ€™s happy.https://forkast.news/google-lifts-crypto-advertising-ban/I see Crypto ads in search results even though my IP address is not in the United States, so the ban may be lifted gradually and now globally.",
