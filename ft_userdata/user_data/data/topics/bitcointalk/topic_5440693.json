Please anyone help me.Ahh dear so sad your rank is not eligible to post an image on Bitcointalk, as according to the requirements you need to be at least JR Member. For Jr Member rank you need 1 merit on a good post but if you can try the alternatives provided by Bitcointalk in the form o coper membership you can buy a copper membership which will be probably equal to the member rank on that membership you can post images and Gifs.Format upload your image or Gif on the BBcode img url generator, you can use Imgur or imgbb full details for posting an image is here [Guide] How to Add image on Bitcoin Talk Post? .Let me check if you have some decent posts then I would like to help you to achieve the Jr member rank.",
