Transaction capacity doesn't have to do with network's security. Quote from: SapphireSpire on October 31, 2022, 07:32:15 PMThe best blockchain is the longest chain with the greatest POWThis is pleonasm. Just the one with the most work.Quote from: SapphireSpire on October 31, 2022, 07:32:15 PMTo increase transaction capacity, the block interval can be reduced by reducing the block hash difficulty.There are various ways to increase the transaction capacity. One is to just increase the block size. Another way is to mess with block intervals, as you say, which involves trading off security. The fact remains: You don't scale. Scaling isn't a matter of transactions per second. It's a matter of transactions per second per block size. If you just adjusted the block size limit to 1 TB, and left transactions as is, you shouldn't call that \"scaling\". Scaling is when the size of transactions becomes less than it was before. Bitcoin can already process more than VISA can do, with second layer solutions.",

Whichever one I choose, I broadcast my payment to the network and the restaurant sees my payment show up in their account/wallet immediately. With bitcoin, the restaurant owner can spend the money immediately if they want, and the transaction becomes irreversible in 10-20 minutes, probably before I've even left the restaurant. With a credit card, the restaurant owner cannot spend the money until it actually arrives in their account 3-5 business days later, and the transaction remains reversible for up to 180 days.The same fundamental premise holds true of any and all electronic fiat methods, be they credit cards, bank transfers, PayPal, Google/Apple Pay, etc. All of these can be reversed for a significantly longer period of time than bitcoin transactions can be reversed.",

      "body": "(as others have noted) It appears the OP is conflating transaction throughput with transaction speed. Throughput is the number of transactions that can be handled per n period of time, while transaction speed is the time it takes for a transaction to settle/finalize. The reason why bitcoin's transaction throughput capacity will be lower than Visa's is due to the fact that bitcoin transactions must be transmitted to everyone running a full node on the network (and each transaction is similarly stored by everyone running a full node), while Visa transactions only need to be transmitted to a Visa computer. Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on October 31, 2022, 08:57:45 PMI might compare someone \"swiping\" their credit card at a merchant, and the payment processor (using the Visa network) telling the merchant the transaction was \"authorized\" to an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction.

In most cases, the transaction will be finalized and will not be reversed, but there is still the potential for a reversal (or in the case of bitcoin transactions, a double spend). Exactly my point. Neither an unconfirmed bitcoin transaction nor a Visa authorization of payment are final. However, the bitcoin transaction is difficulty and costly to even attempt to double spend (certainly not worth it for the price of a meal in a restaurant) and the double spend attempt has a high chance of failing, while a Visa transaction can be reliably reversed easily and for free with a single phone call claiming that your card was stolen. Further, the window for a bitcoin double spend is ~10 minutes, while the window for a Visa reversal is 180 days.The only form of money which is instantly confirmed and irreversible is cold hard cash, with bitcoin being a close second. Everything else is a very distant third place.Having said all that, this situation will change somewhat when full RBF is released with Core v24.0. At that point, zero confirmation transactions will be easily reversed, so you either have to trust your customer not to scam you (as you do with every credit card transaction), wait for a confirmation (still much quicker than 180 days!) or use Lightning.",

Are we talking about a click of button in a piece of software?Is this full RBF feature going to be an optional feature, or is that the new norm for RBF-enabled transactions? What I am asking is, can I use the \"standard\" RBF we have now or go with full RBF, or will their be no \"standard\" anymore? What is the reasoning behind implementing this? Giving the sender a chance to change their mind if they were too hasty and made a mistake or what? On first sight, it seems more harmful than an improvement but I would need the whole picture to be able to judge it properly.It could also require services that accept unconfirmed transactions to completely re-think their business model. Crypto casinos, for example. Although, they already have in-built protection where the deposit transaction has to be confirmed before the player is allowed to withdraw their winnings from the platform. Trying to cheat already means shooting yourself in the foot. What about instant swaps between lightning and on-chain BTC? Submarine swaps don't require on-chain confirmations I think. Seems all that will be negatively affected if full RBF can't be deactivated manually.",

If you opt out of RBF, then some nodes will accept a replacement while others won't. Which transaction ends up being mined depends on how many nodes enable full RBF, how many miners are looking at nodes which enable full RBF, and a bit of luck.Quote from: Pmalek on November 01, 2022, 08:12:19 PMWhat is the reasoning behind implementing this?It prevents DoS attacks against multi-party funded transactions such as coinjoins and Lightning channels.
