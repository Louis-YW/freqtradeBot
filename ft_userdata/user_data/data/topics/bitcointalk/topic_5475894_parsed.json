It was really hilarious that American government used to grant company registrations without actually knowing the owner. This is a huge risk and these companies can be easily used for laundering money. I have seen multiple companies in my country claimed they have a US subsidiary registered under LLC structure without actually providing a complete address in their website. It's good to see that the US government is finally taking steps to fix this corporate loop hole.",
