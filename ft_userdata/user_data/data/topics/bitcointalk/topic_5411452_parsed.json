ThanksÂ  seems a bit steep for a single chip even with the packaging. I thought maybe it was a set of chips. Each set includes 6x items: 1x 509 chip, 1x foam plastic Air-tite, 2x 509 holograms, 1x hologram plastic case, 1x 509 storage foam case, and custom packaging. All of these items cost $$$, as you know. With inflation, designing, manufacturing, shipping, and fees projects are not cheap these days. .002 isn't much over my cost for forum members, but hey it's a free market! No broken fingers here if you decide not to purchase my friend.",
