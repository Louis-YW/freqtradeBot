  "content": "Hello familyI thought I should drop this for the house to formally clearify me further on this platform that was blatantly praise and worshipped like a money making machine by my cousins I went visiting this past sunday but from the research I made on this platform/website seem to me like a scam project run by scammers presently to lure enough customers in their atmosphere before they actually mess it up because as for now they claim that the software is actually paying but I believe its just a matter of time before those that invested or in this case of their bought a mining machine will start crying for their funds. I donno if am wrong about this but I also strongly advice for everyone that have involve or planning to partake to take serious precaution before starting because regret is always one step away from us.so here is the name of site or appCSTCMINE APP Please member of the house help and share your opinion on this website and app .",

I believe there is a possibility of an exit scam going on here.Code:Domain:cstcmine.comRegistrar:Sav.com, LLCRegistered On:2022-12-04Expires On:2024-12-04Updated On:2023-02-24Status:clientTransferProhibitedName Servers:rory.ns.cloudflare.comvita.ns.cloudflare.comhttps://www.whois.com/whois/cstcmine.comOn the Trust pilot page, they currently have only nine reviews discussing how they received their payment from the site. I understand that relying on feedback/reviews from trustpilot is not recommended because they may be paid reviews.I'm not a fan of anything to do with referrals, so I don't think I'll invest in such a platform, but I'm not stopping anyone from investing in it, just make sure you use the amount of money you can afford to lose and also don't be greedy, make sure you cash in the first opportunity you get and don't wait for too much profit before making withdrawal because most of these sites crash easily.",

      "body": "Well thanks for the review you did on the site and app, I have already checked the domain myself and that was what raised my alarm for a possible scam here but just needed to sure am not fabricating any suspicions from the bad hunch I have for this kind of platforms, well anyway like you said it is just a possible suggestion so anyone involved in this should just take extra precautions and I have certainly cleared my cousins on a possible scam but am leaving them to their fate so whatever plays out the result is for them to reap it.",

      "body": "This is a Ponzi Scheme created by we boys to scam us again. I don't believe any of the following information im the site. QuoteRegistrant ContactStreet:2229 S MICHIGAN AVE SUITE 303City:CHICAGOState:ILLINOISPostal Code:60616Country:USPhone:+1.2563740797Email:Select Contact Domain Holder Link https://www.sav.com/?domain=cstcmine.com they use those information to make real do people will not suspect them. So anyone who is investing in that platform should prepare him or her mind to loss out. Well the first vistors or customers will cash out as Cantsay said. They will make it to look like legit but I tell you it is not legit. It is just a scam. They can even keep this website plus the app running for about six months. And when they have gathered enough customers, you will begin to see network problem, withdrawals Â problem, and site maintenance will be starting. And once those thongs have started then you will know that they want to run away with the peoples money. So I will not advise anyone to invest in it and also tell your brothers and sisters to avoid it and any other ones.",
