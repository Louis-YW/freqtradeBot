Parker, whose mission was to manufacture a better pen. The Parker Pen Company's tradition epitomizes the highest standards of craftsmanship, technology, and aesthetics. From the 1920s to the 1960s, Parker was No.1 in worldwide writing instrument sales. The Parker Duofold is one of the most recognizable and enduring fountain pen designs. Launched in 1921, the pen was a phenomenal success and put the Parker Pen Company squarely into the front rank of fountain pen manufacturers. Duofold remain popular in Europe being produced well into the 60s in varying sizes and colors when it was revived in the 80's once again as Parker's Flagship model.In 1932, Parker began test marketing the next generation in fountain pens, the Golden Arrow. This radical new pen featured a compact plunger-operated pump filler that nestled at the back end of the barrel, eliminating the space-hungry pressure bar and sac. The Golden Arrow was later renamed as Vacumatic. The Vacumatic went on the market in 1933; and discontinued in 1939, due to the introduction of new Aero-metric filler.Parker pens were frequently selected to sign important documents such as the World War II armistices, and commemorative editions were sometimes offered.You can also view our item on Trumblr.",
