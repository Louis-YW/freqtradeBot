Sometimes there are some that involves code and seeing them make me feel like am seeing magic. So wanted to know if technical analysis requires talent or if not then can anybody assist me with something like \"Technical analysis for dummy\" because I can't really seem to understand it.Thank you.P.S I am sorry for the poor way I coined my question.I meant Bitcoin technicalities like Block chains, hash rate, nodes and the likes.I can already apply technical analysis just want to research more on the technical aspect of Bitcoin because coming across certain terms i don't understand while reading a thread is painful.",

You only need to choose those 1 to 3 that are easiest for you according to your trading type. MACD or Bollinger bands are the most commonly used indicators even for beginners in day trading.",

And by this, you can script your strategy into useful functions for signal generation automatically if your trading platform allows it.That said, technical analysis deals with all the chart studies that can help you analyze Bitcoin and then come up with a decision on whether to buy or sell at a point in time. There are many things to learn under this subject, but I advise you to mainly train and stick to price action, trendline, pivot point, Fibonacci, and Ellliot wave strategies. You can choose one or more and also combine them together if you want. Google and learn them one by one.Note: Do not depend on those common indicators, they will fail you.",

You can also go to Github and read the books there, it’s absolutely free and you can improve your technical knowledge https://github.com/openblockchains/awesome-blockchainshttps://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbookIf you prefer watching videos, I recommend watching Andreas Antonopoulos videos on YouTube.",

This is a trick I use to learn new things faster.Get an empty exercise book or open a blank note on whatever electronic device you have. As you read through any word that sounds complex or hard to get, write it word. Then after you have read through the document, Google those terminologies one after the other and find other context where it has been used. Sometimes, I even add, speaking with a friend who is more knowledgeable about bitcoin than me. It is the fastest way I learn and still learning about bitcoin and its ecosystem.",

I see the market making similar moves and I predicted the bottom to happen within 365 days of the top, i.e. what happened in the previous bear market and the results are in front of you, that's exactly what happened.Here are some important things to remember when using Technical Analysis:1. Support2. Resistance3. Timeframe(s) are very important and how you want to trade the asset4. Breakouts5. RSI & MACD IndicatorsStart with this much and I am sure you will be able to knock off some pretty clear moves in 15-minute timeframe, it's best to start learning as there's a lot of things happening right away within a day.It will help you understand the movement and always believe that something which has previously happened can happen again. History do repeat itself.Good Luck!",

Unfortunately, many people think like that which is pissing me off sometimes to be honest, If you're planning to get into crypto trading or make bitcoin predictions and treat it like gambling by blindly putting your money in, it won't work out for you. Instead, you need to understand the principles of technical analysis to make informed decisions. Quote from: ImThour on April 21, 2023, 05:27:09 PMIf someone says Technical Analysis is a joke, they need to see this chart of mine where I predicted $16k to be bottom at the end of the year on Apr 27, 2022.~snip~Also, I must add that your prediction for Bitcoin's movement on April 27, 2022 was really good, and as you said It's all depends on your knowledge and people must follow the important things you mentioned about Technical analysis.

      "body": "@OP, it looks like you are confused between technical knowledge on Bitcoin and technical analysis on trading.  These two subject is different and not related to each other.  Technical knowledge on Bitcoin involves programming wherein a person have to learn programming language while technical analysis involves technical knowledge on reading price chart, indicators which lead to the price prediction of the Bitcoin market.If you are interested in Bitcoin technical knowledge you can need to learn the programming language used to create Bitcoin which is C++ and other programming languages used for the Bitcoin library.  There are free courses online that can help you to learn these programming languages like Codeacademy and Coursera.In terms of technical analysis, you can browse https://www.babypips.com/ and sites for free technical analysis lectures.Bitcoin technical aspects need knowledge of programming language, so if a person does not know any programming language, it will be difficult for him to understand anything about technical things of Bitcoin but, people is capable of learning, if they really wanted to learn the technical aspect of Bitcoin, they can start by learning the programming used in creating Bitcoin and its libraries.",

There are no codes in trading, just graphs and candlesticks, also trading doesn’t require any special talent or gift. Everything everyone knows, they learned and they got better at it because they improved on that skill which means you can learn it too and do the same.

When trying to learn new stuff, you always have to start with the basics otherwise it would be too overwhelming and I think that's why you seem to be having a hard time. The average \"basic\" could also be relative as we all have our own learning paces, I suggest learning how to backtrack when you have to cause crunching information more than what you can afford to is counter productive.For this, I would also recommend learnmeabitcoin.com and perhaps you might find other helpful stuff in: https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.htmlAnother thing about self-learning is, I realize some people can explain it better for me lol so in short, if you didn't understand something from source X, source Y could do it for you.

It has to do with your comprehension of coding and your familiarity with programming languages. You cannot participate in all of the forum boards if you do not comprehend the issues discussed there. However, since you're here to learn and want to know more about how that aspect works, you'll need to spend more time on that board as well as find time for self-learning.
