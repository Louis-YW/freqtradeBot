      "body": "Investing casino platform tokens is very risky I think. We are constantly seeing many casino platforms getting scammed after a few days. Many casino platforms are being shut down by owners due to lack of success. But since the RoLLBit casino platform has been around for a long time, you can prepare to invest here. If the owner takes steps to do better in the future, the price of the token can definitely go up. But since I have never entered and bet on the RoLLBit platform, I am not very experienced about this platform. But if there is a staking system on the RoLLBit platform, then by investing there, you can keep long-term staking, in which your profit will come and long-term investment will also be made.",

The room for profit is very low when you use ATH and ATL as a boundary for the price. The price is due to the previous update about the major upgrade. The first upgrade already dropped which is the on-site exchange and the other one is probably an airdrop or something but since an upgrade is already uncovered. I doubt that the hype due to the excitement will continue. This all happened when Rollbit experience a setback when they have an issue with their license. I think the team created this hype to cover that issue.Trade safe. We have a lot of time to buy this before though. Now is not that much a good time unless you are really decided to ape on this.",

All types of altcoins have risks to invest in, even BTC alone also has risks, but for BTC in the long term it is more reliable to invest because BTC is the only crypto that is very promising in the future.Coming back to the topic, long term investing in gambling tokens is not really recommended as these types of tokens are centralized so their value can change significantly with some action.If want to take advantage in a short time, maybe you can rely on it, but for the long term, you should just avoid it.But still, as you said, an investor must continue to follow the development of the gambling token so that he can take action if there is an increase or decrease in price because we can see that some gambling tokens fail to develop and do not have a sufficiently satisfactory value.For RLB itself, it is currently quite good, but who knows what it will be like in the future, it is clear that you have to be careful if you want to invest in gambling tokens.",

After reading this thread, I did some research about RLB and found it to be a part of the Rollbit lottery. The past one-year performance of this token is looking good, and if someone wants to invest in it, then they need diamond hands. I cannot speculate on the future price, but I understand that it completely depends on the performance of the Rollbit lottery. I assume they have significantly increased their user base for the price to spike up significantly.",

I see this tokens dumping than continuing to increase in price unless there's some positive news that'll be coming in future to keep the price increasing higher.

It is currently active and popular within the community, which has led to the coin having significant value. However, it's up to you to analyze whether the current price allows for further improvement.
