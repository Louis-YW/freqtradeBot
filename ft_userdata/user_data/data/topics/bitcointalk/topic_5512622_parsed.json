So if you BTC from SmokeTooMuch for $1000 then you might have around 200,000 BTC which is worth $12,144,000,000.00 with the current price today.

I was about to put $20 into it but someone stopped me and on that day the price was .12 cents per bitcoin. IF I would have bought then today I might have had 167 coins and that translates to $15,030,000 at today's exchange rate. Safe to say I effed up lmao only $20 invested would net you 15 Mil today!

Quote from: robertcarlyle on November 14, 2024, 03:39:27 PMIf someone bought 1000 usd of bitcoin on January 1, 2011, would it make a huge difference buying on that date vs may 16, 2011 for the same amount? How much would that bitcoin be worth today if bought on January of 2011? 200 million usd or more? How would it make a difference?Anyway, my wild guess would be over $800 billion because the lowest price record in 2010 is $0.06 per bitcoin, so since its 2009 it should be lower than that. That said,  you will beat satoshi in terms of holdings.  just look at the price here. https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin/historical-price/",
