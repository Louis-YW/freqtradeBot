  "content": "While Tulsi doesn't seem to be as able to immediately respond to questions as does Kari Lake (Arizona), It seems that Tulsi is just as in favor of MAGA as Kari Lake is. Now Tulsi is coming right out into the open with what is going on in the Democrat party. I personally think that she is waking up to the fact that this has been going on for decades.Tulsi Gabbard is Right – The Democratic Party is a Cabal of WarmongersQuote from: https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/politics/tulsi-gabbard-is-right-the-democratic-party-is-a-cabal-of-warmongers/The Democratic Party has radically transformed to \"a cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness,\" Gabbard said. The party has altered its views to such a far-left point that their ideals are no longer based in democracy.\"I can no longer remain in today's Democratic Party that is now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness, who divide us by racializing every issue and stoke anti-white racism, actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms enshrined in our Constitution, are hostile to people of faith and spirituality, demonize the police and protect criminals at the expense of law-abiding Americans, believe in open borders, weaponize the national security state to go after political opponents, and above all, are dragging us ever closer to nuclear war.\"The Democratic Party has indeed undermined the entire Constitution with an aim to remove all our freedoms under the guise of \"equality,\" while the powerful elites who run the nation prosper and are immune from their own laws. The \"cowardly wokeness\" has certainly racialized every issue in an attempt to DIVIDE us. The Treasury just created a racial equality board, banks have said they would begin issuing special mortgages for people of color, and even Kamala Harris said that whites would be the last to receive aid after Hurricane Ian. The true enemy is not your neighbor but the state.We are no longer energy independent due to woke climate change policies. There would not be an energy crisis in America had Biden not taken office—illegally. Countless government funds are placed into \"climate initiatives\" that never see the light of day....",

Don Bolduc, who won the Republican primary and is campaigning against Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), confirmed in a statement Wednesday that Gabbard will be stumping for him.\"We don't agree on every issue, but I am honored to have the support of Tulsi Gabbard who shares my view that the status quo is broken, and we need a change of direction,\" Bolduc said in a statement. \"Tulsi is a fellow change agent and independent-minded outsider willing to speak truth to power.\"Bolduc, notably, was endorsed by former President Donald Trump earlier this year.He added, \"I am going to spend every day between now and election day building a wide coalition of supporters that includes Republicans, independents, and even disaffected Democrats who know that Senator Hassan is a career politician and must be retired.\"Gabbard drew headlines on Tuesday when she announced she was leaving the Democratic Party. The former Hawaii congresswoman was a candidate for the Democrats in the 2020 presidential election after having served multiple terms in the House of Representatives.\"If you can no longer stomach the direction that the so-called woke Democratic Party ideologues are taking our country, then I invite you to join me,\" she in a video posted on Twitter. Democrats, Gabbard added, \"divide us by racializing every issue & stoking anti-white racism, who actively work to undermine our God-given freedoms enshrined in our Constitution.\"...",
