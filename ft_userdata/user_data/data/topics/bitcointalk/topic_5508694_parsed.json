Who (or what process) decides if the removed transaction will be broadcast again?Most wallets, as far as I know, have an option to rebroadcast a transaction. Some of them do it automatically, while others require you to do it manually.Plus, you can use some of the public services, like https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/pushtx/ or https://blockchair.com/broadcast, or the so-called \"free transaction accelerators\" that will do it for you.Quote from: pomme7000 on September 08, 2024, 06:39:58 PMAre there any statistics on the percentage of transactions that get removed and never make it into the blockchain?I dont know of any. Due to the decentralized nature of the blockchain (each node maintains its own mempool), Im unsure if such data can even be collected reliably.",

To some holding area, I assume, for possible inclusion in the next block? What is the name of the holding area and where does it reside? Thx.Hosseinimr93 has pretty much said most of it. The fees on the bitcoin network as well as fee rate on the MEMPOOL is dynamic meaning it's not fixed it changes depending on average fees. The average closing fees on an already confirmed block would likely be the opening average fee for a new block. This simply means that if more bitcoin users decide to increase the fee rate they are making use of in their transactions just for them to get their transactions confirmed faster then the average fee rate on that block will increase also.Nodes have a minimal fee rate known as purge fee. It's the smallest fee that would be ever considered by miners to be confirmed. Transactions with fees below the purge fee will be dropped automatically from the MEMPOOL and as fees go up the purge fee tends to increase also too.",

Who (or what process) decides if the removed transaction will be broadcast again?Just as you have been told, each node has their own individual mempool, there is no general mempool, so node A can remove your tx from their mempool, but node B could still have it in theirs, this is because nodes receive tx's at different times and they can also configure their mempool differently on how long a tx will remain in their mempool.The BTC network is decentralized, so there is no single authority that decides anything, you can rebroadcast you tx and some wallet softwares also rebroadcasts tx's automatically. Take note that rebroadcasting tx's does not mean that it will be added into a block and confirmed, if your tx is stuck, you either have to use rbf or cpfp to get it confirmed.",

Who (or what process) decides if the removed transaction will be broadcast again?Anyone in the world that has the raw transaction can rebroadcast the transaction. If the transaction is rebroadcasted and it's still valid, it will be recevied by nodes again. Again, take note that any node has its own mempool. Even if majority of nodes remove a transaction from their mempool, it's possible that some still have it and the transaction gets confirmed.",

      "body": "other thing to noteeach node has its own mempool.. general nodes do not prioritise transactions when the mempool fills up in regards to block creationjsut when their memory is full and they have to disgardÂ  transactions, which in most cases is to disgard the cheapest txhowever there are mining pools which actually manage the creation of blocks and these are the special nodes that select the transactions to add into a block candidate. they do not wait for their mempool to be full before choosing transactions. they instead start selecting transactions when each new block attempt is made. whether the mempool is full or not. even in a near empty mempool of unconfirmed transactions waiting. a mining pool can choose any reasons to let any transaction it wants into its block candidate, or ignore it and let it drop.. most mining pools however(due to obvious profit/bonus) will choose the most expensive fee transactions they currently have waiting, emphasis even if the mempool is not fullmeaning the mempools of other nodes might actually only contain cheap fee transactions for weeks as the mining pool nodes are picking up and confirming the expensive ones first, leaving the cheaper fee transactions in normal nodes mempools waiting for weekswhat is also worth noting is when a mempool is gaining a bigger amount of transactions waiting, users hoping to get their transactions confirmed sooner into a block will want to and do compete with the other transactions waiting, and so users then rebroadcast their transaction by altering the amounts being moved to raise the fee and replace the old cheaper transaction with the more expensive transaction to beat the competing transactions waiting. so cheapest tx are not just dropped when mempool fills but also old cheaper fee transactions dropped if the sender resends a tx with a higher fee to replace the old transaction",

There are many newbies who learned a lot in this forum such as myself when I started years ago. What they explained is true and I have experienced myself where my transaction didn't get included in the next block due to low fee and It almost take a week for my transaction to get confirmed yo the next block. As for the fee this time is that low fee transactions have a chance now to be included in the block since the fee is low compared before.",

What OP is talking about is the purging fee rate, not minimum relay fee rate. When the network is congested and the size of the mempool reaches a certain amount, the node starts to remove transactions with low fee rates, so that there's a room for transactions with higher fee rates.Currently, the minimum relay fee rate is 1 sat/vbyte for any node with default settings.",

It has a size cap defined by the client and is a portion of your RAM. Something like 300 MB. When it is filled and the node receives a new transaction they have to decide which ones they want to keep in their RAM.Since miners prefer transactions with higher fee (to maximize their revenue) the nodes start discarding transactions that pay the lowest fees and accept new transactions that used higher fee rates. The transactions in their memory with rates lower than that threshold are simply discarded (or dropped from memory) freeing up memory space for others.",

Thx.One of the reasons why a node reject a transaction is because of the lower transaction fee and this may be seen after it has been long due for confirmation but still remains on the mempool because of low transaction fee, we could always avoid this by ensuring to look into the mempool size and fee rate before making a transaction.To your question in proper, a transaction is sent back to the senders wallet if the node reject it for some particular reason, but i keep wondering why some node may not do the same for overstayed transactions unconfirmed, they remain on the mempool and were not rejected for long.",

When the transaction is unconfirmed, no transaction has actually been made and there is nothing to be sent back to the wallet.
