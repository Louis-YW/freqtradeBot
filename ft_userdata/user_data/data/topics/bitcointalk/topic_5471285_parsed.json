There are some software that can calculate this for you, but it's much easier to use getdescriptorinfo and pass the descriptor without checksum, in order to fetch it.Example can be found here: https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getdescriptorinfo.html",

Code work ok then. It just a problem with this particular address. A lot needed to know about bitcoin internals. I'm heard first time about '50 non-spendable bitcoins of the genesis block'.",

Add that address to wallet so it'll be indexed by Bitcoin Core. First rescan is slow, but afterwards you only need to use wallet RPC call. 2. Run either self-hosted Electrum server or block-explorer which index all Bitcoin address.",

I'm heard first time about '50 non-spendable bitcoins of the genesis block'.Oh, yeah. It is mainly encyclopedic knowledge, but it might seem strange to anyone programming Bitcoin. For some reason, Satoshi decided to not include the coinbase transaction to the global transaction database (you can confirm this by getrawtransaction). Maybe he did to not be called a preminer as genesis block was mined before he released the very first Bitcoin client binaries.",
