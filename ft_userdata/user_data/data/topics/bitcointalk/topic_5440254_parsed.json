A whale will not gonna buy bulk tokens without any info that will signal them to buy. This kind of inside trading is common on crypto since SEC doesn’t monitor all the crypto projects unlike typical physical company.I  believe exchange themselves is doing this kind of trick since they knew all the tokens that will be listed in advance especially Binance. This will continue to happened until all exchange will be regulated by the SEC. Maybe this is the reason why CZ keeps running from regulators because his business including insider trade will be busted.",

Another thing is the damage they are going to cause to the traded token after pulling it off with their gain. Any exchange or employee who is found guilty of such a crime should be sanctioned to prevent future damage.",

Recently a trader have profited $100k+ in profit in less than an hour. Inside trading is an offence and it should be taken seriously. It can give certain individual an unfair advantage but ultimately it damages the reputation of exchange and erodes the trust of the financial system. It can also damage the reputation of traded token or asset. This is why most the financial regulators, including SEC have very strict rules against it and take tough stance on enforcement.Ultimately, maintaining the integrity of the financial markets is crucial for the long term health and stability of the economy. By taking a tough stance against inside trading, we can ensure that market is fair and transparent for all participants.",

It's because when I see someone tells me about such information, I consider them as a scam. Because in this market, you rarely see those actual things happen. But if it's really existing and if there's a punishment about it where the token is being traded then exchanges like Binance will act accordingly for those they suspect part of its circle.",

Hopefully they think by talking about it to more people, there will be more demand and price will rise.I don't like it. It is like the early comers eat late comers. Let the market do its movement naturally and if you pick good cryptocurrency at good time point, you will gain profit.Quotethat's why seek for a good opportunity for having a reliable people will told you about the possible price pump coins.Who can tell you possible pumping coins?If you join signal groups, you are like fresh meat for group owners or they can have a secret groups with owners and a few closest friends. As a normal member, you will receive signals after those guys in closed group and you will buy at higher price than them.If you look for signals from others, you are not trading but are betting with belief that they are kind and honest people and don't each you like their fresh meat.",

If it was me I wouldn't have bought at 12$ because there is every tendency it will drop more lower.",

So, the probable catch is our subscription fees is the main revenue for them and by selling same signal to multiple people, they may try to pump one particular coin.These are all kind of scam attempts but no one is bothering such things because we are losing very small amount which is the main encouraging point for those scammers hence they keep attempting with different group name and with different coins and tokens.",
