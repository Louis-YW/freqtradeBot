I consider him one of Africa's greatest entrepreneurs mostly with the completion of Africa's biggest refinery, in Lagos. It is an enormous achievement by a true visionary.So, he was advising young entrepreneurs to be careful in spending their money, mostly as the business is still growing, that living flamboyant lifestyle should be reduced to the barest minimum. Instead the money should be saved or reinvested if the success of the business is the ultimate goal. He said he doesn't have a house abroad and it is not a do die affair to own one. Nigerians has expressed their opinions on the advice he gave, and am asking it here to know what we feel he should have added to the advice of reinvesting, besides saving or not buying real estate abroad?This is the discussion over the radio on Max FM this morning.",

Dangote is indeed a successful entrepreneur, and the completion of the Africa’s largest refinery in Lagos is a great achievement. But it’s important to note that such project wasn’t solely financed from Dangote’s personal wealth. Large scale projects like these often involve different sources of funding, partnerships and government support. Let’s not shy away from the fact that so many corrupt Nigerian politicians have hidden under the shadow/name of Dangote to be a part of this project.Anyways, his advice is well appreciated.",
