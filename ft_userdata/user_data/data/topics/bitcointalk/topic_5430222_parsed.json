Modifying isn't completely prohibited but the original works still have the highest value. Good luck mate!I haven't thought about plagiarism.

Thanks to my friend sujonali1819 he did remind me about it. I choose the combination of green and black as the theme colors, and the sig illustrates how the coin mixer works, which the traceable coins (shown as silver coins) enters to the Sinbad logo, as the mixer, then produces the untraceable coins (gold ones) as the result. I don't put many clues about what project Sinbad is, so out of curiosity, people might click the banner and try to find out themselves.Thank you and good luck guys.",

So you still have some time (24hours) to make a few retouch on your signature and avatar design, if you think it's not worth the taste you had in mind. However, I wish everybody the best of luck, as we await to see who finally emerge the winner of this contest. Happy New year in advance to you all.",
