I think that was the height of the blocksize wars, with the hard forks of shitcoin cash and others, aside from the danger of flippening that there was with Eth eating into Bitcoin. But we see after the years that the danger passed and Bitcoin continued to be declared dead without anything really happening.Looking at the downward trend, if next year we enter the bull market as expected, the death of Bitcoin will hardly be announced.",

There see just some people that do not bother to speculate on the existence of bitcoin but prefer to just call it dead at all time. In the year 2023, as positive as it was, some people still saying such stupid words. They can continue to call bitcoin that, but all-time-high is coming which is what that matters to me and people that hold bitcoin.",

They also have to learn from their painful lessons and avoid repeating it again.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsIf they did not store coins on FTX exchange, and just hodl their coins in non custodial wallets, they are good now.Quote from: Ambatman on December 22, 2023, 06:19:32 AMI was among those who were affected by this type of newsLess exposure to social media, news will help you to have less panic, uncontrollable emotion and bad decisions.QuoteBut thanks to knowledgeKnowledge then experience do help you to go through similar fud or black swan events in future.If you were affected by it, you will now from now, you must store your bitcoin in non custodial wallets, not on centralized exchanges.",

It goes up, reaches its peak then slowly goes down. Same with this one. The peak was in 2017 when China banned ICOs in their country and Jamie Dimon is saying that Bitcoin is a fraud. Very funny that after many people are saying that Bitcoin is dead, it's still here giving profits to those who are holding it, and changing the lives of some investors both in a good and bad way.Anyway, I guess there will be a time when that phrase will never be used, or at least only a few will use it. Nevertheless, I see that phrase as irrelevant already because we've already seen that Bitcoin is still here even though many are trying to ban it. Bitcoin is here to stay like what others are saying.",

It is impossible to miss out on the Bitcoin market where the popularity of Bitcoin and the number of its users has grown steadily and continues to grow. Users now trust Bitcoin enough and Bitcoin has now become one of the most trusted cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin will end this year's journey between 40,000 and 45,000 dollars before the end of 2023 and Bitcoin will start a new journey in 2024. It wouldn't be surprising if Bitcoin reached its all-time high this year as Bitcoin has been very positive over the past few months. Bitcoin may not touch its highest price this year but hopefully Bitcoin will definitely touch its highest price next year.",

It is an unofficial recognition for survival of Bitcoin.Ignorance caused by misinformation is one of the reason why people predict the death of Bitcoin. I have also been in the category of people that predicted the death of Bitcoin. The reason was that I never knew the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins. It I common to see altcoins come and disappear or die in few weeks. That was why I thought that the same fate will befall Bitcoin. If these critics understand how bitcoin works I think they will change that death perception. As we can see from the graph that Bitcoin education and awareness is increasing everyday which has made people to gradually change this perception. Maybe in the next two to five years , majority of the world population would have understood that just like the dollars and other leading currencies of the world, Bitcoin will never cease to exist. Quote from: sunsilk on December 22, 2023, 11:10:09 AMWe have been seeing the changes and less people or financial institutions calling it dead because there are so much adoption that's been happening on their sectors. Many of the institutions that championed the media war against Bitcoin for many years now want to benefit from it. These anti-bitcoin forces did everything possible to destroy the coin but all the effort failed. They are now the ones that are spending money to advertise Bitcoin to the world.",

And it’s true that by the end of this year, bitcoin was again the most alive of all the living. It even came to life in terms of price jumps and mempool overload. It is impossible to call bitcoin dead if queues are lining up to confirm transactions , which means at a minimum an increase in demand and need for bitcoin. In general, we see the opposite effect of the death of bitcoin.",

And anyone who want your dead must plan evil against you. And there is no way those people are not planning evil against you. But karma and nemesis is always on the way to them.

That fear must be in the early years of adoption, when people were not sure of what to make of a decentralized digital currency, that has no physical presence. Not in this present days that investors have tested and are testifying it's profitability, infact Bitcoin has proven itself to be a valued asset that can be trusted to last as long as time permits. Bitcoin bear and bull runs will always give it relevance, where more investors will want to enter and take advantage to increase their ROI.",

Bitcoin isn't deadApart from the fact that many other people in the world today are still skeptical about Bitcoin, those old ant-bitcoiners who stood at the point of saying Bitcoin was dead in the past years when the price got so bad got disappointed. There is definitely a lot of FUD in the history of Bitcoin, and it cannot stop because humans are designed in such a way that we love it mostly when we are only on the winning side, but each time it becomes rough and things get a bit bumpy, then we begin to complain, forgetting that there were times when it was all good with the same thing we are frowning at.Although Bitcoin has proven to so many people how persistent it is in the crypto space, that doesn't mean that everyone is convinced; some people will still cause FUD, mostly if any bad incident erupts.Yeah, it's yet another year coming to an end, and Bitcoin is still alive. IMO, it will definitely continue to live. What could be worse than the past price dump that Bitcoin has greatly outstripped?Quote we could look at the BIG dips like this:2011   - From $32 to $2  = 93.75%   2013a   - From $263 to $63  = 76% 2013b   - From $1,163 to $153  = 87%2017   - From $19,666 to $3,124  = 84%  (this one looks right)2020   - From July 2019 $13,880 to $3,850  = 72%  or alternatively  From February 2020 - $10,200 to $3,850  = 62%2021   - From late 2021 $69,000 to $15,479  = 87.5% and probably the one they are referring to is from early 2021 $64.5k-ish to $28.8k-ish.  = 55%But there have been various other BIG dips in the midst of those dips.  There were many that were greater than 25%..",

As long as the mining community is still mining, Bitcoin will remain alive, their activity is a vital organ that keeps the network functional and operational. For those who have doubts about Bitcoin long term durability, they should look at market sentiment towards Bitcoin to add insight into the Crypto market as a whole.
