However, they play a big role in the market, attracting investors as well as helping new projects come to life. As the crypto market has been through major highs and lows over the recent years, launchpads are a new way to keep the market thriving. One of the best launchpads to do this is AdLunam.Launchpads have played an important role in the crypto market by encouraging new projects to be created. AdLunam is one of the best launchpads in the market, and its key feature is its NFT integrated model. They allows project creators to customise their presale by having the choice of what type of pricing they want (eg, dynamic or static), adding bonuses for users, and more. This is encouraging for project creators and inspires more people to start their own project and become a contender in the market.Learn more about them here: adlunam.cc",
