You don't have to drag everyone into what you believe to be right or wrong. Since this is the internet, you should expect to see this kind of behavior, but as long as they are not endorsing a dubious project or using another person's identity to their advantage, they are just trolls. Painting such a person red would be a waste of time because it wouldn't stop him from trolling.

It’s a clear negative tag IMO.I think neutral is more appropriate, but I leave that to each individual to decide. In addition, the member in question mainly uses the Bitcoin discussion board for his posts, and in that board trust feedbacks are not visible. This makes sense from the forum's point of view, because that system is primarily used for something other than evaluating someone's personality. Unfortunately, many (including me personally) use it inappropriately in some situations.https://ninjastic.space/user/BitcoinMoses",

Scammers come and go, and we will never be able to catch and tag them all. But, they do tend to leave after the scam is done, or they have so much negative feedback and so many active flags that they can't scam easily anymore. People like this need to be called out each and every time they post until they leave. Ignore only works to a point, then you have to move to another method.theymos / the mods don't want to be censors, and that is fine, we just have to keep up the pressure on the trolls because they won't ban them.-Dave",

Their only purpose is to get a rise out of you and make our forum a worse place to be, so don't give them the satisfaction. Instead, focus on what matters: making connections with people who will enjoy and value your contributions.

The style of writing is the least relevant here, because someone a little more intelligent can very easily copy it, which does not prove that it is the same person.I would solve it in a very simple way, anyone who appears on the forum claiming to be Satoshi would be given 24 hours to prove it or be permanently banned - such members have zero value for the forum.",
