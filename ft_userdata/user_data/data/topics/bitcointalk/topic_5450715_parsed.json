  "content": "QuoteA vigilante hacker burned roughly $300,000 worth of Bitcoin found in almost a thousand addresses allegedly linked to Russian intelligence agencies through the OP_RETURN function in 2022, according to Chainalysis research. The anonymous vigilante reportedly found 986 unique Bitcoin addresses between March 2022 and April 2022 that they claimed were used by Russian security agencies. They leaked the addresses using the text storage capabilities of the OP_RETURN function which is used to mark BTC transactions as invalid and burnt the majority of BTC contained within the addresses.The vigilante also sent some of the BTC to an address used to collect donations for Ukraine with the message:“Help Ukraine with money from the GRU Khakir.”They used three other messages to mark the addresses:“GRU to SVR. Used for hacking!”“GRU to GRU. Used for hacking!”“GRU to FSB. Used for hacking!”GRU is the Russian Foreign Military Intelligence Agency; the SVR is the Foreign Intelligence Service; and the FSB is the Federal Security Service — all three are intelligence agencies.SourceThis is definitely not the first time for government agencies to be targeted by hackers, The recent is from a vigilante hacker, who hacked and burned the Bitcoin of the wallet addresses belonging to Russian intelligence agencies and sent some as donations to Ukraine during this trying times.",

It doesn't make sense to send only a tiny portion to Ukraine following the hacker's logic.I am also very sceptical. Why would high-ranking government agencies store some of their funds on a CEX?I would be surprised if the FSB, GRU and SVR kept their bitcoins in a hotwallet or on a CEX.Or maybe they stored seedphrases or private keys online or in an insecure way? I would be very surprised, we are not talking about 14 year olds hiding in their bedrooms but about some of the most competent government agencies in the world...In any case I agree with Jet Cash, I have the feeling that all this is a bit of propaganda and an attempt to discredit Bitcoin one more time.",

That’s totally not something I would be euphoric about.",

I did not see any mention of such things in the post itself. Russia could very well go to hell but I believe this is a matter to worry about because I haven't heard about burning Bitcoin ever. Also didn't know anything about OP_RETURN function. A google search also didn't yield anything much useful.",

If someone knowledgeable can enlighten us, that will be great! It could be a huge security threat for the people like us as well.OP_RETURN is a type of command used by the bitcoin software which marks a UTXO as invalid. Such outputs do not have a private key, and there is no script which could unlock them. Therefore, any coins sent to an OP_RETURN output are burned and can never be spent. There is no security threat.On searching the blockchain, I found 915 transactions which include OP_RETURN outputs with the string \"Иcпoльзoвaны для xaкингa!\", which is Russian for \"Used for hacking!\" as the article points out.Some of the transactions have no coins being burnt, and instead include the empty OP_RETURN output with the above string and dust outputs to hundreds of other addresses. The person in question would presumably do this to draw attention to their transactions. For example: https://mempool.space/tx/2deb61815c8aff5fe89c39bd8ab632b1110f70be3b9fba52b1f77d68e3bbc622And then some of the transactions do indeed burn not-insignificant amounts of bitcoin to OP_RETURN outputs, again with the above string. For example: https://mempool.space/tx/a7cfa39733d905eb68c421d4552720cc5198f7be4b163715447b698627d102b1",

The hacker might have found a way to get the private keys from those Russian intelligence agencies. Such events can take place with high level agencies then normal users who aren't well aware about technology can easily get hacked.It is a concern because many people start their journey into crypto world without getting proper knowledge about security. Such users can be penetrated by the hackers and the innocent users will lose their savings that they have invested into crypto. It should be wise to teach them about the security measures so that they can protect themselves from such hacking attacks.The good thing about that hacker is the genericity towards Ukrainian people, but the worst thing is that he burnt those Bitcoins. If he was truly a good hacker then he should have transferred the whole amount to Ukrainian government rather than burning those coins.",
