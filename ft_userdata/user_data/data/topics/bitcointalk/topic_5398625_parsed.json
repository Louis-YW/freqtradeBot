For the past days we saw an exponential downward spiral where more and more LUNA were minted in a desperate attempt to maintain the peg for UST. Unfortunately there are too many UST still outstanding and LUNA's marketcap is already way too small to stay a reserve currency for all those UST. I would stay away from LUNA, whatever they try to save it, it won't be to the benefit of the current UST or LUNA holders.",

In the best case, price can double at this point but it will go down more, in my opinion. Don't jump on Hype and use stop loss always. What’s the current deal between CZ? LUNA can burn their supply, and that could be a game change especially if they are going to burn more supplies since right now minting is not possible. There’s a lot of new investors because of the current HYPE, we can’t really know what’s next for LUNA and since the team promise to stay, $1 can still happen in the right time and many will surely be happy to see that price again with LUNA. High risk, High reward better to know your side now.",

Be greedy when others are fearful, this is the quote circulating on social media, it looks like everyone jumps in when they saw 1500% pump today, this is risky and you should be ready for whatever the result is. Many already lose money with LUNA, just use your extra money and invest at least a small amount of money. If LUNA can hit $1, most probably it will rise higher but of course this will take more time.",

The fact that the supply was more than 6 trillions and with 1 dollar value and the marketcap will be even doubled compared with the biggest company in the world like apple. This is a non sense thing to see a company with garbage product can surpass apple just used FOMO. That thing will never come true",

I hope that it would, at the end of the day too many people lost money and I would love it if the price goes back up so that everyone would earn, why wouldn't I want people to earn, but I doubt it. This is the dilemma of the people who are realistic, if you are saying the truth that you believe, then it will be quite difficult for you to get liked because you are saying things that people do not want to hear.

The point is CZ says where is the BTC which they say is for UST backup, why isn't it actually used for backup? Cz Binance Twitter",

Look at their justifications; at least, that is how I would expect these guys to compensate for their mistakes.And personally, I don't participate in the game that people think is luck here because it only has to fail  , I have also seen some friends who have spent money to buy again when the price of the fish is too much 0 but they still suffer the pain of not controlling their own money. For those who have money left over, pay attention to buying coins like BTC ETH BNB... because it won't fail like LUNA. Take a look at the last few days after strong market volatility. I'm sure you guys elephants have hoarded more crypto for their own use and will have the tricks to push the market price again. We sold investors will spend money again to save the losses and scenarios during this period, which perhaps will be even worse.",

Binance Labs invested $3m USD in Terra (the layer 0 blockchain) in 2018. UST came much later after our initial investment.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1525754773626097669Binance's CEO has also urged the Terra team to be more transparent, in particular in regards to on-chain transactions.QuoteThe last few days, we tried hard to support the Terra community. In my tweets, I am simply pointing out the potential issues from my understanding. Minting, forking, don’t create value. Buying back, burning does, but requires funds. Funds that the project team may not have.In this regard, I would like to see more transparency from them. Much more! Including specific on-chain transactions (txids) of all the funds. Relying on 3rd party analysis is not sufficient or accurate. This is the first thing that should have happened.https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1525754777170231298",
