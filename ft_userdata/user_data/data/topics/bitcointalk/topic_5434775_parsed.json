The exchanges are not having a nice time, go with what you trust.",

That was the same question I asked one of our late members – Becky666, the first time I interacted with him. That number is ominous, for me. QuoteIn general, this is not the right time to be looking for new exchanges as if you are looking for new gambling sites with faucet. The exchanges are not having a nice time, go with what you trust.Exactly! Why would anyone who wants to choose an exchange not look at the trust rating of the exchange in the first place? I mean, one can easily find that on coin sites like coingecko and CMC. It's an easy thing to do.",

They even displace Huobi's announcement flyer.It's a big scam, and forget about the money you deposited there. Next time, be very vigilant and ask around if you are not sure about the exchange. The domain name alone is a dead giveaway that the site shouldn't be trusted.",

Thank God you haven’t linked the exchange’s link here in the post. Moreover how did you know that they guys have looted the money and that’s from also the investor. And who the hell invests in these type of businesses without any prior verification? If the traders are being scammed, then they are the only ones to be blamed. There are tons of popular exchanges out there, but they still went for these exchanges, so yes scam was in their fate. My condolences are with the scam victims.",

      "body": "According to the review done by \"scamadviser.com\" they seemed to be some red flags about the website. Although I didn't bother to check out the website itself I think it will be a waste of time and energy. According to \"scamadviser\" the owner of the website is not revealing his/her identity and that's what most scam site does. They hide their identity to that when there are through with their scam activity they can disappear into thin air without traces.Quote from: ahash04 on January 15, 2023, 04:58:14 AMDoes anyone have any experience about btgg666, i heard its a big scam, they have looted investor's money...Since you already know that it's a scam site I don't see any reason why you would still be requesting for more information about it. Just go with the fact that it's scam and avoid using it so as to also avoid story that touches the heart.",
