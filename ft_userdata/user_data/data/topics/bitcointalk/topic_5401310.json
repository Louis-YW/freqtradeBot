  "content": "Ups and downs of crypto price are the crypto way. Happens all the time. Happens to both old and new crypto. Crypto is for holding for a long time for maximum profit.Recalling History : Bitcoin went from $19,000 to $3,000 Then to #60,000Ethereum went from $1,000 to $80 Then to $4,000Dogecoin went from $0.001 $0.00008 Then to $0.1BNB went from $400 to $60 Then to $500And we also know, that Shiba INU from worth $1000  down to $2 for almost a year. Later Shiba INU worth $1,000 became $10m! How do you think people got rich in crypto and hold Crypto worth tens of thousands and millions?The answer is that they buy when the price is very low like in the current market. Now is the time to buy. That being said, Bitcoin before went from $19k down to $ 3k and smart people bought Bitcoin at $ 3k! The same thing is happening again. Crypto price is all about up and down. The rich buy crypto when the price is very low like now, keep it and the price increase 10 times + from $1 to $100+ then they sell with huge profit. So make sure to buy Crypto now and wait.",

But yes sure, can't believe a $1k worth of Shib is now worth $2.   Lots of so called experts actually are saying we are at the bottom already which there could be a bull run again. We may not know until it happen but hey if you are willing to wait, just do it. As long as you won't spend your BTC and wait for the price to go up, you won't lose anything. There - that should be encouraging.",

      "body": "You already know the answer But unfortunately, a lot of people who join crypto don't know exactly what to do so they just buy and wait and sell when the price drops. Many of them can't wait for the price to increase again because they only hope that the price will increase quickly once they buy.If they continued to think like that, they wouldn't gain as big as people who had already obtained it but they would only suffer losses. Investing in crypto is all about patience and choosing a good coin to hold so that it will pay off in the future.",

Therefore the majority of panic stricken posts and messages come in from the random group of users who bought in at the wrong time. These people are new and less knowledgeable about market movements and they are the targets of whales to sell on.When a bear market is ongoing, selling will happen from these weak hands and not from the whales. While there may be some holders selling as well it is usually less in number.Either way, newbies who got affected by the bear market, should learn their lesson at patience and how to hold through a bear market instead of panicking.",

Price is down now but some are still predicting more fall to $8k-10k. So some decide to jump in now because of bull FOMO while strong willed predictors still feel it has more bear to do. Up and down is rthym of the market for sure but I expect another ATH after the next halving.",

And $1,666, just in case, in case anything unexpected happens, I mean even lower vantage point, point 2.Sure, if I'm going to do such a method.Trading/investing options like that, you will most likely reduce the risk of big losses, profit if it is currently lower and will go to another month, what if the fall is worse.",

Most of them call this as blood bath, crypto going to hell and what not. But thats completely non sense, they forget that this is the real opportunity and one should not be bending it over. Many of them cried when bitcoin went from 3k to 60k in the past, they did not even try to buy it when it was slowly moving towards new high. Always kept asking question like when bitcoin movement will stop, is this opportunity to buy and what not! That's completely insane, they should buy and keep buying when such bear trend is on the way.",

Also, only valuable alts will have the chance to increase their price throughout the years. But if the foundation is weak and the team is anonymous, the likelihood that they will disappear in the market is very high. So if you have long-term plans with your coins, better be selective with your investments. One sure thing that won't disappear is bitcoin. So for me, you can always include btc in your portfolio.",
