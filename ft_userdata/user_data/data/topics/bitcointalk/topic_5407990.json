This proves that you are serious about the traffic that you guys will get from Bitcointalk and really value it.Moreover I can see that the site accepts both FIAT and crypto deposits. So which country payment methods are available, if a person wants to deposit in FIAT?I can also see that you have a deposit bonus, it would be great if you can also mention about the wagering requirements that we need to fulfil in order to withdraw the funds.The site seems promising to me, just do some great promotions, and I am sure you will get potential gamblers from here.",

You are only allowed to use VPN if you are just using it for your privacy and not for accessing games that restricted to your country.I saw this interesting terms under Use of Player account.QuoteWe reserve the right to make a phone call to the number provided in your user account, which at our own discretion can be a necessary part of the KYC procedure. Withdrawals may be terminated until the account is fully verified. We will make reasonable efforts trying to contact you regarding the withdrawal of the funds, but if we are not able to reach you (by email or phone) in two (2) weeks as from the date of the request for withdrawal, account will be locked, since you have failed to pass the KYC procedure.Lastly max bet usually varies in each games based on the software provider limits.",
