If customers find out that they have been targeted with shill marketing, they often feel cheatedMore on this: https://www.smartcapitalmind.com/what-is-shill-marketing.htmSo if shilling is the kind of marketing that you are going to apply I don't think people will trust your product or service.Care to drop your project so people will avoid it?",
