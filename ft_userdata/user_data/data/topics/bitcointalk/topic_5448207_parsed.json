  "content": "As you know, there are a lot of new blockchains launching in Q2 2023, many of them with superior technical specs and features to currently used L1 and L2 chains. Shardeum for example allows thousands of normal users to be validators and is like Ethereum but with sharding. It's backed by WazirX exchange, which is the biggest exchange in India. SUI was created by former Facebook DIEM developers and can do over 150k TPS. Q Blockchain is EVM compatible like Ethereum and has 5 second blocks but the biggest upgrade that it has over the blockchains launched currently is that it includes a legal document called the \"constitution\" built into the protocol which protects users on the chain and enables root nodes to monitor and control validators. There is a DAO built into the protocol along with digital ID, staking, escrow, DeFi etc. and gas fees spent on DApps in the portal are redistributed to Q holders. It's also unique in that there are built in synthetic assets like USD, stocks and Gold. You can get the aforementioned coins and Q before it lists on an exchange by heading over to Zealy and performing simple bounty tasks.",

I understand that a new one makes people salivate because they want to make a ton of profit from new projects, since there is a potential of breakout but let's be real when you you invest into something like that there is a likely chance that you will lose all of your money and it is a risk you don't need.Just buy and use stuff like eth, bnb, sol and so forth which are good ones and if you want extra layer get matic, and these are all great stuff and you should be doing fine, these are maybe old but they will make you a profit without a doubt.",

Sui mainnet will be launch soon and there is no free airdrop for Early supporter or community. Tye only benefit Sui team given to community is allowing discord server member and sui capy winners to join IEO in exchange. All those discord members who joined SUI official discord group before 1 Feb 2023 will be eligible for taking parts in IEO.Now our focus should be on ZKSYNC and Starknet which can be a biggest Chain in term of transaction and Airdrop. Fee of both chain is very high and you have to pay 20$ above just for official bridge and 2$ above per transaction (Swap, Add liquidity, Mint Nft). i have done all and waiting for mainnet to be launch this year .",

Perhaps next time we will see more projects and airdrop programs for early users, I have also observed many people are pouring into the hunt for new airdrops.

Syntethic tokens have existed for a long time now. Imho they are quite pointless as they are not real stocks, only representing value of stocks.And there indeed are plenty of other projects planned to launch in 2023 as well, but the problem is that they are only plans, that especially with L1 tech can delay indefinitely. With experimental tech comes unforseen problems and depending how experimental the new chain is, it can face many delays as it's imperative that chain holding so much value don't have any bigs to exploit.",

Arbitrum is new and it was still on hype but it will be like the others later on. When more people use them, they can experience an issue and there will be another alternative that will be created after that. This is a never-ending loop here in crypto.Leverage bet/trade is very risky so you might be right that users of this function are the ones who get the highest airdrop amount from ARB. They deserved that but I doubt if all of them are earning a nice profit out of the airdrop.",

I mean sure if you are fast and cheap then you would be liked, but there are already cheap and fast ones people can use even today. Look at tron, look at sol, those are cheap, nearly free for some cases, and they are very fast, under 1 minute transactions. Are they at the top? Not really, sure they are ranked very well but not at the top, so that means things that you listed could provide cheap and fast transactions and it could still not be as fast.There are even coins outside of top 100 which can be used for cheap and fast transactions, so that doesn't matter to ranking. People loving and investing a lot with hopes of making more is the only thing that matters, and so far those coins have not gone up that much like that.",
