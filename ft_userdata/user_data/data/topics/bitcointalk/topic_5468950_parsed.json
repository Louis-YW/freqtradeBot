Since you are a brand new user, someone won't trust you because you don't have enough trade history around the forum. So someone will escrow (hold) the funds. Once you deliver the elements, you will get your funds. The buyer should confirm receiving products. If the buyer refuses, even if he reviews the product, then you have to show appropriate proof that you sent the product. Then escrow will release your funds as well. In a critical case, escrow may ask other forum users  opinions.Of course, an escrow will get a fee from you.",

Once you've both agreed to use a third-party escrow for your transactio, the buyer sends an agreed amount to the escrow. After escrow confirms receipt, you ship the goods to the buyer. After the buyer confirms receipt of the goods, the escrow releases the coins to you.",

If you are the buyer of a goods and you do not know the seller, you can use escrow. If you are the seller of a goods and you do not know the buyer, you can use escrow. Example is on this forum, we have escrow providers: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=276897.0They are still trustworthy than the buyer or seller that you do not know. Both of you, I mean the buyer and the seller will agree to use escrow and pay fee for charge depending on your agreement. Escrow provider is the middle manThe buyer will give the middle man the money The seller will give the middle man the goodsThe middle man will deduct service fee, give the buyer the goods and also give the seller the money.",

The escrow provider perhaps for the good service in handling the transaction between you, the buyer and seller.2. Sending positive feedback to your trade partner is not a must.3. Look at this scenario. If I am trading with you, I am a newbie and I go in first since my rank is newbie and can not easily be trusted. Can you send me positive feedback for going in first? Obviously, I had no choice but to go in first  I would apply the same logic on trades facilitated over an escrow service",

Some fees maybe incurred in the escrow process but it isn't always the case with every escrow transaction anyways. Escrow, has so far proven to be the way and manner people transact and has had more subscribers than the regular processess involved in conventional sales/purchases transactions.",
