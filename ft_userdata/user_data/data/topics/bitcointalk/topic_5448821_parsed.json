So the token which moved by the hacker is already flagged with a warning of stolen funds and don't forget the CEO can freeze his centralized token even it's on non custodial wallet. But there's a way to cashout it without being traced.I'd say it's just your own assumptions for saying most of frauds are because of inside jobs.",

With centralized exchange, you give more data, with a possibility of lower security control, although you get better liquidity in most cases. Can't say it is a good trade-off if you don't need that liquidity though. But yeah, using an air-gapped wallet is obviously the best choice if you don't want to expose your holdings to security risks. CMIIW.",

The DOJ would have had no case if it weren't for Alpha Bya and those morons getting denied time after time verifications on exchanges for their shell companies, and also, of course, the Walmart $500 gift card!",

Surprise! I'm not saying that Coinmarketcap's exchange ranking is to be trusted, but 5 days after the hack, not only has Bitrue avoided falling below rank 30, it has even ranked up actually. As of this posting, Bitrue is already at rank 21. Again, I'm not saying Coinmarketcap is worth trusting, but even exchanges like YoBit, HitBTC, and others which are not among the top 50 in the site's ranking and whose reputation is certainly questionable, still maintains tens, even hundreds, of millions in daily volume.",

So yeah, they have little incentive to provide a native app since they make a ton of money just from running the website. In addition to this, creating a new app will probably add another weak point since hackers can spread fake apps. They probably don't want to deal with it too.

The convenience will eventually become hell for everyone. FTX users to date do not even believe in the FTX drama anymore. Since January FTX managed to recover its assets and return $800 Billion in user funds. https://www.reuters.com/technology/bankrupt-crypto-exchange-ftx-has-recovered-73-bln-assets-attorney-2023-04-12/But will it bring back its name? Of course not and will be abandoned. Just like what happened to Bitrue and the hack has happened 2x. This will further lower its position and will lose many customers despite full compensation. Even the top scalable exchanges are not used for the purpose of storing coins in the long run. it will be at risk of rekt like FTX. The safest is a private Wallet that has full control.

It is unfortunate but most people only learn the hard way.-snip-Spreading awareness about the dangers of centralized exchanges is a bit more difficult for reasons such as CEX's promises that they have money to spare for hacks and guarantee everything. At the end of the day, even the top exchanges are helpless if they only rely on promises instead of ever-improving security. Some people may have switched to DEX and gotten used to it, but the majority still use CEX for the reason that it's more convenient, constantly updated, and says that no hacks will happen because of the improved security system.",
