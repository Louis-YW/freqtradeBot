      "body": "I am open to the idea of divination. The underlying concept of seeing things before they happen seems plausible to me. I think it has a lot to do with perspective. For example, when Leonardo Da Vinci predicted and drafted up drawings for the helicopter hundreds of years ago, most people just couldn't see things from that technologically minded perspective. On the other hand, I don't know how to feel about fortune tellers or others claiming to see the future. I suppose there are things I just don't understand and I like to remain open even though it is probably unlikely they can see anything I can’t.",
