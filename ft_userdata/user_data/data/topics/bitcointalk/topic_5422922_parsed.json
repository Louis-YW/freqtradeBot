  "content": "Every day we encounter messages via email sending us fake emails or pretending to be legit emails from the office, and from our friends but why suddenly do these hackers and scammers focus now on sending text messages with links?I did small research for a while and here is what I think is the main reason:Mobile users are young and don't really understand that some text messages are dangerous especially the links when click accidentallyParents that are older like young ones don't understand that its dangerous to just click linksWhy do I think this is one of the main reasons?We don't fall victim to this kind of scam or hack because some of us encounter emails with links that give access to hackers, while our parents and you people are just getting hold of the technology they just encounter just now, they are trying to learn what we already know, but out of curiosity, and no knowledge regarding with this threat they fall, victim.What should we do to avoid this?Before giving them gadgets try to educate them first it's okay to let them explore but guide them through itI always remind my parents, especially my mother who is already old, he always received this kind of message, that if he doesn't know the person or the mobile that sends a mysterious message I told her to delete and block it immediately.There is no reason for us to click anything since we don't know these people, this is happening all over the world and we should always not attempt to do something because once they get some information via those links we are in big trouble.I hope this helps some who are having trouble with their young brother and sister, and their parents also",

Hackers may not know in advance that you are a worthy person to hack, but they anyway try to get your data in the hope to obtain something valuable. But in order to send you a \"text message\" with links, they first need to know your email address. How do they know that a certain address even exists and belongs to a real person? Well, they know because you unintentionally shared it with them: you probably registered on a platform or website that later was hacked, or its owners simply collected and shared your data without your consent. To protect yourself and your family from these malicious individuals, you should consider using separate email addresses for each platform. When you notice that one of your addresses started receiving strange emails, you will know on which platform the data leak occurred. The easiest way to organize your addresses and set up them for each service is to use disposable emails or aliases. The list of useful resources offering such kind of email services can be found here: https://www.privacyguides.org/email/",

Scammers only hope that from a list of thousands of email messages sent, some will be read by ignorant and careless people.",

      "body": "I got the impression that you're overly concerned with the young and old. Because your mother is very old, older parents are unlikely to be actively involved in the life of the Internet. In the end, by clicking on any link, she definitely will not incur any losses because, logically, she simply does not have any important data on her phone.But with children, I would agree. But then again, as a parent, I know all the warnings are useless. A child, even in adolescence, has the curiosity of a cat. There will be links that still tempt him to click on them.You just need unobtrusive control of where and how much time your children, and maybe elderly parents, spend time on the Internet. And probably, in my opinion, while you understand that communication with the phone can be fraught, not store any important data in their phones.",

But WhatsApp phishing messages is also very common recently. But from the phishing messages alone, you will know they are only scam attempts. Many people are using mobile phones, so they are the most targeted, it is normal. But anyone using a computer too can be exposed to the scam, like through email or social media.",

      "body": "Quote from: tech30338 on November 24, 2022, 01:31:44 AM<…>SMS are another channel to exploit with malware links, just as emails and social media networks are. I have perceived an increase of the usage of the former channel to send these sort of links as of late, and there are even government-based campaigns on the media (in my country of residence) these days warning people of these practices through SMSs.I figure there is a combines set of reasons for this: -   Scammers will diversify the methods and channels they use.-   I’d say people may tend to be more confident in SMS received context, specially certain age segments, as it seems something rather personal. -   The SMS channel has not been overly exploited with malware links. That gives them a certain chance because the channel may not yet be seen as a malware prone point of entry by many.-   SMSs are a bit more difficult to visually identify the sender as been either legit or a scam just by looking at the sender’s information (after all, it’s just a phone number).-   Emails have some degree of protection through spam filters, with years of work behind. They are certainly not impenetrable though, as we see on a daily basis. SMSs on the other hand, I believe, don’t have that much in play in this sense. I have seen some antiviruses that incorporate some sort of solution, and/or some apps that claim to help in this sense, but I’ve never really taken a look into it really (nor would likely feel inclined to give further snoop privileges to an app or such).What to do is pretty clear, and is in line with making people conscious that malware can be received through this channel, just as it can over emails, needing to take similar precautions, develop a sense of wariness, and refrain from clicking links.",

All numbers that are not on my phonebook are automatically sent to the spam inbox and it is not giving me notifications either so I have less distractions. Messages from new numbers but I had contact them first either by calls and messages will notify me when they send messages and they are also sent to the right inbox. It's cool. But I know most phones do not work like this, I have two other phones and I do not have the same features as my ROG. You can advise your less technology updated parents to buy ROG if they are using many financial apps on their phones. ROG uses Android which is a downside to Apple lovers and it is a gaming phone.",

Cellphones are the gateway wallet to personal identity, also known as “smishing”. It is basically a robber pickpocketing someone's sophisticated style. Senior citizens are the easiest targets. One clicks on the link and some of the websites, and one cannot distinguish that it is a scam will be drawn to this. Like a social security number, a cellphone number must be protected. This is so scary; our location and all our information can be taken from your cellphone. There must be a way to prevent this from occurring so often.",
