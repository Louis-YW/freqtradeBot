But let's change your mindset a little bit about how to approach what you think is best, if you're just starting to learn about Bitcoin, the Bitcoin whitepaper is an essential read. . This is the first document written by Bitcoin founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, in 2008, describing how Bitcoin works and how it was designed to solve the problem of traditional currency. However, if you want to read a white paper on Bitcoin, author Andreas Antonopoulos wrote a very famous and easy to understand white paper on Bitcoin called \"Mastering Bitcoin: Unlocking Digital Cryptocurrencies\". This book provides an in-depth look at how Bitcoin works, how it is used, and how it can change the way we interact with currency.",

You don't have to deep dive into these things yet if you have no prior knowledge of basic coding. I remember watching some youtube videos before that kinda strips downs or explain some concepts in layman's terms. That's a pretty good start for me when I was just a beginner but my knowledge today is still nothing compared to those who really know how to code.",

I was hoping anyone would have recommendations for me and/or others on this forum to read to truly gauge many of the concepts and technicality.  I think it is quite normal for someone that is not familiar with IT and that is not a programmer or coder himself to not understand all those formulas, equations and symbols that are often used in a technical whitepaper. It will not really help you to read other technical whitepapers in my opinion. To really understand all those equations you basically would need to study IT and programming for a few years or at least a few months. I don't think though, that it is really necessary to have profound coding knowledge in order to be able to get a feeling if a project has potential or not. There are many other things stated in whitepapers that should be understandable for everyone. Like the problem that the team wants to solve, the way they want to solve that problem, the roadmap and the tokenomics for example.",

There are lots of scams and fraud in this crypto space, and as such, I will urge you to educate yourself on how to identify possible scams and ways to avoid them. When you are done with all this, you can choose the white paper of your preferred project, that is to say, you should consider reading the white paper of any project you find interesting, and from their you can learn and understand more things about the project. But always note that not everything written down on the white papers of these new projects is true; some of them are just formulated promises to convince their targeted audience that they are worth investing in, so always base your choice on your research and findings.",

I was hoping anyone would have recommendations for me and/or others on this forum to read to truly gauge many of the concepts and technicality.  Basically, there is not a lot of important things that can be taken from whitepaper. Most people here already understood that the main point from whitepaper must be what product that will be developed and how tokenomic will be used by the project. You can try to search some whitepapers that are already been made by the major project like arbitrum, optiomism, or something else. The fact that if most of people didn't care so much about what was already contained by the whitepaper caused by im sure if almost all of whitepapers have contained almost the same idea but with a different ways to execute it. Try to read some whitepaper and you will understand what i meant. To be honest, the concept that is already mentioned in whitepaper sometime can be changed in the middle of execution. There are many projects were doing it. Im not whitepaper is not so important but it's pretty much a useless thing these days as people knew what concept that used by the project by seeing the name of the project. Sometime slogan is enough to explain everything related to the project. The most important thing from whitepaper these days is tokenomic for that token that will be issued by the developers.",

And if you have have an access to chatgpt4 you can do that with any whitepaper.And i admit that some whitepapers are very technical, like the team would have included yellow papers in them. But just looking at the paper that's too technical doesn't help you so yo could just ask from the team if they have eli5 versions of their white papers, vision papers or one pagers. If they don't they are not doing a very good job with their pr. In most cases they want to explain their tech to everyone out there and if you need a phd to understand the basics of the tech, i am not so sure it will be adopted so easily.",

Here on the forum or on other similar sites. Feel free to ask questions and don't be afraid to be perceived inappropriately. I know from my own experience that sensible people will always help you and advise you to read articles, for example, on this or that issue. Because a healthy interest is welcome and you are on the right track.",

I was hoping anyone would have recommendations for me and/or others on this forum to read to truly gauge many of the concepts and technicality.  I don't know if it's only me, but right now, I don't think that reading a whitepaper is still an important one whether you will invest into that project or not.In the past, yes Whitepaper is a big factor because you will see everything about the project there. Their tokenomics, the roadmap of the project, the team behind it, the possible upgrades of it etc. etc. Now on the other hand, I've also seen Whitepapers who is very alluring and very attractive to investors, but they ended up scamming others. I've read some good whitepapers which if you read it, you will think that \"The whitepaper is good, I will invest into it.\" especially if you are a newbie investor, but they ended up as an abandoned project.I'm not investing into new projects in the past, and until now, but I've read some whitepapers already, and the ones that I've read ended up either as an abandoned coin (most of the time) or a scam coin. Like others here, I know that reading whitepapers isn't essential anymore. Reading whitepapers is just a waste of time for others. Some might disagree with me, but that's what I observe base on my experiences in the past. As for the OP (if he will read this), it would be better if you will just pick and invest into the top coins instead of spending your time reading whitepapers that will end up as a fail project.",

It can be copied or stolen from other projects and apply minimum changes on it.In my opinion, the first white Paper anyone should read and understand is the Bitcoin WP, because it is basically the genesis of the rest of the WP we see today. Also, I have got the impression that the developers feel like using roadmaps nowadays to explain their objectives, rather than a WP. Perhaps it is because the Roadmap can be more flexible than a PDF document.",

Another thing that you need to keep in mind is nearly 99.9% of cryptocurrency projects are scams. So good luck separating the wheat from the chaff by reading a whitepaper. There is a lot of factors that you could extract the gist from a project without focusing on the whitepaper.
