If so, then there is no way to recover it, correct?2. has anyone used it as a part of a multi-sig vault? Like one of the keys being this NFC card, in a RFID protection sleeve.",

I mean, let's say you have 3 cards (A, B, C) and one of them gets lost, or damaged, can I use a backup (any type of backup) to restore the key that was saved in the card ?",

I mean, let's say you have 3 cards (A, B, C) and one of them gets lost, or damaged, can I use a backup (any type of backup) to restore the key that was saved in the card ?Yes you will need a backup file that you create and a copy of the decryption code which is on the card, so you have to keep a copy of both of them someplace safe in separate locations. A good analogy is having a seed phrase (backup file) in one location and then having a password for it in (decrypt code) in another location.Keep in mind, it's OK security not great security. If someone knows you have one (say they saw you using it) then they know to look for it. Or keep hitting you with the $5 wrench till you give it up.A full HW wallet like the coldcard that you can have a 'duress pin' is still a better option for larger amounts of BTC. -Dave",

It was a new product, so I wanted to see how people use it. To be honest, I don't think someone would see me using it, since I wouldn't carry it with me. But I get what you mean.Thanks for the info.",
