  "content": "KulaDAO aligns the interests of different people groups to create shared value.Kula incentivizes the equitable realization of assets using blockchain technology.Misaligned interests between different groups of people negatively impacts our world.Competing interests lay at the root of wasted opportunity, broken trust, and relational breakdown. Ultimately this affects the fabric of society and impacts our shared prosperity. Correcting the misalignment of interests between different groups of people opens the opportunity to create and share value. Can the value of assets be realized by incentivizing all stakeholders to meaningfully participate in the process? Can we also lower risk that investors have to bear?With Kula we believe that we have found a solution.We use a new form of organization, a Decentralized Autonomous Organizational ecosystem, or DAO, to work with each stakeholder, align interests to create the value that sits in shared opportunities and assets. DAOs function on blockchain technology.We issue tokens to stakeholders to incentivize participation. This means stakeholders are engaged, participating in the proposals and decisions that will shape their shared outcomes. As a new level of trust is built between stakeholders, latent value is unlocked. This creates a foundation where positive outcomes can thrive and destructive practices are minimized returning greater prosperity and financial return. This is then reflected in the price of the token held by each person. Kula can applies this model and structure to any project whether in the development of real estate, project management, agriculture, livestock management, or the mining and development of natural resources. Why?Today, the misalignment of interests costs global industry billions of dollars a year.In agriculture competing interests along supply chains can result in the use of harmful pesticides, or unfair pricing. In the management of mineral resources non-participatory power structures can leave local communities without voice or agency. Whatever the sector, where stakeholders fight for their preferred outcomes there are winners and losers. Where one group loses - ultimately to the detriment of all - Kula sees an opportunity to turn these moments into a win-win-win outcome for all stakeholders. Kula, hereafter KulaDAO, solves for such problems by using DAOs to incentivize participation, build trust, and create value across the realization of the particular asset. The cryptographic structure of a DAO allows an immutable, transparent, and accountable engagement of all stakeholders in the development of their shared assets. This is new, unique, and embraces an opportunity presented by the inception and utility of this new technology to solve the issues that lay at the foundation of misaligned interests and create shared value for every group in a given industry. KulaDAO's structure however goes further to create wealth for both investors and clients.My Insight and ResearchOne thing that make me look into KulaDAO is there initiative to centered around addressing and eliminating conflicting interests to ensure that local communities in every that live near the project can benefit from their resources. They are committed to creating a transparent and fair system that promotes the well-being of all stakeholders involved and the community. Another cool thing with Kuladao is, all mining, humanitarian and ethical practices will be viewable on the blockchain for everyone to see so it will be transparent. Also people can have a fractional ownership and governance throught DAO. They also applied to FINMA (a regulatory institution in Switzerland) so I am more confident about the project. It will launch on Q3 this year so I have lots of time to research about it more.If you like to know the project to you can start to visit there website kuladao.io and request for the whitepaper.",
