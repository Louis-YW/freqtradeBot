In general, the Merit to post ratio is very high there, and that makes it an attractive place for Merit farmers. I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.",

I could be wrong to sense it though.Mate, I think this kind of action is not off limits to any user. Someone is still not obligated to post on a particular board but they can care enough about abuse of merit, quality of posts and so on that when they come to complain then take the bright side and listen. I mean I can still distribute merit on local boards, reporting posts even though I don't post there.Quote from: BitcoinGirl.Club on August 14, 2022, 03:55:11 AMThe financial motivation was not in my mind LOL.

This is a unique forum where we have things that are never the same among users with different cultures, knowledge, backgrounds, economies. So we shouldn't think people have to have the same mindset as us.So far I think WO is an easier place for spammers to get merit without putting too much effort into improving the quality of their posts. They can post memes, some words or whatever just to get merit, but I'm not generalizing all users there are the same. It's just about some users who aren't really sincere about having a good discussion about bitcoin.",

      "body": "Personally I care much more about the value of posts, than the intent on posting, even if I do bare the OP's opinion in my mind and therefore sometimes I don't send merit because of this (WatChe comes to mind).For example one of those users mentioned - Hamza2424 - I have sent merit a handful of times for charts mainly regurgitated from twitter. This for me is useful/vauable as I don't spend much time on twitter looking at charts or analysis, so WO helps to refine this process for me with other users posting what they consider to be the most relevant. As long as it has a source, I don't see any issue with that, and it remains useful for me.Is it a very lazy form of posting, without adding much additional opinion yourself? For sure, and that's why I usually don't give more than +1 if the analysis isn't original. But doesn't make it less useful personally.A few examples: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4. Note I'm also not the only one who finds these types of posts useful, or with value.Quote from: _BlackStar on August 14, 2022, 07:56:34 AMSo far I think WO is an easier place for spammers to get merit without putting too much effort into improving the quality of their posts.

It's just about some users who aren't really sincere about having a good discussion about bitcoin.Could someone explain the difference (in terms of value) of a hat-wearing WO member regurgitating a chart or meme from twitter and getting 5-20 merits for it, compared to some newbie or low ranking member getting 1-4? Obviously the intent from WO regulars is rarely to gain merit (as most have enough), but I don't see how the post value is any different. Double standards come to mind here.If others want to be \"more careful\" with who they send merit to, then you are more than welcome. Personally I'll merit what I find useful or of value to me, because I'm meriting a post not a user.",

This is my Community Pakistans Monthly Anlysis done by me.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=232519.msg60700439#msg60700439First thing i use to post in WO from very long as First merit recived from JJG on WO from that day I'm regular to WO. Check there are only 20 active members in last month.There is no point on Palgrism Alhamdulliah i use to add Source in every single post check you will come to know there every single post i do i mention the source.Without any hesitation i post in WO as some meme BTC related stuff daily and i receive very good number of merits fro WO. Then My local community i use to send those smerits to active and good posters.And i think Wo members who merit me are one of top users on the Bitcointalk so they better know Quality of Post and as well i would like to mention again from Day 1 posting with Reffence i have sources on Twitter as BTC magazine, BTC Quotes, BTC memes and many other as Glassnode, OnchainCollege, PLCB and PlanC. i use to follow them and post their useful posts with Reffence. sometimes very rare i dont put Source link when i dont get it i use to say Unknown source.Checkout not even 1 single merit has been sent to Non Quality Post as one liners. And please take the name Samreen also in this list as i gave many merit to her as well.There are a few active members and i use to merit them up on day of independence by very very Sad moment i have to say she seems jealous as many members of my Community posting in WO and earning merits.Please Notice that i can send my merit to anyone by that should not be spam so check its not spam its supporting spirit of my Community.",

Personally this is how I see merit distribution is intended; from merit sources -> high merit earning individuals -> lower merit earning users and to local community boards. Ideally merit sources would have infinite amount of time in order to merit lower merited individuals and newbies, but this is unrealistic. Other members obviously have different opinions and prefer more of a gate-keeping strategy in order to avoid merit ending up \"in the wrong hands\". This is predominantly due to DT1 eligibility being based on trust from merit earning individuals, so merit abuse becomes an issue. Despite being a relevant concern the root problem imo is with the system of DT1 eligibility, rather than merit distribution itself.",
