Let us stop having such views that one day we going to win to recover our loss that will push us to be losing more",

But considering this point of your's you can see that people doesn't associates theirs self in gambling because they want have profit when the future permit, the most reason why those who is addicted in gambling is addicted is because they want they playing gambling because of money not because of entertainment, it is even difficult now before you can see someone who is gambler that plays gamble because of entertainment. What i mean is that you have a budget plan in gambling so that you will not lose much in gambling, which is same as bet what you can afford to lose",

Gamble responsibly because that income is also going to feed your family, their expenses and education.  If this is not working out, limit the budget on things that need spending and include your monthly gambling expenditure on it. Problem is that most addicted gamblers cannot make themselves so this or follow it. So they need someone to help them out. Family and friends can take this responsibility if they are supportive enough. Who knows maybe doing this budget for the first time may motivate that gambler to reduce gambling spending and eventually stop this addiction.",

Budgeting isn't a bad thing and having a specified amount can lead you to the betterment of yourself to limiting your losses and not regretting it in the long run. The enemy is yourself, thinking that \"only if...\" that would make you want to think that you should've done something in the past and that's the convincing factor in the present that you are going to gamble because \"What the heck\".It's all about self control and being satisfied that you have experienced it and be positive about any outcome.

Under any circumstances, this budget should not be exceeded and this way, the gambler will remain within certain limits and even if he loses his entire balance, still he knows that he has spent nothing extra.",

Because funds management is the most important when you are investing or gambling either you have experience or not. To gamble you have to invest a amount which you can afford to lose. That means never take risks with all of your funds where is no guaranteed profits. Always set a budget before gambling and do proper analysis and observation to maximize your wining ratio. If you lose just take a break and never try to win back your losed funds immediately.There are so many things to improve for your gambling startegy. All you need to have a good experience with proper concentration and it will help you to gain continues winings.",

Lastly what I understood correct is that he was chasing lost after little lose, greed doesn't allow him to let the little amount go and he ended up losing all every and also to the point of staking with cloths. This now lead to the main purpose of this your topic because if a statistic is being drawn to monitor and regulates the total sum that would be spent at every week, month I don't think he would had this mindsets to gamble with even his total amount won to the context were he needs to drop his clothing in an exchange to their amount of money stakes.",

Just set a specific amount you CAN spend (and will) spend for each session, each amount should adjust depending on the number of times you gamble say per week or per month. And no, gathering the same amount of money isn't exactly possible since it's money you decided to dedicate for your enjoyment/entertainment. There's a different part of your income that should go directly to money that will be used for investing. Those kinds of financing would make your life a whole lot easier and at the same time stress free (just don't forget to add enjoyment, spend a little for yourself).",
