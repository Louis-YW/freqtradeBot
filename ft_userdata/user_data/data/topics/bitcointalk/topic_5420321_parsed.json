Looking at the brighter side, I think this bad things will be converted to greater things.  Since there are five worse events happen this year, I have high hopes that Bitcoin will break the $100k barrier when it rally towards its ATH this coming bull market... I am just thinking and applying Newton's Third Law: Action & Reaction.QuoteHis third law states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction.",

It seems like that this day the crypto company can collapse easily caused by there are so many scumbags in the project who doing shady things to the company's fund.",

Hack incidents have cost a lot of panic and weak hands rushing to sell even if their assets are not stored in the exchange wallet but in a cold wallet.",

Maybe Tera Luna doesn't have much impact on other coins, especially BTC.But it's different in the case of FTX. Starting from the hacking case at FTX, millions of dollars in members' funds disappeared instantly and now they are also being sued in US courts.This raises issues that are not good for the cryptocurrency world. Hopefully a quick recovery.",

Prior to these events, are also major events that have made crypto very popular, such as DeFi and NFTs, as a result, there are now many players in the cryptocurrency space when compared to previous years. While these events are quite regrettable, they are probably events that will help to shape the future of cryptocurrency as institutions, crypto experts and major players in the crypto space will take lessons that will usher in a more robust, safe and secure cryptocurrency space for the future. We must not ignore these lessons as it is critical to shape the future of crypto to become better.",

If they can, they would be very ready to do this because it helps to save their exchange (not collapse) and even can increase their reputation and attract new users.Worse things are collapse from Ponzi scheme because those collapses are more harmful. Their impacts are more widely and can touch to many related entities. Those collapses are not restricted to a single platform, company but many entities and people will be affected.",

There's not a single exchange that's safe, hackers are not sleeping as they're implementing new methods everyday to make sure they invade or cause serious damage on exchanges. Security breach also affects the exchange as their top security measures are not strong enough and easy to crack by fraudy hackers who inturned change it to phishing messages sent to users who fall victims for it. Also, users should take safety measures to stay clear firmly from it. Exchanges hack can not be prevented, but can be reduced if the exchange users are highlighten on essential areas the fraudsters will focused on.",

This was the main reason why BTC was created by Nakamoto in the first place. I don't know what is OneCoin but I know the popular bitconnect and I think it shouldn't be included in the list given that it is a scam or a ponzi at the first place. The ones on the list is financial institutions and exchange scandals that make crypto worst events. Bitconnect is just using crypto to gather funds for their ponzi scheme, It is just different. MT.Gox could be the cruelest one but some funds are recovered and the rest is just history compared to other events that happened where hackers still haven't get caught.

It was normal for Bitcoin to make a correction after ATH, but then the war between Russia and Ukraine and the deteriorating conditions of the global economy caused a further downturn, Which was normal, but we can say that what is happening since then that is, if we talk about the previous days, it was an artificial process.",
