  "content": "Around the same month 11 years ago, the first bitcoin conference was held in New York and the attendees is less than 100. The speaker is as follows: Bruce Wagner, Gavin Andresen, Jeff Garzik and Stefan Thomas. Just take note though that the conference is sponsored by no less than Mt. Gox and Bitpay and also MezeGrill.com and CableSaurus.comMaybe majority of them got REKT when Mt. Gox was hacked  , Lol. But it's good to see the first conference and how BTC grows since its infancy.",

As much hate as Gavin gets, have to admit he's a seemingly really good dude, did a lot for bitcoin and had some really great ideas (of course my favorite being he's the first to introduce the idea of physical bitcoins/paper wallets). It's just too bad he went down the path he did.",

Most international payment instruments do not include Bitcoin on their platforms. Is the exchange platform done at the same time by the same team?

The bitcoiners held their first to see their strength on the digital currency (bitcoin). Been the 1st conference in that magnitude, it was like a fish camp that set up by just a few interested persons. And the attendance was very poor which was estimated about 50 bitcoiners (people). Since the number was few, the individuals who came for the meeting knewn one another because of the number that attended the conference. There were a lot of things that were discussed in the conference. The conference was held in Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. They first discussed on the concept of bitcoin and a lot of questions were also asked and the reason why bitcoin was created was also discussed.https://www.google.com/amp/s/spectrum.ieee.org/amp/the-worlds-first-bitcoin-conference-2650255667",
