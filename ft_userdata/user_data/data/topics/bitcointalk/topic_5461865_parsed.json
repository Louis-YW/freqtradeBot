Exchange platforms should really be listing out those potential projects because on this case, they might be able to list out some projects which might be scams or rugpulls because it is really just that easy to make out some manipulation and showsthat a certain project looks legit because its been listed.Its true that its never been recommendable  for newbies to join up but it would be all depending into you though because there are investors who are really that risks takers on something like thisbecause we know that the earlier you would be able to get in, the more profits that you could potentially be able to make out but of course the risks is higher which is somethingthat you would really be needing to deal with.",

It's just a marketing stunt.Deposit to list campaigns is obviously a marketing strategy. But that doesn't mean it will not beneficial for novice in crypto. Even though if the \"deposit to list\" campaign fails, you will be refunded 100% or more than what you have deposited. It is true in Bitget.Quote*If (token) liquidity requirements fail to be met, all deposits will be refunded. And participants can get an extra 5% cashback of their total deposit amount. The maximum individual extra refund is capped at $50 in (token) on a first come first served basis.Source:https://www.bitget.com/support/articles/12560603794676Quote from: Amphenomenon on August 02, 2023, 09:35:05 PMQuote from: JeromeTash on August 02, 2023, 09:08:33 PMI would not encourage anyone to participate in them.

They exploit the fact that it is done to know if the project is a serious or just another scam project. They will only not list the coin or token if the requirements fail to be met. It's impossible not to list them if they met the requirements because the reputation of CEX is one of the most important key to gather traders and investors. So if ever they fail, you will be refunded for what you deposited and it doesn't mean that this project is a scam.",

It's always about just profitsIt’s that simple.The term is simply business. As much as they have an integrity to keep, that includes unlisting a coin if found out to be a scam coin or token, in the days that they are not or have promises on them, the brains behind the project could as well pay the fee yo depict there seriousness and intentions for the coin to go public as would be the case and the exchange would benefit as well from the traffic the new project would bring.Mind you, not all who happen to have come aboard the exchange because of the project would leave should the project go south. Whichever way it turns for the project, the exchange would still have some means to profit.It’s left for individual investors to be on the look out for the projects they wish or hope to invest in and what exchange that defends or suits there interest.",

There actually cex strategy that I liked is Learn and Earn so basically newbies have to read or watch the video and at the end, the Centralized Exchange will give a some quiz and when your answer is right you will get reward",

How would you explain what deposit to list entails to a novice? And would you encourage a novice to participate in these events?most of the CEXs are doing marketing promotions by making deposits just to attract more new registrants. for example, the reward is the token from the exchange itself, and to claim of course requires valid data via KYC. as well as withdrawals which of course will increase the profitable transactions of the exchange.this is just an example of the marketing strategy that exchange platforms use to get new members. it never hurts a beginner to try, but it is better to validate the reputation of the exchange first.",

      "body": "I wouldn't encourage a novice to participate in such an event because they don't have enough experience to find such a new project. That can lead to losses because some beginners can use big money to try to make profits and it is highly discouraged.CEX exchanges certainly want to profit by hosting such events. But unfortunately, we don't know how exchanges can get and take advantage of it. And if the token doesn't end up being listed on the exchange, the people who bought it will lose out because they bought the token in the presale stage.Don't be too tempted to participate in such events if you don't know how to participate. Better to trade as usual and use the exchange to make money.",

So for me, it's a red flag.Victims here are most new in cryptocurrency and will lose their money.But they can do a lot of things beside deposit-to-list, they can improve that way just to prove that the project or token is worth to list and they are quality project.",

      "body": "It's just a method of listing crypto for free by the community, on the other hand the exchange must also take advantage in other ways, one of which is by \"depositing to list\" to find out potential traders who will be involved.This event is only a form of support contribution, it has no instant benefits to either the participants or the exchange itself. If we notice, the projects that have taken this path are synonymous with community driven tokens (meme and shit coins). I think it's okay for newbies to join this event provided that it is held by reputable exchanges and fair requirements for participants. This also increases the possibility of the crypto being listed immediately.",
