See DeFi too which are definitely securities too.",

No one can recognize other cryptocurrencies as securities without first considering bitcoin being the ultimate one, as regards the SEC, we can not question them because they had never supported it right from time than sending attacks upon attack to counter the acceptabilities from various institutions, but now that bitcoin had gone beyond what they can control, manage or regulate, you should expect nothing more than this kind of attacks from them, but we all know that bitcoin remains our priority digital currency and no other.",

This makes me smile that they keep Bitcoin out of the hook but is it true that all other crypto projects can be considered a security? Well, to be clear, the SEC said that most digital assets can be considered unregistered securities, not everything. The SEC has a set of guidelines called the Howey Test, which is used to determine whether something is a security. If a cryptocurrency meets the criteria outlined in the Howey Test, then it may be considered a security. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that all other crypto projects can be considered a security, but rather it depends on the specific characteristics of each project and how they fit within the legal definition of a security.",

Even if the SEC calls bitcoin a security, I wonder how they will handle bitcoin. Bitcoin is decentralized, so even with regulation, the SEC or the government cannot stop criminals from using bitcoin. What the SEC is doing is like they are scaring us, they are probing the market reaction to finding a way to step in and control it. They can suppress some crypto companies and some centralized projects, but I don't believe they can suppress bitcoin or the whole market.",

When it comes to issuance, like ICOs and so on, there are differences in taxation compared to miners in Bitcoin. But that has different reasons. Monero shouldn't be a security either then if Bitcoin isn't deemed a security? Or what exactly would be the difference between the two? Even if there are known people who created Monero, that doesn't matter because there are also people today maintaining Bitcoin. Monero wasn't dropped on anyone, but could be CPU mined during its early days, especially when you were familiar with remote access to AWS CPU instances. So nobody actually organized a public sale. The SEC is trying everything to bend regulation such that they cover as many cryptocurrencies as possible. You also said that Bitcoin is a currency, but besides El Salvador I am not aware of another country that embraces that definition. How do you get to the conclusion that it is a currency and, hence, cannot be categorized as a security? I might not be all up to date with the SEC's most recent statements.",
