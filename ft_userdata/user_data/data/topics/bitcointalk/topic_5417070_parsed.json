Provided you're on the internet, your information like email can be easily gotten by this spammers (hoping to take advantage of your ignorant) from the dark web especially when you fill form online like survey, bounty, giveaway etc. Even exchanges or other top sites can leak your private information out either unknowingly through hacks or those selling customers data for profit. This is why it's recommended not to use the same email you use for your regular activity online for other important things like bank transactions. Scam attempt like this aren't new and they'll still be used in coming years because the Crypto community is an easy target as novice flow into the space yearly. Even though you're expecting a similar kind of email due to the activity you engaged yourself online, always make sure the sender of the email correspond to who you're expecting an email from as this scammers are always cleaver in their attempt to scam you.",

I have a Gmail which is practically public and to which I receive dozens of e-mails on a daily basis, but at least 90% of such e-mails end up in spam, so I think that their spam filter does its job quite solidly.What everyone can do to help in the fight against spam e-mails is that when they receive such an e-mail in their Inbox, they report it as spam - which, after a certain number of reports, will automatically send that message to the spam folder for everyone else. Unfortunately, people are too curious, so they look at what's in that folder, and that curiosity can sometimes be very dangerous.",

Most of these are just promotions and most of them are scams. SO, once more, be careful.Never trust any email that inform you ar ethe winner of something, because they will be commonly scammers.

Obviously, using unique email addresses for every site mitigates that, and changing the email once it has been leaked. However, the reality is most users don't do that. Everyone on this forum prior to the compromise (which I believe was 2015?) had their email leaked, and therefore could be subject to these types of attacks.

Just ignore it and don't interact with the email as they would confirm that there's a legitimate and an active user behind the email.
