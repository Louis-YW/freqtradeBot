Why can't you name the big collateral in a post it isn't some thing you should've hidden if you need a loan.

But if the OP can't deliver the house maybe he's just lying about having a house In reality, it's very easy to get a loan from a bank with a house as collateral, or maybe the OP is an idealist who doesn't want to deal with banks and chose bitcoin.. It's amazing",

Get a loan from your local bank or lender using the house as collateral2. Get a salary/an employee's loan, or business loan because based on what you will pay weekly, you have a stable source of income3. Save the â‚¬1,800 weekly for 8 weeks That's just 2 months. You can do it!",

Are we in a deal?You should be careful with troll posts like this, especially by saying \"Are we in a deal?\" as the OP could easily take you up on your offer, send the 500 eur then you are entitled to honor the deal...or, stuck with drama because you didn't (even if you refund).At least state that you're joking/being sarcastic when you are when it comes to anything relating a transaction, for your own protection of not entering a contract that you actually don't want to be involved in.",
