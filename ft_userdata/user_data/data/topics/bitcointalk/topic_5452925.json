  "content": "SUMMARYMempool is the best option. It's much better than ETA and Static but always double check mempool to compare it with given estimation from Electrum wallet.If you know what you are doing, are aware of mempool (volatile memory), you can use any option because with any option, you are free to customize your fee. After your initial broadcast, you can bump your transaction fee later if you want to have faster confirmation.Reminder: Electrum uses sat/vbyte for fee rate but its label is in sat/byte and has yet been corrected by Electrum developers. That issueYour transaction fee will be decided by transaction size, fee rate. You can save transaction fee by using either lower fee rate or reducing your transaction size.Transaction fee = Transaction size * Fee rateLet's discover it, step by step!TRANSACTION SIZEYou can reduce your transaction fee by reduce its size that requires you to know how to use your inputs and outputs effectively.For inputs, you can reduce the input number by consolidate your small inputs when network is not at high demand from users. Then you can make consolidation with very cheap fee rate.For outputs, it depends on how many senders you will send your coins too with your sending transaction, including your own change address as part of outputs.Generally, you can reduce transaction size by using Segwit address (Bech32) that starts with bc1q. Since its deployment in 2017, many wallets and later centralized exchanges support that wallet type.Please use some Bitcoin Transaction Size Calculators at Reference (bottom) to understand it better.A strong reminder, you can use centralized exchanges that support Segwit but you should not rely on them. Storing your coins on centralized exchanges, with custodial wallets, is extremely risky.Reminder: do not keep your money in online accountsLet’s control your coins by non-custodial wallets like Electrum, Bitcoin Core wallets. In this guide, I present only Electrum wallet as it fits with newbies and their limited resources for wallet storage.FEE RATENow, let’s move on to fee rate. What is best fee rate for you to use?It depends on your need.If you want to move your coins within a short time like 10 or 20 minutes (~ 1 or 2 next blocks), you will have to pay expensive fee at that moment.If you are not hurry and can wait longer, you can use lower fee rate and wait for like 1 hour (next 6 bocks) or even longer like 12 hours or 24 hours. Remember that if you use too low fee rate, your transaction will be at bottom of mempools and waiting time will be up to 14 days (2 weeks or 2016 blocks). After that, if your transaction is still not confirmed, there is possibility that it will be dropped from mempools.Note that not all mempools will drop your transaction but some will. That leads to a need that you might see your transaction is Failed, then you will have to re-broadcast it.Be aware of this risk and avoid to choose extremely low fee rate. If you only need to consolidate your inputs, don’t do this when network is in high demand. Just observe mempools and choose good times to broadcast your transactions.WHERE TO CHECK FEE RATES?Check it in mempools. There are some websites to do that but I’d like to recommend two sites:https://mempool.space/https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),24h,weightWith mempool.space, you can choose chart option to have better overview. If you are new with this experience, use their main page and get default given information.The second site, Joe-hoe, is more advanced but it is more helpful.Now, how to use it?Block time is about 10 minutes in average. When you broadcast your transaction, it will appear in mempools. Then miners will pick transactions that can give them most beneficial transaction fees (with highest fee rates and biggest sizes). They will prioritize such transactions, and 1 block equals to 1 vMB from tip of mempool.Hovering the mouse on the mempool chart, you will see different fee bands (in different colors) and corresponding size of waiting transactions within that fee band. Let’s consider and choose a fee band that matches you.HOW TO CHOOSE FEE RATE WITH ELECTRUM WALLET?In Electrum wallet, you will have three options when broadcasting your transactions: ETA, Mempool, and Static. Let’s dig into each of them.Turn on Edit fee manually.ETAWhat does ETA means? It is Estimate Time of Arrival. It means something. It is only estimation of arrival time or first confirmation time for your transaction.Mempool is lively up and down, so an estimation at the time you broadcast your transaction can be not correct. The actual confirmation time can be longer or shorter than ETA if mempool is up or down, respectively. ETA gives you estimations in time like 30 minutes, 1 hour, etc.This is disadvantage of ETA option. It usually will cost you more than Mempool and Static options.MempoolMempool is an option which gives you information in how many waiting blocks for your first confirmation, such as within next 1-2 blocks, next 10 blocks, 25 blocks, etc.It is a better option than ETA. You will have less likely overpay fee for your transaction.StaticThis option is useful when you comprehensively know what you are doing. It is helpful when you only make your transactions when mempool drops to your favorite fee rate.When you use this option, with your experience and mempool observation, you won’t overpay fee for sure.ComparisonCompare three options and see difference, ETA and Static options provide overpaid fee than Mempool option. All of them are estimations because we don't know how mempools will become in next 100 minutes.Within 10 blocksETA: 106.3 sat/vbyteStatic: 100 sat/vbyteMempool: 14.5 sat/vbyteDouble check with https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC%20(default%20mempool),8h,weightQuote from: tranthidung on May 18, 2023, 03:27:28 AMI checked it yesterday and again, Mempool option is the best.ELECTRUM ON ANDROIDQuote from: tranthidung on May 16, 2023, 02:24:07 PMUse Electrum wallet on mobile (Android) like your hot wallet and store small fraction of bitcoin there, security-wise.On mobile, you can check mempool by tapping on Network, then tap on any point on the fee color stripe (left is from tip of mempool, right is bottom of it).

      "body": "Honestly, I’d avoid wallets that don’t offer the option to customize fees. That is a must-have option and, to me, a condition when picking a wallet. If it doesn’t have even the most basic functions, you’re better off not using it in my opinion..Also worth noting: transaction fees aren’t always high. If a transaction isn’t an urgent matter, you can save a decent amount of sats over time by waiting for the mempool to clear up and paying lower fees to send a transaction. Like tranthidung says, also a good idea when consolidating outputs. But if you need to move coins from one wallet to another without a hurry, there’s no point in overpaying.",

Now people are still looking for a way to reduce that amount. Do you understand what you are writing?Transaction size and fee rate are different. You can control your transaction size by three factors: number of inputs, number of outputs and address type. If all three factors are unchanged, transaction size is fixed but it depends on you, not on Electrum wallet.Fee rate is another factor you can customize by yourself. I guess you implied about fee rate, not transaction size. Electrum wallet have three options: ETA (Estimate Time of Arrival), Static, Mempool for fee rate estimation. With each option, the software gives you a default value but you can scroll the slider to customize it.You have to choose inputs, outputs, then fee rate, step by step.",

Now people are still looking for a way to reduce that amount. Now I don’t know how Electrum works on Android (personally don’t like it) but maybe you get a large minimum fee because currently the mempool is overloaded and your transaction will probably not even go through at all, it’ll just clog the mempool even more right now if you set a low fee. Sometimes transactions with low fees won’t even get picked up by nodes if the mempool is as clogged as it is as we speak.Edit: now that I read tranthidung’s reply to you, I also noticed the little arrow next to “ETA” in your image. Did you try changing from ETA to other options? Looks like ETA maximum range is 25 blocks..",

Then you can make consolidation with very cheap fee rate.For reducing transaction size, you have other ways too but it doesn't apply all the time. Consolidating the inputs when the fee is low is a very great solution but in case, if you miss doing so, you can try spending different UTXO in case you want to send a small amount. For example, right now, in my signature campaign address, I have 4 unspent outputs(0.0015, 0.004, 0.005, 0.005). I tried to send 0.001 BTC in normal mode without selecting any coins(inputs) and the fee with 1 sat/byte was a total of 400 sats. It's because it was either taking all the unspent output as input or most of them while with my first UTXO, I could send 0.001 BTC. In that case, there would be only 1 input. I tried and it was asking for a fee of 200 sats in total.To do so, you have to enable \"Show coins\". With enabling that, you can see all the UTXO you have in the menu. So, when you will want to send funds, you can check which of your UTXOs can fill the amount and thus, you can avoid using more inputs. This will help you reduce the transaction size and thus, save some fees.You can only use this option in Desktop wallet, not in android app.",

My assumption is that they could be attributed to either internet connectivity or a potential bug in the version of Electrum you are using.The three transaction fee rates are not well displayed when you change between the mining fee;Let's take a look at the fees from ETA imagesQuote from: tranthidung on May 16, 2023, 10:56:43 AMETAWhat does ETA means? It is Estimate Time of Arrival. It means something. It is only estimation of arrival time or first confirmation time for your transaction.*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=450fee rate=44Transaction fee becomes= 44*450=19800 sats; that's equivalent to 0.000198 BTC, the fee on the first image is correct.Quote*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=450fee rate=106.3The transaction fee becomes= 106.3*450=47835 sats; that's equivalent to 0.00047835 BTC, the fee on the second image is wrong.Let's take a look at the fees from Mempool imagesQuoteMempoolMempool is an option which gives you information in how many waiting blocks for your first confirmation, such as within next 1-2 blocks, next 10 blocks, 25 blocks, etc.It is a better option than ETA. You will have less likely overpay fee for your transaction.*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=481fee rate=14.5Transaction fee becomes= 14.5*481=6974 sats; that's equivalent to 0.00006974 BTC, the fee on the first image is correct.Quote*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=481fee rate=135.7The transaction fee becomes= 135.7*481=65271 sats; that's equivalent to 0.00065271 BTC, the fee on the second image is wrong.Quote*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=481fee rate=103.1Transaction fee becomes= 103.1*481=49591 sats; that's equivalent to 0.00049591 BTC, the fee on the third image is wrong.Quote*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=481fee rate=35.4Transaction fee becomes= 35.4*481=17027 sats; that's equivalent to 0.00017027 BTC, the fee on the fourth image is correct.Let's look at the fees on the static fee rate.QuoteStaticThis option is useful when you comprehensively know what you are doing. It is helpful when you only make your transactions when mempool drops to your favorite fee rate.When you use this option, with your experience and mempool observation, you won’t overpay fee for sure.*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=481fee rate=30Transaction fee becomes= 30*481=14430 sats; that's equivalent to 0.0001443 BTC, the fee on the first image is correct.Quote*If transactions fee= size*rate; Input(s)=481fee rate=100Transaction fee becomes= 100*481=48100 sats; that's equivalent to 0.000481 BTC, the fee on the second image is wrong.Clearly looking at the USD value, you will notice they are the same, they didn't change even when you increased the sats in each transaction.",

It seems that these errors appeared across most of the images. My assumption is that they could be attributed to either internet connectivity or a potential bug in the version of Electrum you are using.It is like a bug and I noticed it too.The brown color appeared when I changed the estimation option around and scroll the slider left and right. It appeared when you don't have enough satoshi to pay the transaction fee. I guess it comes from inaccuracy of transaction value is not subtracted transaction fee correctly. You can see the transaction value is not correct from transaction size x fee rate too. It is like a bug on that day  I remember in previous versions, Electrum has an option to subtract transaction fee like in Bitcoin Core. In this version, it no longer exists to choose.I am not sure why it happened as today it works well.",
