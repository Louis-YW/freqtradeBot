  "content": "While one person paid 10,000 bitcoins (BTC) for two Papa John's pizzas another was paid 32 bitcoins to dress up in a crazy outfit and hold a sign that reads, \"STOP THE FED! USE @BITCOINS!!!\"What's remarkable is that even after a decade, the core message remains unchanged. I've come across interviews featuring Jeremy Sturdivant, the initial individual in the narrative, and it's evident how much he regrets his actions. However, I haven't come across any interviews featuring the second individual yet - I don't know his name. I'm interested to know what he decided to do with the bitcoins. Does he still possess them? When the story was published on the website, his bitcoin wallet was linked to the article, allowing anyone to offer him tips, and indeed, someone tipped him with one bitcoin.It feels refreshing reading stories from the past. This actually instills hope.  Is there any other story you have heard about bitcoin from the past?

Imagine 10,000 Bitcoin which is worth a billion dollars plus just for holding a paper saying \"Stop the fudz\". If the person in questions is the kind of person who is determined to hold, and they hold that amount till the first bull run they will probably be out of poverty in the rest of their life. But I doubt if he's still holding it till when Bitcoin price was worth a fortune and then becomes famous. If not he could have probably been had of somewhere in the news.",

This actually instills hope.  Is there any other story you have heard about Bitcoin from the past? Share with us.I came to know about cryptocurrency back in 2018 so it's just been 4.5+ years now. Personally, I have no story of mine or any of my relatives about Bitcoin. This really shocked me because some of my family members do have knowledge of the IT sector and one of my cousins was a software developer back in 2010. I still think why any of them gave any interest in BTC. Well, one of the reasons was less access to the internet and overall, fewer sources for information about all the processes about the industry (crypto). Coming back to the story, I recently read a topic on this platform in which the op shared his thoughts on how the whale took the high risk to become a BTC whale.  (Bitcoin whales took high risks, while studying price movement in the past). If you wanted to read some more stories then i prefer you to read (The most iconic bitcointalk threads. History on Bitcointalk) this thread because it consist of many iconic histories of BTC.You will find more interesting topic in here.161 History of Bitcoin 2007-2014The Bitcoin Origins - Explore Bitcoin History and Secret",

Share with us.I think the most common historical of them all is the story behind the bitcoin pizza, i don't think it can ever be forgotten in history because it's the most touching of them all if there are still more other stories i may bot get used to, we can also have some personal experience to give from those who are early birds in bitcoin adoption back then in 2010 and beyond, the most interesting of this all is that the history can still repeated itself, when we also invested today and hodl for a decade to come, which will be obviously about 2 more halving, what has happened before can still make a reoccurrence because we don't know how far bitcoin would have worth by then, maybe $500,000 in a decade to come.",

I've been here since 2014 and had very limited to zero knowledge regarding cryptocurrencies; my only exposure was through faucets, from which I acquired my first Bitcoin. Some of which were in my possession until a few years ago, when they were sold during COVID-19 quarantine and repurposed to be used for staking purposes, which was extremely popular and profitable during that period. I'm not sure if I regret repurposing that money because Bitcoin skyrocketed a few months later, but generally, I find it almost impossible to hold for such extended periods; eventually, you'll be tempted to sell.The ideal would be to have bought Bitcoin in 2014. The amount of BTC I had in my possession was too small to make a huge difference now, so holding it until now wouldn't matter too much.",

While some heard about Bitcoin but turned a deaf ear to it and after the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed they all started to regret their decision and hope that same opportunity present itself to them someday.Those are the only type of story I have read about and it's still popular among bitcointalkers, especially the aspect of not buying earlier than we did.",

It's something that those rich Bitcoin holders get to look back at. Not sure if they would regret it because they probably have more than 10K BTC as well.

He'd sneaked a whole PC into the server room and connected it to the outlet there and he'd leave it there running 24/7. One time I went there and thought he was doing some diagnostics on that PC and asked him why doesn't he use his business PC to do that and he had a story that he has a lot of his own licensed software there that he uses to build websites and stuff and his soft is better than the one the company has licenses for. A year later he finally told some other employee that he was mining bitcoin and it was all just a story. They never fired him for it or anything like that but he never made a lot of money either because he was selling these coins every year. He eventually had 0 bitcoins by the end of 2013 when it went to 1k. So, he in a way knew what to do, was given huge opportunity and wasted it. He did not recognize the true value in bitcoin until it was too late.",
