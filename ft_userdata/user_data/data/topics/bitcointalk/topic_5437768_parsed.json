But I would say don't get your hopes up with this short term trade, especially if you are a beginner it can be really difficult.To be honest, I prefer to make long-term investments only, and in the meantime you can learn and continue to hone our skills to better understand what short-term trading is all about with all the risks.Oh yes, you should try it using a demo account first before trying it with real money.",

Therefore, there is no fast role about making profit in trading. My advise is you need to learn and follow the simple techniques about trading which are:1.Taking lower risk by using low leverage2. Don't be greedy3. Don't over stay in the market especially when you are making profit because taking profit is better than losses.4. Don't rely on telegram group because they will end up feeding with the fees charged from you.",

The best strategy for you is Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), which means buying bitcoin at a specific price every fixed period of time, thus avoiding the problems of ups and downs, but it is a long-term strategy.Therefore, learn more, and therefore in demo trading, it is best to gain experience and from which you can trade daily.",

I am not here to frighten you my friend. But whatever I am saying is from personal experience and knowledge. In short term trades, in order to make more profit, you increase the risk in take and therefore the chances of getting loss also increases. As a newbie it’s always advised to get knowledge about trading. Then track the market for some time and at last use the money at right place. As a newbie your first objective should be to avoid losses, not to make profits.",

You should learn also in psychology because it's very important in trading.Trading day to day is only profitable if one hits the day's best entries. Instead of waiting for a lengthy candlestick before making a profit, scalpers take advantage of short candles. Trading in the short term is rewarding, but timing is difficult because trading positions are constantly being opened and closed. Scalping is the ideal strategy for short-term trading; if used improperly, it can result in losses as well as profits. Price movements are only effective on the short-term market, making it possible to profit daily on open bets.",
