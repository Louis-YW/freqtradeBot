I remember when I read about the reason for the confiscation of Khaled, they had told that money went to that mixer, but how could they determine the mixer to which those money went?There is a lawsuit against Blender due to which that mixer stopped and Sanctioned Mixer Blender Re-Launched as Sinbad so we will see that soon.If they are from North Korea, the United States will not be able to sized the domain, and therefore whenever suspicions revolve around them, all they will do is move to a new domain name.QuoteWallets of Blender.io on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains were put on a U.S. sanctions list in May 2022 after it turned out North Korean hacker group Lazarus used the service to launder cybercrime proceeds. The U.S. Treasury Department said Lazarus was behind the infamous Ronin hack, when $625 million worth of crypto was stolen from a blockchain bridge protocol used by the popular non-fungible token NFT game Axie Infinity.I've read their report here and can't find solid evidence on how to know the coins were sent to that mixer.https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/has-a-sanctioned-bitcoin-mixer-been-resurrected-to-aid-north-korea-s-lazarus-group/But I found thisQuoteBlender may have been motivated to re-brand in order to avoid sanctions, and OFAC could now seek to impose further sanctions on Sinbad. It may also have done so in order to gain trust from users, following Blender’s abrupt closure last year, and the disappearance of significant amounts of funds from the mixer.",
