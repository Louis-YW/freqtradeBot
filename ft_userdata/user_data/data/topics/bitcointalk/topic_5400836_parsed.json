Because they're claiming themselves to an expert in prediction which is the fact that isn't. I tend to agree that the chart will not lie and all price history of the price was recorded there but the chart won't tells to anyone what will happen in the future.  Though there are many people who believe that the chart will use as a tool to speculate the market price but that still remains to guess the price, there's no guarantee that you will have an accurate result. That's a perfectly right answer, education is the key to how we do understand the market behavior even though it's unpredictable.",

And about the topic what you define as education?You're talking about either the knowledge or process?That's right, all this time the chart only helps us guess where the price will move. With chart analysis we have a guide on when to exit or enter the market. So that this minimizes our losses. But beyond that, there are many that we cannot predict such as Whale which has large funds that can change the state of the market. Then education without practice or implementation will then be ineffective, therefore doing it directly will be more effective.",

They're not created by people out of their imagination. But what we make of those charts are subjective. We can make a hundred and one different predictions out of them. You don't follow the herd for the sake of following them. I suppose it's not that bad to be with the herd for as long as you are with them not because of going with the flow but because your analysis points to the same direction the herd is going.When it comes to money, emotions are indeed a hindrance or an obstacle. Most often, if we want to come up with the most reasonable decision, it is better to shut our emotions down.",

It's easily to build up models based on past data but it is not easy to build up a good and correct predictive model. There is margin of errors, deviations from a model but no matter how accurate it is, don't bet all your capital because of any model.Quote2. Don't ever think about following the Herd.Sometimes, it is good. Example panic sell. If you smell that there is news which will trigger panic sell on massive scale, you should move before the crowd or do it as soon as possible, just like earliest panic seller. It is not harmful and you can buy back with more amount of coins or tokens. It means you take advantage of crowd effects.Quote3. Emotions is the real money killer.If you make your decisions solely based on emotion, greed or fear, sooner or later you will lose your capital.",

This is just an isolated case but manipulation is very common in crypto due to its thin orderbook so no matter how bearish or bullish the coin is. There might be a chance that the technical analysis on chart will always show an accurate result especially the long time frame.You really think the whales was behind of UST and LUNA crash? hell no, the CEO and the team are the behind of the crash. Although we see they're cooperative and likely want to make their coins to be top 10 again, also promise their holders that their coins will recovered and not failed. But how do we know behind it? This is why I don't like anything that's centralized since you're need to trust 100% about his words and I'm not the person like that.",

We could resort to Mark Twain’s  There are lies, damned lies, and statistics  which I tend to use as a personal text, when I don’t find a better use for that space. Charts often represent numbers, and in order to take a given chart for granted, we need to be sure that the underlying data is correct, was properly gathered, and that the representation is adequate (*) for interpretation beyond doubt. On top of that, charts will tend to fail to provide a context on their own, which in BTC is crucial in many cases as strong fundamentals can easily sway trends.(*) A counterexample would be Purdue Pharma’s deliberate use of a misleading representation when charting data to support their marketing claims that their drug product wasn’t addictive. In order to do so, they used a logarithmic  scale instad of a linear scale, this giving the wrong and smoother impression with their data.",

My thought on that, however, is that many people who chorus a particular market or price direction may not even be TA traders who actually take time to monitor charts. There are people who just want to chant what others say without knowing what informed it. Again, I believe that despite the fact that there's no perfect situation anywhere in the world and that charts may not always be accurate; it's not any wiser trading without them.

Number 3, I completely agree with. The mind matters when trading. Emotions can make you enter/exit a trade prematurely, when personal feelings get mixed in trading it becomes difficult to be clear mind to make decisions. But can we truly trade without allowing our emotions get the better of us?",
