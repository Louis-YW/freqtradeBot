If you have any other questions you can let us know.",

Anyhow, if you wanna improve it here is feedback: 1) If BTC is selected in dropdown menu but user searches for ETH address, explorer should show ETH data instead of saying — entry is invalid, like blockcypher. 2) It shows wrong data [1], that's my address I can confirm this is not the true data  [1] https://www.talkimg.com/image/TPdgN",

You are right regarding the Block search, right now we are implementing it in the search engine, however it is already available at the system level: https://anontransfer.com/explorer/block/btc/00000000000000000003fb96492ae4cd8e7e70d98ef7d7379a7291347eb6ee91Quote from: libert19 on October 23, 2023, 11:13:07 AMQuote from: anontransfer.com on October 17, 2023, 10:39:42 PM..Product Launch..Cryptocurrency ExplorerAs promised, we are very happy to make official the launch of our Cryptocurrency Explorer, where you can check the balance of the addresses, see information about transactions and also blocks.
