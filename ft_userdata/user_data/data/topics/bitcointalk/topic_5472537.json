I was not aware of the Binance refugee card, thanks for sharing it.1.I would say, you missed the biggest role that Bitcoin Blockchain plays here and that is of transparency. In most of the cases charity funds given to refugees is just stolen by some middlemen or there are some huge illegal deductions in the amount by the distributors and the refugees can't do anything at all instead of taking that money and make a living with that.But BTC blockchain can avoid that corruption as every transaction will be recorded and can be used to track the amount if it reached to the real owner. 2.Government giving refugees a place to live should allow them to start some micro level business so they would not depend on the funds for there life. Governments can help them by giving some loan in the form of BTC3.If the country giving place to migrant don't have huge resources (funds) then Bitcoin can be used to raise funds for those refugees. Everyone wanted to donate money can send money from anywhere in the world.4.Local businesses should give discounts to these migrants on buying things with BTC directly. But first there are not that much business around accepting BTC as payment method so they should first do that. Make it a payment method.",

Brainstorm \"safe\" methods to convert Fiat to Bitcoin - Bitcoin ATMs and P2P exchanges.2.

But while they keep their doors close internet banking services open for use by customers. A wise customer will quickly take the favoured position by buying bitcoin through any reputed exchange platform, supposing they don't have an existing account they can immediately open one and run the transfer through p2p and send the coin to their selfcustody wallet as simple as that before things escalate to the extend internet services are shutdown.In the event they leave their war zone and settled in other country as refugees they can at any time find a physical buyer that will be interested to buy their bitcoin and give physical cash at hand since almost everyone now has crypto awareness. In times of war the faster you make smart and strategic decisions concerning your finance the safer ground you find yourself having access to your money at ease while your counterparts are lockout.",

It is not a lottery or something that will bring you a quick profit with just the click of a button.It is true that there is a possibility that you will win the lottery, but even obtaining a million dollars will not make you rich for the rest of your life. Many of those who obtained this amount returned to poverty after less than 10 years, so financial knowledge is necessary and important.This does not only apply to individuals. Even oil-producing countries that did not improve the exploitation of their resources have become poor, including Chile or Venezuela.The summary of what I want to say is that even if people and governments adopt Bitcoin, without proper planning, adoption will not make a difference.",

But to the best of my digital banking and commercial experience, I think there are various methods bitcoin can be easily converted to fiat either a decentralized or centralized manner but since centralized exchanges are mandated to block some IP addresses of some regions, it's better to use decentralized p2p.If refugees seek a new place of their comfort zone, the first thing after having a place to stay for a while is to get a bank account that can at least accept some deposit of money, they can make use of hodlhodl, we have others like BISQ, Agrodesk, they don't request for KYC, they can simply set up an account on these exchanges and when they have Bitcoin to sell, they can do so using these exchanges. To avoid locking the accounts, they should make sure that the amount to be received does not exceed the maximum limit of the account types they opened, I'm saying this because banks are funny, they can limit them with basic accounts since they are refugees.I think with this, they can endure until everything settles. Concerning banks that are not working, I believe most commercial banks are now digital, there should be some places within the country of affected people to have access to ATM machines, they can use their debit card to have access to the needs.",

Because I also think that Bitcoin can help refugees or anyone who wants to flee or leave their country which is experiencing a humanitarian crisis or is at war. Carrying cash in person may be very dangerous. So converting it to Bitcoin will indeed be much safer. Because control is completely in our hands. Apart from that, with Bitcoin it will also be easier for us to access it as long as there is internet. Especially if the banks are closed. So as long as we can transfer money from our bank account digitally, we can convert it to bitcoin. But we also have to make sure that we use a safe wallet. And have stored the private key safely.",

You cited, to put it mildly, the erroneous opinion that \"Ukrainian banks closed their doors after Russia's terrorist attack on Ukraine\".Perhaps some banks did so, but the largest banks continued to operate. Work was stopped only in the territories that were occupied and looted. Moreover, the key banks of Ukraine canceled the accrual of interest for the use of loans to individuals (for a considerable time, the interest for the use of credit funds was not accrued), removed penalties for non-payment of loans.... The work of processing did not stop, cards and accounts were serviced, including - ATMs and bank branches.This is the reality, I speak as a resident of Ukraine, who did not leave Ukraine 2. regarding \"bitcoin can help\". If refugees have savings in bitcoins, have access to them and the necessary data - of course it will be useful, and safer than keeping a bunch of cash or bank cards. The question is whether refugees have bitcoin savings. I honestly haven't heard that refugees from the Middle East, and/or Africa coming to the EU for example, use cryptocurrencies frequently and actively. So the question is rather whether this part of the population has bitcoins ?",

The question is..... Can Bitcoin help these refugees?I would say not just “maybe,” but bitcoin is a must-have in such cases. For several reasons.- in many countries there are limits on the export of cash from the country.- banking transactions may be limited, prohibited, and also, banks themselves may simply freeze any withdrawal of funds from a personal account by order of local authorities (in order to avoid the withdrawal of capital, which “destroys” the local economy).- bitcoin is easy to take out and transport, because you don’t even need “rubber bands for banknotes” for this.  And also, bitcoin is easy, quick and cheap to send anywhere in the world. For example, refugees may send this \"forward\" themselves to their relatives, so as not to risk loss during the move. Quote from: Kakmakr on November 02, 2023, 06:08:59 AMWe know that Ukrainian Banks closed their doors, when the first bombing started and most Banks do this when there are a possibility of a war. So how do people get their money out of the \"Banking\" system, when Banks close their doors? In order not to find yourself in such a difficult situation, need to prepare in advance by withdrawing all funds from banks, or even better, by not making deposits in banks at all. You cease to be the owner of your money by giving it to banks. Whoever can manage, control, own is the master / owner. Simply, you lose control, which means you cease to be the actual owner, if the bank may simply not give up your money.Quote from: Kakmakr on November 02, 2023, 06:08:59 AMWe also know that the Banking system are reluctant to open Bank accounts for foreigners or refugees in the country where they end up. \"In April of this year, Binance Charity launched the first-of-its-kind Binance Refugee Card for all current and new Binance users from Ukraine forced to move to EEA countries as a result of the war with Russia, the card and crypto-based cash assistance helped 15,000 Ukrainian refugees and internally displaced people.\" - Source : https://www.binance.com/en/feed/post/93305How can Bitcoin help these people to relocate and continue with their lives in a new country? 1.
