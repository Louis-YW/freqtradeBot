I mean regulations from my country or everyone that has OKX exchange account has been sent the email already?They are implementing this Regulations worldwide. So if someone want to trade or make deposits they will have to do KYC verification. I just talked with their representative in Telegram Group and they assured about it. OKX was one on the most recommended non KYC exchange and now they are asking for KYC documents. After Kucoin, OKX has implemented KYC verification as a must. So now Huobi and Coinex are the best non KYC CEXs. Now It's a must to use DEX exchanges for anonymity, decentralization and about security especially for old OKX users.",

Time is obviously running out for those who are fond of using centralized exchanges with unverified accounts. Of course, this is expected, but it's still unfortunate that they cannot anymore provide even a low limit for those users who don't want to reveal their personal information.I guess the largest remaining domino to have yet to fall is Huobi? It's $1,000 deposit limit for unverified users is rather low, but even this will probably be gone in the next weeks or months.",

You can write any information there, and you will be approved for a $1,000 limit.The exchange has again lowered the limits for unverified clients, which means that mandatory KYC for all users will be announced on this exchange very soon:This only means identity document verification for OKX users. $1000 is too small. Not even maximum daily, weekly or monthly withdraw, but lifetime if your account do not get verified. I have deposited and withdrawn more than $1000 before and identity verification is compulsory. It remains 28 days now seen on my OKX account.",

And now OKX is also doing the same thing. I don't know which exchange will ask their users to do KYC.It's not surprising to me because this has been happening for a long time. Even Poloniex and Bittrex, which used to not ask for KYC, implemented it a few years ago because my friend was required to do it a year ago. And the only option for crypto users who don't want to do verification is to use a DEX.But it is also a matter of convenience that traders get. If they are comfortable using one or more exchanges and find that those exchanges require verification by doing KYC, they will.",
