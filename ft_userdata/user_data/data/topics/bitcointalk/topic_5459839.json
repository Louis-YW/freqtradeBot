  "content": "There will be a review campaign for Mixin Safe in the next few days. I am working on the review terms and conditions. For each review, 0.003 BTC (at current price it's $90+) will be rewarded. The service is not like our usual services we see in gambling or mixing projects. It's a very different service. That's why I thought to have this topic so that everyone who will be interested in the review campaign can check the service and prepare mentally. We will have a tight deadline but I think it will be enough for reviewers to submit their review. Please ask any questions if you have about using the product. I will request the management to guide you if needed.We will have a total 100 members in the review which means almost everyone who will apply will have a chance to get the reward. The funds for the entire campaign has been already secured to my escrow wallet.Product discussion on Bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459401.0",

Basically, a wallet app that claims to offer a better way for multi-sig so that their users can recover their funds as long as they have one of their keys. They hold one of them, just like other services in this field. CMIIW.The name Mixin is not unfamiliar to me. I probably use one of their services in the past (Mixin Messenger) but I can't really vouch for their security, reliability, etc. I only used them for a short time.

Usually, review campaigns run by Royse777 are strictly regulated, so they are not available to everyone.  Therefore, most users will not be able to participate, and this will increase your chances of being accepted into this campaign.  Then do not forget that the amount that will be paid for each review is not small, and therefore I expect that the conditions for creating the evaluation will not be easy and not within the reach of everyone.Good to everybody willing to join and congratulations for the wallet project for choosing their advertisment strategy to be managed by Royse777.

But, I will wait to see the exact conditions of the campaign. Hi, from the Mixin Safe team. The price shows on the website are meant to be the pricing proposal when product fully launched. For test, the price is very cheap, starts at $2 per year, and it includes a free transaction to send, so $2 is the minimum cost for a tester. Quote from: dkbit98 on July 14, 2023, 08:50:28 PMOne thing I really don't like from start  is that I have to use my phone number to use Mixin app  Think we already talked about the product in the ANN topic.  For the test, I believe you have no need to worry about this. Before the anonymous number feature is fully rollout, you may use some phone number services on the Internet to get a random phone number just for a single SMS. Then you can begin the test, just you know that you may lose the account access because you don't own the random phone number, and if you like the product you can change the number to our Mixin Anonymous Number once it's launched in upcoming months.Quote from: hugeblack on July 16, 2023, 12:31:16 AMI searched quickly about this service.Personally, I do not like miniscript, and with the limited number of wallets that support this technology, recent ledger miniscript vulnerability[1], Ledger Recovery[2], and their price policies[3], I expect that the number of users for this service will be very few and limited, and thus achieving a return from it will be difficult.It is true that they avoid a single point of failure, and in theory their service is decentralized and better than Ledger Recovery, but such services will achieve greater success if they are from one of the producers of hardware wallets.
