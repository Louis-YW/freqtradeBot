But we should also know that November 2021, bitcoin got to all-time-high of 69000. Some people got bitcoin, holding it and the price falled as some people sold. But the good news is that all-time-high is still possible and that might likely be in 2024/2025, just a prediction though. During the falling of bitcoin price, it was more on altcoins as they fall the most. Some people save coins on exchanges, 2022 was another lesson for those kind of people as FTX collapsed and millions or billion worth in dollars that many people lost. Not you key not your coin is a lesson in 2022 as those coins saved on exchanges wallet addresses dropped significantly after the FTX implosion.Let us begin the fun of 2023 by guessing what would be the highest bitcoin price in 2023.",

I like your optimism i've vote for 30-40k. I expect strong recovery that will push price close to 30k. Maybe even above 40k. We did not have a strong short squeez starting from ATH in NOV 2021. RSI on monthly was never as oversold as it is now. Fear/greed index shows extreme fear for last 1 year. We had only few days of fear and 0 days of greed. https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/I expect strong recovery but i don't think it will start next cycle. I think we are done with regular bitcoin cycles.",

But before taking it in negative manner, we should really appreciate that, it gave hope to buy more Bitcoins and also welcomed many new users to Bitcoins. This year as many of us predicted will be really big for Bitcoins. Many have estimated Bitcoins to cross 30k usd before March. If Bitcoin manages to do this, then definitely towards September we might see all time high price of Bitcoins. So let’s hope for the best and wait.",

But with my hope, I expect bitcoin will be able to hit $30k in 2023, and that will be the basis to signal that the bear season is over and prepare for a strong growth year. What we're all looking forward to is halving in 2024. But before bitcoin can hit 30k, I think it will drop one more time, and that is our last chance to buy bitcoin cheaply.",

The high of 2019 (the year after bearish trend) was around $15k levels (then ATH was $19.5k). I guess anything from $50k levels to $55k levels got big possibilities in coming months.Also, I like to speculate about the time frame of occurrence of high price of 2023, as per 2019, we may see high price of this year by 2nd quarter of this year. May or June will be the months as per similar speculation. These are all not by any technical projection but based on the concepts of 4 year cycle of bitcoin market and the saying of 'history repeats itself'.",

Although the effects of the recession and geopolitical conditions will still be felt in the crypto space as well as in Bitcoin so an increase in the price of Bitcoin may still seem difficult. But I don't think Bitcoin will have a hard time passing $20K within this year, because investors and traders still have great faith in Bitcoin which still has potential for growth and are still making purchases in the market.",

By 2024 is where the halving will happen and I'm guessing this will really move the price above $100k just when we expected it to happen in 2021 but didn't. Maybe the next will finally make it happen.So many people have already said we have found the bottom for months yet the price continues to go under. It's when the time when holders already lost hope and sold that they'd be surprised by its price comeback.",

It could be deceiving that bitcoin is at $16500 today but in just a month, the price can increase above $20000, if it decreased back below $20000, you should not forget that we are speculating what could be the highest price of bitcoin in 2023.

Theoretically, in 2023 the price to raise gradually. In Q1, Bitcoin may struggle to pass $20k, and it may struggle to pass $25k in Q2. While in Q3, I expect BTC price to try passing $30k. Then, at the end of 2023, I hope BTC price moves constantly toward $35k. So, in early 2024, we can expect that BTC price to be around $40k.",

Assuming that there will be no events, no black swans or something that will put a dent on the market like the FTX collapse of Terra Luna debacle. So it's a long shot but I will stick with this prediction, still conservative estimates as we might be looking at the 6 digit figures in the next ATH 2024/2025. But this is a good indication that we can achieved that $100k that we all wanted to see next if the price in 2023 could be in the $30k-$40k in my opinion.",
