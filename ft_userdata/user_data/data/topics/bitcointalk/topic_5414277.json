      "body": "It wont be completely a threat to Bitcoin because many people see Bitcoin as an asset/ invesment instead a payment medium that can contest against the traditional ones provided by centralized platforms, like Visa & Mastercard. I don't share that vision however.The digital dollar will probably be very successful among the average people who dont know about Bitcoin or cryptocrurrencies in general, since this project of digital currency by USA would likely make easier for people to manage their finances, pay their bills, pay for their services and keep track of their credit score, but in exchange of centralization and possible surveillance for commercial and law enforcement purposes.Bitcoin shall continue to have high liquidity from those who want to speculate with its value, as investement and tradeable asset, it is also worth noticing those businesses which accept Bitcoin, they do it because either share the idea of a decentralized medium of exchange (while they also accept Visa & Mastercard) or necessity (as consequence from being excluded by Visa & Mastercard). People who already accept Bitcoin could just add the CBDC option if they want and keep Bitcoin and the rest of their options intact.",

Digital dollar would remain a boundary bonded currency and that's not what bitcoin is. The uniqueness of bitcoin would always be its stronghold and the reason it persists in our world. Having the government hedge on the energy consumption has become an old news and it would be washed away with the strokes of the clock. The CBDC will never hold a substantial threat to bitcoin.",

Is it not going to be backed 1:1 ? It is going to definitely be the same thing honestly and thus at the end of the day what you should focus on is accepting the fact that it's not a crypto it's not an ath it's not even a new kind of virtual currency, it's just nothing but fiat and thus it does have constraints of the fiat as well and there is nothing to be worried about since they are going to be backed and strong, hopefully, maybe not like usdt but can be used in its place.",

Addressing the latter first;Quote from: Queentoshi on September 20, 2022, 05:28:58 PMDo you think with the level of civilization in the united states, that the digital dollar will be successful?Yes, it's a possibility. Digital exposure is quite high in the U.S, and having an extra layer on that using the block chain could definitely be successful. It could create a cheaper and faster way to transact using the USD, than what is available today, while giving the government more control of transactions.QuoteWill digital dollar be a threat to bitcoin?Is the regular dollar a threat to Bitcoin? It isn't, so a digital version, or more specifically a blockchain version would not be any different.People use Bitcoin for a couple of reasons;• As a global currency,• For privacy,• For freedom,• As an asset and/or hedge fund,• As a speculative asset, etc.A CBDC would not fill this and attract those users to hold them instead.",

I want to note that your caption is wrong or doesn't correlate with the body. The real question would have been \"Will digital dollar be a threat to stable coins like USDT\".Bitcoin is in different class as it is not centralized, unlike some stable coins and the alleged digital dollar. Then, to answer your question, there'll be no difference between fiat dollar and digital dollar. So, since fiat dollar doesn't affect Bitcoin, the digital version will not also. The innovation will encourage many to learn about cryptocurrency, it is an advantage.",
