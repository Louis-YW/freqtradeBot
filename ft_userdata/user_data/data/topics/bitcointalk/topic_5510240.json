For me, maybe it’s only been recovered now after being forgotten for years…",

This has led to speculation about their possible identity and their reasons for selling. I don’t think it is Satoshi making these transfers but it could be some early bitcoiner that had some interactions with him in those early days. Maybe somebody found their lost keys or maybe they just wanted to move their coins to more secure storage.There was a different Satoshi era bitcoiner who moved funds to Kraken this Tuesday morning. If they’ve been hodling since the very beginning, there is no doubt that they have enough money to meet all their financial needs by now and are ready to cash out.",

Considering that, it's not impossible for one of Satoshi's wallets to activate. It's believed that in the early days, he was the first miner and controls a massive amount of Bitcoin--close to 1 million BTC spread across different wallets.",

Because now it is some coins inside a bigger wallet that are moving from one address to another.P.S. This also counters that old speculation that \"Satoshi owns a million bitcoins\"...At first, that was my speculation, but after digging deeper and reading from different sources, I found that these are probably early investors with multiple wallets or addresses, all owned by a single person or entity. What’s intriguing is that just recently, there’s been a trend of major transfers, each for 50 BTC.As mentioned in this article:QuoteOn September 20, 2024, five distinct wallets, each transferring 50 BTC, were tracked by the on-chain transaction monitor, Whale Alert.Although this isn’t the first time old wallets, also known as Satoshi-era wallets, have moved funds, the fact that five wallets, each holding 50 BTC, are possibly controlled by the same owner is worth noting. I just thought I’d share this news to spark some speculation and get the community talking since it's interesting for those who haven’t been following the big news in crypto.And there’s more.QuoteThis isn’t the first time dormant Bitcoin wallets have come to life. Earlier this year, a wallet inactive for over 12 years moved 500 BTC, and another wallet dormant for over 10 years became active in April 2023.So, if I hadn’t searched for this info, I wouldn’t have known that 500 BTC had been moved this year... And surprisingly, instead of triggering a market dump, the market is actually on the rise right now.",

That's my opinion.",

It's false to believe one can actually hold bitcoin for over 14 years like that without services of transactions being made since those while. So it's assumed that such holder must be of access restrictions of the wallet and has just unlocked the keys.",
