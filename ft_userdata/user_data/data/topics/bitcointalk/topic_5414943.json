  "content": "There's a troll who likes to gaslight, but mentions that he doesn't like \"social drama\", but continues to start social drama. Is he baiting people? Perhaps, but I'll bite.How can someone compare the Hodlnaut trials to the Scaling Debate? The troll also wants to indicate, indirectly, that like the fraudulent followers of Craig Wright who have their \"echo chamber\", that the supporters of Segwit are also fraudulent that listen only to their own \"echo chamber\".The troll doesn't differentiate that Craig Wright is not Satoshi trying to claim he's Satoshi, and the Scaling Debate is an actual technical debate on how to proceed in Bitcoin's development further. I thought the latests posts of the troll were good, but he was probably was planning another game of gaslighting.Plus if the majority of the Bitcoin community indeed followed Roger Ver, or Gavin Andresen, WHO was one of the people supporting them during that time? Craig Wright.",

When the big block camp started saying that the debate is \"political\" and that it was about who controls Bitcoin, they stopped arguing in good faith and started using populism and propaganda in what was meant to be a technical debate.",

Not only is Faketoshi (AKA Craig Wright) claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto without handing in any inkling of proof but he also shills for obvious scams and not-so-obvious scams but nonetheless have historically been proven to be scam, just a bit more complicated. Of course I am talking about his shitcoin endorsements. Really says something about the character of a person when they endorse shitcoins even though they \"truly\" only believe in Bitcoin. Nothing he does has any kind of positive side for the Bitcoin community. He seems like a ego maniac to me.",

      "body": "ok...for all those interested. im the supposed trollfirstly i have been calling out CSW as a scammer since 2015!!stop being a social drama queen liar to defend your silly opinonand no dont pretend 100%(an unnatural occuracne to even exist) of btc were segwit supporters in mid 2017. and now dont even dare to try to say i am saying that i am comparing the whole BTC community as CSW'show dare you stoop so lowYOU= your 11 buddies are such queen's of drama. just stop with the drama and understand the context. and the details and the actual words and the actual meanings of actual things.. and realise what the question and my response was actually aboutthe question and my response:so i poked at a certain group of people (only 3-4 of them were in the hodlenaut topic asking a genuine question, which i found hypocritical of those 3-4 to ask based on previous experience of them) because:certain people in the hodlonaut topic asked(not verbatim) why do idiots blindly stay loyal to other idiots who tell a story that is only backed up by quotes of other idiot friends of theirs.. but that story does not align to actual proof. such as blockdata. historic events, actual code.etcsee a genuine question. that deserves a genuine answerhere is the link to the posthttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5413844.msg61008060#msg61008060i noted the hypocrisy of these certain peoples question.. so thought i would let them solve their own question by using an example of when THEY personally decided to trust friendship loyalty over hard fact data i called out a group of people for using social bias and loyalties to push a different narrative(about a different event) that does not fit the real blockdata version of events.. so they can get some prospective of the reasons. because those asking the question are involved in a false social drama narrative of the other event i poked at..thus they could ask themselves and answer themselves why they believe in loyalty of human trust rather than evidence of immutable hard fact dataso windfury is upset because I called him out on a topic.. even though i didnt use his name. he seems to have outed himself.. by bitingpoor lad.. he cant be bothered to read blockchain data so wants to point fingers and name call to defend his opinion that bitcoin upgraded without controversy, without a hard fork(his buddy group narrative).. even though there was controversy and a mandatory hardfork to remove the opposition, to activate a bitcoin upgradeshamefully he then wasnt to push any that disagree's with the tactics used to get the upgrade activated, must somehow belong in the same group as scammers and thieves and scumbagswindfury.. put your social drama to bed. ..its funny that now he is still trying to defend that his opinion remains strong. and thinks i am trying to confuse him to the point of insanity and manipulate his mind(gaslight) and i must just be a troll for trying to get him to actually look at the evidence that opposes his opinion about events of bitcoin..oh well windfury.. stop crying. stop posting social drama and JUST READ THE BLOCKCHAIN DATA.. you have had YEARS to do itone major thing you should learnbitcoin does not upgrade unless it shows high majority flag accepting to upgrade.if people veto, object. this does not mean they are following some scammer team. it means they dont like the path an upgrade wants to take and are simply objecting to an upgrade. which normally means the upgrade proposers go away and tinker with their proposal and come back with a compromise..it does not mean mandate the upgrade to activate anyway by removing non-flagging blocks to fake a 100%(which is an unnatural amount to ever accomplish but they did) and hen do social drama calls that objectors must be on some other team of scammers.GROW UP.the point of the question was not to debate the whos on what team of some civil war event that fits their narrative..  it was to point out that even in BTC there are people that would rather cause social drama by faking history to fit their story of drama creating crap that they just want to entertain each other with for years by echo chambering the fake versions of history just to make more dramalast thing. if you want to start another social drama debate (you did by making this topic)atleast try to provide evidence. and not just shwow you emotions and try pigeon holing people into some scammer group becasue you think if they disagree with your opinion they must be some troling scammer.. now go read the blockchain data of the event you continually want to social drama lie about. get your facts straight. realise the truthe and move on with yourlifeoh and by the way core devs actually admittted that the controversial hard mandatory hard fork occured..so dont turn this into a 2022 debate about calling out the devs. its about calling out just 12 idiots that still cling on to a version of event that didnt not occur the way they want to present itso read the blockchain data, own up to your mistake. and make that group number, one less",

Simple question.  After putting your data into countless dozens of threads, how many people have replied saying \"this data supports franky1's assertions\"?  Or anything remotely along those lines?How many people have interpreted this data as you interpret it?It's not many, isn't it?For years, you've been saying this data proves you right.  And for years, very few users, if any, have agreed with you.  Yet you claim the evidence is irrefutable and proves you right.  Why does no one else see it?So is it really the best orchestrated conspiracy in history, where we've somehow managed to prevent tens-of-thousands of accounts from making a comment that vindicates you?  Just one solitary user agreeing with you and exposing our supposed cover-up and recognising your \"truth\"?  Or is the more likely outcome that the \"evidence\" doesn't mean what you think it means?  To me, it's far more probable that you have been wasting your time and discrediting yourself by spouting ridiculous nonsense for years on end.  What really happens is that people see your posts, look at the data, roll their eyes like I do, think \"this franky1 weirdo is a raving lunatic\" and either disregard you or add their voices to the ever-growing number of people that say you're wrong.  The *only* rational conclusion is that you don't understand what the data means.  You are reading data, misinterpreting its meaning and arriving at a flawed conclusion that no sane person will ever agree with, no matter how many times you repeat it like a brain-damaged parrot.  You are the Flat-Earther here.  You have convinced yourself of something that simply isn't true.  Your confirmation-bias won't allow you to see what others see, and so you dismiss them as part of a conspiracy that doesn't even exist. Why do you persist with discrediting yourself further?  You are wrong.  Accept it.",

I can't speak for why his name is being mentioned on this particular thread, cause I do not understand fully what motivated it, but from a general bitcoiner's perspective, you cannot afford to totally ignore CSW. His takes are as wrong as he is arrogant in delivering them, but there are lots of totally ignorant people out there who can fall for his crap, if it's not debunked as aggressively as he is spreading them.The media is not doing a good job at stating how wrong his claim of being Satoshi is, so bitcoin enthusiasts have to do that job.",
