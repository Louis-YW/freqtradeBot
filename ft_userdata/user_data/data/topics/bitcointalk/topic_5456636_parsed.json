Those videos demonstrate the ability of the creators who have created such piece of art. Their intention to create those videos is to entertain the public and earn revenue form Youtube AdSense program. The police official might know about the videos and that's why they are not taking any actions against such things because in reality none of those exist.Don't just blindly trust such videos and do deep research before getting to any conclusion. The creators mostly love the idea of creating something that has the element of horror in it so that the audience would love to watch it and share it with their friends and loved ones. If we blindly trust those videos then we may develop fear in our hearts and which isn't a good thing my friend.",

So then the cops will out scouting the streets for some homeless person to lock up. either way they're going to end up in jail.",
