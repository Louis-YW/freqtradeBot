  "content": "I do see people come here and declare themselves as long term holders of bitcoin because they are holding for weeks to months; they are right because previously they were into intraday or sessional/trend trading which may not last for more than six months.But, bitcoin's cycle is 4 year long which means your long term should cover at least one full cycle of bitcoin markets.To enjoy the real benefits of bitcoin investments, you must plan up for covering 3 to 5 cycles of bitcoin markets. Waiting period of more than 10 years may sound unrealistic to many people but I like to suggest them to google to know about the real power of decade long holding of famous stocks.Yeah, there were stocks which transformed long term holders to multi-millionaires for the investment of $100 to $1000. Luckily, we do not have to break our head to find the right stock for long term holding in this crypto space; it is only bitcoin but to get 1000x returns, we must learn patience.For the people, who argue that they cannot lock $1000 for year then they should plan up for $50 or $100; that is very basic. If we stick with basics of investments then we can easily convert deep bear markets of bitcoin into moderate ones.",

      "body": "A long-term perspective is what makes Bitcoin investment to be a not do-or-die affair and one should buy Bitcoin with the money one can afford to forget for a very long time, so this requires a lot of patience to achieve. I agree with you on the 10-year investment cycle you mentioned and the waiting period becomes less stressful when you are not holding funds in Bitcoin that you will be needing for urgent needs but being set aside for good period. Giving Bitcoin a month or 1 year investment time frame may not give the desired profits results, as a matter of fact, you can lose your money investing for a short period base, but if it covers at least to cycle which is 4 years x 2 which equal 4 years, you can be guaranteed of making a fortune from a littler investment from this time, considering now that the price of Bitcoin is low.Not only Bitcoin, but other assets in the Bitcoin category such as Gold, and silver need long-term strong for good profits margin, I am and am still an advocate of long-term holding for profits maximization, but above all, one needs to do their own research to get a personal conviction before deciding to invest and to what period he/she is willing to wait.",

So long investment of for some years are best that can give an investor a mega profit due to bullrus of Bitcoin over the years.",

      "body": "People must understand that making a profit here in crypto doesn't just come in just a few days unless you are in trading. But because we are talking about holding - this means that it takes months to years or even decades, from short-term to long-term holding. QuoteWhat is a short-term investment?If you’re making a short-term investment, you’re often doing so because you need to have the money at a certain time. If you’re saving for a down payment on a house or a wedding, for example, the money must be at the ready. Short-term investments are those you make for less than three years.https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-short-term-investments/So if we are talking about long-term investment, that for sure it is more than that and it depends on how long we have to keep our investment running. Because this is a game of patience and sadly, not all have that winning strategy as they mostly fall into short-term.",

Quote Luckily, we do not have to break our head to find the right stock for long term holding in this crypto space; it is only bitcoin but to get 1000x returns, we must learn patience.This is also part of the reason I choose to invest in bitcoin over stocks. Researching to invest in stocks that can bring profits in the long term is difficult because there are so many stocks that need to be analyzed and compared to choose from. But for the crypto market, it takes me only a little bit of time to choose a long-term investment, just choosing bitcoin and choosing the right time to buy is enough.",

As far as my understanding of hodling is concerned, I think these people are not hodlers. They are just keeping their Bitcoin inactive for a while after rounds of trading, but they're not hodlers. And weeks and months are not long term. Long term should be years. It is possible for a trader to lie low for months while the market is always red. But he is not necessarily shifting to hodling. He could get in once again anytime when the market is turning green already. Or it's possible he's just waiting for the swing. But he's not a hodler.",

Not even talking about stock of companies that failed during bear market (90% of them failed)So now is the question where is bitcoin. Maybe we have 1 more cycle, maybe 2, maybe 0. What if I tell you, we are about to enter a 3 wave bear market 2021-2031 after a 3 wave bull market, that we just ended (2009-2021)",

Indeed, the money one should invest should be also an amount he can disregard no matter what happen but things just don't work as simple as that. There will be instances wherein investors would be 'forced' to sell in order to solve problems on ither aspects or concerns. 10years is a long interval and there are many things that may happen during that period.

For example holding five or ten years, meaning that bitcoin purchases can be made in accordance with the accumulation of capital owned, either using a gradual purchase formula or adjusting to ongoing market prices. Thus bitcoin holdings on long term targets will find great gains.If we look at the growth of bitcoin, then the four year cycle will reach the next ATH in the current year, then we will most likely enter proper accumulation in the next five or ten year holding period.
