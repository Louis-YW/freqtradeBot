Someone is trying to talk me into this but I think its wise to share the thought on here.Big loan I would say not advisable at all.We are near the end of the so called Ethereum mining in September and a lot of developments may happen,maybe for the good of the mining or for the bad of it,if it is this second option then it is clear taking a big loan for building farms is a mistake.However I would say a small loan to build one or two GPU rigs is never wrong,as I think most of us has the possibility to pay the loan even if mining for the moment is not profitable,actually it is profitable to mine and even after Ethereum mining there is RVN and ETC who are the next best things to mine.Overall I would say it only depends on your point of view,above I described what I would do in such situation.",

If it's more than 5 cents, then forget about mining and any mining credits. There are no promising coins for mining on video cards, and there is a lot of competition in mining with ASICs.Read thishttps://bitproit.com/gpu-mining-profitability-after-ethereum-merge/",

Someone is trying to talk me into this but I think its wise to share the thought on here.Such decision should be taken based on couple of parameters. It's risky anyway but mining is a serious business so it can be started through a loan. 1. Cost of electricity 2. Interest rate on loan3. Detailed profitability calculation to see monthly profit after paying electricity bill and loan installments4. Cost of hardware 5. Maintenance cost of hardware Unless you have these data points in front of you, it's not wise to say a blanket no.",
