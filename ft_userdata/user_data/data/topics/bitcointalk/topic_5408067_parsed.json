  "content": "Social media has been awash by the next 5 upgrades expected on the Ethereum blockchain and it is no more news that it is responsible for the current bullish trend in the crypto market. The upgrade will start as early as September according to Tim Beiko who is a foundational member, so the opportunity expected from it is exciting the market and triggering the bullish run.This is the biggest event for the Ethereum blockchain with the hint by Vitalik Buterin who is a co-founder. The next 5 upgrade phases will make it more efficient and the scalability will be better than before. Ethereum as the most actively developed blockchain needs regular upgrades and the introduction of Ethereum merge will help to realize this, and will reduce the present energy consumption by over 99%, and increase sustainability and security within the blockchain as the proof-of-stake mechanism will be the order of the day as it fades off \"proof-of-work\" system.Will Ethereum sustain its current bullish trend during and after this merge?",

The ethereum merged announcement has been making so many miners are looking for an alternative way for that and they were going to the ethereum classic. The fact that if when you are aware if these days ethereum merged has been creating a good hype around the ethereum holders. The bullish trend will be even bigger once the blockchain will be moving to the POW. The supply will be decrease and there would be a reward for the stakers as well. Ethereum classic will be flooded by so many miners. Some rumours about the new hardfork was coming about that.",

How does proof of stake increase security of the Ethereum blockchain as compared to the proof of work, which has pretty much been solid since the inception of the network?Proof of Stake, this is ominous and disagrees with some naysayers. I'm also excited and looking forward to the upcoming upgrade, but after reading some docs, I'm also starting to worry about the decentralization of ETH going away when it's fully migrated to POS. We still can't conclude anything, still waiting for feedback from the community and whether Vitalik Buterin has any plans for that. ETH is different from the rest of altcoins because of its decentralization, once it loses decentralization I think I will stop using it too.",

It could be, but not in the long term, we have to factor in that we are still the bearish cycle, so it's hard to see any coin that will have a massive rally, even ETH itself, even if there is such hype on it's upgrade. And then we all know that everything hinges on BTC. If BTC is down and so other crypto's are, as they are all correlated on the price of BTC.Nevertheless, I do hope that this upgrade will be smooth, and of course solved the current issue on the high gas fees. Although recently it has started to go down to a level that we all can manage to pay.",

However, someone mentioned about the Flippening again, I doubt that it will happen. Bitcoin will still remain on top of the food chain and ETH is still going to be in the second place.However, the effect of this might not last that long, maybe ETH can move past $2k again or even $3k. But I'm not expecting a huge rally to established a new all time high, not in the current state of the world today.",

We have seen events like this multiple times. What is going to happen is that everyone will be hype for the upcoming upgrades and merges. They will all start investing hoping that the price will go up. Some people will FOMO, this will cause the price to be more bullish, once the merge happens, we will see the same trend for few days, and then the hype will drop, things will normalize, correction will take place and the price will drop back to where it should be.",

Another thing which excites us is that the previous upgrades are always being postponed or delayed but I hope that this one if for real now. The month of July is now ending already, so that means that the first phase of the upgrade are now going to start next week or so. Oh yeah, that's nice.Thinks OP, this is the cause of the bull in crypto. That cant be. I don't think anything related to eth or other coins can contribute in the overall market but only bitcoin has the ability to do that. Btc showed an increase first last day, and that was the real one that makes the market a little bullish.",

ETH phase 2.0 will eventually happen and that will be the real key to bitcoins next bull, sure it is ETH run but crypto will be impacted all over and it will be going up a ton.This is why I believe that we shouldn't be really looking to see how it will operate. At the end of the day crypto is crypto and if you doubt its success, then you will not have a part in it and profit from it. I will never doubt it, and I think this will bring in a lot of bull run for sure.",
