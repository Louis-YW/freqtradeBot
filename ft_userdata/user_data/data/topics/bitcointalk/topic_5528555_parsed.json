  "content": "Bitcoin will be completely and entirely regulated and controlled by the government. But I've read that is what most of the people in this bitcoin forum wants so that is good news for you.In EU you can't make a transaction without KYC because of new MICA law. It doesn't matter if it's decentralized transaction. I mean sure you technically can do it without KYC but then it will be an illegal transaction and you will be caught and fined or put in prison depending on the amount that was transferred. It will be easy to catch you because bitcoin has no privacy. I could go more into how bitcoin doesn't really have any privacy but that is covered in other topics.The only way to have privacy is if you put your bitcoin into a centralized exchange or into a bank which allows bitcoin. But this isn't actually privacy because then all the banks in the world will know and the centralized exchange will know. If you use coinjoin and tor and full node combination and coin control and don't make any mistake, you will become a criminal because regulation requires all transaction to be KYC. Regulations keep getting worse and worse all the time and will keep on becoming even more bad. If someone accepts your bitcoin payment without doing kyc on you then both of you become criminals, so no one will accept your bitcoin without KYC. You can't have privacy it is illegal. You can only have privacy if you put all bitcoin in a bank to custody it for you.But 99% of bitcoiners don't want privacy so this is great news. More regulations, less privacy is the way to go!Another reason bitcoin will be back end for CBDC is when you make a payment you don't actually send bitcoin. The payment services which \"let you buy with bitcoin\" don't actually send bitcoin to the store. The bitcoin becomes exchanged automatically by the service to fiat and then fiat is sent to the receiver. You are not paying with bitcoin is the point. Bitcoin is only used in the back end.All the bitcoin influencers are shilling about bitcoin lending is the future. We should put all our bitcoin in a bank for lending our bitcoin bla bla.I could go on but I think I prove my point already that bitcoin will just be the back end for cbdc. We will type in our custodial wallet apps to send x amount of $ to Bob Fisher. You don't even need to know their wallet address, just the name is enough. Then in the back end it swaps btc to fiat/cbdc and then transfers to other person. 99% of people won't even know what bitcoin is. They will just think it was some old bubble that happened in the history.This future of bitcoin becoming the back end for cbdc is a certainty for bitcoin unless we can change the direction of becoming regulated and centralized without any privacy but that doesn't seem to be happening that's why I say it's a certainty.",

I really don't know how did you say about that, and could you please share where you got this information please.Bitcoin will not be the back end for CBDCs, because Bitcoin, CBDCs, and fiat currencies are different, they are competing with each other in usage of citizens in a same nation and society. They won't kill each other, but will co exist with time and make lives of citizens more diversifying in their choices, and increase comfortableness.",

Using bitcoin in an anonymous way is the best.Bitcoin cannot be controlled by anyone even by the government because the network is run by many individual nodes.",

Like you said, let's not make this about privacy (even if I feel that your view is biased) On Bitcoin been the back end for CBDC? Try and change the protocol and make it Centralized. Yes we are entering or in the era of strict regulations pertaining to Bitcoin But this is going to stay true if all countries come together to make Bitcoin usage without KYC illegal and strictly punishable.

To be honest, even in EU I don't think we will see that tomorrow. Maybe in several years, if they don't stop to crack down on cryptos but not tomorrow. AFAIK P2P trading is still allowed for selling his cryptos against fiat currencies and we can still find platforms selling gift cards against cryptos without asking KYC, at the market price. In addition you can easily travel with all your cryptos without even having to declare them to customs, so as long as there are countries accepting it for buying goods without KYC procedures, people will be able to quietly spend it somewhere in the world.",
