The ones, that are buying right now are the hardcore Bitcoin HODLers (if they have some money in their savings accounts). We live in difficult times and not many HODLers will have enough money to buy more BTC and pump the price. I don't see any big institutional investors buying BTC anytime soon. They will follow the trend, just like the day traders and the ordinary Bitcoiners.",

How can you be so sure? From what we know, that floor could be three stories below the current price.By the way, can you show us that instutions data? Or is it just your intuition?",

It's true that not everyone recognizes the opportunity of buying low, and that people are excited and more alert about Bitcoin when the price is high, often making a risky decision of buying at that point. But people make different decisions.It's true that the price can go lower, but IMO $30k is indeed a good chance to buy and hodl long-term. Eventually, I believe the price will get to the new ATH, so making a 3x profit is quite realistic and not bad.",

This ratio is also visible when you see how for every whale there are thousands of weak hands waiting for an excuse to panic sell.Which would effectively achieve nothing. I know users here aren't going to like it, but you kind of need people to be poor to be considered rich, and you need people to make bad decisions for you to make better decisions. Otherwise, you're all the same, and no one gains or loses anything. I know that sounds pretty morbid, but that's the world we live in. Ideally, there would be a better solution out there, but that's what capitalism sort of promotes. What the majority of users here are trying to do is escape that pressure to participate in the cut throat nature of capitalist business. Socialist's communities are usually a little bit more balanced, but I won't go into that as I'll be labelled as communist .",

I understand that Bitcoin is not going anywhere soon so whether you were unfortunate to buy around $60k+ or now you can make a profit as long as you HODL but I do understand why some people will want the market to go lower, of cause maximize profit from the same amount of investment.",
