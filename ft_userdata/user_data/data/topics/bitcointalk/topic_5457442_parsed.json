Now scammer are inventing new tricks day by day.Now a days I saw some scam tricks from many users which is suspicious. Few days ago someone posted about donation where he said that he had been scammed worth 2000$ and now he was asking for donations with forum members where he didn't mention how he lost it or which website scammed him. I think this is also a trick to scam funds. So day by day new ways of scamming will appear and we all have to prevent them strongly. This was his speech:Quote from: pmemorex on June 21, 2023, 09:08:19 PMHello friends i invest my last money 2000$ in crypto but get scam by some website cant withdraw money it say error.

You'd think so, right?  It's not like it's 2012 anymore, when an idiot like this might have gotten someone to send him some bitcoin, though I wasn't here then.  This guy is basically a typical scammer, the likes of which this forum has seen probably hundreds of times.  What makes this case kinda-sorta scary to me is that AI was apparently used to write that text in English, which I assume the scammer wouldn't have been able to do on his own.  I read that stuff that Copylinks flagged as written with AI at 94.8% confidence, and it's astounding to me how close it reads to basic public-relations-speak, if you know what I mean, e.g., a form letter from a corporation in which a lot of fluff is there but nothing of substance.If a non-English speaker can get a program to generate something like that, this forum is fucked unless there are some volunteers who put suspicious posts through an AI-checking tool like Copylinks--but that'd take so much time and manpower that it's putting me into a very foul mood just contemplating it.  Props to OP here for bringing this scammer to the community's attention, but I think we've got a much bigger threat on our hands than him.",

I hadn't done deep research whether he used AI for creating the post or not, but his post was totally shady in my eyes and that's why I replied in his thread. Here is my reply from his thread:Quote from: SamReomo on June 24, 2023, 01:26:33 PMQuote from: Malibitc on June 24, 2023, 01:13:02 PMJoin the Bitcoin Lottery Program today and seize your chance to win $10,000! Good luck to all participants, and may fortune smile upon you on the first day of August 2023!I can smell the aroma of a scam, and that's why I warn all members of the forum to be aware of such type of scams. The OP is asking to submit Bitcoin to his/her account so that he/she will select a participant who will get $10,000 for the entry. It's just an old school type of Ponzi scheme where a lottery program asks users to send money first so then they could add them as participant of the program, and later on they can run away with the money of the users. In such type of schemes, the innocent users won't get anything because the creator will run away with all of the money. There is nothing fair in such kind of program, everything is already planned, and the innocent users can lose a lot of money by participating in such programs. I'm again warning all members of the forum to not send any bitcoin to the address that OP mentioned. I also found that the OP was trying to scam the users with that old school type of Ponzi scheme. Shame on such people who take advantage of the innocent members, I don't know why but those scammers are trying their best to find new ways to scam the members of this forum. I have seen many such scammers, and most of those are newbies. The user also managed to reply with a message, and I think he used AI once again for the reply. Here is the part of that reply:Quote from: Malibitc on June 24, 2023, 02:22:55 PMDear Samreomo,I understand that you have expressed concerns about our lottery program in the forum, accusing it of being fraudulent. I would like to assure you that our lottery program is secure and legitimate, and I would like to address your concerns in detail.He wasn't aware that this type of scam doesn't work in our forum. However, he tried his best to prove that he was running a legit lottery program. Shame on you Malibitc for trying to scam innocent users.",

People, especially bitcointalk members aren't that stupid. A newbie member with no reputation asking for donations is unlikely to get any support, whatever he cause is. Besides, some reputable and well established members are having troubles finding members willing to participate in their loteries (some of which are for free), so what about a newbie trying to get in this business!",

This attempt is really the dumbest I have ever come across, like who's going to fall for that in this Forum that everyone is busy trying to get recognized in a positive way or trying to learn one or two things to expand their trading skills, nah, I don't see members of this Forum as those that would buy such weak story.

He definitely will change his scamming account but a bit too late since he used the same account to attempt a scam, definitely will make an attempt and hopefully use the same address to get caught again. I feel bad for people that's really sincere in asking for monetary aid to help someone who is ill, they almost always get clumped together with the scammers. It's a good thing that no one became a victim of this stupid mofo and I am happy that more people become aware of this type of scams and not falling victim to it, this person will never change no matter what probably because they've tasted the fruits of scamming before and they want more.",

Well, I agree with your statement that most of the members of the forum are pretty intelligent and they won't fall into such traps, but there are many newbie members who are still not that much intelligent and they can fall into such traps. The scammers mostly try to target those members who aren't aware of such scams and those scammers mainly try their best to prove that they aren't doing any kind of fraudulent activity, but are letting the participants win money in the most transparent way. If a service or an individual isn't doing anything wrong then they can show their transparency without any issue, but such scammer only know that how to use words to play with the emotions of the humans. I'm not sure about other scammers but this particular scammer came out with the dumbest scheme to scam the members of this forum. He didn't expected that he will get caught within minutes. I think he is trying to learn the skill of scamming. and that's why he did that otherwise professional scammers would never do something like this. I'm pretty sure that other scammers might be laughing at the guy after reading this comment because the guy reduced the reputation of those scammers.",
