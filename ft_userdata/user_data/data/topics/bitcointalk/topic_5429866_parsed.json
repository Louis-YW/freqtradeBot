Thank you in advance for your helpful responses.I've been in BTC since 2014 and can relate entirely. At first, I checked the price constantly, to the point where it was un-healthy.Over time, I realized it's not what matters in real life at any given moment. Take time to smell the flowers as they say, enjoy life, and don't obsess.Anyhow, .... This will pass - you will tire of checking it and it hardly moves... Good luck, and don't feel alone haha... You will understand what I mean eventually about what I said about minutes of our lives - they are precious, enjoy them and don't waste too much checking price. Not worth it!  Cheers!",

If you invest with most of your money or you're need in hurry, you're better off to sell your coins until you have some cash to buy a foods, pay bills, and for emergency funds. You don't need to spend a lot money if you can't accept the risk, just invest in small amount until you get a better job that will make you earn more money.",

Â What will not be normal however is if after you have become conversant with the bitcoin environment for a long time, you are still addicted to constantly checking your wallet to see your balance.Always wanting to check your balance is the fastest way to keep an unsettled mind towards your investment in cryptocurrency, you should try to learn to slowly limit checking your balance everytime so it doesn't begin to affect the decision you have made to hodl bitcoin for a long time.",

Thank you in advance for your helpful responses.The Anxiety is real mate, although you might have read few things about bitcoin or heard some of its good things from people, a new investor like you will still be nervous and check everytime to clear the doubt of whether you made the right choice to invest in it. Its normal considering we are even in a bearish period. Do not anticipate any bad things because with bitcoin yours funds won't lose value (if truly you invested them in bitcoin). But if feel too scared about losing then my advice is take money off it and invest that which is worth losing for you to clear off your doubts. Then go do more research about bitcoin and I am sure you will come back comfortably.But overall it isn't a bad thing to check everyday but the intention of seeing it rise or drop on every check drives off one's serenity",

You checking your wallet frequently is normal as a newbie, I know you won't want your money to dump so you will be monitoring it always. Just always have it in mind that you are investing for long term so even if price increases you are not going to sell or just always get yourself busy am sure you will reduce the way you check your wallet.",

Thank you in advance for your helpful responses.That feeling is normal, bruv because as a new investor you do everything Â humanly possible to get a bigger profitÂ its not your fault that you check it every 5secs per day, the things is you don't want to lose since the price is not stagnant. It happened to me at first when I was supposed to get a higher profit but I withheld from doing so. Truthfully, constantly monitoring your wallet would get you scared to the point of removing it. Since the price of BTC is volatile, it's best to take it as it comes. Â Â It's best to also invest in an amount that you can easily do without and that way it would save you a lot of stress.",

But thats due to the habit weve acquired in the long run and being used to it. Thats not bad at all, but having an urge not to check on it is a very hard challenge cause we always wanted to know what are the status of our money if its falling or gaining.",

Speaking from my own experience, turning point for me 2018 when I decided to deinstall all price tracking apps from my mobile phone and remove similar websites from my bookmarks as I was getting obsessed with it.Â  Thing is, I realized that there was no point in checking prices on the daily basis because I was not a trader but hodler, so why waste my time on that since i won't do anything about it, no matter price going up or down.

On the contrary, lots of people canât get their eyes of their wallets and I think a lot of people do check their wallets periodically for want to know the current price of their investments. As a new bitcoin holder, I think itâs understandable that you would check your wallet numerous times daily. You stated that you intend on holding bitcoin for the long run and thatâs why youâre accumulating bitcoin monthly and storing in your decentralized wallet. As a new bitcoin holder, Itâs great to see youâre saving your funds off exchanges. As an intending long term holder, you should learn to put aside the habit of regularly checking your wallet. As you intend holding bitcoin for the long run, the present price of bitcoin shouldnât be an immediate concern to you. You would only kill yourself with worry and perhaps doubts by regularly checking your wallet. Donât beat yourself about it and take it slow and easy. Youâll be fine.",

But later on, as I gain more experience and have seen my first bitcoin cycle (bearish/bullish), I was not that conscious anymore. Probably 2-3x a day is good enough to check the price and what your wallet looks like.Don't you worry, as you mature in this market, your concern is how to increased your bitcoin or any other altcoin, not what the price of the market is or what is the equivalent of the crypto that you have relative to fiat.",

This I haven't done in some months now after the Luna first crash which I went to verify if I invested in that project so I can get rid of it before further casualties. What you're experience isn't odds as many investors suffer same fate. Infact many of us had similar experience when we first started investing in the space, I think with time you'll know to handle it but you can try to program yourself not to get obsessed with price volatility by remembering, in future things will always be green and program your mindset for long term price goals (not short term).You can try deleting any of the apps that has to do with price update on the market and your wallets as well. Keep your private key and other vital information needed to access your wallet in safe location before deleting the apps and stay of crypto news. We're in a bear market so the price will always be negative until we go pass this stage, keep that in mind and look for other activities to keep you occupied while we wait for this season to end.",

Make it harder to access your wallet:Â  hide the passwords, remove the wallet app. Focus on other tasks, make time for your hobbies or other activities that are interesting and exciting for you.
