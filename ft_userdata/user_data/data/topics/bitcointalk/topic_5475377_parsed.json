  "content": "Blast, a layer-2 solution on Ethereum, was recently officially launched and confirmed to have attracted $20m in investment capital from Paradigm,... In this funding round, many famous individuals in the cryptocurrency community on the social network X Twitter also participated. Detail: https://twitter.com/Blast_L2/status/1726747115018481798After research, I know Blast has a few points:- The economic model and the airdrop model are separate, so they should not be considered a form of ponzi that some projects are still doing to attract users.- Depositing ETH and stablecoin to get staking interest. Profits are distributed back to depositors at an interest rate of 4 -5%- Airdrop is something that is attracting attention, because most L2 allow users to use the experience early and to be able to reach real users. Similar to many active L2, Blast is also worth our time looking for airdrop opportunities._______________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________News update...- Blast has reached $230m in TVL within 48 hours. https://twitter.com/Blast_L2/status/1727475453869301854- Blast has reached $443 Million in TVL within 4 days. https://twitter.com/Blast_L2/status/1728188031876886764...",

It's around 800 millions combined with blur being staked to get blast. The hype is real someone has deposited 15k ethereum into the blast https://x.com/0xscopescan/status/1728354863892029845that's crazy how someone is willing to risking his money. It seems like that the impact from pacman blur was real. No doubt that people have been learning a lot from optimism.

I hope that will be big like at least 25%.",

Really, L2 is something that is being forced to push quickly, perhaps everyone is eager to enter a real bullish phase with bitcoin and crypto. Although the ongoing activities don't show much, I think the project advisor and developers will know how to make this project familiar to more people. I don't expect much because of the meme show after seeing the increase in TVL, but I think it will be available to everyone soon, maybe Q1 Q2 2024.",

I think this is best way to attract Youtubers, Twittter, Facebook and Telegram Influencers. Everyone is advertising freely this project and sharing own refer link because there is no way to register if we doesn't entry refer code.. I get code hardly after asking many times.. First five code that I get was already used by other members.. When I staked Ethereum I got zero points and get some invite code.. Our team have to complete 5 Ethereum bridge and then we will be able to get points. I am still learning the concept and will share if I get some new update",

Also, all this hefty amounts of ether staked, makes it come under limelight of hackers.  Most of the dex targeted by hackers when they see any door with weak security. Blast is new project and got attention of the investors in very short time. In their latest quote posted 22 hours ago that they reached the milestone of 570 million. This is great number and record volume recieved in time of one week. Security will play main role in this project. If Blast team failed and faced hacking attack in early days then it will be big damage to this project because it will be very difficult to motivate investors after they lost interest. Team is also aware of it and 3 days ago they share full detail information about security. They are working on Multisig wallet.Quote For Blast, each signer has exactly those properties. They are deeply technical engineers who have experience with high stakes applications ranging from financial applications to smart contracts.It's possible to improve security one step further. To ensure more resilience to black swan events, in 1 week we'll update one of the multisig addresses to switch the underlying hardware wallet provider.This will ensure that no single hardware wallet type is used 3 of 5 times, maintaining safety even in an unprecedented hardware wallet compromise scenario.Multisigs can be highly effective if used properly. This is why L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and now Blast use a multisig model. Full Detail",

It's largely based off of rumors. Since airdrops is a thing, it isn't surprising to see users flock Blast with their liquidity as it's a common narrative for liquidity to follow the newest shiny thing on the market. But I'd applaud the Blast protocol team for the idea of native yield on chain. This is not something that has been done by any other L2 network and we have had dozens of L2 networks all of which are just peddling off one another.",
