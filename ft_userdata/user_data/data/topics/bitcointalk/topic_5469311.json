Previously Michael Saylor predicted Bitcoin would reach a price of $5 million https://twitter.com/bitcoinlfgo/status/1700981076389413281This time Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes also explained his predictionHe even said Bitcoin in 2026 will reach a value of $750,000 to $1 million, this is a fantastic figure, considering that currently, Bitcoin is still at a price of $27k-$28k.The main reason is because he anticipates a financial crisis that could cause interest rates to drop to zero, or a scenario where interest rates increase, but not as fast as the level of government spending. In such a situation, Hayes argues that Bitcoin could be worth around $70,000 by the end of 2024, partly driven by a crypto-halving event.He also foresees the launch of various exchange-traded funds by major asset managers in the US, Europe, and possibly Hong Kong. Hayes explains, \"That's when the real bull market starts.\"Is this a sign of the rise of Bitcoin? so many predict Bitcoin to reach a fantastic price in the next few years.

At that time there were so many positive rumors supporting his speculation as Blackrock's spot EFT application and other initial adoption indications. In short, his speculation got weightage at that time due to positive market sentiments. But I think even 150 + days are gone and there's nothing like that even hinting at the market.At that time market was looking favorable and now in the current timeline, there are a lot of challenges we can consider but it will require a lot of developments back to back to boost market price to this level.",

I mean, just because market influencers make predictions doesn't mean things will work out as they say. They, like us, are bitcoin investors and they hold even more bitcoin than we do, so I would be more cautious when they try to exaggerate the price for bitcoin. Don't forget that their goal is no different from ours, which is profit, so always be skeptical of what they say. The fact that they are bullish about bitcoin is a good thing because it will attract more people to know and participate in bitcoin but everything has its motive and purpose, so be careful.Furthermore, whether these celebrities make predictions about bitcoin or not, bitcoin will still increase in price because it is cyclical and the demand for bitcoin is increasing. Bitcoin price increase is inevitable.",

The current price of $100k-$150k is still quite realistic for the upcoming ATH, retail investors still have the opportunity to buy at a low price before it hits $100k and above.  Quote from: Ayers on October 05, 2023, 03:05:08 PM-snip-Furthermore, whether these celebrities make predictions about bitcoin or not, bitcoin will still increase in price because it is cyclical and the demand for bitcoin is increasing. Bitcoin price increase is inevitable.Those who have many followers, are famous, and have great power on social media can only influence through speculation. As there are many positive speculations being discussed, of course, this is also a good opportunity to start buying Bitcoin. The ups and downs of Bitcoin prices cannot be avoided because indeed bitcoin price fluctuations run quickly. But stay alert to the various manipulatives that will occur later.Don't try to fight the direction without any strength.",

Famous people who make predictions must base their predictions on logical reasons. Everything has a stage and a path to go through. Maybe this price will be realized in the coming years, but for me it is more important through which stages it will reach this price.Will Bitcoin be available worldwide? Will states legally accept Bitcoin? I think these phases are more important than the Bitcoin price.",

I do, however what no one knows is when such crisis will finally get to happen, and while such crises seem to appear out of nowhere, at the same time the economy has resisted despite the huge difficulties we went through the pandemic, so I am not so sure that such a collapse of the economy could appear so soon.",

That's probably one of my considerations about hitting $1m in the next 3 years, but right now that's too bullish to say.",

I don't know - I don't think it's unusual for it to hit $5M, but I'm sure it won't be hit without major support like the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs and the halving.I agree that $1 million and $5 million is not an impossible price for bitcoin in the future - but I believe that bitcoin will need major support to reach that price. But I wonder if anyone would still have the guts to buy $5M worth of bitcoin that times and their hold for long term - maybe Saylor?",

How much more into that previous ATH that it does have which is $69k. Lets talk about $100k first before speaking about +100k increments overtime. Well, everything could really happen considering that there are still tons of various source of money could flow to crypto. It is really just that there's no way that it could really be known or predicted on when it would really be that going down the stream.$100k is already a struggle is should say but well we are still on pre-halving season or time on which there's still lots of room for the price to rise up.It is really just that recommended or right on investors or traders perspective that we should really be having that realistic approach at least so that we arent that anticipating that much about into those numbers been mentioned. Lastly, it seems like those fellashad already filled up their bags and now trying out to make some bullish sentiment and just trying to drive the market up.",
