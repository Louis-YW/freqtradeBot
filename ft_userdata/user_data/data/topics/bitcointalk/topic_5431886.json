Also, there have already been many discussions about the possible improvement of this service.It will be fine to write where you pull the values from, and which API you use for display. for more precision, it is better to use two or more. Sometimes there are differences and only one exchange (source) is not enough.Your site seems clean and fast, which is very essential. maybe I would slightly enlarge these two fields with currencies, and also night mode is always desirable.the choice of the domain itself is not the best. .info extension with a hyphen between two words offers very little authority.",

      "body": "I see that your website is very useful for those who want to convert crypto prices and don't want the hassle of accessing platforms like coingecko or cmc. But just as a suggestion it would be great if you could add some of these features:1. Multiple input for those who want to convert several cryptos at one time.2. Real-time crypto price list taken from various sources.3. More attractive domains; Instead of using .info, .com looks more interesting and your domain name should be more unique.4. More attractive themes; You can find lots of flat + modern themes online or you can go with changelly.com themeshope that you can add 1 or 2 of the above features to your website",

Also, there have already been many discussions about the possible improvement of this service.SNIPPreev does not contain major cryptocurrencies which OP's site does. I'd support the project and hope to see regular updates on prices. However, I can see that after testing for just one crypto (ETH) there, it showed me a round figure of 1 BTC = 13.86 ETH but on Binance, it's around 13.8496So, if possible OP, please keep it totally near to what it shows on the exchange as this will bring a lot of traffic on your website.",

It makes me nauseous looking at it.The page seems quite empty and gloomy with only four boxes in the middle and nothing else to cast your eyes on.Try to get some more content on the landing page. Maybe a few links to some bitcoin-related resources, an 'About' page, privacy policy, and that sort of thing.The prices don't get updated in real-time or after a refresh. How much time needs to pass for the values to change?",

      "body": "The add favorite feature is quite difficult to use unless the user spends some time doing trial and error. I think adding a separate page would be better, or making it more user-friendly with additional UI after they click the plus/minus sign. Something like clicking + -> New pair -> save. It's probably unclear just by text but I hope OP can get what I'm trying to say here. I also don't know what the 'Edit' at the bottom left does so you can also work on that. Also, consider adding a dark theme as mentioned above. I use dark reader/dark them on all of my web browsers and your site looks good with a dark theme. It's definitely too simplistic though, but if your goal is just to provide a quick crypto calculator then it is enough. IMO, at the moment, the current UI and UX feel like it is a custom website for personal usage instead of public use.",
