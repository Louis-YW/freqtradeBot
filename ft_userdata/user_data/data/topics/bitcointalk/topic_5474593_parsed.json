Knowing when to sell an Altcoin is the main deal. One of the challenges with the Altcoin ecosystem is that there is this constant creation of new cryptocurrencies and it makes it more difficult for people to know which is more reliable or let‚Äôs say ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. There are alts that have and will make it over the years but as time passes many will be shaken off back into the dust. Bitcoin on the other hand is just one and hence its uniqueness. It‚Äôs less likely to fail you unlike these alts.",

You may be right that many crypto have different situations where some are still high compared to previous price meanwhile BTC for example is decreasing because the price may be manipulated where you can see that it didn't follow the route that BTC take. Well, Bitcoin is still number 1 even though you might see where some altcoins price didn't follow the changes of price in BTC.",

Comparing new altcoins in the market that had not lasted upto to 10 years in the crypto market does not worth it. Bitcoin had been in existence for a very long time and even with the current height in network fee does not mean that they can be compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin has much bigger influence in the market than many altcoins that had been mentioned here so we don't have to compare them at all. Bitcoin still have bigger role to pay in the market when the bull market comes.",

That's your own views about altcoins, and I respect that. But if you are going to ask me, none of those coins would beat the potentials of bitcoin. Although its undeniable that some altcoins are still worth of our money and time, but it takes a lot of research and understanding these coins so you won't fall investing into shitcoins. Few have the potentials to succeed, but majority would certainly end as dead coins.However, if you know to timing the market when you hold altcoins, you will still have the chances to make profits. Altcoins are good for short term investments, so you need to sell them before their prices dump and end up zero value. Unlike bitcoin, as long as you hold it patiently, you will gain secure profits in time even if you buy low and sell high.",

On the other hand Bitcoin isn't manipulatable by its creator or someone else so in that simple sense Bitcoin is unique. I'm not a big fan of altcoins but sometimes I use to trade with those altcoins when I see some profitable moves as a trader but most of those altcoins are totally useless and someone who delves into altcoins without proper research or luck may lose a lot of money.There are some good projects in the altcoins world but still those are risky as compare to Bitcoin, and I believe if someone wants to go with the route of altcoins then that user has to choose only few reputed altcoins that have been known to perform well for many years. New altcoins aren't good at all and investing in those coins is just like gambling, so it's always better to go with old and known altcoins instead of going with new altcoins.",

Altcoins have the opportunity to attract new people in the crypto space because of their too good to be true offers that made this people to jump investing without doing initial research on the altcoins they are going to risk their money. Just like you OP, you are currently blinded with these altcoins because of their promising profits in the future. But if you have been investing in the crypto market for long, you will know that altcoins are just the scammers tool to scam the people, bitcoin is the only genuine investment in the market.I'm not saying in general that altcoins are not worthy to invest as there are few altcoins who are highly established in the market and are certainly hard to break them. But still, they won't serve any guarantee that altcoins are better than bitcoin. Bitcoin is the lifeblood in the crypto market, that reason alone should be your eye opener not to fall on the trap of altcoins.",

There are lots who multiply it's price in just a couple of months. You have to do a screening since not all alts are good to invest. Avoid to good to be true projects or the projects that has the very low marketcap, it's so volatile and don't have enough strong support where if whales going sell their assets, it dumps so much.

Beside that, Bitcoin tends to keep its value against any market uncertainties and offering a more stable investment compared to altcoins on bad market days. While we also aware about the potential of altcoins for short term gains, I see them as more of a hit and run opportunity but too risky for holding so much.The only time I decide selling part of my Bitcoin is when I need funds. In such cases I trade Bitcoin for stable coins like USDT known for their stability and safety compared to other centralized stable coins. Occasionally, I go for Litecoin especially for casino transactions due to lower fees compared to Bitcoin. So we really can't say that altcoins are worthless.I also want to say that countries like El Salvador have announced Bitcoin as their main currency, indicating that Bitcoin is more secure and holds significant value more than any altcoin and also the thing that reinforce our belief in it.",

Now, around 215 dollars each, the price of what it raised is very high.Then what I see that TAO can raise is from 1000$ each to 8000$ each.
