You can trust them to do that job because that's what they were designed for. How are you going to store your fiat there? Your fiat is supposed to be in your bank account and not on centralized crypto exchanges like Binance or any other. I trust my hardware wallet for my bitcoin and certain alts.

      "body": "Earlier, before the FTX incident happened, \"not your key, not your coin\" became a great concern and a reminder to all. I trusted Binance more than my local Nigerian bank. The reason is that I am allowed to hold my crypto in Binance how ever I want it and when ever I want with just little charges that are almost not noticeable, and I only make a withdrawal to my local bank account whenever I need to use cash, and I select which of my banks don't have network issues at that time (that's from online payment to ATM withdrawal), then I will fund the account directly using my Binance. To cut the whole story short, I don't trust both Binance and my local banks; I prefer holding my money on a decentralized system instead of any of these two. Unless I am left with no other option than to just choose between these two, I can go with my local bank account over Binance since I can go straight to the respective bank office and report any behavior I notice that is off the book.",

Exchanges can be hacked, but thievery in banks in my country do not have effect to the extent banks will not be able to pay their customers. They are both centralized but I trust bank the most. No bank in my country has a case of not able to pay customers money because of bankruptcy, there is chance it can happen, but very low probability.But my final opinion is that I neither trust bank nor exchanges, they are both centralized. If you read about the cashless policy in my country and the CBN hell mentality of the new naira notes, because of that, you can not trust banks. There are several cases that central banks will make a country a hell for citizens. But with bitcoin on your noncustodial wallet, you have the full control of your money.",

If I had to choose, I would choose both for my use, because I still need a bank to store my fiat before I can use it for things that are important to me. But on the other hand I also need to use the Binance exchange for trading and store my crypto assets for a while before I withdraw them to my personal wallet.

Maybe you can see the building where your bank is, but you can't see your money because it's not there. You see the digits next to your name. Your money is lent out as credit to other people. In case of a bank run, your bank, my bank, and almost all others would be in big problems.

But at the same time, banks have been around for a lot longer and are generally seen as more stable and reliable. While Binance and other crypto services may have their own security measures in place, there's no denying that traditional banks have a long-standing reputation for keeping your funds safe. For one, banks are usually insured by the government, which means that even if the bank were to go bankrupt, your deposits would still be protected up to a certain amount. Additionally, banks have sophisticated security protocols in place to prevent fraud and cyber attacks, and they're heavily regulated by various governing bodies to ensure that they're following best practices.Of course, that's not to say that there's no risk involved with using a bank. Financial institutions can still be vulnerable to things like identity theft or data breaches. This is why many crypto holders prefer self-custody and cold storage solutions, like hardware wallets, to mitigate these risks.",

I don't fully trust either banks or Binance (or any other exchange) and would stop using their services at the first opportunity. But with a caveat. If we are talking about those amounts that I would be sorry to lose. I allow keeping money in banks and in Binance if it is a small amount and for the purpose of diversification. For example, the reason for keeping in a bank or Binance may be the insecurity of local storage, a trip to other countries, that is, in cases where there is a direct benefit from their service. Again, you need to consider the period of storage they have. Of course, the risks increase in the long run. The longer, the more likely your money will not be returned. Due to various reasons.If there are advantages to keeping money in a bank or in Binance, then I would use it. If not, then I wouldn't even come close to them.",

That's correct to a certain extent. The money you hold in your bank account is insured, but there is an upper limit to this insurance. The numbers differ from country to country. But let's say that limit is set at $100.000. If something happens with your $50.000 bank deposit, the insurance kicks in and replaces the full sum you lost. That's not the case if you had $200.000 in your account. In that case, the insurance only covers half of it. Quote from: dataexpertusa on March 11, 2023, 11:34:20 AMIt's important to note that Binance exchange is a centralized exchange, which means that it holds control of your funds. If the exchange were to be hacked, your funds could potentially be lost. Binance has suffered hacks in the past and they paid back the damages to their customers. Still, that can all be part of a PR campaign. They evaluated that it's more worth it to lose a bit of money now but keep the customers happy, rather than not do it and suffer an outflow of unsatisfied clients. They earn millions on trading and withdrawal fees anyways. If Binance went through a Mt. Gox type of scenario, I doubt customers would ever see their money.",

I guess it also depends on where you live and how strict your government is regarding banks' security. At the very least, most public banks (the majority of the shares are held by the government) have the ability to get funding support just in case something went south, CMIIW. Personally, I don't trust anyone, but it is not practical to hoard fiat in my house either. Luckily I can store crypto just fine with proper setup. I think most experienced crypto users in my country would do the same thing unless they are day trading.
