You didn't look into FTX before you write out the cons of centralization.I don't understand what you mean by throughput, what is exactly is centralized maximizing in a centralized system except for database and optimizations which comes with at the expense of KYC, you can't use their service if you are not verified, is there anything special about that? I'm even trying to picture one good advantage of centralization but the thought of centralized exchanges will not make me see much benefits but demerits of using them. Centralizations always put their ambition before the people.QuoteDecentralization:Pros: Censorship resistance, enhanced security through distribution, inheriting the initial spirit of Bitcoin and the idea of autonomy.Cons: Potentially reduced scalability, decision-making difficulties, possibility of fragmentation and disparities.It's clear both come with their merits and demerits.

I believe it's vital to discuss these matters to guide the future of blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies in the right direction.Let's have a fruitful discussion!Without decentralization, centralization will die quickly but decentralization will remain functional until it last breath of the people that protects it's ecosystem, the reason why we have centralization today is because of decentralization, Dex can survive with Cex but if table were to turn around, the latter will not make it. So Dex win and I don't think decentralization are even forcing balance, no need for that unless cex's are trying hard.",

It’s not directly centralization towards the decentralized token but rather through the user holding it or purchase through exchange because it removes privacy of owning that particular token since it can be tracked through the use of blockchain record from exchange.",

I believe it's vital to discuss these matters to guide the future of blockchain tech and cryptocurrencies in the right direction.Let's have a fruitful discussion!In my opinion, the status quo systems in crypto are good enough for now until we can find more better ideas that would improve decentralization or take us closer to full decentralization of all of the system components of any of the blockchain networks available right now. From network infrastructures to applications (Smart contracts) built on these networks. Initially, I used to think that Decentralization is easy but then, the demerits like delayed consensus and issues with scalability makes it harder to achieve this. This is why the Blockchain Trilemma is still an unsolved case till date.A bit of centralization to protect core system resources plus decentralization of other network operations is viable for now. I'm on the lookout for new ideas that might improve decentralization without tradeoffs in security and scalability.",

In the past, if it's about hacking incidents, both of these platforms have been targeted by hackers.And that means that there's no safe one on this one because hackers are targeting those areas that has money but it is that many of decentralized platforms or exchanges have a weaker security.",

Quote from: coin-score.ai on October 08, 2023, 12:49:47 PMAre there situations where centralization could be beneficial? Can there be a balance?I hardly think there are any significant advantages. But I believe it solely depends on the context, within some settings a degree of centralisation is required, and rather a necessity. So there couldn't be an exact balance between centralization and decentralization, one thing to note is that, currently, many cryptocurrency projects sacrifice some degree of decentralisation and yet still claim they are decentralized, this is what I think is rather wrong.After all, cryptocurrency is a brand new thing, so we shall see how it develops and gains maturity to see how the space will evolve.",

It's kinda annoying because there's no perfect at all.But with Bitcoin is being decentralized, it's a good thing I can see because it solve most of the problem that we have on centralized entities.",

Centralized exchanges are equivalent to express trades.  Excellent for circumstances requiring speed and simplicity, high-volume trading, and access to a diverse choice of altcoins. While DEX, they prioritize security and provide you more control over your assets, making them ideal for circumstances requiring safety and sovereignty. They're great for folks who wish to keep their crypto assets safe while still maintaining ownership without relying on a central authority",

So don't say that many people store their funds inside a CEX. No matter how strong their security are, it can still be hacked unexpectedly by a skilled hacker. DEX on the other hand can work differently.I think there is no way to store our funds on them but we should always disconnect our wallet right after we trade just to be safe. It's also a good idea to use a separate wallet only for this purpose. Like you I also prefer CEX. I can only trade on DEX if the coin that I got from the airdrops and bounties are listed on it.",
