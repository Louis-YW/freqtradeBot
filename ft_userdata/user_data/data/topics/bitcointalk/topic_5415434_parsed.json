  "content": "TAKE THESE FIVE REASONS SERIOUS AND IMPLEMENT Tenaciously and you would be so shocked on how fast your life would change.Let’s move………….1.Laziness/Comfort Zone/Procrastination:This is the first reason a lot of people are poor. This reason is not a new thing actually It is a straightforward reason. WHY?A lot of people today do take this reason as been minor but if you actually understand this well enough you would definitely stand out among the crowd.2.Short Term Intensity;One of the reason the poor people would remain poor is short term Intensity instead of long-term consistency. HOW DO I MEAN?A lot of people today are poor and would remain poor because of this. Short term intensity gives you instant or even no gratification but long-term consistency gives you continuous gratification.A lot of people today only channel their energy to making money when they are broke and once,they make few million, they channel their energy to other things less productive that would constantly take away money from their bank accounts and would return them to back to being broke. 3.The Scam Mentality:One common mentality all poor people have that would allow them to remain poor is the SCAM MENTALITY.Of course, I am not disputing the fact that there are a lot of scammers everywhere but in the real sense not everything is a scam. Poor people’s life is usually filled up with obstacles instead of opportunities. Their life is full of can’tinstead of can.Of course, you need to shine your eyes whenever you want to do any transactions but mind you not all things are SCAM.4.Result-Oriented:One factor that keeps the poor people poor is the act of been result-oriented. How do I mean?A lot of people when they hear that a particular person is Rich, instead of asking for the process of making the money, they focus on the results and don’t end up getting any tangible results.To leave the poverty zone, one thing you should note is:follow the process and it would cumulate to give the results.5. Poor Mindset;Poor Mindset is the reason poor people would remain poor. This might sound trivial but your mindset is the key to unlocking wealth and no one but you can change and work on it.The major thing that separates the rich from the poor is the mindset.Poor people have poor mindset while rich people have rich mindset.Work on your mind because no amount of information given to you would work If you have a very poor mindset.Even though you are not rich, have the mentality the rich have and you would definitely become rich with time.",

      "body": "Hey, hope you are having a good day!Well you are right but also wrong on some points.1. Yes. Laziness is one of the main reason why people remain poor. They have many opportunities but instead of working they whine about it. But there are also hard working people who have dedication but can't work due to lack of opportunities and this makes them lose hope. Nowadays educational certificates doesn't mean anything in some countries. \"If you got somebody in the system you'll get the job\"- mostly happens in those countries.2. Yes. Short term intensity is also one of the main reason. But you have to understand that they need to make the ends meet. Like if you gave a poor person $100 dollar bill, they will buy the things they need to live. But Yes there are people who will spend it one gambling, use it to drink alcohol. 3. Scam mentality is actually pretty common nowadays. People invest all their savings to a small business/project and they get scammed then they lose all their hopes. After this they do not want to invest anymore. In a actual business/project there will be ups and downs. You can't lose hope easily. Mostly poor people don't wait until it actually blows. And I have actually seen most people get scammed. But only a few succeeded after investing money on something.4. Well. you are right. But most successful person won't show you the process. People just say do this, keep doing this. Suppose you are rich and you have a poor buddy - In order to remove poverty from your friends life you have to show him the process. Otherwise it might just backfire.5. Agreed.",

      "body": "A lot of poor people don’t have the same opportunities as other people. Even as simple as going to school & getting an education. Impoverished people don’t have the same chances as rich people. There are exceptions put sometimes these people just need a chance.It’s not always as simple as being lazy or whatever. The best thing you can do is work hard, keep free of addictions & you will at least have a chance at making a good life then. There’s a reason why not many people are rich, it’s not easy.",
