Sorry I am still quite new here but I know the rules.If doing a Thread like the one you have created already next time you see on the left side when you creating the thread +Additional Options...Click on it and then you have the option to make your thread self moderated , this means you can moderate your thread by yourself and can delete some kind of messages you dont wont.Just in case you dont know about that option for the future.You can also lock your already open thread and or delete it and make a new one with self moderation on.",

I wanted to say that in response to Lafu's comment on the OP going the way of self moderation. It's a no-no for a noob account.Again, like The Pharmacist suggested; OP needs to tougher up and stay on their lane after reporting the issue to mods and not head over to the offender's thread to start a war. Doing that gives the offender a cynical pleasure that they're getting at OP's emotion.",

If it's still unhandled, then you will have to be patient until the post gets deleted and stop insulting them instead.",

What next after retaliatory spam? Feedbacks? PMs to mods?If your first action to perceived wrong, is to immediately retaliate, then you should not complain about the system as you did not give sufficient time for action to be taken or inquire what caused the delay.",
