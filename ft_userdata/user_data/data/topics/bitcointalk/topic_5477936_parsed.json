Naim makes e no good to invest in altcoin because you might lose your money. This talk goes well with Bitcoin investment.

Taking Bitcoin or everything related to this industry as a journey and on a long-term basis is what makes for why and how we take and experience the outcome of everything that we do as we journey heads,  but above all,  we need all the motivations that we can get and we should and must try as much as possible to stick to the path that can lead to a profitable future as an asset which is bitcoin and try as much as possible to avoid any crypto coin that give us too high profits promises most times these coins are just pump and dump projects,  and should only be considered as a gamble and nothing more to that.",

Some people are facing different financial situations in their lives; even if they invest in Bitcoin, once they are faced with some kind of financial need, they will still end up selling off their coin. First, before some can be patient in holding their coin, they should have a good-paying job and probably some side hustle to support their finances. If they receive a salary, they should endeavor to save up some fiat as emergency funds and only allot the amount of bitcoin that they can actually hold for a long time with any need that will require them to sell off so quickly. By so doing, they are planting a good seed, which will not just be cute off so short when the time is not yet due to reap the good fruit.Some people invest the amount of money that they cannot hold for a long time, and because of that, they also don't get comfortable when they see the price of Bitcoin going down. One step to archiving a successful Bitcoin investment is to acquire proper knowledge about it.",
