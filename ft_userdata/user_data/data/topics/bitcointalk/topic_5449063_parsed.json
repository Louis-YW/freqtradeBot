  "content": "This is my first post here but pardon me if I am so blunt, that is so me. The love I have for BTC made me open this account and I wouldn't consider bank an option if I had my way, it's a cheating business where one's money is under custody of those that can use it as they like without saying Thank You.I'm happy a bitcoin forum like this is available, it will help me pour my mind once in a while and show my appreciation where BTC has helped me.I got to realise that people are just in the dark, the government, politicians and banks are like cult running a scheme they labelled bank. Banking bsuiness is planned on cheating people and they said to believe is the place where money is safely kept and vital to countries economy. I also agree. But can it also explains why they will mismanage funds and the government will quickly come to their aid? They launder money for politicians for both benefits and use an unexplainable scheme to perpetrate their operations.But bitcoin is not like that, it is fair, decentralized, plain and give you control of what you own. I love it.It drives me crazy when it rings in my head that my deposits waste in banks as they give me a little interest after using 90% of my deposit for business. More curiosity is when I thought about Mr A, Mr B and Mr C depositing a total of $250,000 and their account balances are showing Mr A=$75,000, Mr B=$150,000 and Mr C=$25,000 but the bank still loan John Smith company the $225,000 from the deposit of those men even when the three depositors still have acess to their money at any time. The banks will do a mere paper work and create figures in favor of John Smith company. Now, the company has access to the money of Mr A, B and C just as the three men also have access to their money. How do they do this?You keep your money with them, they charge you for maintainance and other unexplainable fees, they loan your money out without your permission and they still charge you high when you withdraw or transfer electronically. It drives me insane.No one can do without bank and fiat due to the way it has been structured with the economy but anywhere bitcoin can work in place of them without putting myself at risk, I will defintely stick to it.-Just pouring out my mind, hope is not too loud?-",

      "body": "If you're familiar with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, it may not make sense to keep a large sum of money in a bank account. Banks are becoming increasingly problematic, and it's frustrating to face numerous questions when attempting to withdraw funds. It's a helpless feeling to have someone else control your finances. Despite the high volatility of cryptocurrencies, people still use banks because it's not easy to transition to a fiat-free ecosystem for Bitcoin users. It will likely take more time for the banking system to adapt to the needs of cryptocurrency users.",

How do they do this?nice one bro, like you definitely nailed it. banks actually works with a fractional reserve system, that means they only keep a fraction of all the money deposited by their customers in the banks and loans out the rest to companies who then returns interest for them.   This is possible because they have  records on how much would be withdrawn by the total number of customers they have using historical data and with this,  we know that not all customer will withdraw at the same time interval.        nevertheless, if this happens, they have access to variety of tools, such as borrowing money for the central banks to quickly raise funds incase of unexpected withdrawals. but definitely, the banking system cannot change and will continue like this even though Bitcoin becomes a legal tender all over the world.",

Bitcoin has now made people take control over their own asset.Some Banks limit average citizens with the amount of withdrawer, while the rich can gain access to massive amount, but with bitcoin coming into the picture, every man can easily and accessibly get their asset.Inclusion, there are still some greedy government that are not ready to make Bitcoin a legal tender asset, but poor citizens will find way to access Bitcoin and make it out of poverty.",

There is a diversion of funds, people who do not return their money, bad investments and a etcetera of problems.The paradox is that knowing all these problems, the majority continue to invest in those places.Big governments use a large part of the collection to inject them so that they do not go bankrupt. Why does a bank go bankrupt? - Because a bank is an example of doing things wrong.At this point I do not limit myself to talking about only banks. I dimension a problem in society: ease, mediocrity.The problem of poverty and misinformation is terrifying, that's why btc is not popular.The banks are shit, the government with its taxes is shit.",

So i think Bitcoin has come to save man from the hands of bad government.",

      "body": "I think it's getting clearer the more we advance in technology, basically in a digitalized economy. I myself have always seen bank as the major fraudster (threat) who keeps enriching themselves with our hard earned money and give us peanut as the interest rate equivalent to ~5 to 10 percentage of every of our total asset or amount in our bank account, this same bank or government charges 1 percent for every single deposit and 0.9 percentage for service charge includes: sms charge, mail charge and monthly statement of account charge. And also about 3$ for ATM card collection which in every 3 to 4 years after expiration, to sum it up we have 0 interest left at the ending of the month or year yet, we still go back to borrow money in bank same people who used our money for loan will still use your money and loan back to you with interest, and must be with a collateral otherwise the loan will be denied.So for this reason I hardly store a reasonable amount in bank all less for immediate conversion of USD to my local currency for immediate usage otherwise I would be that last man to store my money in the bank due to their none being transparent enough.",

That's the definition of fractional reserve banking.Banks weren't good or bad. They used to be a tool, a means to an end. The idea was good because it allowed people to loan money from an institution that should be unbiased. Before banks, you had to go to someone rich, like a lord and borrow from him, but that lord wouldn't have uniform rules. If he knew you had a beautiful daughter, he could demand her in return for the money. If he didn't like you, he could deny you the loan, and so on. So banks were an improvement. Unfortunately, they became more and more corrupt and now they fake statements, lend money they don't have,. hide the fact they're heavily in debt, they also trade on the stock market using money of their clients, they trade in debt, buying and selling debt of other banks, they run repo businesses... We should somehow reset the banking system and go back to what it used to be 100 years ago.",

I can do it in high shopping malls and also with street vendors.I don't need to carry a debit card if I need to withdraw money from my banking account through an ATM. A smartphone is more than enough.I do not need to visit my bank branch anymore. Anything and everything related to banking can be done through a smartphone and through video calling the banking associatesThe only downside here is, everything is regulated by the government. The debate here should progress towards that angle only. Banking services are exceeding expectations and no crypto can beat that. It's the financial privacy where nothing can beat Bitcoin.

With Bitcoin no one will ask you to pay for maintenance and other fees. You're the boss and you can decide when and where to spend your bitcoins. I agree that in current economy structure we are highly dependent on the banking system but in future Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will definitely be the option for all payments.You should stick to Bitcoin, it's in fact far better option when available, and soon it's going to be available as a payment option in many sectors. That's our firm belief and trust that one day Bitcoin and other valuable cryptocurrencies will take over the fiat or at least work as secondary payment option along the fiat.",

The bank realizes it's in trouble because Joe sees his balance but doesn't really have it, but the bank has some time before Joe comes to withdraw, so it asks the government for help and the government issues bonds. Joe sees bonds as an investment opportunity so he buys them using the bank balance he doesn't have, but the government agrees to take bank's word for it and gives bonds to Joe.This way bank sells liability to the government and the government buys time by selling 10 year bonds. Maybe Joe dies in an accident in 10 years and the debt disappears? Joe is happy, he thinks he'll get more money in 10 years, the government is happy because in 10 years someone else will be in charge, bank is happy because it lost Joe's money and nothing happened.",
