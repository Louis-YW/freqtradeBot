      "body": "First of all welcome to the forum OP, secondly it’s great to see a professional designed OP from a new casino. Many new casino often fails to look professional, but you have made it OP. Moreover the No KYC feature will definitely attract more gamblers to the site. Moreover I can see that in the OP you have mentioned about test net coins and a casino specific tokens, so does it mean that BTC isn’t accepted in the casino yet? If not, then please move the thread to Altcoins section here in the forum.",

But I just want to believe that, since it's still on testnet then everything will be fixed overtime, and I hope they get to fix the bugs on it and also the popups takes much more time ans possibly delay  or even hinder the bet entry field and should be checkmateJust as @Plaguedeath has said which I just confirmed that the   casino doesn't have terms of service and also privacy, this is one factors most players might want to look into since you stated that the casino is KYC free, because players like myself wouldn't want to be lured into making deposit and at the end after making a big win be asked to provide KYC or get kicked out.",

The casino looks like how owl.games, with the use of smart contract. So requiring KYC to its users in the future is a BS decision the management would do.",

Visiting their site and the way they phrase the intruction gave the impression that you only need their native token for gas fees. That usually means they have their own main chain.Ethereum is the default network but Metamask actually supports other smart contract platforms. The Binance Smart Chain and Polygon are among the popular supported networks. You need to add them manually.",

Their ANN, for now, is pretty good and still needs more attention so that the casino site can get more members. And having plans to add another game certainly becomes an attraction for new members. And hopefully, they don't need KYC in the future.",
