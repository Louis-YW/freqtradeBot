      "body": "If they are providing with false information about one thing, bitcoin, imagine how many more can they falsify? Is there no other platforms that can provide you with accurate and entertaining information regarding your other interests that you are so conflicted about this one? In my opinion, their stance about providing misinformation says a lot about what kind of platform they are whether it’s about bitcoin or not they still should maintain an unbiased and honest opinion about everything especially when catering to an audience",

And in the event that their information becomes a problem to the society, you don't want to be recognized as one that sponsored a false media that paint a wrong and deceptive narrative to people that could jeopardize their decision making process as it concerns Bitcoin investment.",

I wouldn't be butthurt about someone posting anti-Bitcoin articles or even posting false info about BTC. We live in the fake news/fake info era and there's nothing we can do about it. Your donations are voluntary. It's up to you to decide whether or not to keep donating.The internet is huge. You can get valuable content in tons of online places for free.

Of course, I will stop supporting this website or site even if I enjoy its content, but being toxic in particular things will not be a good idea, even if not about bitcoin or being anti-Bitcoin. I don't like a website that is being toxic, and I sure everyone doesn't want that. Imagine after enjoying the recent contents because you can read good things and suddenly they become toxic about a particular thing. Of course, you will be shocked and not used to it, so you will stop visiting the website.I'm not a close-minded person, so I will not be toxic either. Maybe they are just giving their opinions and sides, and we all have the freedom of speech, so we can't stop if there is a website dedicated to badmouthing bitcoin. As long as I know what bitcoin is and how it helps me, I will not believe in something that spreads false information about it.",

If a trusted source spreads Bitcoin rumors, one should take multiple approaches. First, contact content providers with evidence-based concerns. Explain how misinformation can damage Bitcoin's reputation and digital currency understanding.Evaluate their other stuff. If their health, history, or art work is unmatched, keep supporting them. They contribute greatly to your interests. If the quality of these sections declines or their anti-Bitcoin becomes overbearing, reconsider your support.Lastly, support matters. Subscribing and donating promotes their platform. You can send a clear statement by withdrawing support if they keep spreading disinformation. Their true material must be balanced against their Bitcoin stance's potential harm.",

I will therefore make my judgement from whatever information I get from the CEO and if the efforts are purposely to discredit Bitcoin, then I will immediately stop my donations to the organization.You cannot feed what you do not believe in or what's against your financial decisions. Any organization that is anti-bitcoin is absolutely against my source of income and I cannot support them especially as they are doing that falsely to discredit the platform and for their best known sentiments against it.First, I don't see a reason why an organization who wants to be recognized as a reputable organization will be involved in falsifying the bitcoin and misleading other well meaning individuals and bitcoin lovers to sway against the interest of Bitcoin.Secondly, I wonder why I would ever want to support such organization again since it will be regarded a conflict of interest and an accomplice of the false news and fallacy to keep donating to such conny and ill-fated organizations, even when they engage in other things that interests me, that could be a bate to get people like me to keep supporting their propaganda.",

Literally, everyone puts their money where their mouth is, and that should drive our donations too. I can't put my money on a project I know negates principles I stand for.

It is possible that some individuals who share this information may have hidden motives and might be manipulating the Bitcoin price. I think it's essential to investigate the situation more closely and gather more information before continuing with my donations. If the content about Bitcoin is false, who knows if their other material is also misleading? If I discover additional incorrect information in their content, I may have to stop my donations altogether.

It's the same with this one. At first, you love what he does until he posts anti-Bitcoin content. Ask yourself first. What's the reason why are you donating to that content creator in the first place? If you love all of his content aside from that anti-Bitcoin content then you can just continue donating and still subscribe to him. On the other hand, if you don't want him anymore just because of that anti-Bitcoin content then just stop donating and unsubscribe. After all, you are donating because you want to support him and not because he forces you to do it. I didn't encounter this type of content creators TBH, but I guess if I were you, I'd just ignore all of his anti-Bitcoin content and will just focus on the other content that he's posting. Everyone has their own opinion, and if that's his opinion then there's nothing we can do about it, and as for you he didn't force you to donate or subscribe, but you did because you are showing appreciation to his content. Well, you can make a debate on him if you believe that what he's saying about Bitcoin is false. I mean many influencers are doing that.",
