      "body": "Do this still matters? It's very risky if you will just make Elon Musk an indicator when you are buying/selling Dogecoin. There are already a lot of bots that are already deployed that are waiting for Elon Musk to tweet something related to cryptocurrency like Dogecoin, and these bots will immediately open a trade. That's why you can see an immediate pump on Dogecoin every time Dogecoin is mentioned by Elon Musk.For me, it's good if you are trading for it just like you buy immediately after he tweeted because you will not know when Elon Musk will tweet about Dogecoin",

      "body": "Yes, it is undeniable that every time Elon Musk tweets about Dogecoin, it will push up the price of Dogecoin itself. But will we always expect the same thing like that? Yes, maybe this is not a problem when it comes to making money through what Elon Musk tweets. However, we should not depend on this so that we forget about other factors that affect the price itself. The worry is that we are a little late and become FOMO about this, instead of getting our benefit, the opposite is true. Because I'm sure there's a lot of people watching stuff like this, and they're racing to be the first to come in and slam the price.",

His acts are random now if we're going to base them on the crypto market.Yeah, he's a fan of meme coin mostly for Dogecoin but we don't know what he's going to do or post a picture or make it a profile picture. They're all random and we don't know what it will be but for sure that everyone will go to react all of it if he ever does and behind that account and monitor/smartphone, he's surely going to laugh again while looking at the market's reaction.",

Am not sure i am willing to base my investment on tweets, it is already risky enough to invest on alts. He isn't just a man but the he is Elon Musk. The second richest man in the world if I am not mistaken. A lot of people follow him so it's normal for those people to react for whatever this guy is doing and there are those who just join in for the hypes in hopes of scoring some profit. For a true investor, they can stand on their own feet and they don't depend on some influencers. They also think it's wrong because it was the same as market manipulation which is mostly done by the whales.If you are not sure if what to do then I suggest don't join those people who watch out for the actions of Elon Musk and other influencers. You already said that investing alone is already risky, so why will you elevate that risk?",

Elon still has the biggies influence in Doge which even with just a tweet like that OP's sample might trigger some volumes of buyers. This December however is not as quite positive at all to crypto, unlike the previous years where we see little pumps.",

Maybe he can push the market all the way, but the bear market will be considered before making a manipulation through his tweets. If it is bull market, then he could've done the market push that takes the market to rise continuously for specific time period. As the market is in its downturn, it can be easily identified as manipulated move.",

I think that at this time Elon musk is getting fed up with Dogecoin because several times he tried to push the price to increase, but his efforts were in vain.I also will never care about anything Elon Musk says on Twitter. because making Elon musk as a motivator for investment is not good.but sometimes no matter what Elon musk says, some people still believe that there will be an increase in the price of Dogecoin.",
