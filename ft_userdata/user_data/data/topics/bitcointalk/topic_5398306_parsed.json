  "content": "It seems to be a day of celebration for the Filipinos as the winner for the presidential position has emerged in the person of Marcos Ferdinand Jr. Marcos Jr, - the son to the popular Marcos Sr who ruled Philippines with a strong hand and was a dictator and ruled for 21 years (1965-1986) but was later exiled and died in 1989- believes he has all it takes to push Philippines to greater level and has vowed to be a great leader. President Joe Biden wasted no time in congratulating him and feels this an opportunity to expand on \"bilateral cooperation\" on issues that affect them regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, economic growth and more. Also, China's president, Xi Jinping extended his congratulations and expressed further on how this win proves that China and Philippines have been partners through thick and thin and feel they can forge a great working relationship.I believe this is a start of something new. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/5/12/us-china-congratulate-marcos-jr-on-philippine-presidential-win",

      "body": "It's rather amusing to note that the U.S., or Hawaii anyway, has a claim of $350m or so against BBM ('Bongbong Marcos') claiming some sort of human rights thing against his family, and he has not gone to the country since.  Likes to visit China though.It will be a hoot to see how the diplomatic gears lose a few teeth in a panic shift over this issue now that BBM might actually get as far as inaguration.  Need significantly better relations to get a guy's county set up as a Ukraine-like proxy war battlefield, pervert playground, and shadow-banking money laundromat.",
