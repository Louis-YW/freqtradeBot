  "content": "I'm having an issue I've never experienced before with my standard wallet. Every time I try to send coin, regardless of using the mempool, static, or eta sliding scale for the fee, i get an error message because the fee is 100% or more. And when I increase the gas, the rate goes down when it should go up. And goes up when it should go down.Another weird thing is that all of my previous withdrawals now show a gas fee equal to or greater than the withdrawal amount. Does anyone know what's happening or if my funds are recoverable?The error type says: bool object is not callable. What does this mean?",

Don't remember) that it can be duplicated without 2fa.Not sure was not paying that much attention.-Dave",
