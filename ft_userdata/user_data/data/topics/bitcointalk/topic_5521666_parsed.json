Due to BTC price increases, forum profitability, and conservative spending, there is a substantial reserve of forum-earmarked funds, currently about 1226 BTC. The cold-storage addresses are bc1qj33689f6edzjst72w6nzs02qd0w68spw49qgcv and bc1q9md45gnwykdkf2r79fdzxyrs96rwejq5nkpca6, though due to accruals the actual amount of forum-earmarked funds might be somewhat higher or lower than the amount in these addresses.Note that the balance of the forum's old donation address is not meaningful, and cannot be added to the above figures. Also, the old multisig arrangement which was previously detailed in this post is no longer in place.",

Indeed no question is silly.It looks like most of the Bitcoins were gotten through donations in the past. If this is the case, are does the forum accept donations?",

If you haven't, it seems you were never truly interested in Bitcoin or the forum. What I don't understand is why you're asking such foolish questions and why you seem to envy the wallet of the owner. If you had believed in Bitcoin when you registered your account and had remained active here, you would have earned a significant amount of Satoshi simply by participating. Now that Bitcoin has surpassed $100K, it looks like you've become greedy and a bit unsettling.",

Bitcointalk is already a well known site and everything here is sustainable. So I guess there's no need to spend for promoting the forum since people already sharing the information that this forum exist and I think that's enough already. Also we can see that Bitcointalk still the famous bitcoin and crypto platform so there's no point of doing such thing you mentioned since it doesn't competing to any platform. Also people here don't ask any financials or prizes from administrator so maybe you or other people should stop those thoughts that if they have lots of money they should give something back to their community.",

Because since the forum do not run ads for Bitcoin related projects and generating money from it, spending the little that has been kept in reserve for emergency without a replacement will be a very bad financial decision. Hence, advertisers need this forum, more than this forum needs advertisers.",

The idea seems to be interesting but I don't think most of the investors are gonna be interested in having the discussion here on the forum and I don't know the reason, it's just my gut feeling but yup there's are exceptions in every case as always.Honestly in my view, the rewards idea on posts will boost the activity but also lead the forum toward that artificial content which is not gonna sustain in the long run.",
