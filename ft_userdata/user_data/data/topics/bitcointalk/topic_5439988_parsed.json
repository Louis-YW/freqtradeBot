  "content": "Newbie question. Thanks for your attention!I setup and downloaded latest firmware on my 2 new S19 90T's using Braiins pool. Everything was great for a while then I keep getting an abnormal hash rate and the units stop hashing. Seems to occur more often when both rigs are running. I have been running just 1 until I can get to the bottom of this issue. When I run both they will hash for an undetermined amount of time 1-2hrs. ish then 1 will go down I will restart then soon the other will stop hashing then back and forth. I had 1 hashing for as long as 2 days before an issue occurred but there is no real pattern to it, it's more frequent when both rigs are running. Could this be my network? Or could it be the pool? I appreciate any input just trying to keep hashing and troubleshooting in the right direction. Thank You!",

      "body": "Where did you run these miners? Is it a closed room? If yes then it is due to overheating that is why the hashrate is drop or throttle. You need to take the hot air out from the room to cool down the miner if the miner is very hot the hashrate will drop or the miner will stop. And also, I suggest you to also try it to other pool like ViaBTC pool.",
