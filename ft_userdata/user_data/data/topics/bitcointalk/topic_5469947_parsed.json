Or maybe, if he doesn't want to visit the forum, there are way worse misleading posts out there.

I taught that it was really fast for such a custom title to be added close to the user's rank. Just this fast, it could have made me wonder if the admin was really waiting for such a motion to be moved, and he just immediately gave the user the custom title. But no, I was all wrong in visiting the link, and I notice that just some editing appears to be perfectly placed in the right place and right thread of discussion.I really don't know if there was some member to whom their thread and discussion obsessed so much due to the content it carries to the extent that they needed a whole new board assigned to them alone. It's ridiculous to imagine, especially when the said person might be someone a few newbies might be looking up to to learn from.",

Every human being is born with brain and as we grow up, we learn analytical and critical thinking. So, if someone writes that fish oil treats anemia, doesn't mean you should believe that. In the first case, you should either completely ignore that or do your own deep research or at least check them on websites like mayoclinic and drugs.comSince this topic is about the BADecker's post on some medications against cancer, I still think he shouldn't be marked for that. Internet is free, just type Fenbendazole on ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and you'll find some interesting answers.By the way, in our life, problem is not that BADecker talks about what he doesn't know, the problem is that FDA is a very corrupt organization also and they accept drugs from pharma companies that pay the most. FDA often ignores every bad side of drug if proper sum of money is paid.",

I know that some folks believe anything they see on TV. I can tell you even worse, some people get calls from strangers that offer them investment options and these people tell them their debit/credit card numbers, it's hilarious. Life is different today, you can't even trust so called licensed doctors anymore because they are just salesmen. Perfect example: Your child has ADD or ADHD, you go to the doctor and doctor tells you that we should give Vynvase or Adderall to her to the rest of his life. Seriously, when you are a parent, does it really require any knowledge of medical terminology to analyze that it's not a good idea to put your kid on strong drugs like amphetamines for the rest of her life? So, my perception is that in life you have to fight and shake your head or you will become a victim of others. Absolutely every day and night I prefer freedom of speech and prefer to act according to my critical thinking and abilities rather than to be under someone's caged censorship.",

Obviously, I was just kidding, dude. I'm not really into medicine that much, but all I know is there's no cure for cancer yet. So, my response on the thread started by @Joeyp wasn't about the whole cure thing. I was more focused on that statement that goes something like this.Quote from: Joeyp on October 10, 2023, 07:55:51 PMLegendary members spread completely fake information - merit system do not work.
