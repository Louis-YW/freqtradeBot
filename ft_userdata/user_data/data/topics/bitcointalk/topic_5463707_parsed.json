Most of those pegged coins are centralized as they can be seized on noncustodial wallet but with the exception of DIA. Even if you remember what happened to USDC that DAI has some of its reserves in, as USDC depegged, DAI also depegged. All other coins that are pegged with fiat or any other coin or asset can depeg. Having domiciliary account is secure than having stable coins.",

Domiciliary account just dey like our normal bank account wey we dey keep Naira,but the difference na say you go dey keep foreign currency like dollar, pounds e.t.c. So government no get any right to freeze anybody account abi government do freeze your bank account before ?Quote from: Cynthia_sinach042 on August 18, 2023, 02:44:25 PMSo in comparison to domiciliary account based on time, effort and potential of losing your holdings I suggest using stable coin than having a domiciliary account in Nigeria.It is not true. Domiciliary account sure pass stable coins for Naija,if anything happen to your funds in your domiciliary account, you can hold your bank responsible and you will get your funds back. If stable coin tomorrow crash and you lost your funds,where you won go hold the dev to pay you back your funds,for America or where.",

And it value remain constant. Because of stability of usdt has made many people to invest on it. As time goes on I believe that people will stop saving there money In the banks. Local banks has became a problem. Dey are tactically defrauding people of there hardearn money.Emagine saving 50,000 naira in a domiciliary account for two months you will be left with 48,250 naira sms and what ever you Know nothing of.But when you convert your money from usdt to local fiat In two month your money may add value. Maybe from 50k to 65k so usdt is better than domiciliary account.",

It is even safe under your custody online than keeping them with the banks.OP, with respect to wetin  you talk about government freezing  account without any offence I no agree with that one.

It is only few of the Fiat Currencies some shitcoins might pass. So I also disagree with the op on that point. When you save in those international fiat currencies, your money is well save at all times but saving in stable shitcoins is at the owner's risk. If na me I will prefer saving it in fiat than shitcoins. And the most preferably is bitcoin when you save your money there and you understand the market , you will sleep well with all eyes close.Apart from Terra Luna coin, shitcoins are not valuable like bitcoin so investment in shitcoins is like in the sea which you can lost all your goods for an unknown winds, storms so you have to bear all those risk in it.",

And with GTbank you can transfer between these accounts that's ( NGN to USD) although I haven't tried of the account among inside. But the problem there is that if you convert your funds to USD now you might lose because you are buying at a higher rate than what it should be, besides banks are offering very low while road side trader being the aboki's are selling #840. I can't remembered the last time I had a serious amount in my bank account because that's is a pure waste of time, charges and maintenance alone gets you irritated.",

Just recently, I been dey look for how I go take buy RMB to buy some items from China. Despite say I get USDT, e just dey useless because I nor fit use am exchange for the RMB. No seller go take am.  But had it been say I get domiciliary account, e for dey very easy for me to hold the RMB for there and do the business wey I wan do easily.",

No coin fit take Bitcoin place because Bitcoin na di king of dem all. But look am dis way, say you buy a bag of Bitcoin during the bear period or you dey do DCA small small and you come get about $60,000 worth of bitcoin holdings in your portfolio and your goal na to sell di Bitcoin during di bull season. You place your target at $100k and finally Bitcoin hit di price, you offload everything make beta profit. Di goal again na to wait make di market go bearish so dat you go invest again, meaning dat you go hold your asset for some time dey wait for di bear season to kick in and you fit hold up to a year. So becuz of di centralized nature and uncertainty attached to stablecoins, I dey suggest to spread your asset across (USDT, BUSD, USDC etc.) so dat if anything happen to any of dis coin e no go too pain you dan leaving your asset in a particular stablecoin and e come bad say na dat one com crash. Domiciliary account for good but on a second thought di charges fit scare person.",

Also when it comes to an investment choice between Bitcoin and USDT or any other coins I think holding Bitcoin is more of an investment and USDT is more of an exchange currency and it doesn't have that investment feature like Bitcoin.",
