Because someone with good bitcoin in custody can think about it but house is reasonable and there is one thread What can 1 Bitcoin buy in your country? so see how much beneficial it could be but accumulating full bitcoin is hard at this time.Coming back to your question it really depends on our targets like what we want to buy or when we want to sell seeking good time and satisfactory profits on your end because the market will go up down always so you decide entry exit point based on your analysis.",

      "body": "If you are asking it for yourself then it depends on the target you aim for. Because many just want to double their money in holding it and when they achieve the target they just harvest it. And definitely, most of the holders become greedy when they see the profit is keep rising and many end up with nothing. That's why it is necessary to make a mindset before holding off any asset.You asked to harvest holding for buying a house, or land, or due to family reasons, which also depends on the emergency and good entry points. Like take an example, you are earning double on your holding and you know, this is not the current time to buy a house/land and there is no family reason but you also knew, that the market will never reach this point again in the next 3 to 4 years and you can not wait for that longer. So, the simplest thing you will do is harvest your profit. There is another scenario too, in which you knew the house/land rates are decreasing and at the same point you are making the same profit then the answer will be, booking the profit to buy the land so that land could also make you profit because you have bought it at a lower price.",

Will you buy a new house/island? What is your answer to the question?There is no optimal timing for this, and it also depends on individual views and the factors that can cause it. A bitcoin hodler who has realized a 30% profit on his overall investment may feel inclined to exit, whereas one who has realized an 80% profit on his initial investment may not go because the aim he set for himself has not yet been met. The market is volatile, and you might choose to sell once you have made your profit. But you don't have to sell in a panic or fear in¬†losing all of your money. Long-term holding of bitcoin has been shown to be beneficial, as long as you do not sell them all. 1BTC=1BTC.",

I'm struggling to see the connection between \"what is the best opportunity\" and \"family reasons.\" If I understand correctly, you're referring to the reasons behind selling assets for profit. It's worth noting that this reason applies to most individuals and may encompass various situations, including health emergencies, unforeseen expenses, and the need to allocate funds for important purposes. Undoubtedly, family-related issues and necessities also play a significant role in the decision to sell \"hodl\" assets.",

Buy and hold is a thriving investment strategy so far in bitcoin or crypto, clearly this has been adopted even if they are whales in crypto. I adopted that strategy to build my investment portfolio over the years, but I'll probably stop buying it when the price hits a new ATH. I should enjoy the advantages in that area and will probably sell all or part of the ownership.If I can be honest, I've even tended to invest in bitcoin in the last 1 year instead of gold. Meanwhile I also have some savings so that I am not affected by price volatility. Before my target is reached, then I shouldn't sell it.",
