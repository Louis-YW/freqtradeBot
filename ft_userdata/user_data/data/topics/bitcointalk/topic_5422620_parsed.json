This is how I completely agree with LoyceMobile, Binance provides us with a new false security, and that is exactly what creates the most problems in the crypto world.Quote from: LoyceMobile on November 22, 2022, 05:52:09 PMThis will lead to a false sense of security: you can't know how much is in the users' balances, so you can't know if the exchange has enough funds to cover them.",

Tbh, CMC used to be even worse and less reliable (not saying that it should be trusted now either, on the contrary) than it is now prior to Binance takeover. I remember the days when scam exchanges like HitBTC and P2PB2B were listed as one of the top exchanges and at least now they are nowhere near the top meaning newbies having less chance to register there.

Hell, they are listed as the top exchanges there as well. They are by far the biggest exchange at the moment, whether we like it or not so its expected to have biggest proof of reserve numbers. Regarding this new feature, I have no doubt that newbies will use it without hesitation and will trust it blindly. After all, that's CMC's target audience. This proof of reserve thing will be like trading volume, every exchange will bullshit about it to some degree and there will be no way to know for sure how legit those numbers are.",

Most of these reserves are posted by the exchange themselves or found through wallet analysis, people can easily verify it. But if they do that, then ignoring and spamming about this issue on their social media should help. But I do agree that the data is difficult to trust even if it just links to an address posted by the exchange itself. Better not to trust any cex and move your funds regularly if you are not day trading.",

I was not saying they are not on top by volume, but we are talking about proof of reserves here, and CoinMarketCap doing that is the same thing as CZ doing it, so I don't trust them.Coingecko already added information for Reserves in their standard page for exchanges, there are two options Available and Unavailable, and they are not owned by any known centralized exchange.It's interesting that Coinbase, Gemini and Binance US exchanges reserves are not Available for Coingecko right now, and it's the same thing for CoinMarketCap.https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchangesCentralized exchanges can now use this alleged proof of reserves, to lure new customers again to keep coins in their accounts... until the next exchange collapse.",

I once was a fan of this site although it has already been questionable in its early years even before it was bought by Binance. I remembered coinmarketcap allowed Ponzis and scams to be promoted in its platform. Now, it is nothing but a way for CZ to make sure Binance is always the number 1. So I don't think this new feature is a big deal. CMC will always add new features for as long as Binance has the top position, for as long as it would boost Binance's image to the public. Newbies will always choose the number 1, and CMC always makes sure it's always Binance.",
