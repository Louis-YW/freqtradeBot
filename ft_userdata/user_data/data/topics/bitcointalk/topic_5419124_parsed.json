      "body": "Yes, indeed why not? But who would know why Satoshi didn't include this particular feature? We could only guess. Is it because having a limited, in fact fixed, amount is generally more preferable and beneficial to the overall design and vision? After all, incorporating this certain feature would only mean the supply of Bitcoin is infinite. Bitcoin, then, isn't unlike fiat at all.Anyway, this is something currently offered in centralized platforms. Although highly discouraged, this is indeed something that could be taken advantage of right now. But not in the protocol itself, of course. Also, isn't it enough that by HODLing whatever amount, you are already sufficiently, albeit indirectly, rewarded for it through the price increase? In a way, HODLing is rewarded. And that's due precisely to the fact that Bitcoin's supply is predictable and fixed.",

Why should you be paid more money just because you own money?You see just because the existing flawed financial system does that, it doesn't mean it is the right thing to do. As the economy experts are starting to slowly realize, printing more money is the only reason why the global economy is this shitty today.One of the reasons why Satoshi invented bitcoin was to avoid everything that is flawed in existing monetary system.Not to mention that what you suggested would ensure inflation in bitcoin. In other words it makes sure that bitcoin would lose its value over time just like any other shitcurrency like dollar, euro, ruble, yen, yuan, etc.",

Yes, the protocol can be changed to add features like this, but will we get consensus from all the full nodes to implement this? The coin cap will have to be increased to allow for \"extra\" coins to be mined to pay for this... and the moment when changes to the coin cap are made, people will lose trust in the experiment and their coins will be devalued.

      "body": "First, Bitcoin is not a bank. Bitcoin doesn't give interest. If you want interest you could just use a PoS altcoin, which gives interest to it's users. Or maybe you could use services like Nexo, if you want interest from your coins. I don't recommend such services, though.Second, Bitcoin is divisible into a million satoshis, so the problem with \"extreme scarcity\" doesn't exist. When BTC becomes too expensive, the Bitcoiners will start measuring everything in satoshis.I don't understand why do you think that we should be fighting deflation? Is deflation something bad? BTC being scarce isn't actual deflation. It's more like having a high price elasticity. A small change in demand leads to big change in the price. You should read about this in some books about economics.",

Satoshi who created the BTC tech and algorithm probably thought about this, before someone can create a tech as good as BTC they would have thought of many options and how they want their production to work, BTC wasn't supposed to work like the traditional financial system in any way other than the both of them being currencies, this fixed low interest rate would be of no benefit to the BTC tech, and will only create more holders than spenders.If you want an 'interest' you should probably go into mining of BTC if you have the finances to do so and be rewarded with BTC anytime you mine a block successfully, or you can use the old successful way of just holding your coins. But interest rates will never be a thing, the algorithm has been set already, and only useful implementations are made through consensus.",
