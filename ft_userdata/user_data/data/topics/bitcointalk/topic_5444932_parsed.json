It's a little confusing to figure out which name belongs to the picture.One more thing. How can people actually vote? Didn't see anything about that?Comment in this thread which submission they like most?Anyway, good luck to all the participants. I won't stand a chance against this strong competition! Respect!Edit: My vote goes to Helena Yu ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5439781.msg61770657#msg61770657 ) , she was the first and set the standard.",
