Read before you invest in shady business. QuoteOne of the primary reasons cloud mining is regarded as a scam is that many cloud mining companies promise unrealistic returns on investment.In the cryptocurrency world, these companies frequently promise high returns with little to no risk, which is not a realistic expectation. Many of these companies are Ponzi schemes in which returns are paid to early investors using new investor investments rather than actual mining profits. https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/innovation/is-cloud-mining-a-scam/",

It's more like a guaranteed chance the above is a scam, cloud mining simply doesn't work because the core idea behind it is broken, we can dive deep into all the \"legit\" cloud mining services that existed in the past and show how they all failed, but I can sum up a whole mess in a short explanation.When the mining profit falls below the contract value or in other words, the buyer is losing money > cloud mining works.When the mining profit yields more profit than the contract value, the buyer is making money while the seller is losing potential profit > cloud mining does not work.So technically, the only way for anyone to make money from cloud mining would be when the hashrate they bought is making more money than what they spent, but who on earth would keep renting their cow that makes $10 worth of milk a day, for someone who pays $5 a day? history showed that nobody will do that, the cow owner is happy when the cow makes $1 and you rent it for 5$, but not the other way around.In fact, history has proven to us that even hosted mining is broken, when your miners aren't making much profit, the host is happy to host them, when they are making much more money than what you pay for hosting, the host will rather kick you out and buy his own mining gears, and there is no type of contract that would keep you safe if you are not safe renting only the power outlet, you are certainly not safe renting the power outlet and the miner.So even if you were to stumble upon a \"honest\" person who offers cloud mining service, you are going to make sure that when shit hits the fan and the miner they rent you for $5 a day is making $10 that person is going to win the battle against the devil and he won't get greedy and just end your contract out of nowhere, they might refund whats left of the contract, but will they watch you make a ton of money form gears they own and operate? I would certainly not bet on that.",
