Don't abuse them or trust them too much and put all our assets in the exchange. We use bitcoin because it's decentralized, and we hate the centralization of banks, but it's funny how many people don't trust banks but trust centralized exchanges. Even if the major US banks collapse and their stock prices plummet like shitcoins in the crypto market, Binance is not 100% reliable.",

Those 9 exchanges is not regulated and violating the regulation of the country where they are operating. Any business will surely take down if it’s not compliant so we should not use this news to create another on using CEX. I bolded the part which needs to be highlight on this news to make a clarification on the recent action.I never hold my fund on exchange for a long time but there’s a time that we need to store it a little longer on exchange especially if we have planned trade that dependent on time.",
