  "content": "I know that few people have heard of bosagora before or have not even heard of it at all. Bosagora is a foundation with its own blockchain and their network will launch next month. The company entered the market more than 4 years ago and has strong partnerships and Don Tapscott is their key advisor. Bosagora is committed to moving the real financial market to blockchain. Wouldn't you like to buy real estate from the comfort of your own home? One of Bosagora's partnerships will help you do just that. Buy NFT real estate and you own it. Don't you want to waste time driving to the university? Bosagora solves this issue with their Meta University. In addition, they will use their BOA coin as a means of payment and apply it to their partner The 9 Company, that is a kiosk enterprise (payment terminals). BizForum was held the other day, where CEO Kim In-Hwan met with the mayor of Seoul and talked about the development of blockchain in the real world. In addition, BOSagora continues to communicate with local governments, companies, and organizations about the future of the blockchain industry these days. Therefore, a \"real-life blockchain platform,\" connecting everyday life and blockchain, will be an important element for \"creating a better world through blockchain technology.\"",

Judging from what the bosagora is, it looks like this is a project that manages real estate, or it might also make it easier for people to get housing easily. It seems that this project is quite interesting and hopefully it will be useful for the wider community",

I didn't see something different with other coins or token projects there. \"we will strive to move closer to BOSAGORA’s vision of ‘Making a Better World”, they said, but most people who engage with the ICO projects will say that thing.Too much projects has started with the same thing, Bob's Repair is one of them. And don't forget about education project from Tether with their Blockchain and Cryptocurrency school in Swiss (Lugano).",

Four years and yet they are still unknown in the community although they are already in the market https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bosagora they should do proper marketing because even if the project is promising and can offer something in the industry, even without proper marketing they will still remain unknown.They have an official thread here, but the thread maker only has to post and those posts were already two years ago, they could do better than this, if they want to gain more investors and supporters.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5266527.0",

Even last year's bull run they also increase up to $0.5, this project is indeed promising. I also actually want to have some of them because has been monitoring this in the market for a long time, maybe later if the price drops below $0.03 because I want to buy it with a very cheap price. So you have a result of your research, is it graphic analytic or fundamentals? And what are the good things that make you really want to buy a BOA? Because I didn't see anything unique about Bosagora, it appears to be similar to other crypto projects.",
