I do get the point but op only thinks that this forum is all about giving advice to another person which you know it's not. I get why op think that this forum is just people who are giving advice to other people is because op didn't know Bitcointalk yet and why it is created. Maybe soon, he will know that it's not just about that but also sharing knowledge, learning about crypto related information that many wanted to learn from experts. That's why I ask, what's wrong about giving advice to another forum users.",

Surely you can talk about Bitcoin in all its aspects here, but you are also allowed to discuss about altcoins, gambling, economics, politics and society, and even off-topics. There is even a marketplace here and a currency exchange section.I’m a bit surprised that you’ve been in crypto for a while and you’ve already encountered a number of sites dedicated to it but it’s only now that you’ve discovered this forum. This is the oldest forum dedicated to Bitcoin, and which Satoshi Nakamoto himself/herself/themselves founded.Anyway, welcome to the forum! Explore and enjoy!",

This place is like the bitcoin it's and the things in here are also decentralized, such as the trust system and merit system but thr only difference is that here is a forum, the must be admins, staff and moderators to keep here going..Speaking about what you expect here. You will expect bitcoin discussions as the name implies. There are places you will discuss about the economy, politics   football and gambling, altcoins and even if you want to develop a projectYou are welcome. And how did you come up with such alias Queentoshi?",

Your already being careful and that's nice and I'll suggest you stay the part. There are always such individuals whose intentions are to plan misdeeds towards others and they very much gere as well as everywhere else. The difference is, they might not be so open as in other platforms following the close moderation of bitcointalk. Be open enough to seek opinion amidst doing your own research on every promising project or presented opportunity. It might save you the long run.And more importantly if you wish to stay here for a longer time, be familiar with and keep to the rules of the forum.",
