Now what is best openion about this seriouse situation As far as I know, Shariah prohibits interest (riba), gambling (maysir), and investing in unethical businesses (haram). Bitcoin is neither of those things. But let me ask you, why should the Bitcoin community care about that?Everyone has the right to their own religious beliefs and practices, and it's important to respect and accommodate those beliefs. But it has nothing to do with Bitcoin. It's up to each individual to decide what investments align with their own beliefs and values.",

With all that being said I do think bitcoin is able to at least avoid all those pointers and is thus allowable in the Muslim culture, but I respect oldies who think it should be haram (am I using the word right?) as then again, I am not a Muslim. But all in all, it is up to you to decide. I've had a few Muslim friends who invested in assets and in particular, bitcoin, they say it's not prohibited per se, so they are good to go.",

Also the high volatility aspect of bitcoin which could lead to speculation is also another factor that makes some Ulama see it as haram.Some Scholars are of different opinions that since it is something that can be use to purchase goods or services and if it is used for such purposes only then there’s nothing wrong with it. The belief is that if it is not hoard pr hold to increase in price then it is proclaimed Hala",

Now what is best openion about this seriouse situation Investment according to Islamic law is not a sin and traders are encouraged to make a fair profit from business engagements. But collecting interest from loans which is called raba is prohibited according to the Holy Books of the religion. The question might be how Islamic banks make a profit. They make their gains through business partnerships or equity participation. This means that there is an agreement that allocates a certain percentage of profit from the business to the bank.I don't think the Islamic religion is against investing in bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies but using bitcoin for loan services that require interest is not permitted and borrowing money with interest to invest in bitcoin might be against the Holy Book..",

      "body": "It should be noted that Islam is a diverse religion with many different interpretations and practices. What might be permissible for one person may not be for another. Some argue that bitcoin is similar to gambling because its value can be unpredictable and volatile, while others believe that it is not haram because it is a legitimate investment opportunity that can generate profits without imposing interest rates. I think it ultimately comes down to personal interpretation and belief. Some Muslims may feel comfortable investing in bitcoin, while others may feel that it goes against their religious principles.",

In reality, anything you purchase with the intention of raising its value in the future is not permissible.

But what if he is a newbie on this? A public opinion might still matter as this can help him decide if which will fit better on him. There are differences between the two (banking sector and crypto) that is cryptos are more unstable but they are also more profitable than the banks. We might only need to check the legalization status of crypto in our country if it's allowed to invest on them or not.If not, well there are still other alternatives like stocks, real estates, gold and so on. It's not always need to be banks. The reason why I seem to avoid them is because I am not really confident about their operations as we know that there are so many negative news about them like they are collapsing and then restricting people about their money.",
