      "body": "actually nowadays there are quite many new altcoins that thrive and getting hundred millions of capitalization in just very short time.what matters most in determining which of new altcoins are worth to invest nowadays i'd say the partnership, you see if you can know that they have partnership with something like mysten labs, binance labs and even some popular exchanges you'd know that they are good project and gonna have massive valuation in no time.history has already prove this to be true, just see sui, arbitrum, arkham and many more they have invested by big venture capitals, and they are gaining massive market capitalisation in no time.so if you're eager to invest in newer altcoins just see their partnership instead the first time, but what makes it difficult is getting whitelisted by them.",

Not actually to ignore but to take extra precaution with them since commonly scams happen on new altcoins launched in the market. If you wanna invest on those then its fine but try to do a deep research on the alt you want to invest. Although there's no accurate sign that the project is good since some show some good potential but still it end up as scam. That's why make sure that the money you invest is the one you can afford to lose so if you fail on that investment you are still fine and can find another one to invest.",

Thus all new altcoins will be flopped???Whatever new altcoins are risky what is known to all but what sign should be noticed before investing altcoins? I think no one said to ignore new altcoins? They were just warned since newer altcoins have higher risk ratio in comparison to old and well-reputable altcoins. New investors should build up their portfolio and the best way to do that imo is to start with well-trusted coins, and then deviate from there slowly since you'd have a passive way of being able to maintain your money. While thrusting yourself into the newer altcoin market could bring in a lot of profits if done well, newbies don't know how to do it in the first place. It wouldn't be any different from gambling if they just entered and invested in any altcoin they'd see that would look like would grow, especially if you consider how a LOT of new altcoins are just scams, or will end up to be scams.",

There were many good altcoins in crypto industry, scammed within some months and that was out of prediction. Then how people let newbies investor advice/invest to new altcoin? Thats the fact as newbies doesn’t know properly how to investigation. Even i even don’t surely know how to investigation good new altcoin which will be exist for long cause team, community, promises, partnership, supply can’t ensure anything. But people with good knowledge, take risk based on their skill. Rest of things about that Project, are depend on luck btw",

If there's no innovation or new concept in a new token investors should ignore this, we are being flooded by so many coins and tokens in the market, its time that investors should stop supporting and investing in these new coins or tokens that are not bringing anything in the community, right now we are being flooded by MEMEs when the community only need few memes.Investors should understand that these new altcoins prices are manipulated and they do shill marketing to deceive investors, old coins have proven their worth in the market so we should just concentrate on these coins instead of new coins that are just copy-paste of trending coins.",

Thus all new altcoins will be flopped???Whatever new altcoins are risky what is known to all but what sign should be noticed before investing altcoins? Before those warnings, there had really been some bad experiences that most investors had with some shitcoins. That's why it's greatly advised that investors exercise caution before investing in any of those altcoins, so that they will be aware of the risk involved and be able to take full responsibility for what the end product of their investment will yield. It is also advised that a newbie learn about Bitcoin and invest in it before thinking of any other altcoin. Sometimes even those altcoins can appear to be very real and also list their token on some recognised exchange, but they can still fail at the end of the day. The token can just lose value, and even the exchange where it has been listed will just delist the token.",
