  "content": "Gambling faces limitations, so marketers are exploring new ways to promote. Social media have become one of the methods. I have already written about the top 50 Instagram & TikTok accounts for gambling advertising. But gambling is strictly regulated on these platforms. Therefore, Twitch may be a more suitable platform. Twitch allowed streamers to share referral codes and links without restrictions for a period. Today, it is prohibited to stream sites that include slots, roulette, or dice games and arenâ€™t licensed either in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions. But following the rules, influencers can stream various gambling sites on Twitch.We have collected 2,505 Twitch channels related to gambling and I make the top 40 of them sorted by the number of hours watched.idxNameFollowersLanguageHours WatchedTop category by HW1CasinoDaddy183,033English707,391Slots (99,7%)2SlotsMarko32,000English600,621Slots (100%)3SkipNhO1,250,000Portuguese535,614Virtual Casino (81%)4PokerStars327,000English512,140Poker (100%)5rachaxp7199,000Portuguese382,578Virtual Casino (79%)6STANISLAW89128,000Russian335,639Virtual Casino (94%)7ilGabbrone545,000Italian320,153Virtual Casino (89%)8ZLOYn857,000Russian307,565Virtual Casino (56%)9Andypsx94,000Spanish238,293Slots (100%)10egorkreed1,160,000Russian233,181Virtual Casino (70%)11k4t4n4172,000Russian226,723Virtual Casino (36%)12Slotshub25,259Greek221,803Slots (100%)13ROSHTEIN1,070,000English218,262Slots (100%)14RobbinLud10,000Russian208,070Virtual Casino (100%)15KhovanskyToday105,000Russian199,053Virtual Casino (53%)16PokerStarsEspanol57,000Spanish196,284Poker (100%)17Casino_Squad68,000Italian194,948Virtual Casino (100%)18TritonPoker75,141English174,478Poker (100%)19aussieslots50,000English164,755Slots (100%)20yuuri22106,000Portuguese154,733Virtual Casino (51%)21PokerStars247173,113English148,791Poker (100%)22symbiolive131,922Portuguese138,976Slots (58,9%)23Kosteze111,000Russian138,509Virtual Casino (72%)24SemaKingg16,000Russian127,934Virtual Casino (99%)25SpinlifeTV86,000English125,964Slots (100%)26SEINTYS128,000Russian118,056Virtual Casino (38%)27cellinrj308,000Portuguese117,266Virtual Casino (60%)28Eskhato94,000Russian116,558Virtual Casino (100%)29PokerStarsFrance46,000French113,107Poker (100%)30ADM1TR1POW277,393Russian106,738Slots (45,6%)31fnxLNTC650,000Portuguese104,120Virtual Casino (95%)32topbonusio42,000Spanish103,057Slots (100%)33FEDOSIK_ZANOSIK15,309Ukrainian101,069Virtual Casino (100%)34B4W1N23,160Russian95,773Virtual Casino (100%)35GALINEOS18,000Polish95,302Slots (100%)36Bonusheroes15,887German90,417Slots (100%)37DiNIceTea117,000Russian89,526Virtual Casino (46%)38nokainlive68,000Portuguese89,102Virtual Casino (100%)39SLOTAKIAS24,000Greek88,981Slots (100%)40ProdigyDDK172,000English87,051Slots (92%)The information in the above top is relevant at the time of data collection.

The effectiveness of influencer advertising can be attributed to the strong bond between influencers and followers. When influencers recommend or review products, viewers perceive their opinions as highly reliable, surpassing the credibility of traditional advertising methods. Influencers offer a unique advantage in terms of targeting, allowing advertisers to concentrate on specific target audiences. That's why we have compiled 2,505 streamers into a single list - Gambling/iGaming Twitch Marketing Inventory List 2023, which served as the basis for this top.

As long as it is gambling,I don't think that most of these influencers do gamble the way that they put it to their followers. As a follower,if you get yourself carried away by these influencers and believe in their words,you might end up in great loss,because gambling is a game of luck and how can you know your lucky day.

They have millions of followers and they have a lot of fans too.They even have a magic word when they promote a gambling site online which is the word \"this is the legit link in the description, you are sure not to lose, instead you will always win\" so they are encouraged a lot and those who lose are poor.But anyway thanks for this information",

Twitch has a rule to prohibit their streamers to stream gambling, I don't see any reason why anyone should know the top streamers who're stream gambling. Twitch isn't supporting them, so everyone who support those streamers are definitely don't care about terms of service, maybe this is why most people always complaint about KYC when they want to withdraw.",

I have a feeling that this will turn out to be the same as the previous threads, my reply is based on personal reasons others might find the thread helpful most especially those that frequent twitch. If it turns out that they can freely promote gambling activities without having to violate any regulations, then it's okay.",

They are more likely paid through an offer alone. What they do is to just boost a platform's popularity and not with its creation. But that amount would be more likely huge even if it is not on percentage.Quote from: ultrloa on June 20, 2023, 01:14:24 PMInteresting list to follow although I don't know majority of them and only familiar with few name in a list but atleast its good to know thag there are so many streamers to follow.

I do know some as well but I only watch them whenever they are playing games on my interest to atleast give me an insight whether to actually try the game or to avoid it. They're somewhat informative on my end but there are just influencers who are not making any sense at all.Gambling advertisement is quite on a \"loose\" nowadays. Whether it is a bad thing or not, most of the influencers won't mind knowing the answers.",

It just goes to show how many people out there are watching this sort of content and being influenced by these streamers on a long time scale. Many of them will have sponsors, both officially disclosed and those that they partner with in secret, who might be distorting the actual win return rate of the sites they're playing on. It's very dangerous following these sort of people because they can often manipulate viewers into believing that it's possible to win long term, unless you're playing poker or clear about the risks of the entertainment you're playing - it's better to stay away.",

Good point Hispo: one thing is disclosing an estimate on how much an hour watched is worth on average, and another one how much specific streamers earn. The latter enters the realm of personal (financial) information and, unless one wants to reveal them freely, they shouldn't be disclosed to the general public.That kind of data leaks are a disgrace for those who believe in the importance of privacy rights, but it is undeniable that gossiping can be very tempting for many too.",

Haven't gone to gambling twitch since their banning of anything that's gambling-related in the platform. But it's good to know that there are still streamers out there that are able to get past the ban hammer and gamble willy-nilly in front of a large audience. Furthermore, it's not really my cup of tea since I'm an experience type of person and I'd much rather do the thing myself than watch someone do it for me. It doesn't give me the same satisfaction and enjoyment per se, so streamers from gamers to gamblers aren't really my tempo. Only guy I watched that's remotely connected to gaming and gambling at some point in their career is Moe (Yassuo), he was a famous youtuber back then turned twitch streamer and then a gambler after severe burnout from League of Legends, he got banned unfortunately from Youtube for reasons I do not know but he's trying to go back to variety streaming which is cool I guess.",

It was all over the news when they already prohibit gambling-related content, I'm not sure if the list will be helpful for companies, but most likely their twitter accounts are named the same which companies can still contact them for promotion.as far as I know, streamers on Twitch can still stream while gambling as long as the gambling site they are playing on is registered in the United States.Quote from: bittraffic on June 20, 2023, 05:07:32 PMInfluencers need another video-sharing site that gives them more freedom, there are tons of them but the audience are often just on youtube.I just found this out recently, did you know Eddie from stake.com has launched their own streaming platform, it's called kick.com, I found this out because one of the youtube channels I follow mentioned a streamer from Twitch called xQc is getting a $100M contract on kick.com. if you are curious you can search on Google xQc $100m kick.com contract, you'll see articles about it.",

      "body": "Hasn't Twitch issued a ban on all stuff related to gambling? Or was it only applying to putting out referral codes on the stream? Can't really remember, I just know that Twitch did something to limit the influence of what streamers have to spread gambling, and that in itself is already a sign that gambling isn't really going to stay in there imo. And even if there were some aspect of gambling that was still open, I reckon it wouldn't be long before they ban it again. Quote from: Slow death on June 20, 2023, 06:50:04 PMif you could get more information such as how much money each of them earns per day, per week, per month it would be good information, it would make people have a more realistic notion of the size of the importance and influence that each of these guys have in the world of gambling and it can also serve as a source of inspiration for those people who are beginners or who also want to follow the same steps as these guys, it would also be very good if you could get information on how many referrals these guys have in every casinono doubt that this information would be very relevant, and we also have information on how much money these guys have already earned with their referrals in each casino, many casinos partner with these channels, I don't know if this is true or not because I'm not a person who's been following Twitch so I'm not 100% sure if this is true or not, just heard about it in the past with some channels where guys kept playing and people kept saying the guy was putting money that was given by the casino to play, anyway what would be good to know and how much money casinos pay to channel owners like theseTwitch is outside of those partnerships so payments wouldn't really be disclosed iirc. Same with the money they get, I don't think Twitch API would reveal such a thing (if OP actually got his data from something like that). Plus, money isn't really needed anymore, just the amount of views is more than enough of a metric.",
