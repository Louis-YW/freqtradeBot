You are still going to have to get 12V to the hash boards and the control board not 5V. They are hard wired to convert the 12V from a PCIe plug to the voltage they need.After that you can pull 2 of the boards, like a lot of us do for converting them into silent space heaters.Then grab one of the custom firmwares that are out there to shut down most of the chips on the board.You would also need to figure out fan control, and a few other things, probably not worth the time and effort.-Dave",

Anyone know how this could be done?I don't think that's worth it / possible (the 1-5 chips part). I'd recommend selling that S9 (they're worth around $500), and getting the R909 for $600. Great little machine.It runs off of 12V, but I doubt that a solar panel of the size you need (100W+) only outputs 5V. They are usually 12V or higher.",

      "body": "You could have a small 2S battery as a buffer that's filled by a solar panel using like a $10 BMS, and then put a step-down voltage converter to get that 5V at the output.If it's 12V what's required, then just bump it up to 4S or even 3S configuration. In the latter, make sure they're charged around 4V, I don't what's the actual tolerance of working voltage range for these boards is, they usually have some leeway.",
