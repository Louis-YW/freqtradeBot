Newbie for your sanity stay vigilant and don't get misled in that section be careful just a warning.",

Sometimes a bounty project would have a warning about it being a scam or it having ended the bounty campaign, but still you would see such accounts applying and making weekly bounty reports in such threads. What do you do to such people? Just leave them to get scammed until they get to their senses.",

Do they even use escrow?  ________________________________________________________I'd say that if you do not like that section of the forum, just ignore it for now, I am quite sure that there must be a good reason for the admins to let that section to exist to this day.

The problem is that the bounty hunters that should stop promoting once they know it's a scam project.  Look at the 1xbit.com signature campaign, though they know it has multiple scam complaints there's someone promoting them just because to the dollar that they'll get. Just ignore it for now and help moderators to fight and stop spam through these bounty hunters, click the \"Report to moderator\" button.",
