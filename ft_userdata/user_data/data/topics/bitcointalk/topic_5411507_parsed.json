Truth is that the said wallet with $600 isn't yours, and you know it. You think you can outsmart that scammer who told you they couldn't withdraw that amount and then exposed certain seedphrase that gave you access to the wallet. It's a game plan scammers use now and it's a pity you fell for that cheap trick.",

You are describing a the wallet bait of the hacker that contains USDT that has a built in script attached on it. The only to withdraw it is to counter it by another script that will react faster than the scammer set time. I donâ€™t know if this is exactly possible since I donâ€™t have knowledge in coding but the only way to withdraw that amount is to use a script that will do the same as the hacker doing since you have both access on the wallet private key.Btw stop sending free TRX to the hacker.",

It is very like the referred scam is a multisig scam, which a relevant thread is being posted: [Warning] Trust wallet tron multi signature scam. You can see some information over there, but to put it simply, the scammer is making some particular account that can't execute any things including transferring any funds. So, the funds are just sitting there, it can only be moved by another account that manages the bait account.",

Hacker is so wise he use some bot and script which work 24 hours and automatically send Trx . Same case is happen with me in Bnb chain. When ever i send bnb to withdraw my token, bnb automatic send to another address. Some people will ask you to recover and will ask for upfront payment. Don't trust on these People because they are also scammer.",
