  "content": "Hi all,I've seen on the Internet that Wireshark can detect protocol packages like Bitcoin and Lightning Network. They are identified in the protocol column.The problem is that my Wireshark is not classifying those packages, it just says tcp/ip or http/json.Does anyone know how to solve that?Note: I know there's a package called lightning dissector but I don't need to read the packages, just identify them. (In the end, I ended up using it)Thanks in advance!-SS",

      "body": "Yeah Wireshark can detect a lot of protocols including Bitcoin and Lightning packets.There are few things that u should check if they arent identified:Bitcoin network uses port '8333' for mainnet and '18333' for testnet. The lightning network uses '9735' as a port. Atleast what I found, not 100% sure on LN.Make sure that you capture traffic on these mentioned ports.You can also check if u set the preferences right. For that: Go to Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols. Lookup 'bitcoin' and ensure that its enabled aswell. Otherwise it will not capturing these packages.VPNs or proxys can cause problems aswell. If its possible you should capture them without services like that.Last point as usual: Make sure that you have the latest version of Wireshark, maybe you are using an older version where these protocols arent added yet. Updating/Reinstalling can fix corrupted files sometimes.",

However, the reason I wanted to highlight the point you raised is that on the Wireshark site, bitcoin support seems to have been excluded from certain versions: SourceSo if OP uses such a version, it is quite possible that the traffic is not displayed correctly. By the way, the same question was also asked here recently, you can find more starting points there: How to use Wireshark to identify Bitcoin/Lightning P2P packets",
