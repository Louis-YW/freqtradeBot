  "content": "CBDT has finally issued the guidelines in regards to TDS provisions on cryptocurrencies and I will try my best to explain everything in the easiest manner possible. Let’s start then,There can be two possible scenarios – either person trades on Exchange or Peer-to-Peer. In both the case, the primary responsibility to deduct TDS lies with the buyer. However, to simplify the process, the onus of TDS has been shifted to the Exchange in the first case, so, let’s discuss it first:CASE I: A person buys/sells crypto via Exchange   As a buyer:Deposits INR on the Exchange via UPI, net banking or other means – No TDS applicableConverts INR to cryptocurrency – e.g., buys USDT with INR balance – No TDS applicableTrades one coin for the other – e.g., buys BTC with USDT – TDS applicableAs a seller:Trades one coin for the other – e.g., sells BTC for USDT – TDS applicableConverts cryptocurrency to INR – e.g., sells USDT for INR – TDS applicableWithdraws INR to the bank – No TDS applicableIn all the cases above where TDS is applicable, the Exchange will deduct 1% TDS automatically and credit you the remaining 99% amount. Nothing changes for you as a user, no additional compliance. However, like I said above, the primary responsibility to deduct TDS lies with the buyer, so make sure to only use reputable exchanges which are deducting TDS, else, the department will catch you, not the exchange. CASE II: A person buys/sells crypto peer-to-peerAs a buyer:Sends INR, receives cryptocurrency – e.g., buying BTC with bank transfer – No TDS applicableTrades one coin for the other – e.g., buying BTC with USDT – TDS applicableAs a seller:Receives INR, sends cryptocurrency – e.g., selling BTC and receiving INR in bank – TDS applicableTrades one coin for the other – e.g., selling BTC for USDT – TDS applicableSince, there is no middleman in peer-to-peer trade, the responsibility to deposit TDS lies with the counterparty. Thus, the buyer has to deposit TDS to the government if he directly buys coins from a seller. For example, I buy 2 BTC for Rs. 40,00,000 from Amit. Now, it is my duty to keep Rs. 40,000 aside, deposit it to the government and only credit Rs. 39,60,000 to Amit. In second case, where two parties are exchanging coins, for example, I sell 2 BTC to Amit for 40 ETH, both of us are buyer and seller. So, both me and Amit are required to deduct and deposit TDS. The TDS amount will be 1% equivalent of 2 BTC at the prevailing market price.Now, the question arises – how to deposit TDS? The government has divided the traders into 2 groups: Specified Persons – If you don’t do any business or profession. For example, you are salaried employee and invest in cryptos as a side-activity. Or you have business or profession (for example, in the form of freelancing or crypto trading) but your total revenue doesn’t exceed Rs. 1 crore.Others – Any person other than mentioned above.If you lie in the category of specified person, the process is rather simple for you. Every time you do a P2P trade, you have to file 26QE form. Here is how this form looks - 26QE FORM. Basically, this form needs to be filed online, you have to visit this link: E-Payment, select Form 26QE (will be available from 1st July), fill in all the details about yourself and the seller, proceed and deposit amount equals to 1% value of the trade. That’s it, no need to acquire TAN number.However, if you are not a specified person and do trading with volume in excess of Rs. 1 crore during the year, you will have to follow more detailed process which involves acquiring TAN number and filing quarterly 26Q statements. Better consult CA in this case.Note: You only have to file above statements if you do P2P trades. No need to worry about TDS compliance if you are doing trades on the Exchanges.Other questions:Q1. What if I buy/sell coins from/to foreign person? A1. TDS provisions are only applicable if the seller is a resident of India. If you buy coins from a foreign person (including foreign exchanges), you aren’t required to deduct TDS.  Conversely, if you are a seller, the foreign person is required to deposit TDS but since it is not practically possible, NO TDS applicable when you buy or sell coins from or to a foreign person.Q2. Is TDS a tax or will I get the refund? A2. The main purpose of TDS is to identify the taxable transactions, however, TDS in not your final tax. So, you will get the refund of TDS when you will file the income tax return. For example, your tax liability for the year comes out to be Rs. 70,000 and your TDS deducted during the year was Rs. 50,000 so you will only need to pay Rs. 20,000 more, TDS of Rs. 50,000 will be adjusted against the tax. If it is in excess of the tax, e.g., tax liability is Rs. 70,000 and TDS deducted is Rs. 80,000 then the remaining amount of Rs. 10,000 will be credited to your bank.Q3. Is there any minimum amount not chargeable to TDS? A3. For specified persons, the limit is Rs. 50,000 and for non-specified person, the limit is Rs. 10,000. However, this limit counts from April 1st, not 1st July. Let suppose, you have already sold coins worth Rs. 45,000 via P2P from 1st April to 30th June and now you are selling coins worth Rs. 10,000 then TDS will be applicable and the buyer will have to deposit Rs. 100 to the government and only credit Rs. 9,900 to you because the limit of Rs. 50,000 is breached (45K+10K).",

Now I am glad that they cleared this part up and the exchanges are directly cutting off TDS which makes it easier to claim while filing returns.",

GST won't come in don't worry. Atleast not on the trades being made through exchanges, it makes zero sense to bring GST on whole selling proceeds, even if this law comes in it would definitely be challenged in the court of law for sure and will make more of mockery of the government, the GST could be charged on commission or brokerage but not on the total value of sales because then government will have to allow input credit on value of purchase as well which will only increase their own headache.",

I wish that doesn't happen but asking it just for more clarity.",

To an extent the government has be able to discourage trading an investment officially. I think they will also implement GST shortly to complete and that would destroy whatever trading and investment left in this country. One thing I am sure that many community members have now found out multiple ways to avoid tax and TDS.",

TDS doesn't increase the tax liability of the seller. It is just a mechanism to track the trade of the cryptocurrencies. But since, imposing TDS requirements on the foreign buyers is difficult so the government left them outside the purview of this section.However, I agree with your second point. Locking 1% from every trade as a TDS will lead to liquidity crunch and virtually kill the market. We are already seeing horrendous drop in the volume on Indian exchanges and the situation is going to get worse unless we have a better regulations.",

You will need Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC) from your Authorized Dealer as the proof that the money you are receiving is against a genuine export of goods or services. Without a valid FIRC, GST authority may reject your stand and you will have to pay 18% out of your own pocket.By the way, why do you want to show it as an export? There is no GST on trading. Only TDS and Income Tax provisions applicable on trading. Unless you are earning crypto by selling goods or services, there is no applicability of GST.s",

Export is when you sell a good/ service to someone outside the country and bitcoin so far isn't specified as a good or service. Moreover TDS we are talking about here is the mechanism of Income Tax act, TDS has not been made mandatory on selling crypto to foreigner because the foreigner won't be taxed in India, he will be taxed in his own country and it has not been made mandatory when someone sells to an Indian because you cannot enforce the law outside your jurisdiction, you can create the law but enforcing it would be a nightmare for the government.",
