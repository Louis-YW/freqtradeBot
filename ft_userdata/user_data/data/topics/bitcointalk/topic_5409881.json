  "content": "This might not sound well but there is a possibility of bitcoin trading Bellow $17k. I see a massive selloff coming.Still remember  The MT GOX rehabilitation plan made on October 20th 2021? Oh! Let's recall the past.On 24th February 2014, MT GOX exchange was hacked. The exchange lost about 850,000 BTC which 750,000 Btc belongs to investors while 100 BTC belongs to mt gox. Before the hack in 2014 there was a massive bull run where btc went from $13 in 2013 to $1182 in 2014 with a 9000% profit. In 2016 MT GOX went bankrupt with a total lost of roughly 2.4 trillion worth of btc. This impacted on the market so much bringing btc down to 36%.Back to the MT GOX rehabilitation plan. MT Gox promised to compensate the investors who lost their funds during the hack with 137,000 BTC This August 2022.Note: on July 6th, 2022 we heard on news that an email was sent to the investors that lost their funds during mt gox hack giving them option to specify if they would  to receive in BTC , BCH or USTD.Now, let's go deeper. With 137,000 BTC worth roughly $2.8 billion or let's say $3 billion in the hands of investors, what do you expect they do with it? I see the number of investors that will selloff to regain  what they lost outweighing the few that will decide to still hold. offcurse the sellof won't happen all at once. Considering the principle of the market, if the number of investors that will sellof outweighs those that will HOLD, what do you think will happen to Bitcoin? I will leave you to answer that.Well, like they said, you can only predict the market but can't be 100% sure of your prediction. Let's watch and see.",

Here is the official document so that everyone can see,https://www.mtgox.com/img/pdf/20220706_announcement_en.pdfSo it's either the recipient has choice of lump sum repayment, cash, bitcoin and or bitcoin cash.Chances are there will be will availing of the lump sump here, and maybe few on crypto as they have suffered enough of waiting for years. And with that said, cash will be the better options, unless they still want to go to and hold their bitcoin and or bitcoin cash in this bear market.And there is also an assignment, meaning not all claimants will get everything at the same time (cash or crypto). Going to be a slow process for August up to the end of the year or when all payments have been made.And thanks to this kind of FUD, members are now well aware as to what will go down to this Mt. Gox repayment program if it has an effect on the market to put it below the last lowest low of $17,500.",

Bitcoin isn't some kid in front of a self-driving Tesla, it won't die. That's for sure lolThere are a few things which I believe will happen for certain like:->Media spreading FUD with baity titles to generate maximum ad revenue on this news. Will have a negative impact->Not all Trustees will sell their coins. I am expecting like 20% of the coins to be in the market.->Whales know economics, they would never \"dump\" an asset in a short period of time. They would be taking an unnecessary hit by choking demand with their own supply.->Many will sell for cash and leave for Mexico or some SEA country lolIn conclusion, it will be just another day with red closing candles like a mature woman on her zillionth period.",

We came from a bull run and we've seen the market dropped already and we're all saying that we already are in a bear market. So, if you're saying that it's likely that it will be lower than $17k soon. Fine, that's part of the market's attitude of being volatile.There's really nothing to be afraid of, if you're a short termer, you'll fear it.

We've been there for how manytimes and still standing strong after all the years of existence and people cant really just realize that let these things to happen.

We will find that the effect will be very small or supported if the opposite does not happen.I also consider with you that the 137,000 doesn't hold much weight to immediately push the market to an unprepared bear.  Even at that, Mt.Gox would have an appropriate way to roll out the payments, maybe in batches and not at once, however there are other options of withdrawal which includes USDt which I know many will opt for the option.Op, saying we should expect bear it's not scary tbh, this is because we are already in the bear and are not afraid of the bear anymore, but any type of bear you propose, even if it did happen won't last long .",

A lot of those will be paid in cash, and IIRC, some of the cash were already at the hands of the trustees. The disbursement is what's taking so long, not the sell-off. It already happened, and if it isn't enough still, I don't think it will be that big to cause such a massive dump.Nice try for fudding, but try again maybe you'll bait some newbies out there.",

Exhuming the dead body called MtGox may scare a newbie or two but is not going to affect the market.Exactly a month ago the news about the MT.Gox distribution was published so far there has been no significant dump, it's just old news that keeps repeating and is given some spices so that market sentiment is disturbed. But in fact there is no big dump that happened, even now the market is strengthening again. MT.Gox is just a grave with a corpse that is already boned and does not have any strength, it's part of the past that must be buried deep. one or two beginners will indeed panic because they don't know the history of Mt.
