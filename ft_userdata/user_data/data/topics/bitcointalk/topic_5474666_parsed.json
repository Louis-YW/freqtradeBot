  "content": "I'm quite out of the alt world, but I've read that Polygon (unsurprisingly) has created a new token (Pol) for its L2. Of course, there's a technical justification for creating it and they've said you'll be able to migrate MATIC, but I find it hard to believe they won't take the opportunity to print more money and continue financing themselves (which shows that lie of limited supply they sell us). Is there any information about the tokenomics they intend to use?I read about another blockchain (one of the supposedly serious ones) that had printed another token as well, but now I can't recall it. When the free money runs out, more is sought. From what I read in forums and groups, people don't really believes in the narratives of these alts, they just delude themselves hopping to get out with some \"dirty FIAT\". So sad!",

Other project like Aptos, Sui, Optimism and Matic are runner up on the current bull market.I’m already x3 on TIA since I purchased it during listing on Binance. I believe most of the project related to L1 and L2 is the most hype now because there’s VC backing it to finance the value in the market.",

More investors are apeing into the Solana projects as sol is pumping this fee days and some of the projects under it are equally doing great.Knowing which alts is going to print money means keeping close tabs to platform like dextool, coingecko for newly listed projects.",
