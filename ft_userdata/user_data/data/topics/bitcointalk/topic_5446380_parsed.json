Add some rules, what is acceptable and what is not. For example, plagiarism in any form is undesirable.If you really mean crypto educational, I would advise you to do a little research on it, it is very possible that there is something similar.as for the prize, it certainly depends on your budget, but you should keep in mind that a small prize will not attract participants with quality proposals. few will bother if the reward is miserable or negligible.after that, you can start a contest campaign for example in Services section if you plan to payout winners in BTC. probably the best choice and a campaign paid in BTC is always more attractive.",

As far I understood you want to run a contest or gaming competition type thing. So I think first of all to retrieve complete information related to your competition you need to explain your idea, requirements, pools etc etc.Bitcoin Forum > Economy > Marketplace > Gambling > Games and rounds After that, you need to create a thread in the games and rounds section of the forum where participants will join your competition. If you really want to know more about it then can create a new thread in the Service section. There Campaign managers and different Service providers can directly help you with their experience. You can hair a person for that purpose too.Bitcoin Forum > Economy > Marketplace > Service Discussion",

There are plenty of threads, so you will get an idea how it works pretty quickly.Please keep in mind to follow the forum rules on contest/raffles/giveaways, otherwise your contest might get deleted.Giveaways and games that pay out altcoins do NOT belong hereUsers posting \"joined\" type posts when not required or allowed will be BANNEDIncentivizing posting via low effort tasks (likes, follows, etc.) is NOT allowedI suggest you to get an idea what's allowed and what's not. Otherwise it's pretty likely that your thread will get deleted.",
