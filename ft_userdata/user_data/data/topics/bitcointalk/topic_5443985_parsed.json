  "content": "I see joy amongst some users in different cryptocurrency communities who think that the bill passed by Missouri Government to protect minners would impact on the market to get bullish. Aside New York that purged out crypto mining activities, is it necessary to fight for a bill as Satoshi act fund did? As people can still mine in other states without being noticed or penalized until they're asked to leave the state. The new bill was voted 12-0 in favor of bitcoin and miners can pay equivalent amount of money that other companies pay on Electricity bills, which is an advantage to the miners. But, I'm curious about why all the Government officials supported this bill; 12:0. Are they getting interested in mining activities?https://watcher.guru/news/missouri-passes-bill-to-protect-crypto-and-bitcoin-mininghttps://twitter.com/SatoshiActFund/status/1633138344938049536",

Miners can find Texas a better dwelling place, especially when Electricity consumption is at its peak. Making more money aside Mining bitcoin, indeed its attractive. If the Missouri Government wants Miners in their state by offering same electricity rate, it could be they're concealing their intentions in a way of attracting more miners into the state, which will in return boost the Government's pocket through tax, electricity bill and others.",

This new bill will protect miners from being attacked through the use of government regulations and be protected from discriminatory policies. The skeptical me thinks that some of the backers of these politicians might have invested in bitcoin already.A new bill aimed at regulating Bitcoin mining in Arkansas has been approved by both the House of Representatives and Senate and is now awaiting Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ signature.The Arkansas Data Centers Act of 2023 seeks to establish guidelines for Bitcoin miners and protect them from discriminatory regulations and taxes, guaranteeing that firms have the same rights as data centers.Source https://decrypt.co/125811/bitcoin-miners-will-have-same-rights-data-centers-says-new-arkansas-bill",
