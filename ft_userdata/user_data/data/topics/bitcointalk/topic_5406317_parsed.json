I'd rather buy more coins that is belong on top, there's a good reason why they are on top and with this, I can see MATIC as a good investment.",

I meant if you are seeing based from the daily activity of project and moonbeam is the having the lowest activity on its platform compared with another project in your list. Sandbox is starting to create more partnerships with the big brand to build their office in the metaverse. I think that if moonbeam and near can be considered as the worst choices from your list. I know that no one can predict accurately but this based on the price performance as well. It can be seen if you are using the common indicator like that.",

      "body": "@Loco1887, are you serious? They are all top tier projects mate . But if I had to choose the worst from the five projects that you provide, I would choose Moonbeam (GLMR).QuoteWhat Is Moonbeam (GLMR)?Moonbeam is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain on Polkadot. Moonbeam makes it easy to use popular Ethereum developer tools to build or redeploy Solidity projects in a Substrate-based environment. - SourceHonestly, I personally don't know in depth about this project, but from the results of my research, I found that the main utility of this Moonbeam is for developers. Of course because of this, Moonbeam doesn't have much utility. Unlike Polygon and Near, they are the native tokens of their network and ecosystem. Also we cannot compare it with Aave and Sandbox which are pioneers in the DeFi and Metaverse space.Reference:1. https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/moonbeam/",

As far as I understand I don't see anything problematic thing in these projects they all are doing well even if you can ask us which 4 coins you guys will choose from the above list and even you can ask us what are the thing that needs to be improved so that you get a specific answer. I don't know on which grounds you will measure the project is worst and about the future prediction is not easy. If I have to take out any of them I would choose Moonbeam as I have not heard much about it and I don't have much knowledge about this Moonbeam and the rest of the four projects are high-potential projects in my opinion.",

It's like the first basis when we look at projects but also, we need to consider that not all top projects can stay there for long. We're learning from the past and experiences that we've met. On this case, we all should be careful and thoroughly do research before we invest in any crypto in the market. That's what we need to remember before we entrust them with our hard earned money.",
