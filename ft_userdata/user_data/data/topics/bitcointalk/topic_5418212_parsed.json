How are they that certain? They of anybody know how damaging nuclear war would  be for the whole world. But they keep on tempting and tewsting Putin.101st Airborne Deployed to Ukraine's Border 'Ready To Fight Tonight'Quote from: https://news.antiwar.com/2022/10/23/101st-airborn-deployed-to-ukraines-border-ready-to-fight-tonight/The White House has deployed thousands of American soldiers just miles from Ukraine to prepare for war, according to CBS News. Officers speaking with the outlet revealed they were there for combat against Russia.Brigadier General John Lubas confirmed nearly 5,000 troops from the 101st Airborne recently joined the 100,000 American soldiers already deployed to Europe. Lubas described his troops as being on \"full deployment,\" and they are preparing to fight Russian soldiers in Ukraine. \"This is not a training deployment, this is a combat deployment for us. We understand we need to be ready to fight tonight,\" he said.CBS Reporter Charlie D'Agata was embedded with the American forces as they conducted military drills – at a forward operating base – within four miles of Ukraine's border.

Pure Democracy is way more complex.The only difference between Dictatorship and Democracy is that Democracy is group Dictatorship rather than a single-man dictator.

Putin doesn't seem to concede not without causing major damages across and beyond Ukraine boarders. At the point the of the white house is needed else Putin won't mind  using Nuclear weapons on Ukraine which will result in severe consequences as reported from the white house. The deployment of the US Army and the aggressiveness is what the face of the war needs now.",

The West did with the government coups that they started in 2014 if not earlier.So, what has Russia invaded? They have invaded the US, especially considering that US companies own 60% of Ukrainian land, and especially considering that the Ukrainian military is made up of at least 25% of Nato forces from outside of Ukraine, and especially because of all (46?) the bio-warfare labs the US has started in Ukraine, and especially because of the money laundering being done by the Bidens and others in Ukraine, and especially since a large portion of Ukrainian people have been asking Russia for help.As long as the media can keep you jokers thinking that Ukraine is the same Ukraine as it was decades ago, you will never figure out that the Ukraine invaders are the US and Nato.",

Things are getting worse and if this two government do not look for ways to settle this conflict, I think this could lead to a bigger fight that can trigger world war 3 which we are know what the outcome could be.  I think this is a best time for the NATO to remove their ego and look for ways to settle and end this war because people are dying everyday as a result of this war which no one is interested to end.",

Saudi Arabia wants to join the BRICS, they are speeding up the stroke to get away from the dollar.meanwhile US also wanted to push the war as means to escape the declining hegemoney. EU has better chance of making the peace actually, their leaders are starting to oppose US sanctions. if they fail against Russia, then BTC it is. the war may continue, i don't think Putin will stop also, this mad dog is determined, he is carefully strategic to bring nations on his side and its working.we're all spectators and we can only watch until the dark clouds covered the sun. i hope not. there is no much reason to live life.",

This situation need to be handled properly so that third world war is avoided.The trick for the US is to maintain a certain kind of balance. It's a balance in the money.US money more than that of any nation is brought into being by the banks thru loans. When the government borrows money to send to Ukraine, and the banks create new money that they call a loan to the US, what happens to that money?Essentially, US money is really only good in the US. Oh, sure, some countries play around with the USDollar. But most of it goes to buying something from the US.As Ukraine war money gradually trickles back into America, it causes more and more inflation. This inflation is growing among the people.The US has to be careful that there isn't too much inflation. If there is, Americans won't be able to buy products, which means companies will shut down, which means that there will be fewer war machines being made to give to Ukraine... to say nothing about protecting the US from invasion.The US has two things to watch out for if they don't win this Ukrainian war. One of them is the destruction of the UIS banking system. Another is an attack from some foreign nation... which might be Russia.If Americans are feeling the pinch because of inflation, it's going to get a lot worse. Why? Because there is a whole lot of US Ukraine war money that simply hasn't filtered its way into American society, yet. When it does, inflation will soar.",
