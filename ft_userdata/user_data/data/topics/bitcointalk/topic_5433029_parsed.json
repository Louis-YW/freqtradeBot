The fees depend on the partner, yes, but the fees will be transparent, so you can select an exchange partner with the lowest fees (or if you had a bad experience with a partner, then you can choose another partner). This also will have a dollar (or local currency) amount that you are paying for fees (for ease of use). Thanks for the welcome!",

My initial idea was to simply act as a proxy and not earn a cut at all, but I think that could help fund the hosting, domain, and dev work. That sounds like a great feature to implement, maybe you could get paid in a crypto of your choice instead of exchange tokens (like $UNI).I also love the idea to add some notices so users know the terms of each exchange partner, and an easy-to-use filter to find an exchange with the requirements they are comfortable with.Thanks for the advice!",

If I think of implementing this, I would most likely find a CEX that allows this (and the support confirms), but the legality on my side (money laundering) might still be an issue. I don't plan to implement CEXs anytime soon unless I have good reason to.DEX: I plan to implement some ETH DEXs to start off (first DEX would be 1inch and UniSwap), then move to some other DEXs which provide services for other cryptocurrencies. The code will be open source, so I think this will gain some traction from that factor alone.BestChange: BestChange seems like a solid site, don't get me wrong, but they lack the functionality (which as a crypto noob would be difficult) to preform the exchange themselves, they seem to only be a comparison, non-interactive exchange database. A lot of features (like exchange rates in USD) will be some features I plan to implement. Another user mentioned the fact that their feedback seems suspicious, and I think it might be a cool idea to have feedback sent to IPFS in JSON format so anyone can query feedback and ensure I am not changing feedback to be positive in my, or an exchanges favor.Thanks for the advice and feedback, it means the world!",

Most of the top exchanges are implementing KYC at the moment. The risk of freezes is also greater because users can send directly to exchange addresses without you guaranteeing that it's \"clean\" money.1st Question: That's correct, let's say there's FixedFloat, ChangeNow, and Coinbase (I wouldn't adopt Coinbase, just an example of a CEX) available to trade for BTC/USDT. My exchange would say that FixedFloat is offering $1 in BTC for 0.98 USDT, ChangeNow is offering $1 in BTC for 0.975 USDT, and Coinbase is offering $1 in BTC for 0.89 USDT. Let's also say that the user had a bad experience in the past using FixedFloat, so they decide to use ChangeNow. This means that they know how much USDT they are receiving, and which partner they are connecting to in order to preform an exchange from a partner.2nd Question: By exchange data, I mean the rate the exchange is offering, and the address to send it to (and so on). I should have been more clear there, I won't collect any PII like IP addresses.3rd Question: I will not be using any exchanges (unless there is a way to do this legally and safely, and people would like to have those exchanges as an option, CEXs that is) that require KYC or disallow 3rd party payments via API endpoints. DEXs and no-KYC instant exchanges would be the only exchanges avaliable. In the future, I might possibly add functionality for a user to use our site (for fee calculation, maybe an easier UI to use) to connect their API keys to the exchange's API to preform trades. Those keys wouldn't be stored, only as an ease-of-use feature (although I am not sure there is any demand for that).",

Actually it's not correct to do that, maybe you can improve in this feedback part?It's simular to BestChange, but also way differnet than what they're doing. BestChange is a directory of exchange rates and payment methods, which takes you to third-party sites where you can exchange your crypto. BestChange doesn't facilitate trades on their site, which is what I'm doing. My site connects to the third-party exchange and fetches fee information for that specific amount, not a general $1 USD value. They also don't seem to have the best exchanges listed (ones I've either never heard of, or don't seem trustworthy to me) for exchanging crypto-to-crypto. I also plan to allow fiat-to-crypto exchanges through LocalX (X being the crypto, like LocalBitcoins, or LocalMonero) to make it easy to see rates and do trades on one platform.Don't get me wrong, BestChange seems like an awesome site, but I also noticed that when browsing their site a while ago, which concerned me too. I plan to upload feedback to IPFS to make sure the reviews can't be skewed in my favor, or in favor of another exchange. Reviews (on any site) I am always wary of, you never know what people's motives are for leaving reviews, so hopefully the power of IPFS might fix that solution, and my site can help easily browse the feedback on third-party exchanges, and my exchange as a whole.Thanks for the feedback!",

This means, if a corrupt government was looking for who is exchanging so much money to privacy coins on FixedFloat, they will go to FixedFloat asking \"Let's see a copy of your logs, we want to investigate the largest transaction volume from your exchange on each wallet.\" FixedFloat (if they complied) would provide (presumably) transaction details, IP address, and location data (possibly) to the government. They have no clue what country made the transaction since thousands of transactions have the same IP address. Therefore, the transaction origin is obfuscated, except for the obviously logged transaction details (only sent to FixedFloat, we don't store it as of now).If you have any further ideas for privacy, I'd love to hear them!",
