First, I wanted to know if other Binance users also got this promotional email or if is it only exclusive to me ( as it is mentioned as Your Exclusive Reward)Secondly, upon deposit of any 10$ worth crypto, it will get activated or there are any pre-requisites to avail of this offer?",

      "body": "It is another marketing trick, they reduce the fees by a certain percentage and for a certain period to force you to do the trading in that period which means that more liquidity will appear as if it interacts in the platform which is wrong.If you do not need to trade, do not make a deposit to benefit from the 30% discount, you cannot withdraw that money and it is a discount that they may manipulate because most of us do not check the fees that we pay.",

      "body": "Technically, it is indeed exclusive in the sense that they seem to have sent it out to a group of users. However, knowing how generous binance is when it comes to their vouchers. My theory is there's a good chance it's just on rotation, which means at some point everyone will receive more or less the same voucher and perhaps with a slightly different marketing email content- if any.In any case, I highly suggest reading the 'voucher rules' on 'rewards hub' before pulling the trigger to make sure you're able to meet the required conditions.edit: grammar",

      "body": "I always get to check my vouchers and these offers on my account but unluckily, I don't have these good offers so it's certainly for some users that have Binance has to offer it. Maybe not right now on my bracket but soon I might get to see some interesting offers because I've still got some but I have no interest on them as it's not enticing as this one. So, those little offers and vouchers that they have on my account just expires so that's maybe a factor why I don't get to receive like this one.",

I agree that they should keep a time limit but 10 days are not enough for low volume traders. I wished they should keep this active for at least a month or so",

I wished they should keep this active for at least a month or I understand it differently, they are trying to say that there are high trading volumes, many users deposit their money, and there is no wash trading or fake bots but active users who trade, this increase in trading activity generates profits for them more than 30$ Fee rebate that they will give you knowing that you will not be able to withdraw That 30 bucks. If they give you a week or a month, they are the winners.",
