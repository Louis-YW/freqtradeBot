  "content": "How is it possible to change a topic into self-moderated retrospectively? Would be useful for some existing topics, which got spammy over time after a few dozen pages. And sometimes, I just miss to select self-moderated and don’t know how to change it after the topic is created. I’ve tried to find it, didn’t see any option. Editing a topic doesn’t offer that option currently, which is very weird and tiresome. Same applies for adding polls retrospectively. I don't find where we can enable it after a topic has been created / for existing topics...Edit after a few confusions: When a topic would be changed to self-moderated, all the comments left before should get treated as it has been before (not possible to be removed). It's just about the new comments coming after the topic gets changed, which would be self-moderated. Because when a topic is changed to self-moderated retrospectively, our message \"self-moderated topic\" would be displayed and everyone would see it.",

Wow, sad to hear...So, once a topic is created it can get filled with spam and we can't prevent that, we are just dependent on moderators deleting it?

Quote from: hosseinimr93 on March 04, 2023, 08:16:13 PMThe poster has the right to know if his/her post can be deleted by the topic starter when making the post. I can agree here but that could be solved by making it possible for the OP to delete only posts which were made after the topic gets changed to self-moderated. Easy solution in my opinion. No need to disable a change towards self-moderation retrospectively. Same goes for adding polls.

But I haven't found a case like this done before, or maybe I've missed it. Interesting idea, maybe I'll PM a moderator to ask if it's possible and an appropriate solution. Or a moderator can reply here if it's possible. Most likely, approving such request has a high chance to decrease work for moderators overally, if that's possible for moderators to change it manually. Of course, having such an option available in our edit settings would be the best solution that all comments made from that point of time are self-moderated.
