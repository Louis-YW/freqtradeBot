      "body": "I am confused as to the reason for you posted this wonderful poem on the altcoin board. Your poem needs to be on the Bitcoin board as it is the right place for it. The Altcoin board is for other cryptocurrencies and not Bitcoin-based topics. Since you have written this poem dedicated to Satoshi I think you should move it on the Bitcoin board. It would be great if someone here or the OP added music and a soothing voice to this ode. As for me, I do not have any knowledge on music and neither can I sing.",
