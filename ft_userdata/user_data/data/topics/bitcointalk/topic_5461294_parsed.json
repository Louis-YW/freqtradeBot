Go to the local bank or wait for the insurance to pay you. Don't you know anyone in real life? Like don't you have a brother, sister, uncle, cousins or even a good neighbor?",

If so.. How many attempts have you tried now?Please stop. Spend all this time on find a job or do some work instead, I think it so strange that new people comming here like 1-3 times every week with an amazing story, why just here?

      "body": "Well, these are these curious stories that we see around here, in which I think that the person who asks for the loan does it like someone who buys a lottery ticket, the probability that you win is 0 by mathematical approximation, but it doesn't cost you much effort or time to write a shitty post asking for the money. As CYBER_COWBOY says, you can give the repair company the advance that the insurance has given you, let them go to work and when the rest of the insurance money arrives, pay them the rest. The company is not going to ask for everything in advance. And even you needed the money so urgently, it would be more logical for you to get the money from your bank.Anyway, in these cases, the simplest explanation is the real one, and that is that it is a crude attempt to keep $10K and not show up here again.",
