  "content": "Society is  the basis upon which human civilization is created. It is our collective ideas that shape our lives, governs our behaviour and provide us with a sense of belongings. As such, it's important we take steps to better our society, let's create a world that is fairer, more equitable for everyone.One of the key ways in which we can better society is by promoting education. Education is the foundation upon which every great society is built. It empowers individuals, brings up creativity and innovation and cultivates critical thinking skills. For example, it's the innovative and creative idea of Satoshi Nakamoto that we enjoy bitcoin today. Let the government invest in education from the earliest years of life through adulthood by providing opportunities for lifelong learning.Another way in which we can better society is by promoting diversity and inclusion. Society is stronger when it embraces diversity and recognizes the unique contributions of all individuals. We must work to eliminate discrimination and promote equal opportunities for all. This means creating workplaces, schools, and communities that are welcoming to people of all backgrounds and cultures. By embracing diversity and inclusion, we can create a more vibrant and harmonious society.Let love lead at all time! Peace!",

Peace!I don't dispute anything you have said, education and equality are very important to build a just and egalitarian society. But the problem we have is politicians. They have failed to invest in quality education in my country because their children school abroad. Politicians prefer to loot funds for their future generations instead of investing in the future of the nation. The same politicians promote tribalism and racism because they want to divide the people. A divided people can be easily manipulated and controlled. Until we embrace critical thinking and stop judging people by their physical appearance the world will not be a better place. It is possible to reduce inequality and poverty if the world's top economy nations are committed to them.",

As per my view not only our leaders are responsible for the better society, Any good society depends on the lifestyle of that society. What constitute a society is coming together of many families including fathers, mothers and children, now if every parents can say \"change begins with me\" and it is effective than leaders of the society can have a say. Parents have a lot of roles to play in times of a better society, that is upbringing of their children. After all this have been taking care of then the next is education comes second, it is important for a parent to take their children to school so that they can know the advantage of been educated.",

Because everyone that does all of it should apply it first to themselves because we're seeing people that have been too vocal about changes for the betterment but later on, we're seeing that they're the ones that are not following their advice. They're good leaders based on how they talk but they're not good followers because they're also the ones that violate what's being taught. And when you think that you're spotless then that's the time to stand on your own by contributing in helping others.",

One of the the major thing is to love one another, because where their is no love Thier is no peace, and our society can not be better when there is no peace, and that is way there is law to govern us  by restricting us from harming or let's use the word damage our society,  because without law I don't think there is ever going to be a better society, and here is comes to the political leaders we elect into power, they have a bigger role to play in making out society better. But most of out leader are just selfish instead of working towards the betterment of the society they are busy working towards the better of there bank account and their families. So in making our society a better place I think it all comes from the kind of leaders we elect into power.",

The aspiration to establish a more equitable world for all has been a fundamental desire of the natural world. However, the presence of human beings, each with unique perspectives and mindsets, makes achieving such a world incredibly challenging, if not impossible. I firmly believe that in order to cultivate a society that benefits everyone, it is crucial to uphold the principles of our laws, demonstrate respect for diverse opinions, and acknowledge the right of others to live according to their desires.",

Yes, I agree that every macro effect that you want to see which in this case on the society should always start on micro efforts by making ourselves be the good example to everyone through being a better one. We as a citizen have the responsibility on our society and if we want it to be a progressive one, we should always strive to do the common good while making yourself a better version. Even the tiny effort would be a great way to be better, just don't stop striving.

Once this is happening kids will have excitement and joy on going to school since the subject they are taking are what they want to learn and interested. Honestly speaking since I already finished college and know what the kids will going through in their education journey, I can say its really hard to learn things we are not interested. Its like we are just doing for the compliance purpose and not to learn. Education is very important yes that is given, but one thing also must not forget is to teach young student good ethics.

Government are like showing that you can speak what you want to say but after they hearing your side and they know that its against them, its where violence starts. Days will pass and you will shock on the news that the person who spoken what he feel that is wrong against politicians was murdered by unknown people. Hope this ends soon and I hope we truly reached the true freedom we all looking for.",
