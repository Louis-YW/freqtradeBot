I know in crypto world, it will be easy to access my money but the issue is, will my money be same value when I invest all of it in bitcoin .Because literally in banking system for example, if you have $5000 that will be the value in 3 to 5 months and will add a little interest in it so my question is-  I don't fully know how bitcoin works.

However, if you have 1 Bitcoin, and don't add to that it's going to stay at 1 Bitcoin forever. Technically, Bitcoin is deflationary in the long term, and you could probably make the a somewhat confident assumption that it will continue to rise in terms of Bitcoin to fiat valuation. However, most interest on fiat currencies isn't worth it anyway, and usually the inflation rate is higher than the interest rate so you aren't gaining anything to begin with. If interest rates is what's keeping your money in the bank, I'd reconsider as it's worthless. Interest rate means absolutely nothing unless you have a ton of money which can make a whole lot of money in a year or so.",

In the next year your will earn $20 interest from your $5,000, so it would be $5,020. But the value of your $5,020 isn't same like $5,000, it might already become $4,970.

So, if you live somewhere which Bitcoin is popular in you can probably get by. Potentially, renting or mortgages would be the only limiting factors. The CBN recently rolled out new cash/withdrawal policies, this created cash scarcity and restrictions to physical cash use, not to get into too much details but it has resulted in hardship for the people of Nigeria. Of course this is a very good reason to use Bitcoin, because with Bitcoin no institution can restrict your money: it is permissionless, but how do you spend Bitcoins in Nigeria, it is almost impossible, you can't find merchants that accept Bitcoin for payment, and if you want to convert your Bitcoin to cash through P2P, you receive your fiat in your bank account, and face the same problem over again. OP is considering converting all their money to circumvent this problem, but it doesn't solve it because they still do not have cash. What OP should is to convert a part of their money to Bitcoin and leave the rest of it in their bank for spending.Quote from: Welsh on March 03, 2023, 12:29:31 PMI think I'd prefer to hold my wealth in my hands, than a bank that's rejecting access to your money.

We share absolutely the same view, i was only pointing it out to OP that converting all their money into Bitcoin doesn't solve the issue of available cash for spending in Nigeria. Do not forget that the only restriction here is on physical cash use, you can use mobile transfer to nearly an unlimited amount, but the banking network is usually a problem and quite a lot of merchants prefer payment with cash.",

In my country, we have various digital fiat wallet that doesn't necessarily rely on banks to process the transaction. I'm somewhat surprised that it is not the same there since online payment has become popular. Not the ideal solution but can be an alternative for small spending, definitely don't use them to store most of your money though. If Bitcoin stores are easily accessible, this would be the best time to use them for daily needs.Quote from: Plaguedeath on March 03, 2023, 12:39:49 PMBitcoin doesn't work like that because Bitcoin isn't Proof Of Stake, it's Proof Of Work where there's a maximum supply.

How easy or hard it is to change will depend on many things, including but not limited to community consensus, how distributed the network control is, etc. Even if you hold PoS coins/tokens, you also need to do something if you want passive income.",

If you were in a country where most businesses have no issues accepting Bitcoin as a payment option,then I would say you should go ahead but this is not the case in Nigeria. In Nigeria one of the aims of the new cash redesign policy according to the Central Bank of Nigeria is a  cashless economy. This hasn't been achieved because we still have people who are unbanked, our bank internet servers needs to be upgraded to handle several requests and many more. Besides not everyone uses or accepts Bitcoin I'm exchange for goods or services. In my estimation, it is about 0.1% of the population that do.So before you make the big move, ask yourself- how many businesses would accept Bitcoin for payment? - would I need to convert my Bitcoin into cash, the Nigerian currency before I can make any purchase?- can I pay the cab/Uber driver in cash?The answer to the question will tell you what to do.What I will tell you is to put some percentage in Bitcoin, some percentage in precious metals, in real estate and in stocks(if you wish).

I know in crypto world, it will be easy to access my money but the issue is, will my money be same value when I invest all of it in bitcoin .Bitcoin investing plans are always admirable.  But before investing in Bitcoin you must understand its risks and find a good non-custodial or a hardware wallet and store it there. And of course you need to hold those bitcoins for a long time otherwise you won't get very good profit from here and you may face loss as well.  Because Bitcoin will not guarantee you this profit all the time. To get profit from this you must hold it for long timeQuoteBecause literally in banking system for example, if you have $5000 that will be the value in 3 to 5 months and will add a little interest in it so my question is-  I don't fully know how bitcoin works. Is it the same way with the banking system? Will I get more value or less value in future times?When you deposit money in a bank, it is held as collateral and you can withdraw it whenever you want without any loss. And after a certain period of time the bank gives you interest at a certain percentage rate but in case of Bitcoin your money will never be stable like the bank. If you keep your money on Bitcoin then your money can decrease or increase every moment, as if you buy shares of a company from the stock market, if the price of that company's shares increases, then you will profit and if the price decreases, then you will lose, in this case, the price of your shares will never be stable.  Similarly with bitcoin investing your money will not be stable it will always go up and down so if you keep your money on bitcoin for long time in this case you will have high profit potential. i am not giving you any financial advice. so do anything from your own research",
