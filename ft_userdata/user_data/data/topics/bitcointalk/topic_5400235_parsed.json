I have a mobile GPU that's working perfectly but the Laptop I removed the GPU from is dead. There are no mobile graphics cards for modern laptops. The video chip is installed on the laptop motherboard.I've seen PC graphics cards from China that used a video chip from a broken laptop.This was relevant before the hacking of the LHR algorithm. You can sell your video chip, but you can't make a video card out of it at home.",

If you really want to mine now, then buy a small mining farm in an open case.",

Yes this is actually possible and this device was created maybe like 10 years ago however nobody bought it because it would be a hassle to have to carry the device along with the GPU around with a laptop. You might as well get a PC in this case.Then gaming laptops came out and this device had even less of a market. It also wasn‚Äôt cheap and you can only attach one GPU.",

There is two version of this available in the market right now, one is egpu with thunderbolt 3 compatible, the laptop must be thinderbolt 3 compatible as well, the other is modification of desktop GPU with its own PSU and a connector going to the laptop.But using these makes a laptop not a laptop anymore, you cant carry this around so it doesn't make sense to me, better off with a monitor and gpu in a motherboard/desktop PC.",
