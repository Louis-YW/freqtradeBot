In the beginning most people failed to take the risk on investing in bitcoin because they feel it wouldn't survive but bitcoin proved many of them wrong due to the problem it is solving in the world, which made people see its potentials and started adopting it making the price to increase in value.The fact is that, if you cannot beat them, you join them. Thi is why you see that even the people that have criticized bitcoin before has no option than to join the moving train because they don't want to be left out. Banks started failing and fiat depreciating, investors started diversifying their wealth into bitcoin to safe the value of their wealth and bitcoin didn't disappoint them. If you don't have any bitcoin investment yet, learn from that guy in the OP.",

It's inspiring to think about the potential for the future. Here's to hoping for continued growth and adoption!",

Uncertain is very high on those years when the majority don't trust internet assets that were new to everybody. So, those that have held for so long and are enjoying the profits now, they deserve it. They've taken the bashing of many about Bitcoin being a fraud, a scam, and any other negative characteristics that they've thrown to the early adopters. There are too many stories like that in the image and I can remember one who's Greg Schoen who have also bought bitcoin on the cheapest few bucks price but sold them eventually at little profit to losses.",

I thought it was already suspiciously expensive (when the price was in the range of hundreds of dollars), and I didn't believe something purely digital could be considered real money and have real value. And that was years later than the guy in the tweet. It's understandable that it was a different time when it wasn't easy to believe in something so different from the rest of money and the rest of the asset market as well. What's important is to learn from mistakes. Both our own and those of others.",

I could not find anything else that may imply that he has bought bitcoin but in 2021 he replied to the exact picture OP posted with a sad face. So, we can assume that he did learn his lesson and now regrets not buying bitcoin at that time.QuoteOne thing I have come to discover and I want you to understand is that the next best time is now. Being skeptical about Bitcoin from the time you heard it isn't a bad thing, infact I encourage everyone not to go head first into something because many people are backing it especially in finance.I do understand the skepticism though. Back then they did not have the historical data to prove or at least allow them to estimate future prices the way we do now. Crypto was very new back then and not everyone would have imagined for it to reach this high back then. But now with the rise of tech and crypto industry, no need to skeptical anymore and just buy bitcoin the moment the best possible entry to the market opens up for you.",

So don't laugh or look down on those who have underestimated bitcoin in the past because I bet if you were in his position, you would not invest in bitcoin either or even despise it because at that time it really had no value. We are in bull season right now and making profits is quite easy so there are many newbies making very bold claims like you. But I wouldn't be surprised if you don't make a profit in this bull cycle and exit bitcoin when the bear season hits.",

Many of them mined and had them sitting in some wallets. Some bought very early when it had not much value from those that were either scared of Hodling or probably felt it was a waste of time. Either way only a few persons held because they believed for sure that bitcoin will be this big someday.The truth is that even for some persons that saw potential in bitcoin, many didn't imagine it to be this big today that's because if they did most of them would have bought more obviously.

But no one will know what will happen with the future especially to Bitcoin. That is happened to some people who knew about Bitcoin in that year or before that year. But they didn't trying to buy Bitcoin and say that Bitcoin will scam you. Well, that is okay if they say like that but they will regret if they see what happen to Bitcoin. Maybe we are regret not to invest in the beginning but that will not be a problem because we can still invest in Bitcoin now even if the price is at $81k. That is because considering of Bitcoin price can increase more than $81k so we can buy Bitcoin by allocating some money.",

Now that bitcoin prices are going up, do you think we will see $200,000 when the next halving happens?",

From the history, that poster was an old influencer and they can post anything for attention. Don't be surprised if he owns thousands of dollars in bitcoin now.

However, I donât think this person is still seeing bitcoin as a mess until now, because just like anyone else, everyone is craving to invest in bitcoin, knowledge and sufficient funds are the keys. Otherwise, if you keep missing bitcoin investment, then you will never experience what it takes to be a successful bitcoin investor and enjoy all its benefits and advantages.",

Maybe he realised bitcoin wasn't really a mess and later invested. 2011 was quite too early for anyone to really have faith in Bitcoin. Most of us here now would have said same about bitcoin considering the value of bitcoin as at that time. I do not blame those early guys for being ignorant, I'm sure some of them realised earlier and are here now. Those I would really be laughing at are those who are currently seeing the massive progress bitcoin is getting and still doubting the authencity of bitcoin.
