  "content": "In this Post I am discussing about 3 types of People. I don't belong to any category. I belong to the category of persons who doesnâ€™t think CBDC as cryptocurrencies .In the case of CBDCs against cryptocurrencies, there are 3 different categories of people. This categories are for people who think CBDC are cryptocurrencies and aganist to it.CATEGORY A: these people belive that CBDCs are a threat to cryptocurrencies and can displace them. This is because cryptocurrencies are known to be highly volatile and thereby unstable.CATEGORY B: these ones see CBDCs as governments' futile attempt to end cryptocurrencies. CATEGORY C: these ones don't care about the \"fight.\" They accept whichever one succeeds in the long run.Which category do you belong in?ðŸ™ƒAlso, do you think crypto and CBDCs can co-exist without being a threat to each other?ðŸ¤”",

It's a coin that pegged with fiat, so it doesn't make sense if CBDC replace stable coin since both of them have stable price.B: Government can ban the whole coins if they don't like it, any centralized coins will be gone since they don't have any way to trade. While Bitcoin due to decentralized, you can trade via P2P or with decentralized exchange.C: That's a person who doesn't have any cryptos since he don't care with the price.",

I don't think you are going to find those people you are looking for here because we all understand what CBDC is and can never be compared to Cryptocurrency because all here know crypto. I believe your research population shouldn't be within the forum and for those people that would think along your line of question, it will be because they don't know and understand cryptocurrency and it could happen that the Government is able to convince them of CBDC which by the way is the same as the Fiat currency but just in digital form.",

However if you consider altcoins including stable coins are centralized, CBDCs are more centralized than stable coins.So choose to use CBDCs or choose stable coins to use, you can do it based on what you like most, centralized totally (CBDCs) and less centralized (stable coins). CBDCs are more affected by policies from governments.",

If they have any potential I might get some, but it completely depends on how their are used and what advantages they give me over bitcoin if any. Beyond that I would belong to category C, don't care about what news comes up, I will buy Bitcoin when it goes down and sell when it goes up, banking the profit.Thinking about what can happen in future will only stop your current attempts to trade, so better focus on the current market and forget about CBDCs.",

I do not place myself in any of these proposed three categories. Of course, government CBDCs cannot be classified as cryptocurrencies. This is an improved version of government cashless payments. States will issue them not because of fighting with cryptocurrency, but in order to improve the efficiency of the banking system. Therefore, CBDCs are not in direct competition with cryptocurrencies, however, they will be such competition for private and other non-state stablecoins.",
