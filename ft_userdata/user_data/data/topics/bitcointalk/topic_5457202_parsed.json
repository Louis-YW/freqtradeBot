From the transaction status it's showing success only remaining to be received at your own end.But just in case it persist beyond 24hrs you can ask the sender to resend the transaction again but this time with a more considerable high fee cause atimes these delay could be due to the transaction fee amount.You can go through this thread below for more help.  QuoteAll about \"stuck\" transactions and what you can do to fix themhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1802212.msg17954548#msg17954548",

Why not 12 hours or 48 hours? The transaction has been already confirmed and it doesn't matter how much fee has been paid for that.

And you also mentioned it's the exchange wallet so you own the exchange or part of being exchange should have better wallet service with no issues like this in future.",
