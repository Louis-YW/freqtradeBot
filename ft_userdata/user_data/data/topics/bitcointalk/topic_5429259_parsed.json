BTC has proven to be an insulator in itself. And I think that it is good...as if it is setting up or laying the ground for a near-term big pump. Yes, there is a big possibility that in the first quarter of 2023 we can see BTC crossing the $30K line, unless of course something can happen to shake the whole industry like for instance the collapse of another major crypto platform.",

Many theorists are out there and would say one thing or the other about BTC, one should only be careful and perform their own studies regularly too. And based on my trading experience, what Micheal van de Poppe relies on is a swing cycle on a certain higher chart, and it often works.Regardless, I conclude by my analysis that BTC has bottomed already, I don't see it breaking $15,000 any time soon, and it might reach as high as $35,000 in 2023.",

It is a sub-forum called Speculation - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=57.0feel free to post your price speculations there. Although without a more in depth analysis explanation I doubt that anybody will take your prediction very seriously. I would recommend you add charts and serious sources as well as explaining your logic in a more detailed fashion.Having said that, I strongly believe that Bitcoin will be over 100k in the near future. A lot of people here think the same and they have even provided reasons why it will be so. My favorite chart which points towards 100k is the logarithmic chart.",

And to be honest, as this thing is really trending everywhere, so this will ultimately lead to the price rise of Bitcoins. It’s already seen that Bitcoins are moving up in their prices when December started. If it keeps the same pace and ends at December, then definitely new year will be really big for Bitcoins and all the Bitcoin holders. Let’s hope for the best and buy as many Bitcoins as we can in this bear time, and let’s wait for new year.",

These happenings that effected the market were all unforeseen by these spectators so tell me how were they able to speculate or rather predict the price of btc in a short while",

I wouldn't consider it this year because we are already ending it but there are some predictions who are specific and is pointing out about this month of December. $30k was only small in my opinion so it won't take 2024 to be able to see this but maybe we can achieve this in the early quarter of 2023.2024 is the halving time for BTC and everyone is expecting a massive gain during that time. I think BTC is already over $69k once we get there. We reached $18k last time and it wasn't far from $17k so obviously, it will always fall back there, if there are no positive movements. It's not a big loss. Price can fall but it doesn't mean it will never recover again.",

Sure 30k is not a big deal if we ever reach bull run, because we skyrocket very quickly and those prices could be reached, but it doesn't mean that it is a guaranteed thing, it will take some time before we could reach that bull run, it's not happening anytime soon by the looks of it.",

But if he thinks this will happen this year, that is gonna be impossible. Even reaching too $25 is hard but saying that Bitcoin will reach $20k this year, that was very close to reality ( and we are very close to that). Anyways, anyone can make their own speculations and market assumptions. However, it was not the thing we believe because, in reality, nobody would have the crystal ball to see where the price of Bitcoin goes. And they all just fail.",

Though I believe that in Mid 2023, we will start the recovery because the hype for the halving will start again and that could trigger the bull trend. If Bitcoin will still hit another bottom, we can expect a huge buying power at that level and for sure we will not stay longer on that bottom price.",
