Thanks!Â Â  Howdy and I hope you do win!Â Â  Â  These 3D coins I am giving away are coins printed without the indent in the back so they were kinda like a test run and also extras I have that I rather give away than hodl onto them...and no most do not have residue on them...yet I will be throwing a peeled hologram in there with the coin itself as I have plenty of experimental peeled holograms!Â Â  Â  And yes, I made 50 of these...all funded with 10,000 Satoshi and also included under the hologram each has a unique NFT with the BTC addy on the NFT coin.Â Â  Â  Â I gave some away to friends and also sodl some as well.Â Â  Â  Â Will not be making anymore as they took alot of effort and time to design...create the NFT...load and assemble...etc etc etc as well.Â Â  Â  Â Hope that answers your questions!",
