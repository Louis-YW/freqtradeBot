This piece is quite unique one of a kind as you know so its hard for me to put a price tag on it. I know what I paid in 2014 but now after 8 years its worth much more I guess. What you guys think any sugestions ?",

Move this topic into Collectibles ( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=217.0 ) [the bottom-left link should work], those guys know this and some may not care of anything else from this forum.",
