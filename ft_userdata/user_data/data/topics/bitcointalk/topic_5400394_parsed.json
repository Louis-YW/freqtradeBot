But eventually, if you're thinking of long term with them, that's the bigger question because most likely everyone is going to dispose them and ignore after the hype's gone and they're all done. Should you buy it, be careful of what you're doing because you don't know if the trading goes back for it, everyone is going to act very fast for their own gains and positions.",

Avoid the new one entirely because it is an attempt to bail out the owners of the original coin at your expense. As soon as you put a dollar in, they'll pull a dollar out hoping to recoup a few percent of their original investment. Trust me you don't want to be the guy supply capital to a dead coin.",

The airdrop will give free money for people. If you will be owning both and im sure that if you are also aware about this too. LUNA 2.0 will not the same like what happened with the first luna during its peak performance. LUNA 2.0 will get less trust from the investors and mostly of big companies will never trust this developer who develop luna again. There will be a massive change to happen with the new luna.",

There will be a massive change to happen with the new luna. Probably the value of LUNC will surely plummet really hard after the availability of trading of new LUNA on exchange. I don't know what would be the purpose of LUNC since there is already a new one so there is also a probability that they will dispose of it, or use it as cash milking since they will also take advantage of it. And, I think that new investors will buy this new Luna 2.0 to take advantage of the market since a lot of old investors/holders will dump their LUNC and LUNA after the airdrop.",

Luna 2 tries to improve on the stablecoin algorithm but of course everyone still associates Luna 2 with the classic Luna which is a bad thing because of what happened.",

I think peoples trust on LUNA ecosystem has been seriously eroded. It will take years to rebuild the trust. While they may be conducting airdrop, people are only seizing the opportunity to grab the tokens and will likely sell off quickly when opportuned. It will no longer be the same. To a some extent, the image of the Luna team as well as the founder, Do Kwon, has also been dented. People may need to take precaution in projects the team members are involved in.",
