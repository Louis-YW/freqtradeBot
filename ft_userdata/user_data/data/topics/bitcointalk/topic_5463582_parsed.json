Is there any difference between shitposting and spamming?Since the quote is mentioning Karma I believe it's from reddit, so when I was still hanging on Reddit, shitposting was a little bit different from what is considered as spamming in this forum. Spamming in Bitcointalk is (IMO CMIIW) when a user posting a one liner meaningless reply repeatedly to many posts/thread. While a shitpost in reddit is replying to a post with some offensive opinion that the shitposter think it's funny when someone is triggered  by his post, more like trolling. This kind of practice paying someone to shitpost is not very rare I think on reddit, place is full of shitpost actually.",

Now that those whose habits are hard to change have a place to breed, they can get paid for posting trash every day.

Shitposting is all about posting content that has low value or no value at all or you can say that a person is posting gibberish that doesn't contribute to anything at all. 2.) How to tell if it is a shitpost is explained above which is about the post having very low quality or no value at all. 3.) The difference between the two is that spamming is about posting in a row meanwhile shitposting is about posting low quality posts. Anyway, some posts when a person is spamming could be of good quality but it is posted right after or before a post that has been posted not long ago. One more thing, doing both won't do any good for your acoount and for yourself. Also, many people doesn't like that or doesn't want that where almost all of it are reported to mods and get deleted. Hope that will explain something to you OP.",

Anywhere you see shit posting; it simply means that the hiring project does not care the manner of approach you take to market their links, or presales or services; they just want their project name, links etc plastered all over reddit. No constructive post is needed; no sanity is needed; just post every topics or threads or comments about their services thats all. Quote 2. What should we check out for in a post, such that when we see it we can confidently call the post a shit postShit-posting are easy to identify. 1. Off topic - either you are talking about A or B or Z; they do not care; they simply copy and paste their contents.2. They are usually a one line or one sentence comments/posts with links etc 3. They are easily identifiable because the sentence means nothing. 4. They are most likely spamming in numbers (more than 1 comments). Quote3. Is there any difference between shitposting and spamming?There is a thin line difference; but i am not sure if it means much anyway. In a shitpost; there is a target audience; it could be a presale post, or crypto community or football community or a metaverse subreddit / topic. Meanwhile for spamming; it doesn't matter if its a political post or crypto or religious post; they post their contents everywhere n large numbers.",

Because no genuine project will hire shitposters. And they don't care if your account is getting banned or locked. So never do this types of jobs and always be effective and work in a legit way.

Someone spitting facts here. Well, I was also a bounty hunter and experienced the whole journey but left it due to a lot of scams like managers already writing in there a policy that they are not going to be responsible for payout because that's in the hands of the team. This means the risk is 50-50. So I left.Not, as OP was saying shitposting is banned here on btt but that specific person was asking someone to do that on Reddit so I think that's ok to do. And the posts that bounty hunters used to make do not exactly come under the category of Shitposting if they do their work right. Because when you just shitpost most of the good managers like Cryptobrainbross (I think I spelled it wrong) etc. are good at catching shitposter even they do not pay those hunters and also ban them after warnings too. Well, I don't know if they are bringing any bounties now but back then they brought some good projects.",
