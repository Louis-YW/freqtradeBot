It's always good to see people's different opinion concerning issues like this. All this years, I have not been paying attention to the bitcoin price movement but am following this one bumber to bumber. I just hope this is not a bull trap and it can pick up some momentum before the 2024 halving kicks in.",

Then I noticed a sudden market dip from no where which I have no knowledge came in and everywhere turned red to extend I lost interest to continue anything about bitcoin. After some while market started getting back it feet's from where it was.Then I never knew that Bitcoin could turn out this way and be very high at it price, though if I knew then I would have invested with my entire savings in as much it would yield a meaningful results.But something very important, it was from this forum I began to understand how bitcoin works, in fact here was an eye opener to me. I began to learn more things.Talking about your topic, normally I don't think your topic belong here rather moving it to speculation board, but somehow permitted because it's in local board, and I must say any one is permitted to create a topic in this our local board about price speculation of any other currencies including bitcoin. You can't stop people not to talk about bitcoin price.",

Your very correct many saying at Bitcoin have deprived some investors and encourage some two who surmond courage to invest despite prediction of rising and falling in the time past and this present situation, there is one thing I see is that risk taken is very important in some aspects because it will some time move one to another level though is a two sidedÂ  my experience of inability to take risk deprived me to missed alot I would have achieved by now",

The rising of the price dey sweet for belle but the rising of the transaction fee nai come spoiled everything in this period like dis. If to say di price e dey normal like before as the price dey rise men people for enjoy am well well. Di volatile movement nai dey help people well well too because when do price come down, people wey no fit buy plenty when do price high go dey buy more to hodle at that time. And now dat price is wavering from $36k to $37k is still a good time to aquire more and store dem in the wallet dey wait for the real bull market. I am also predicting dat at si end of this year im go fit reached $40k or more sef. So if you buy now you go still get small things.",

Those wey don dey hold since 2018 go fit testify say this matter na real one.

Anyway, just as mate talk as the price go up I still like am but the mempool congestion wey come increase transaction na disadvantage for one side and na also advantage for another angle because, when you reason the duration before your transaction go confirm for the block chain and the fee wey you go pay for you to even do transaction go dey fear you some times. Click image for sourceAs e don be make we no rush sell our coins oo, because halving na next year, after halving comes bull run but before the halving, based on wattin don dey happen before, we go go dey see some kind of increase for the price of bitcoin den, after the halving na there we go fit experience the all time high, though prediction fit no play according but history fit repeat itself.",
