Even if it is 50k it is still going to worth it if you're opting for quality. Another good news is that it's going to bring competition to the industry as most of the internet service providers charge outrageous fees for their poor services. Starlink is not just going to be a competitor, but a pacesetter.

It will solve the regular network challenges that they have because bank matter dey taya person well well. Regardless of the price, banks for this we country go fit afford am unto all the unnecessary charges dem dey take from out account, the money na leanest.",
