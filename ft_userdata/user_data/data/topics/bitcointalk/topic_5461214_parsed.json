The only thing left to do is to update the OP with a better design.",

At the bottom of the page I can also see the text copyright BetFury. All that makes me think this can't possibly be a finished product for your clients.

Pmalek was probably talking about all those typos and spelling issues, which can really turn off potential clients. Most regular folks don't care about the technical stuff on a website; they just want it to look good. That's the whole point of a demo presentation – you've gotta make it shine, or you'll lose a bunch of potential customers in the first few seconds.
