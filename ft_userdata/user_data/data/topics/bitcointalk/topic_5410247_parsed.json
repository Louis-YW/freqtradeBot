      "body": "I really don't get why would bitdice stake their reputation for as small as 8 mBTC. Can you please add some screenshots of your conversation if you don't have a problem sharing? I can see only two images that don't have any discussion between you and their representative. Did they share any reason/potential reason for not sending the withdrawal? They are here for a quite long time and I doubt they have paused the withdrawal without any issue.It would be great if we could hear bitdice side of the story too. You have stated your issue but haven't said if you have done anything wrong which would break their terms and conditions. Let's see what say bitdice has though they aren't active here for quite a long time now.",

Have been playing for more than 2 months. My withdrawal is pending for 2 weeks now. I have contacted them almost every day- although I'm on my vacations; they tell me to keep waiting and yesterday after posting this they told me that they are not scam and I will receive my funds. But at the moment no money have hit my account https://imgur.com/a/qbtAroF",
