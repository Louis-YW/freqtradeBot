The default security features of Android and IOS are both safe. In the end. It all base on how the user use the respective gadget to secure their wallet. Assuming same user will do same thing on both IOS and Android device that will affect the Bitcoin wallet then I think the effect will be same regardless on how secure IOS or Android.",

Similarly, it's estimated that 97% of all malware targets Android users. Why is that? While Apple fans like to point to Android's open source model as the culprit, the truth is that with over 2.5 billion devices in the wild Android simply has a far greater market share than Apple. Naturally, then, hackers will look towards the largest target when crafting their exploits.But if you think installing wallet without need to verify the PGP signature is already enough since you're use iOS, you're wrong because there's no guarantee you will 100% avoid installing a fake wallet.What's the point to compare iOS and Android, when you already know the best one to use?",

Even if you give the most secure wallet to a careless user and give the most insecure wallet to a very carefully user you might be surprised that the insecure will provide more security than that of the most secure wallet, what I'm trying to say it that the person handling the device should also be considered not just the device alone. We have some people that have been using Android wallet and yet haven't experienced any issue with it and also some that have been using iOS and also haven't experienced any with it. I would have chose iOS but because of the slow update it receives I'm going to choose Android and besides I'm currently using an Android phone.",

There is no guarantee one OS is a way safer place to store compared to others. Instead of comparing both of these two, learning how to secure any of the smartphones and basic digital security is way better. And do in mind, that security itself is not just about malware and an OS. Both iOS and Android developers surely compete to secure their own systems.",

Also, you should make sure to use a reputable wallet app and follow best practices for securing your private keys. Therefore, comparing the security of these devices beyond this point is irrelevant, as any security vulnerabilities would likely be the result of bad software or user error rather than inherent weaknesses in the device itself.But, to ensure the highest level of security for storing your Bitcoin, it is recommended to use a hardware wallet instead.",

You can't do anything offline on your IOS and Android apart from playing music and videos or games, you need to always turn on your internet connection and that's where the problem is when it comes to crypto wallet security. If you are using both IOS and Android, be extra careful what you do on them, remember that the internet connection you have on the devices makes them vulnerable to scams and stealing of assets, avoid PMs with links, in emails, or connecting your wallet to the unknown platforms.",

I still wouldn't store too many coins in either of them because regardless of the OS they are using, they are both hot wallets in the end. If you want to store your coins for the long term, then you need to get an offline/cold wallet. I am not going to get into the specifics since there are many tutorials on that subject.How much cash normally you would carry in your physical cash wallet? $200? $500? $1000? Find an answer to this question. If your answer is \"$200\" then this is the amount you should be keeping in your mobile device.",

You can also create another hot wallet in it, with a new seed phrase, so this wallet becomes your online wallet for keeping a small amount of money, less than 50-100 usd for spending when you wish. This way you don't have to worry about the OS of the device you are using, whichever it is, you are using it in the correct way and in a safe enviroment, so the chances of you losing your money is small.",

If you set up a wallet on a new or formatted device that is airgapped and never connected on the internet, it has the same security as a hardware wallet, just that it is more difficult to set up and use in a safe enviroment than a hardware wallet.
