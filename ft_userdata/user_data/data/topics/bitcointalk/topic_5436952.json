Latter asked for an extension for up to 31st January 2022. But till now I have not got the repayment. S/he read my message on telegram on march 16th 2022. After that he diable to call him and probably ignored me. Though I can see his online status changed to within a week, recently, etc. But s/he never replied to me.

I don't think leaving neutral feedback when the loan is fully payed and warn other user to be careful to lend money to this user is enough, because he's already lost his reputation and some people might convinced after looking for his positive feedback.",

I agree with you that this amount could be earned with a low effort and at the time of accepting the loan request the user was on a signature campaign. There is nothing happened to the user if there is something with the user then still the telegram is active. If there is something wrong then these accounts might be handled with his/her inheritance. But those people are not aware of the forum account and the way of earning funds from the account. Anyway, the person who is operating the telegram is aware of the scam of this fund.",

Yes I know, sorry if my post was a bit equivocal but it was just an impersonal/generic you, because as you say no one knows what happened actually, so I didn't want to personalize my speech by naming and blaming SiNeReiNZzz specifically. I hope he is ok and he will come back soon to pay back your loan, but people should try to do their best to inform the lender when something is wrong instead of hiding.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_you",
