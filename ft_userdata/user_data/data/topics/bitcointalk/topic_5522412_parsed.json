  "content": "There's a common misconception dominating, that holding bitcoin does not produce anything, and that bitcoiners encourage everyone to put their money on a \"static asset\" that is unproductive to society, instead of putting them somewhere that would fund and allow the production of new goods and services. In other words, holding hard money slows down economic growth. At first glance, the logic may seem sound. But, when examined through the lens of a sound, Austrian economist, it quickly falls apart. Holding bitcoin represents a safeguard against the relentless money printing caused by central banks. Considering that central banks are arguably one of the most harmful institutions ever devised by humanity, it's not only reasonable to assert that bitcoin generates value but also an understatement to merely classify it as a \"good or service\"; bitcoin is the cornerstone of civilization. What exactly does it generate? It lowers humans' time preference. It allows you to transfer value into the future, which as result, makes you less present-oriented. This discount of the present for the future is what has allowed humans to develop capital goods, which have increased economic growth by orders of magnitude over the course of time.  Putting central banks out of business would enormously increase productivity, because fiat currency has encouraged everyone to live fragile lives and discount their future for the present, because the future is always uncertain under a fiat standard!Send it to a no-coiner.",

Moreover, fiat that is not housed in the banks are not excluded from inflation. You keep your fiat under your roof, it is still going to be inflated.With the history of fiat, at a time before it, there was trade by barter and other means until modernity gave birth to fiat. I think the main culprit of fiat is the government, I mean the policies of government that have successfully caused inflation and hyper inflation or maybe it is just the nature of fiat, an inflationary currency. Which means no matter how the government manage it, an addition of printed currency would likely cause a bit of change in economic status quo / inflation and causing the standard of living to drop presumably.Technology and growth have brought decentralised digital currency and also centralised digital currency/cryptocurrency of which the centralised coins still are influenced, disrupted just like fiat. So I don't think bank is the Quotebecause fiat currency has encouraged everyone to live fragile lives and discount their future for the present, reason for this but fiat itself which is inherently inflationary.",

So I will say even if fiat does not exist, bitcoin can still exist. Although it is evolution but when talking about evolution of money, it is good to mention those that existed before fiat like gold.Bitcoin and fiat are not competing. They are alternatives to each other. It is people that should use their brain. Fiat will dominate for local spending because the government can not allow bitcoin usage locally in most countries. But bitcoin remain the superior, investment asset which can hedge against inflation in long term.",

However, as time goes by, the more we’re exposed to fiat, the clearer for us to see that it’s not getting beneficial anymore on our part, especially that its value only depreciates in time. Now, here comes bitcoin which could hedge against inflation. While inflation becomes inevitable, but having maximum amount of bitcoin in our portfolio that we tend to hold longer than fiat, that made us won’t feel the high effects of inflation unlike those fiat holders who are at risk of losing the value of their fiat in the long run.",

Regarding the value proposition you laid for BTC, I find merit in your argument and I have to admit that I have come across these arguments (as anyone who knows BTC) a million times before but the way you contextualized it I think this is my first time.I want to add that IMO the real value of BTC is not in holding and treating it as an asset but rather watching it keep moving in the economy as blood in the human body.",

To gather these resources they need to take them from somewhere. Fiat currency is empirically the most effective weapon that allows them to have infinite resources, by stealing from the people's purchasing power endlessly. When they cannot steal through inflation, the government cannot fund a war forever, and it stops. The same applies to crime. Aside from the fact that central banking is itself criminal, when people adopt a more future-oriented mindset, it significantly shapes their value system.

It will be a great investment if I buy a gold ring or jewellery because it can be worth much more in years to come, but they use the same argument to talk down in bitcoin.It's like the same argument where they say things like \"bitcoin is a scam because it was created out of nothing\".What was fiat made out of? precios stones?

This makes it an excellent investment option imoIt is indeed right. It is just a fact. Bitcoin is not an income producing asset. That doesn’t mean it can’t be a good investment.People can get rich by longing oil in the markets (since it is not really possible to keep oil barrels in a garage or smth) or storing gold in their homes. It happens all the time. All it takes patience and buying it from the right price. (Or long/short it when the time is right)It is pretty much the same with bitcoin.When you buy a company stock you check its ability to make money, its debt amount, cash flow, ratios etc and then you’ll make an educated guess about its future price. Since you are buying it, you think it is cheap at the moment according to its current data and you expect them to be better in the future.When you buy a commodity (which bitcoin also is according to the US), you betting on that the demand for that commodity (bitcoin in this case) will be higher in the future and that demand will drive the prices higher. That kind of thinking assumes that the current market prices are honest and are not being manipulated by somebody.In honest markets an investor with common sense thinks like that.
