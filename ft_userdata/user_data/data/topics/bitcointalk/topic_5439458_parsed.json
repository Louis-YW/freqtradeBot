Maybe but there are better alternatives that does not force you to expose to unlimited risks.@Tytanowy Janusz I understand your concern.My thinking is that Biometric data alone without anything else is OK.The issue with most other projects and even ancestry websites is they also have your other details and this makes you very easy to identify.As long as it’s only Biometric data which will also be encrypted this should not be an issue. The issue is when you combine Biometric data with name, address or any other data which can identify you and is accessible.There is no ICO and no coins provided on 3DPass. If anything there would be a small cost for the computation needed to perform the check and issue the new ID (gas fee). The data is also encrypted so nobody has access to it besides the user.There are too many use cases for a decentralized ID but what I agree with is this will be useless if it’s standalone. It needs to be used as part of Web3 ecosystem whether it’s as part of a Smart Contract, governance or a dApp.",

Definitely not it needs to be simpler.I think the 3DPass approach is simpler for the user. Use the app to scan Biometric data (Transaction fee needed)-> Algorithm checks whether this is new or already on the blockchain --> Decentralized ID is issued or recoveredThat's it One downside that I just thought about on trustless decentralized identity solutions is age verification. I'm sure in the future age verification will be needed to access age appropriate dApps. This issue seems very difficult to tackle in a decentralized manner.",

I asked this question to the dev team and there is no storage. All processing is done locally using RAM only as mentioned in the white paper Data Privacy section. On the official app the storage can of course be prevented but users MUST not store this locally anywhere.Also it goes without saying that the device should not be compromised.Once the HASH ID is generated this is protected by cryptographic standard SHA-2.",

Humans are very good at making work arounds. Even if you used all 10 fingers people would generate a second ID with their toes  But at least we limit it to two IDs per person minus anyone who of course sells their decentralized ID.",

Just like with every crypto wallet. But that's probably not what you wanted to ask, but how idena deals with the fact that one person has multiple nodes. Its the turing test i was talking about before. Its not a \"some CAPTCHAs\". Its 6 logic puzzles that you have to solve. This test is performed simultaneously for the entire network and short session last only 2 minutes. So there is no way to validate more than 1 identity. Well you can try with 2-3 but sooner or later you will run out of time and fail valition loosing stake and identity.

They tried to aim for a sweet spot. Validation each day is cool because new members can join right away but from the other hand old members needs to spend 30 min each day instead of once every 20 days.Quote from: Cee2 on February 12, 2023, 09:42:02 AMMy thinking is that Biometric data alone without anything else is OK. I'm not an expert but to me sharing any data is a red flag. I have no guarantee that this app wont collect my IP address, mobile phone hardware details, information about the browser, about the font size set on the phone, screen resolution, location from GPS. I have no guarantee that it wont be connected with darknet databases from other services that were already compromised.Also if biometric data is all i need for your app ... it means i wont be able to safely use other apps that will one day reach mass adoption if this project will fail because my biometrics can already be compromised.",

Just answer this question. How is it possible, in your opinion, that someone has a database of 1 million fingerprints?I would disagree, and will try to explain my thoughts on it this way: 1. As you can see on the picture posted by @3dpass, the HASH ID is created from several pieces of data when together being leveraged as a seed. But each of them represents an authentication factor you can never recover the HASH ID without having all of them:- a fingerprint is something that you are factor, which can identify the person easily (of course, in person);- a piece of stone is something that you have  factor. - this combination might be expanded with some additional factors like a password (something that you know), etc. My first conclusion is that you can identify a human being, however, it's not enough to only have their fingerprint to recover the HASH ID and keys. It implies, that your bio has been already compromised (or even public), but the second factor is private and strong enough to protect your keys.   Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on February 14, 2023, 11:56:51 AMQuote from: chum_yum on February 14, 2023, 10:30:21 AMHow 3DPass will deal with fake fingerprint data? I know its impossible to guess my fingerprint. The amount of possibilities are infinite. But creating a random fingerprints should be easy. How will 3DPass sort fake from real preventing 1 person from owning infinite amount of identities?For example this:The only way to check if a given fingerprint belongs to someone real is to meet him in person and verify it by his finger.",

Or maybe not \"more secured\" but \"secured in a different way\". Because you can also hash your private key using \"something you know\" AKA password and part of your best book as \"something you have\" using simple softwere. 3DPass is nothing more than that. Am I wrong?Quote from: chum_yum on February 14, 2023, 03:06:07 PMthat your bio has been already compromised (or even public), but the second factor is private and strong enough to protect your keys. good point. But that doesn't  this fact make bio useless in this system?",

I'm the owner of IDENA digital identity for more than 3 years.you need 10-30 min of your time each validation (~20 days). They tried to aim for a sweet spot. Validation each day is cool because new members can join right away but from the other hand old members needs to spend 30 min each day instead of once every 20 days.I'm not an expert but to me sharing any data is a red flag. I have no guarantee that this app wont collect my IP address, mobile phone hardware details, information about the browser, about the font size set on the phone, screen resolution, location from GPS. I have no guarantee that it wont be connected with darknet databases from other services that were already compromised.Also if biometric data is all i need for your app ... it means i wont be able to safely use other apps that will one day reach mass adoption if this project will fail because my biometrics can already be compromised.I appreciate what Idena did as the trendsetter for decentralized identity and for validators/nodes it's great. Ask yourself would this work for anyone else? Only a minority of people are into cryptocurrencies and from those even a smaller minority are into validation/nodes/mining. The feedback that the crypto community always get's is that the community must stop building products for other crypto people only. Everything from the app is open source there is no data collection. Remember we are just talking theoretical and what ever idea is available to improve security and keep it simple can be discussed for implementation as a community driven project.I mean we keep discussing it from a theoretical perspective but a private key can always be read if it can be accessed. The general trend when it comes to security is to move away from passwords towards Biometrics. I mean most of use unlock our phones every day like this. A lot of us travel internationally with biometric passports. There is a reason for this and it's the better security compared to a password.Good dicussion so far to try and make this decentralized identity solution better!",

In my opinin, correct me if i'm wrong, it lose majority of use cases. The algorithm checks the blockchain to make sure there is no match. Of course this depends on how many fingers are set up to generate a decentralized identity.If 3DPass get's the algorithm and conditions right for generating a new decentralized identity then it would be 1 per person. Of course people can be very creative and I joked earlier that people will start scanning their toes   Nonetheless there would be a strong limitation on the amount of digital identity per real human being with the goal being 1. You have to remember that for something as difficult, as controlled and centralized as Passports there are a lot of people walking around with multiple passports of different identities. This is not an easy issue to solve but I think the 3DPass proof of scan consensus mechanism which is like a PoW is a great baseline to build from.Quote from: Tytanowy Janusz on February 14, 2023, 05:59:27 PMSo 3DPass is only a more secured version of private key.

Am I wrong?I think this is harsh and I hope you can be open minded on the project.I believe it is more secure and secured in a different way. More secure in the sense of multiple biometric data plus an additional object which is a crazy level of security. Plus most importantly it will be more user friendly than anything I've seen so far. Scan two fingerprints plus your favourite sculpture for example. Good luck trying to figure this out for a hacker or forgetting this.Don't believe me on the accuracy of the algorithm check out this video I made playing around with the current recognition algorithm for 3D shapes. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TlDE69Tmms&t=6s",
