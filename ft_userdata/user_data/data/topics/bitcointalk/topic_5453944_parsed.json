  "content": "Many times driving in the subway, I saw a folded dollar in a phone case, and it was in different countries. I thought there was some kind of fashion among young people, it turned out to be a financial chain. To attract money, you need to fold $ 1 in a triangle and put the larger side in a convenient place to attract money. Do you think this method is working, what causes such a popular idea of putting money in a triangle to attract big money. Does it work, maybe among your friends there are those who have already done the same? Does such a monetary amulet work and will it work economically for you.",

Even the Chinese in my environment have more mystical variations to \"bring in\" money and luck.However, one has to look at the phenomenon in a rational way whereby, \"to make money, you have to do something that has value\".",

While it may be seen as a superstitious belief or a fun tradition, I don't personally think it has any real impact on attracting wealth. It's more of a symbol or reminder to stay positive and hopeful about financial abundance.",
