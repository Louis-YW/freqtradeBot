But at the time say 2016-17 they all worked well. Keep in mind there is a lot of fraud going on and in terms of these services vs. the google type ones they try but can't keep up. So you will get a lot of bot clicks. They say they fight it, but in the end even Google with billions of dollars of staff and tech can't keep up with click fraud.Also, back then their targeting was not the best but I don't know if that has improved in the last few years.-Dave",

      "body": "About A-ads.com, a publisher can generate as many clicks as he wants, but it's not going to help. The network is nor based on the CPM or CPC model. There are several factors considered and as well as the ratio between supply and demand for traffic.That was the first time I meet a network working like it, and from a publisher's point of view, it's a very interesting one for your money.I personally knew people who spent all day trying to divert traffic with autosurfs programs, I told them they were wasting their time, and that's what happened...Can't comment on the 2 others because I've never used them, but there are also Coinzilla, Cointraffic, and probably Adshares.Someone posted a list here long ago but I'm pretty sure most of the websites died since. You'll surely find it using the 'search' feature",

Choose only a reputed ad network that provides a better return.On the list that I found above, I think the best is Ad Dragon, I didn't try it yet but I think the decentralized feature that they have will might a better, the peer-to-peer (P2P) advertising model for marketing your projects sounds good for me.",

It's most likely due to managing the network. Because for example, Dextools do not accept ads without KYC verification, dextools don't want to give easy access to scammers (according to them). But there is a huge demand for dextools ads, so coinzila won't exclude such ad sites from where huge revenue will be generated. I am also against KYC, but nowadays it's hard to avoid for good service. As an advertiser, you have to make sure where your ads should visible. Just not who don't ask for KYC but have no huge network.",
