A loaded dude can pay for sex not just because he can't have it free, but just because he's rich. We are in an era where even love is measured by the number of gifts one receives. So obviously a marriage cannot just survive on good sex.",

      "body": "I think sex and money are really important but not for everyone as a general rule. I think many people are perfectly satisfied in a marriage with very little sex and sometimes very little money. Personally, I require quite a bit of sex to feel satisfied in a long-term relationship. And I also am quite ambitious so I think money is pretty important for getting some of my basic needs met. However, people have very different needs and we shouldn’t judge others for choosing to live without sex or not craving luxury.",

So obviously a marriage cannot just survive on good sex. Well good sex is great,but food is more important.Living in a place that is fairly safe is important.So good sex and some money should work out fine.1)Sex is complex in long term relationships married or not married (long term = 10+ years)2) Good sex is one part needed3)some money is another part needed4)Love or like or attraction is needed.5) Luck is important.so  you can have it all and get covid 19 die and the marriage is ended.My wife and I both had covid-19 we were sick for a long time.Both of us did not give a fuck about sex we wanted to get healthy over all other things.We healed and back to a nicer life.and we are back to having the things needed to be happy.",

And also about sex I have a partner in life and Im am satisfied with it..So for me it doesn't have to choose if sex or money. Just be contented. We can live with out sex but money should exist in every human being to live as well.",
