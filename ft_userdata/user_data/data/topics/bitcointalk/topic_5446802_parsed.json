      "body": "As I see it, mixing services are not inherently illegal. They can be useful for legitimate purposes, such as protecting users' privacy and security, or preventing unwanted surveillance. Banning mixing service ads would be a form of censorship and discrimination against a particular technology. It would also be hypocritical in a way, as the forum allows ads for other controversial or regulated services, such as gambling, ICOs, or even HYIPs. We should respect users' freedom of choice and expression, as long as they comply with the laws. So the question is, are all mixer services inherently illegal?",

I was thinking about this ever since I have seen OmegaStarScream's quoted post. Is it time to think about this?I'm not a lawyer, but as far as I understand the forum itself is protected under section 230[2] that protects \"interactive computer services\" from any liability as a publisher for what the users post.As for users advertising mixers or any other service really, they can do whatever they want as long as it's not promoting something illegal (e.g. drugs, etc...)[1] https://wiki.c2.com/?ThreeLetterAgencies[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230",

Theymos may want to avoid any legal issues with the forum, but he shouldn't control the signature space of users unless mixers are banned. Users shouldn't be restricted from advertising mixers unless there's a forum ban. However, if legal authorities demand a stop to mixer advertisements or seize the forum due to mixer ads, it would be an unrealistic action. This is because the forum isn't directly linked with money laundering and doesn't promote it.",
