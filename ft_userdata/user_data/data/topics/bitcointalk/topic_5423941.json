Bitcoin has scarcity and very well thought tech, but in order to have good price there's a need at least for demand. Hence a degree of trust is still needed.Now, I see two group of \"believers\":* those who understand fairly well the math and relationships behind this and will say \"it's not a religion\"* those who don't grasp all this and just see the price go sky high now and then; they keep their fingers crossed or even pray to get rich (quick)",

Bitcoin is not as godly as you think, you should remember that we didn't have bitcoin before and we still live well and everything is normal. But if you are religious, you know how important religion is.",

Bitcoin is different from other assets you can predict and it will come to pass according to your prediction. I don't think, people just believed in Bitcoin because of money only but money is part of it, but many people believe Bitcoin just because is not manage by government.",

Hence the phrase; \"Do not trust, verify\"If you use a less extreme word than 'religion', it could be argued that there are many who feel that Bitcoin has no flaws and can never be usurped by newer or 'better' technologies, hence they already have a closed mindset to any innovation.",

You could draw some parallels between Bitcoin and religion, because Bitcoin community tends to be messianic - there's a lot of people who believe that Bitcoin is here to change the world, get rid of the evil banking system and fiat money. But such comparison isn't really productive, because that's just some aspect of Bitcoin community. At its core Bitcoin has nothing to do with religion, which is belief in supernatural forces.",

I am not sure how you came to the conclusion that many bitcoiners considered it a religion because I have never got that vibe to be very honest! You will definitely find bitcoin maximalists here who truly believes in bitcoin and its power to break free censorship. This belief must not be mixed with religious kind of beliefs. Bitcoin is a disruptive innovation that disrupted the traditional payments market significantly! But it still has a long way to go. Also, it is not right to entrust any single asset class blindly. It will make you suffer losses in an unimaginable way. When it comes to making money out of bitcoin, just keep your eyes and ears open and diversify every single time! And it is better to leave this religious thought out of bitcoin please!",

And I can relate religion to any of this Bitcoin primary usage and purpose, so it will be a wasted effort trying to debate on this subject matter and we have seen similar topics like this before, it will not generate any serious discussion and in no time the topic will become in active since there will be no discussion due to the nature of this topic.

      "body": "Quote from: Obari on November 28, 2022, 02:42:59 PMDo you really see Bitcoin as a religion?Religion could mean several things based on the perspective of people. It could be an avenue to worship or reference a Superhuman that controls the affairs of men. This is where we have religion like Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and so on. It could also mean commitment or devotion to a certain course or interest. Some inventors were committed to make new discoveries and they were very dedicated to achieve them. Based on the first definition Bitcoin is not a religion because it doesn't promote any belief about a particular God, gods or deity. Everybody regardless of your religion is welcomed to the Bitcoin space and nobody is promoting any form of religion, I am not sure Satoshi's religion is known or whether he belongs to any religion. We have heard phrases like this 'Humanity is my religion or freedom is my new religion'. This could entail that you are committed to a particular course because you believe it is worthwhile. It means devotion to promote a particular product or idea because you believe it would have a positive effect on the people. Relating Bitcoin as a religion in this aspect might not be wrong because their are individuals that are working hard and dedicating their time and resources because they want to promote Bitcoin. Their number one desire or task is to do everything possible to add value to the Bitcoin space. Bitcoin is not their religion because it promotes a certain religious belief, it is their religion because they are dedication or devoting resources to it.  Definition link",
