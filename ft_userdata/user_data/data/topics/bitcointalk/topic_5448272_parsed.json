Just to be sure that you receive good working miners and the other party receives the money2. Who's going to cover the shipment fee and the tax. These miners are most likely to be shipped across boards3. What happens when you get the miners but then fail to make profit due to other costs such as power? Bitcoin mining isn't that profitable lately.4. What if the miners malfunction while you are still using them... maybe 6 months into using them and yet the deal was for 2 years, what do you do?",

These miners are most likely to be shipped across boardsit depends on how much is it if it's not that low 5-10% in total round then it won't be done.. however, if it ranges that we can split 50%-50%3.

Bitcoin mining isn't that profitable lately.it is going to be my own problem.. this is a lending service and doesn't get affected with anything on both sides4.
