But we are talking about insurance like a sure money back guaranteed which differs right? Cause what if the safu funds exceeds the loss so theres anyone who will not be reimburse? What do you think mate?",

That's why we should always think that the word Not your keys not your coins is always valid to think about. Maybe the only we can do with them is not to put a huge money then hodl it on their exchange or other so that we will not get any problem if the same like FTX issue will happen. But that is binance they are strong so hopefully they will not follow the foot tracks of FTX since if they turn scam for sure there's huge effect on crypto market, also it might get a impression that there's no legit business running using crypto.",

Choosing exchange to store your assets over personal wallet where you have your keys and full control of your assets is unwise decision. Regarding your question, the simple answer is Yes, there are a few exchanges that offer insurance for their users in case of a hack or bankruptcy but not all exchanges offer insurance for their users, so you should take your time to do your research before choosing an exchange. Don't lose guard with insurance mentality, you should also consider factors like fees, security features (very important) and customer support. It's also worth noting that these insurance policies usually have limits and don't cover all types of losses, so you should try to read the fine print.",

      "body": "If you are in some countries that require cryptocurrency exchanges to make an emergency fund in the event of bankruptcy, you may be able to recover part of your money, but this process is slow and may take several months, if not years. So why do you need to secure your money with a third party instead of using a multi-signature wallet in the bank vault or in the bank, where you can place wallet seed in safe place or using services that encrypt part of the private key and enable you to recover your money even if you do not remember the seed, are all safer solutions than leaving your money in an exchange and waiting for compensation to occur if the exchange goes bankrupt or is hacked.",

If you have coins on exchanges, it's better you take them out because that is not how self custody work, you can wake up one day and find out you have nothing under you anymore because you don't have the private keys and when you have no keys, you don't control such assets and if they chose not to pay back, you can't do nothing but to beg to have access to your one crypto.You remember what happen to FTX, how the exchange went from being one the most to been one with nothing because the team were disorganized, some stole assets through back door that till today, nothing has been recovered from them, and crypto doesn't have any insurance that cover this company.If you are insurance company, you will not accept to run insurance for any crypto companies because that's one of the biggest and riskiest investment any company will want to insurance. Even if they received money for insurance, the day it might want to collapsed, you will need more to settle this company. Some may even played dirty just to have money from insurance company, nothing safe about insurance here.",

I think you will need to read the team of service of the cryptocurrency exchange you are using so that you can be rest assured that your funds are protected in case of hack of bankruptcy. Many of the big cryptocurrency exchanges do have insurance policies supported by their insurance companies. I think exchanges like Binance, Kraken, Crypto.com etc have something like insurance funds for there customers so in case of bankruptcy.",

If you run after exchanges that provides exciting offers but their security is poor, then no one can help you from getting hacked. There are also many trusted exchanges, who provide insurance upto a fixed amount if your funds are in the form of fiat money. So you can have a research on that also. But if you are planning to store your coins in any of the exchanges, then let me say you that it’s a bad idea. In exchanges you completely don’t own the coins.

Why? We do know that exchange platforms turns out to be like honeypot for scammers. If there's one then i had might be able to miss out but just like on what i had said that it is something that would really be that impossible or unlikely. This isnt something an information that would really be shared out, not unless if its announced.This is why its really that important as a trader on which you shouldnt really be that storing up your coins on an exchange platform or centralized so  that you wont really be having that kind of risks on losing with those funds.We've seen some exchangers had been hacked and ended up on not to be operational anymore or completely stop, and there are situations which  exchange owners do ran off the money of their traders.There's so much possibilities for you to lose up money if you arent that careful, this is why HW or storing up your coins on non-custodial wallet would be always that recommendable.Somewhat it do understand on why people do really love on leaving out their coins on exchange to make those fast executions of buys and sells if ever there's an opportunity.",
