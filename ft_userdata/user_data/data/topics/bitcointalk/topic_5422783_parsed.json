  "content": "I’m receiving this email since last year but I didn’t bother to look on it until now that I became curious on what’s the content since I don’t subscribe on any google form using my personal email.At first, A newbie might mistakenly look it as legit email since this is through google form invitation when you check the sender.But later on you will be directed to other website to claim your supposed donation grant. I patiently finish all the task so that I can see what will be the outcome. After a couple of minutes of clicking to finish the task, they ask me to to donate for others with small amount of Bitcoin in able to claim the money I collected. This is where the scam part enter. A gullible newbie might be tempted to risk small amount of Bitcoin in exchange for the potential huge amount that you can get by donating to others. I think this scam website have many victim since they are very persistent on sending me an email for a long time.",

What intrigues me here was they are using google form instead of the typical junk email that might be misinterpreted by newbie that they subscribed to giveaways.I will lock this thread soon. Thanks for again for the heads up charles.",

Your curiosity will someday be able to play a cruel joke on you. If you are sure that the sender is unknown to you, why open such emails at all? Although I have never come across information that you can immediately pick up some kind of virus when opening emails, being interested in dubious emails is fraught with consequences.I am more than sure that if you use an email that is familiar to some people, that is, your circle of acquaintances and employees, the number of such emails will be at a minimum, with some degree of risk. Just separate your business email boxes from all the other junk that comes from the web.",

Be very careful. I got tons of scam mails in my inbox but I am sure the scammers must be very mad that I don't fall victim, because I never check them out anyway.",

The other emails I am receiving are less recognizable and more dangerous because newbies might open them out of curiosity. Some victims are aware and were suspicious of opening unknown emails but they were blinded when it is to giveaways and other forms of money guarantees. There were posts like this before but I do not mind another one to remind our newbies once again of the dangers of opening unknown emails.",

It is either a spoofed email or an email with a minimal typo to make it look like legitimate so that victims would think it is really coming from Google.Surely these days, newbies would not even bother entertain these kinds of email, unless they are not yet aware that these scams are really common. Looking forward for some email scambaiters like Atomic Shrimp to mess around with these scammers one day, lol.Quote from: Ryker1 on November 23, 2022, 09:07:18 AMWhere was this mail sent? --in your spam inbox or in your main inbox?It looks like it is in his main inbox since there was a tag of \"Inbox\", unless he marked the email as \"Not Spam\" before he took the screenshot.",

At this time also 0.03BTC values at around $500 so do you think you will get this amount free of cost? This is one of those scams where you will be directed towards other websites as you have stated and in your case they ask for donations first of all to redeem your amount and some might be willing to send it over to that particular address and loose them in instant.But as you said out of curiosity you want to see what happens and outcomes but clicking on these links is also not safe at all as some malware can be installed in your system without you even knowing about it draining all your personal information and sometimes wallet are also hacked so don't get excited in these matters and leave them as it is or unsubscribe to these mails improving your security.",

Well, the avarice of scam victims have always been their Achilles heel, when you tell people that they are going to earn something big without them working for it, it stops them from thinking rationally for that period. Giveaway scams were more popular some years ago, and you begin to wonder how one can fall for the trick of giving something first, to receive a giveaway sum in return. Prominent individuals have also had their accounts hacked and used by scammers to make giveaway posts, these prominent individuals are very rich btw, yet people still believed they need your money first to give you something back in return; if a person isn't moved by avarice, or isn't in a hurry to become rich, these sort of scams can't work on them.",
