I'm just curious because an opportunity as this could come to my region someday. what are the requirements to become an elite trader.

It sorta looks fun and engaging to me, like something I would want to try outHearing the name of what they're looking for, I have no idea if you should be going along with them. If you wanna engage and you think that you're a trader that's what they're looking for then go for it. But if you're a profitable trader, why there's a need to go along with these offers if you can grow on your own and do it alone? It does sounds interesting and you could make a lot of money from them if there's a prize and reward but in a sense that you're a good trader, just make yourself profitable from it.",

It could be they offer copy trading for the elite traders so that they can stand out among other traders.Just try out if you want to, but make it sure the find you will use is the amount that you can afford to use.",
