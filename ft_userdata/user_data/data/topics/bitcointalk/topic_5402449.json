The Code must go on. V1GithubAccess to real time Master Log for solo-bitcoin.com pool .See what solo-bitcoin.com is doing.Don't Trust...Verfiy!transparency is everything when electric cost and hashpower is on the line. See exactly what our pool is doing. Solo mine with peace of mind knowing your electric and hashpower is properly being utilized to give you a better chance to gain the 6.25 BTC  and the transaction fees rewards.Chip based reward. The goal is for Solo-Bitcoin.com  pool to reward the specific miner whom actual chip solved the block reward. This way no matter your mining rig CPU, GPU or  ASIC . The exact miner who owns that chip gets the full 6.25 BTC and the transaction fees reward.  The overall goal is to pool all hashpower to act as one miner to have better chances against the high difficulty but reward even the smallest miner with the 6.25 BTC the transaction fees rewards with 0% fee.Current status : is in development with blocks already solved on the Bitcoin testnettestnet solved blocksPlease do not try and connect to the pool tell it is announced another testnet run or go to mainnet.We will be doing more test net runs this week or next.Moving to the Bitcoin mainnet as soon as possible. Not to soon tell we can prove the solo pool preforms perfectly .solo-bitcoin.com pool is based off of ckpool  feel free to jump in to the development of solo-bitcoin.com poolTo-Do:1.Set up a github2.Modify ckpool source to set the chip based rewards with full transparent logging. Know exactly who is getting the bitcoin block reward to whoms chip3. get better servers to host solo-bitcoin.com poolCurrent issues:1.getting this error when trying to run the build on mainnet bitcoinCode:realloc(): invalid next sizeAbortedWorks fine on testnet without error .Current VPS is running on 4 cores and 4 GB ram . We will need better VPSUPDATE : 6/13/2022 - pool status: DOWN .Bitcoin full node is still running and staying synced for further testingUPDATE : 6/16/2022- clarified that solo-bitcoin.com pool takes 0% of any part of any rewards gained from the pool. Yes the miner gets the transaction fees as well. UPDATE : 1/03/2023- My intention was to go a different direction with Solo-Bitcoin but now we arrive at V2 2023. The Code must go on.",

Ran some more test. Today attempted to connect to remote Bitcoin core full node. The same that was used to successfully mine bitcoin testnet block.  Ran ckpool from a completely separate server. Each server runs fine until I connect the pool to the remote bitcoin node. Then the realloc(): invalid next size happens. My feeling and from what others have mentions is ram limitation is cause for error. Would this test not confirm ram limits is not the cause of this error ?",

With hard work, dedication and some fun. Thank you for all you have done for Bitcoin over the years. Thank you for building ckpool. An honor to have you on this thread. Even if your tone seems less than encouraging. Solo-bitcoin.com is actual a tribute to you and people like you. People who played a huge roll in making Bitcoin amazing. The legends of bitcoin. For the unknown and forgotten bitcoin legends also. Sound corny but true. I only seek knowledge .The knowledge i will collect in the process of partaking in the making of this pool is worth more than any fortune or riches. Some of my motivations are very close to my heart. This can be a lot of fun. Hope to hear from you more. Your input is worth gold. Seriously",

Including my father RIP3. Every single Bitcoin solved on a solo pool by smaller miners feels like it honors Satoshi's vision. That anyone could contribute to the network and  be rewarded.  That you do not need thousands of dollars worth of mining hardware to solve a bitcoin block. Level the playing field for anyone to be apart of bitcoin mining. Not just the handful of pools that solve the majority of the blocks.4. To facilitate the first solved bitcoin block in a ages with something less than a ASIC rig. CPU or GPU. “I know this one seems silly but it is a goal close to my heart”5. FUN, FUN and more FUN. Not sure if you remember the feeling of being overtaken with bitcoin’s promise? To feel so excited about being apart of something much bigger than yourself? To feel like you have a great purpose or cause to pursue? To be happy in what you are doing. Happiness!! This is why I am doing all this.",

But as the chip can be traced that finds the block I guess there is also the option to join with an asic?thank you. Yes the majority of hashpower on solo-bitcoin.com pool will be ASIC. ASIC more than welcome on the pool. The concept of chip tracing and logging is crucial to be fully transparent. To give better control to a pool community to verify who, what and when solved a block on the pool. One of the primary goals of solo-bitcoin.com pool is to give the community all logs and as much information on how the pool rewards and operates. Chip tracing and proof of rewards distribution to the specific miner who solved the block is critical.",

Thanks for keeping a mood of mining alive, as I would say to Kano of CK,Have a great dayThank you.  Glad to have people offering to help. Feels great knowing people are behind you pushing to excel . Currently I get paid every  2 weeks. I have been saving funding from each paycheck to purchase our much more advanced servers that will host our pool. Soon we will have redundant servers to assist with widening our reach as a pool. Currently just staying focused and saving up funds. We are taking donations but please do not feel pressured. One way or the other the new servers are going to get bought. Just takes me some time to save up money for them.  Most our problems will be solved by better servers but a project has to start somewhere.We are just getting started.",
