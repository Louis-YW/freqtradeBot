  "content": "Man Utd have reacted to Ronaldo's interview with Piers Morgan by issuing a press release. The club are keeping their cards close to their chest for now but reports have suggested that they are extremely unhappy with the situation.This was published on their official website and it reads;\"Manchester United notes the media coverage regarding an interview by Cristiano Ronaldo, the club will consider its response after the full facts have been established. Our focus remains on preparing for the second half of the season and continuing the momentum, belief and togetherness being built among the players, manager, staff, and fans.\"The statement comes less than a day after clips of Ronaldo's interview with Morgan emerged on social media, with the veteran forward expressing his displeasure at the current state of Manchester United. As well as taking aim at manager Erik ten Hag, the Portuguese superstar also criticised former boss Ralf Rangnick.https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-club-statement-cristiano-ronaldo-interview/blt1f4b90741f8beade",

      "body": "I mean Ronaldo literally said that the owners did absolutely nothing for the club, he said there were a lot of people who didn't want him there, and he said he doesn't respect the manager. I do not really see how he can stay, if it was just between him and the manager, maybe there could have been some way of figuring it out, but he outright told the owners off on national television as well, there is absolutely no way of coming back from there. He is not going to get ANY playing time if you ask me, and if he does then the manager doesn't have any self respect. He will probably be let go after world cup, and he will be asked to find a team asap. Thats the type of situations we are in, there is no future for Ronaldo in United at all.",

      "body": "Most of us will have seen or heard about the interview. I think United are also guilty of it themselves, they have not really treated Ronaldo with respect. This is not just any one player, this man has been the best football player in the world a few times. And has meant a lot for football worldwide. That is not well estimated by Erik Ten Hag. It is clear that Ronaldo has indicated that he does want to leave United (indirectly). It is quite serious accusations to say that the management of the club and the coach do not want you at the club. Surely there must be a grain of truth in there somewhere?",

Ronaldo can't get that joy he had at Madrid here in Man UTD, he's allergic to losing and not scoring. When other players don't play to his rythme it becomes a problem.Other players wants to be in the spotlight, it shouldn't be all about CR7. To win a game you have to play as a team not to one player out of 11 players on the squad, that's why he had to struggle to get goals on his own.",

Ronaldo is not just a nobody. This man is the man, they can't just throw away a player who can make a team win all because others also want to be on the spotlight. Everyone has to be part of the team and play as a team. But if they are pulling each other down, there really is something wrong in the club making members anxious.",

For your information, United are taking a silent reaction on the lad's actions, for example, the Ronaldo banner has been pulled down which tells you how much their ego has been bruised and can't all be a coincidence unfortunately.

Also CR7 is mega right about young players and their training system because they only care about having a great haircut , driving the best car on market , having the best girl in the club and 0 performance on the club. If this is the model United wants to follow ...then I don't care anymore. They could simply go to Championship and stay a couple of years there.",

He still had a year left in his contract yet he was pushing for his departure from the club because he just wanted to play in the Champions league. Every coach would not be happy with such behavior because it shows that the player considers his interest more than the clubs goal.

The best option for him now is to leave Manchester United and retire somewhere else. It seemed that he felt that he still had such a good physique that he became unconscious of his current state. If he stays like this it will make him bad at his retirement age. Indeed the last resort he had to go, it was already evident his picture in the stadium had been taken off it was a sign he had to go. But when comparing messi and neymar,their age is still young if physically they are still better than Ronaldo. But when it comes to manners, of course, their relationship with PSG needs to be modeled. Maybe at the moment Ronaldo is just frustrated and can't keep up with the EPL's fast game. Maybe if he were in another League it would be a different storyline.",
