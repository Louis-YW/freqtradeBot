  "content": "Tether released a statement regarding the freezing of tornado cash addresses, basically saying they’re not going to do it.Apparently so far authorities have not requested them to freeze any privately held wallet or address despite Tether’s near daily contact with US law enforcement.This is what they said about it: “Unilaterally freezing secondary market addresses could be a highly disruptive and reckless move by Tether. Even if Tether recognizes suspicious activities on such an address, completing a freeze without the verified instruction of law enforcement and other government agencies might interfere with ongoing and sophisticated law enforcement investigations.”What do you guys think about this move?Original tweet with source:https://twitter.com/thetokenist/status/1562485559972352000",

It's clearly stated they are just waiting an instruction from authorities.Tether's reputation is already bad enough since we know USDT is a centralized stable coin. Freezing assets without a solid reason would damage them further.",

This is one reason why I didn't have USDT anymore but rather converting them to either BTC, BUSD or USDC. Having a centralized stablecoin in our portfolio doesn't make us having a full custody of it.",

There are other websites reposting the news like https://news.bitcoin.com/stablecoin-issuer-tether-wont-freeze-tornado-cash-addresses-says-premature-freezing-could-jeopardize-investigations/Tether will not freeze but only the accounts of traders who will send to centralized exchanges. They'd be the first to be threatened if they don't act in accordance with the government mandate.",
