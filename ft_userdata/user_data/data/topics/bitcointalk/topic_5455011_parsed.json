  "content": "The btc and other crypto dont need comparsion with fiat currencies.For example If saudis and OPEC Will sell oil and accept btc or other crypto then it's end of the dollar.But the point is that currency in order to succeed need to have commodities relation.The bitcoin itself is commoditie so btc cant be currency...the oil is commoditie and gold...so u cant buy food with oil or gold neither with btc yes you can but the rule is that commoditie is commoditie and currencies are currencies.So you need currency what are the currencies? Currencies Are now If we talking about crypto then stablecoins.It's very real that world commodities gold oil and food Will start accepting stablecoins for payments.The crude oil is biggest commoditie in the world with biggest market Cap so If any currency Will be dominant in OIL trade then this currency will be the king.And likely USDT or USDC Will be used for oil trading since other country Stablecoins Are not so well developed then USD Stablecoins are developed. But only one thing is missing.... there Are no proper network of ATM machines so people can exchange Stablecoins instantly to cash like people in brazil allready can Do it they are lucky they don't need banks it's proven that unbanked people can use USD stablecoins.Most likely the old USD will be replaced by USDT or USDC with new digital currency the digital dollar and new cash bills Will be invented becouse in order to have legit currency widely accepted the paper bills are required aswell.So now the brazil showing the light to other world... Slowly world start following to brazil to get Same things done and once this thing is done nobody really don't need Banks anymore, brazil can Do it then we other countries can Do it aswell.The future is real we probably have USDT ,USDC paper versions aswell as digital ones.Good times ahead things gona be better much better more financial freedom and more ways to earn good money",

What would they do with BTC if no one will want to accept it for their goods? Oil is only a small part of international trade conducted with US dollar. It doesn't matter that there are examples of trade being conducted in other currencies, because no currency is as close to being universally accepted as USD. Dollar has no real competition.Quote from: Shortmaster on June 03, 2023, 10:10:10 PMThe bitcoin itself is commoditie so btc cant be currency...Bitcoin is not a commodity, because it's not being consumed by any process. You can't burn it for energy or make chemicals out of it. The only thing you can do it so send it to someone.Quote from: Shortmaster on June 03, 2023, 10:10:10 PMIt's very real that world commodities gold oil and food Will start accepting stablecoins for payments.Why would the world need stablecoins? They are just fiat curency with extra steps which make them inefficient compared to existing systems like SWIFT or Visa.",

      "body": "For the fact that bitcoin is designed to freely co-exist with fiat currency without one interfering with the other or trying to push the other into existing the market since one can not survive without the others, bitcoin can not replace the US dollar but rather, bitcoin is an alternative to fiat currency and at that, both can successfully work together to provide economic stability.",

If you like talking and listening to the richest people, then you should go to them because we don't have billionaires like you talk about here. But I suspect with your knowledge and attitude, someone rich would want to talk to you. One more thing, I want to know, are you rich? And with an attitude that doesn't respect others like you, shows that you are not a nice person either.",

It's not gonna sit well with them, you might even get a boot in the face if you tell this to big business and oil tycoons. Bitcoin is great and all, but it has yet to prove itself in the external market. And with the recent crackdowns on its usage from different countries across the globe, this just makes it harder for bitcoin to earn a seat in the top-tier echelons of commodities. Until we solve that issue, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as you put it, will not be accepted for any other purchase, especially for large-scale purchase of stores of value and commodities like oil, gold, and others.",

Right now, governments are already implementing tighter regulations against stablecoins. So forget about these privately-issued coins being used in the future as replacements of the USD. In the first place, they can't even continue to exist if that fiat currency on which their price is pegged is already dead. They can't replace USD because they're like shadows of USD.",
