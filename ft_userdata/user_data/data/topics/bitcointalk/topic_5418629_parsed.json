  "content": "hello.can anyone tell me please is ledger hardware wallet support still experimental on polkadot.js wallet?i ask because i see notice in UI :Ledger support is still experimental and some issues may remain. Trust, but verify the addresses on your devices before transferring large amounts. There are some features that will not work, including batch calls (used extensively in staking and democracy) as well as any identity operations.and the question arose: is this an outdated warning or actual info?",
