Having an SSD and adding more RAM can improve the speed of the syncing process.Quote from: M.Antonio on January 12, 2024, 08:38:13 AMand how safe is qt wallet full node compared to the ledger?The safety of your wallet/node depends on you.About the ledger, we do not know how safe this hardware wallet but since it's a closed source it's not safe. Having a Bitcoin core on Linux OS is much safer but you should learn security practices listed below.- https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet#online",

People usually run their own node for helping the network decentralization and protecting their privacy, not increasing their security.If you want to be secure, you should create your wallet on an airgapped device or go for a good hardware wallet. Fixed the typo.Thank you hugeblack for the correction.",

The faster the internet and the better the specifications of your device, the shorter the period.But why do you need to run a full node?Hardware wallets provide you higher security, while full nodes such asÂ  bitcoin cores give you greater privacy, so it is better to buy a hardware wallet instead of running a bitcoin core ( if you are planning for security, not privacy.) ledger are a bad choice for hardware wallets and you should avoid them.Quote from: hosseinimr93 on January 12, 2024, 08:59:08 AMThe current blockchain size is around 550 MB and the time it takes to download that depend on your internet speedGB*",

For ledger it's absolutely not safe and you should always avoid them. If you need security, you have to go for an airgapped devices (a devices that has no internet connection). You can create one yourself by using an old device or new device, just disable the WiFi card and Bluetooth connection or possibly use a software like Tails USB to airgap your device. For the software airgap you have to turn off your wifi in the OS and for hardware you have to physically remove your WiFi card. Quote from: hugeblack on January 12, 2024, 09:20:57 AMAssuming that you have a fiber connection or medium-speed internet, you need an average of 2 to 5 days to complete the synchronization. If OP is in my location, it would probably take longer than 5 days, maybe up 10 days because from my location the internet connection is very slow the maximum is around 21.35 Mbps which is rarely seen except you purchase an IPNX connector that is very very expensive and the medium or average is around 9.55 - 10 Mbps. lol Quote from: hugeblack on January 12, 2024, 09:20:57 AMBut why do you need to run a full node? For me, I'm just tryna get more experienced.",
