They are a pice of Bitcoin's history but they justhave a few years, so no opne will give you too big of a price for them as they have almos no utility at this point. However, as the years go by, less and less of these equipments will be found and that will be about when collectors will pay good prices for them. Just wait at least 10 more years and I guess they will be worth a lot more.",

I think people should not start to collect random hardware that serves no purpose  I mean isn't that what all collections are mostly.  Things that serve no purpose.  Looking at and having a piece of mining history might mean something to someone like looking at a painting.  To others paintings are just useless pieces of canvass with paint splashed on them.  To each their own right!",
