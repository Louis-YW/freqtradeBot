How likely this buy back will even happen?\"The U.S. Treasury Department is asking primary dealers of U.S. Treasuries whether the government should buy back some U.S. government bonds to improve liquidity in the $24 trillion market.\"Source:https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-treasury-asks-major-banks-if-it-should-buy-back-us-government-bonds-2022-10-14/#:~:text=Oct%2014%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20The,in%20the%20%2424%20trillion%20market.",

      "body": "^^ I think it's mere speculation at this point. Bullish? nah, we just had another bounce back from $18k. We haven't get back to the $20k'ish, which for me is the biggest support that we need to achieved.And there could be another reasons for the jump right now and not necessary this news. But in any case, every market is connected and there could be 'short' term effect, but not necessarily very bullish.",

Don’t know whether this is bullish or not.I mean if they buy bonds then the yields will go down but will it be good for inflation? Probably not. I think they are just doing this to make sure there isn’t some nasty liquidity crunch in the bond markets.",
