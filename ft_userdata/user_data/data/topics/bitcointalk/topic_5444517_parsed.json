      "body": "It is a good advise in my opinion about acquiring skills. You don't have that much qualification but being a graduate and most companies are no longer focusing with that.What they like is what you can bring to their table based on the skills you've got. And that's why learning some skills before applying for a job is gonna give you an edge from other candidates that could also be fresh grads. The more skills you have, the higher chance that you might get employed as a beginner and from there, you'll think about it whether you want to hone that skills or you're good being like that.",

Come to think of it check how many small business owner you know especially those who owns a small daily needs store and calculate how many years you know them, they actually don’t do big things and are more of the time having what they can use to feed and settle other necessary bills.To do big you ought to aspire for more and learning is one way to do so. I think it’s more like investing in yourself and never settle for less. But also there are those with big mind set that started from small investment and still made it.",

Small margin profit business will take your time and effort, and at the end, all the profit you make in a long time will be nothing compared to the profit that someone who involves himself in a high paying will earn in a shorter time. If you must be involved in small margin profit business ensure that it is just for a very short time and not what you have long term goals for. You can be involved in a small margin profit business and still pursue your skill which you intend to do for long term, let the small margin profit business be a stepping stone.",

      "body": "I also think that it is really good advice.  Being employed in a small-margin business is somehow not beneficial in the long run.  Since the business have a very small profit, they won't be able sponsor their employee to train or acquire skills.  Aside from that it is obvious that income growth in this kind of environment is very limited.  Although it is beneficial in the short term especially when we are looking for a start-up source of income, acquiring a skill or learning a trade is far more beneficial in the long run.If someone is able to acquire a skill or learned a trade, the possibility of being employed by good companies becomes higher, and the person will have the capability to start a business because of the knowledge skills, and experience he accumulated.  at the end of the day, those who have the skill and talents often reap a higher earnings.You can also check this article[1] on how important learning new skills is and at the same time the importance of learning a trade[2].[1] https://www.piedmont.org/living-better/the-mind-body-benefits-of-learning-a-new-skill[2] https://ca.indeed.com/career-advice/resumes-cover-letters/trade-skill",

With the present economic outlook, do you think that this is a good advise?Both a Yes & a no. Small Margin business ideas or what we can call home startups look pretty lucrative as less capital is generally required to open them and you can easily make your living using them. But if you see the current trend in most developed and developing nations, the trend of the market is changed and a shift towards buying things online and from major stores has been there. Also seeing the development in technology it looks as if this trend will obviously continue. Which means these low margin business will always be struggling with the footfall as we progress further. But yes in this current unemployment scenario it's a good option, as best one if it can be done as a side hustle.",

It is not easy to do that now but when it can be obtained, it is clear that the qualifications we have become bigger and that is something that is very good.

Yes,  he will lose the money, but he can get the experience that he can't get on real-life trade. And, usually, the skill will be obtained as long with time.",

These days, we've got businesses or jobs that may not be able to pay you for your skills, some may want to milk you dry all cause you are dependent on that job as to settle one or two bills.  Personally, good advice like these rarely come and if a statistics be taken, you'd discover that those with the needed skills set most times do better than just the average graduate and have better edges.  It's quite true that you'd stand to gain more when you pair your business ideas with a little bit of skill because that helps to sell you more.",

It won't be easy because more graduates are from more well-known campuses. We must adapt to the situation and try opening jobs for other friends.",

Unemployment is high, and some positions and jobs require a higher level of competition. Some graduate but cannot choose or apply for the right position and expertise. They have to make a living in occupations that are completely different from the one that corresponds to their university degree. Some choose to study at a higher level, but choosing a career to do something sustainable, finding the door to your own profit is also a good option. For example, if you graduated in electronics - you can choose to continue learning advanced repair skills to combine with small business and small profit margin.",
