  "content": "Good job, internet: You bullied NFTs out of mainstream gamesQuoteBeneath the common complaints that they're environmentally costly and more or less stupid, I think NFTs inspire so much repulsion on social media because they seem to corrupt something that people actually do want. Sameness is everywhere in this era of mass production, and what started on assembly lines was near-perfected by computers, which can duplicate data near-instantly. From that perspective, the scarcity and uniqueness of NFTs might be seen as subversive: They're pushing against the current of history. It feels like something could be cool about that, somehow. But not thishow. While individual NFTs are unique, the obvious goal of corporations is to do what they always do and mass produce that uniqueness. The majority of NFTs are just another kind of mass-made plastic tchotchke, or commemorative gold coin like the ones sold on TV at 2 am. They contain nothing that's good about handmade, one-of-a-kind items; all they do is irradiate the concept with high-grade art collector snobbery and Beanie Baby-style financial speculation. What is a \"Web3 fan\" but a fan of buying and owning things? Isn't this about art?I think the internet's NFT bullying has had an effect on mainstream game publishers: If we'd all just shrugged, they'd have tried way more NFT gun skins by now. Even if it hasn't, though, maybe making fun of stuff online is something we do for each other, to remind us all of what's real and validate the overwhelming feeling that it's all very stupid. And I think that's beautiful.The comments on reddit are also interesting:QuoteIt has more to do with NFT and crypto currency markets tanking than with internet shaming.QuoteThe internet ridiculed microtransactions (see: Horse Armor) and that didn't do jack shit to stop them because they still made money.NFTs could have been the most openly mocked \"feature\" to ever be brought to the industry and we'd be neck deep in them if they were at all profitable.I think success of NFT is tied to success of crypto, without adoption of Ethereum or other platforms that host NFTs, they couldn't become widely popular. And crypto is not getting actually used in real world, almost all crypto activity is just speculation and a game of a bigger fool. So, it was inevitable that NFT adoption in mainstream gaming has failed. But it's good that the gamers took a stance and pushed back against them.",

      "body": "They are failing because they are not giving proper in game services. What gaming industry should have done is entirely different story. I mean instead of making the trades between multi player zone, the gaming industries should trade with the user directly. For example, they should buy the NFT's (characters, powers, levels, usernames etc etc. ) from the users and increase the value of trade as well as game. This can creative smooth integration between the two, have the economy flourishing in the financial perspective and over the period it can do both: earn revenue and give some of it back to the users. NFT's will carry that high card stamp due to this and then we can see them going mainstream one more time. This is anyway just theoretical approach, the reality could end up entirely difference Who knows players may not be interested in it anymore",

      "body": "I think the NFT crash and subsequently their fading popularity in gaming is mainly homegrown, like Hispo wrote. If you sell scarcity and uniqueness, but eventually convert this scarcity in a mass product, then it's a contradiction in itself.Play-to-earn [NFTs] is the absolute extrme of that concept: Playing is something most people enjoy, so the activity of \"playing to earn something\" will be one of the least scarce activities ever. \"Earning\" is normally something people do when \"working\", and \"working\" is generally a scarce activity, one people can enjoy but wouldn't do it forever, and also 99,9% of all people simply can't work in most jobs because they lack qualification. Playing is quite the opposite, even if there is some skill involved - game companies just can't make it too tough for it to be profitable.Now you earn something which looks like it is scarce but isn't, and somewhen you'll want to sell it. Somewhen many will sell it. That doesn't happen only to P2E NFTs but also to all other mass-produced NFTs. Prices will go downhill, and the concept with it.So I think while \"Internet mocking\" and the \"crypto crash\" may have both contributed to the \"NFT crash\" and thus the exodus of game publishers from the market, the real cause is simply the unsustainable concept behind the \"NFT as a mass product\" concept. The NFT crash may even have deepened the crypto crash a bit.Bitcoin is radically different: it is maybe also an item which benefits from its scarcity, but it can't be just earned (at least in bigger quantities) by just \"playing\". Its scarcity is also not its only USP, it's the resistance to censorship, global usefulness and the absence of middlemen/single points of failure.",

While a pack of baseball cards can be bought for cheap. The cards within it appreciate in rarity and exclusiveness over time. Being deflationary limited edition assets, also contributes towards their value appreciating.These are aspects of limited edition collectibles which NFTs have tried to target within a digital format. However the format of NFTs leaves some things to be desired considering many have demonstrated how they can be reproduced in a way which trends towards them being inflationary rather than deflationary. NFTs currently lack that deflationary momentum of baseball cards and collectibles, which results in them becoming more rare over time through increasing scarcity.NFTs being digital could also grant them some advantages over things like baseball cards. In a way which might allow them to accumulate intrinsic value. However it doesn't seem that this is widely attempted or supported. The majority of NFTs appear to target only artwork.",
