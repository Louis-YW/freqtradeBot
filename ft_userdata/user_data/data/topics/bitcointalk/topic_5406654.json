That's really sad to hear those kinds of things, did you try to speak with him? What he was expecting to do with a newbie account precisely? I really don't understand what those guys are looking for. Are you sure it was a human at least and not a bot? As it has been said please report the PM to moderators.I quote your post to show the pictures to everybody.",

It was in your ability to check facts that you realized the URL was totally different from this site. It goes to show that once you've your account in \"always stay logged in\" and you're asked to log in again, be suspicious. I don't know why there's resurgence of this type of attitude now. Sad.",
