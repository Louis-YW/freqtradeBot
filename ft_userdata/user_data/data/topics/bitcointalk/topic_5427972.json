It has no tangible form.It's somehow similar to your money as long as you use it only in bank transfers and credit card, no ATM, not paper bills.Or it's somehow similar with a thought or idea. Or, somehow similar to the music at the radio.You can use software to find out how much you own, but it has no physical shape.",

      "body": "BTC is a virtual currency, it is not physical and it has no look in real life. BTC is a virtual currency that can be sent and received online through computers or mobile devices. BTC is a decentralized currency created by Satoshi to be a second option to fiat currency, though it works differently from fiat as it can't be printed, but 'mined', mining doesn't mean miners excavate physical BTC, miners validate BTC transactions and put them in new blocks, this process is called mining because in that process the successful miner is rewarded with new BTC's, that is how new coins are made. Quote from: Cyber_Alien on December 12, 2022, 08:42:22 AMIs there a list of figures I can print out and use as my reference? Alternatively, should I point to an entry on a public ledger and say, \"There!

I think the important thing we need to care about is value. You should be more concerned with the real value it can bring you than the tangible form. Although it is a virtual property, it cannot be touched, but the value it brings to you, no other property can get you.If 13 years ago you owned 1 bitcoin for $1, now with 1 bitcoin, you would have $17,000, but if 13 years ago you held 1 pound, it would still be worth 1 pound.",

However, you need to show your wallet ledger or balance to anyone before teaching about BTC if you show your wallet history you're exposing yourself to physical and online attacks.",

This is what bitcoin looks like in the real world!",

You said that 1 btc is this: \"101111101011110000100000000\".I created exactly that.Saying that \"101111101011110000100000000\" is on the bitcoin network is denial of reality given I just produced it here on the forum. Without someone's rules. Without mining. Without POW. Without confirmation. I created \"\"101111101011110000100000000\". In an instant.So, why are you people buying or mining something that everyone can create in an instant?It's interesting how you ignored my challenge on dollar. Try to create 1 dollar, i.e. 1 instrument of debtors liability in an instant. You can't. That's the point. Everyone can create digits. But not dollars. That's why Bitcoin is a joke. Joke taken seriously.",

EGgoing to a loan shark and asking for a loan. is not creating new money. its borrowing someone elses already created money.if you want to create new money you have to go to a bank that has the facility to do so. learn the difference. not all loans create new moneytalking about dollars in any discussion platform does not create new dollars.",
