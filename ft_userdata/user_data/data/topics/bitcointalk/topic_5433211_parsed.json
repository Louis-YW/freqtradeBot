They were saying \"they have been running for X number of days, have Y number of users and Z million dollars go through them; it is impossible for them to run away\". The rest is history...Besides it is not always about the company itself scamming its users, or not all its users (ie. selective scamming), but another risk is a third party hacked exploiting the backdoors in the closed source software that the company has placed in it (intentionally or unintentionally) and stealing your funds. Kind of like Windows where the risk is not only Microsoft hacking you but other hackers exploiting the backdoors Microsoft has placed in their product to hack you.",

What you say is untrue.If they plan to scam their users, they would code an auto script to automatic do everything and with such bot, things will be done in a few seconds and minutes. You will have nearly zero chance to exit.What you say is more relevant to attacks on blockchain which can be detected automatically by big exchanges which run their own nodes and after having detection, they can react to keep their funds safely.

Provided that the trustwallet is handled by CZ, however this does not guaranteed safety all the time. From the word itself its closed source means they still have an edge whatever goes wrong with their platform. Its not like Im saying they will ring any bells or what but always make cautious since its still a possible scenario for every big firms out there.",

To be fair both FTX and MtGox are centralized exchange while Luna is a shitcoin project, while @OP is discuss about wallet, so you need to give an example about which wallet has been hacked especially the closed source one.@hosseinimr93 gave a good example how closed source wallet is bad even though it's non custodial, the fact is many users are still use Coinomi even though someone already make a report. So I wouldn't be surprised if there's a new user will make an accusation against this wallet again.",

They could empty the largest of the person who isn't related to them, then wait, then go for the next biggest and continue (if they wait enough time, people will keep trusting them before they empty a lot of users wallets - they can fairly easily track when you're online and just need to target a rolling attack for everyone they suspect won't be).",
