      "body": "If everybody folds then he doesn't have to show his cards, but it works both ways. When you fold, you also don't have to show what you had. This is a fair rule when the stakes are high. Often people bluff with nothing in hand and get everybody scared. If the table knew that they are this bold, they'd bet against him more often and wouldn't get bullied by him anymore. At the same time you can try to bluff half way and then finally get scared and fold. You wouldn't want the whole table to know that, would you?So, the answer is yes, I'd like to know his cards, but I wouldn't want the rest of the players to know my cards  Since we can't make it like that it's fine as it is. When I play with friends we always show what we had, but that's a different situation.",

But the thing is the players are not going to show it by default, unless he wants to proved a point or just showing his bluff to make you feel that you made the wrong decision. And I guess that's one reason why poker are exciting and why there are players or gamblers who go professional. There is this element that you wanted to out hustle the other player. However, it's really up to you, for me I'm fine with the playing not showing his cards. I already made the decision to fold as I think that he has a greater hand than mind.",

One the other hand you should also know that it is the choice of that player to show his card or not because it is not compulsory and the rules don't allow such.This is why it is good to play with reputable people that wouldn't like to cheat and when you fold, you know that he has won the game rather than thinking that he is cheating.",

Not knowing the cards that led you to fold can be frustrating but adds an element of mystery to the game, it’s part of the game’s strategy and charm, a game of incomplete information. It is not just a game of chance, but also a game of skill, strategy, and psychological warfare. But it can also leave you with that nagging feeling of wanting closure. It's like a puzzle with missing pieces, and you're left wondering if you made the right decision. It’s natural to feel curious or even frustrated when you fold and don’t get to see what cards led to that decision. Folding can be tough, especially when you have a decent hand like a pair, every poker player has been in that situation. So yeah, they’re right it what makes the game exciting and challenging.

Bluffing is what makes poker interesting and different from other forms of gambling. It also involves reading your opponents mind and making your competitor believe you are not bluffing. It's a wiser move to let bluffers win than take risk on your poor set of cards. But if you believe your cards are competitive, you should not stay behind provided your bankroll backs you up. Occasional bluffs are considered a strategic move but the person that bluffs too much would not be taken serious by the table and when there are multiple opponents in the table, the bluffers would have higher chances of losing.",

It bothers me at some point and the more it bothers me when I was the guy who is on the losing side. Our pot is not more than a thousand that he has to be that serious. This thread should have been a poll so we'll see who also feels they have the right to see the other guy's card. Or am I just too Karen to feel this way?",

Those who feel the pair is lower or do not dare to reply to another player's bluff even though the pair is higher, will decide to fold. There are no rules requiring you to show your cards to other players, obviously they won't do it because their tricks and playing style must be kept secret. This kind of excitement is what makes a poker player's mentality tested, when another player raises the plot, someone has to cater to his playing style to find out what kind of cards he is holding.",

But then again, you'd ask yourself if the risk is worth taking, what of you decide not to fold and decides to proceed with the plot they raised and then it turns out not to be a bluff, that time, you'd wish you had folded, so the question should be, is the risk worth taking and do you have such money to spare?",

That's why the game is fair. You don't want to hurt your feelings just because he didn't show his card, plus he raised a bigger amount so that means he won.It is better that you ask if he can show his card to you. I mean there is nothing wrong with it. Maybe you panic at that time because he raised the bet so you just thought of folding and admitting your defeat.However, in the poker game, there are many wise players, and they can cheat you if you hesitate or lose your defense especially if you don't focus on the game. Poker is fun and at the same time you can make money through betting, but you must concentrate and balance correctly whether your card will win or not. In short focus and analyze.",
