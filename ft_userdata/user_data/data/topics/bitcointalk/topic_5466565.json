  "content": "We have a tool [Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images created by TryNinja, which will fix our old invalid images uploaded via Imgur hosting site on bitcointalk.I am wondering if there is any possible way to fix broken images in other people's posts. I'm asking this because quite often, I come across many guides that were created years ago, and they now have broken images. These guides contain valuable details, and if I want to recommend one to a newbie seeking help, having the pictorial details is crucial for them to understand the complete content of the guide.I've had this thought for a while, and I'm sharing it now as it might provide a possible solution for posting guides created by others, with all the images.",

The other solution is to because of that, create your own guide and give a reason about it which is the error images that make the guide not understandable.",

Or, there is a simple solution you can do yourself:Quote the entire post.While in Edit mode, you will find all the original Imgur links within the quoted text. These should work when accessed directly.Now, you have two options:Manually edit the images by uploading them to the TalkImg service and updating the URL.Publish the post as is and use the Imgur to TalkImg script, which will automate the process for you.Quote from: TryNinja on May 14, 2023, 07:38:14 AM- This will upload and edit all imgur.com links found on your post history (even those inside quotes you made of other people).",

It's only theymos can do the most, like to make a script for the whole bitcointalk that will use like what Tryninja's script do. This may require lots of time since the post numbers are already in 62M count.",

I didn't change anything on the forum's end, so imgur must've loosened up their limits. I guess it's not necessary to convert img images into links as long as imgur keeps working. But to prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.I'd like to create a page which recommends services for hosting forum images, and mention this in the error message you get when you try to use imgur. Other than TalkImg, which ones are good?Quote from: theymos on May 25, 2023, 06:11:09 PMQuote from: LoyceV on May 25, 2023, 07:17:36 AMQuote from: theymos on May 24, 2023, 06:24:57 PMto prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.This also means old posts can no longer be edited without replacing the image links (I just tested it).It's based on the message ID. Posts before roughly when I posted that can be edited without updating the imgur links.",

Unless theymos do the #3 in the poll but it risks user's privacy which is a no-no for most of us. As what i mentioned the script of Tryninja is way much better but it should be done on server's side for all of the post that has imgur images, which is only theymos can do it, but the risks should be take note first before doing it.",

For example, when you go through the tutorial for Electrum wallets they are all without images. If you read the contents of those tutorials it won't make any sense as they are related to the screenshot. Either a new set of tutorials needs to be created or the owners of those tutorial should have to fix those image links. As OP mentioned this [Script] Imgur to TalkImg - automatically fix your broken images can be used but it can be only done by those who wrote those tutorials.",
