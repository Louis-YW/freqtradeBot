  "content": "We might have a bull run coming in next few months. There is a good possibility that many alt coins will achieve 20-50X from their current prices and thus they are good investment opportunity at present. But finding which one is good is an art. I believe that SushiSwap can be good contender for this. All time high: $23.38Current price: Approx $1There are lot of developments happening related to this altcoin as well likehttps://decrypt.co/121027/sushiswap-acquires-cosmos-based-trading-platform-vortex-protocolhttps://www.cryptonewsz.com/factor-and-sushiswap-collaborate-for-integration-and-vault-partnership/So, if it goes back to previous ATH in next bull run, it can give 20 x return. Such a return is never possible with bitcoin in less than a year time frame. So will you also bet on ShushiSwap ?",

With all of these calculations, everyone is having their own bets for the next bull run and whatever it is. I have my own bet which I know will be surely be up on the next bull run and that is no other than bitcoin.If by any chance that I get to have some backup funds that will be open to any investments that I'll choose then sushiswap is going to be one in my list.",

      "body": "Bad decision at the management level or let me say at the DAO level is not helping Sushi swap, Sushi swap is one of the first exchanges to decide on multi-chain deployment but you can't name any chain that Sushi swap is dominating. Uniswap is always late to the party but always ended up dominating despite coming late to the party. I believe this is the last chance for Sushiswap community< I will like to see it grow but time is not on its side if it messes up this change then game over for the team. Because the price hit $20's in the past does not mean the price will hit that range again. I will be conservative with my own expectation and say it will likely hit $10s in the coming bull market with is a good return on Investment",

If you want to invest on sushiswap to make a big leap during next bull run, then you are free to invest and wait and see if you are right or not. I wouldn't, but that's my own money and I am not in favor of investing into it, whereas I have to say that its not going to be easy for everyone to feel the same way neither, it would be totally different from each other. Which is why if you want to do it then you should, if I don't want to do it then I shouldn't, this goes for every single investment.",

It may possible for people to think about that if sushi will be pumped so hard once bitcoin goes to the moon again. So many things are changing right now. I think that it would better to bet on uniswap or something else but good luck with your choice",

Well, the difference between alts and btc especially in bull season is btc will 100% moon to a new ath no doubt about that while alts are mostly under probability. So my friend, the profit margin may be higher with alts investment but with btc there is a guarantee that the price will pump as btc is the initiator of bull season.",

In case of sushiswap i have no idea if it goes back up or not. Or if competition eats their share and no one will be interested.And even if it would hit back to ath, just 25x isn't worth the risk. I rather gamble with unique projects and low cap newcomers. I am sure sushiswap has their own community but i wouldn't count it to be so strong that people wouldn't jump ship to other winning projects.",

With the trend of a lot of new networks now, SushiSwap became also a big player for most of DeFi platforms especially also on layer 2 protocols Sushi Swap can be easily used for every new ecosystem which major on layer 2 protocols based on Ethereum.With the increase of DeFi activities, I believe Sushi Swap will stay and still key player on the next bull run together with Uniswap which is forked by Sushi Swap.",

However from $0.8 to $1.2, it is a good rally for $SUSHI in the last few months. It is a less impressive recovery than other altcoins but with uncertainty of Bitcoin, altcoins are facing big risk in near future.With a wide vision, I think $SUSHI will recover to $3 and from $1.2 to $3, it is a very good profit for investors but as said, it is long term. If you can afford for short term shocks by Bitcoin corrections, loading up $SUSHI around $1.2 is good.I agree with your vision for DeFi and SUSHI swap as well.",

Sushiswap I think is not going anywhere but most likely it won’t ATH again. There are many other projects which have that potential.
