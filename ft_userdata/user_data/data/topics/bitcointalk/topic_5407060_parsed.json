Elon is a big manipulator and he was the one who came up with this crazy idea to jump Tesla on to the crypto bandwagon, so it would make sense if he was the one directing them to unwind it. He might need some of that cash flow to start fighting a rather expensive court case, considering he needs to find $44 billion which he committed to buying Twitter. Either that or they do not consider it to be viable assets any longer, it's a perfectly valid strategy to cut your losses and attempt to recoup at least some money if you think it'll fall even further.",

I believe it is highly unlikely they needed the cash, keeping in mind their stock price is relatively stable at the moment, around 700$ per share.I'd dare the speculate that this was the result of pressure by some shareholders that thought it was a good idea to panic sell or perhaps this was a preventive measure in the advent of thougher environmental regulations against PoW cryptocurrencies and those companies that holds them. In any case, this only works as a reminder that there are people in this forum that are more authentic Bitcoiners holding a few satothis than a big company holding thousands of BTC.",

Could be dozens of reasons:From they want to expand in China and as we know China is anti BTCAs others have pointed out could be a large investor / fund wants them out of the financial market so to speak and in the car building market.Could be they are worried about something and they want to sell now so when they spend the money it does not look like they are selling because they had to.And so on. It's less then $1 billion US so not that much in the overall BTC market.-Dave",

What Musk did pumping and dumping bitcoin and saying that it's bad for the environment was a low level scam you'd expect from a street peddler, not a CEO of a big company. I mean, I think it's probably hard to argue that Elon is an exceptionally talented businessman, and definitely has some other very good qualities about him, in the intellectual field. So, I'm not going to take that away from him. However, the reason they likely sold was stakeholders, and public perception, rather than the issue of not believing in Bitcoin or wanting to say invested in Bitcoin. These days, reputation is everything, and especially for a car company that's trying to appear to be the greener of the alternatives. Supporting a currency which has had some very public negative news about energy usage isn't exactly the greatest look for them, even if the claims aren't that valid.",

And yeah, you could say that this is a business move on his part as he is moving his money right now to whatever purpose he thinks it may serve him and his company (maybe another venture or something).",

And as DaveF pointed out, \"you don't sell assets just to improve your balance sheet for no reason.\" So there must be something the company is up to.
