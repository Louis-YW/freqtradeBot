  "content": "Ok so my question is, is it possible to use multiple Tradingview Webhooks in a single Trade for example let's say our main indicator give us a buysignal now i want to wait for another indicator to give signal like some crossover and then maybe another indicator condition within like 5 minutes(so basically a condition of a limited time too) and if all conditions are met place a order. Now this will use multiple Webhooks and also time conditions like other indicator has to give signal within 5 minutes but even 3 commas allows only one tradingview webhook , it do give other conditions but i want to use multiple webhooks/conditions is it possible to do that?",

I thought it will be very easy to get answer here.Because this board is general and the possibility that reading is a beginner who does not understand what you are asking. So I suggest you post things related to trading on the following Trading Discussion board: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=8.0",

I thought it will be very easy to get answer here.maybe because there is no direct solution for your request (with a high probability of what Husna QA said, this is a beginners & help section, and it is hard to expect experienced traders to come and give answers to usually banal questions)going back to your problem, I would think in the direction of making my own trading bot, which will have this or a similar possibility. I know that the MT platform has a lot of advanced features, but it is basically simplified to forex trading.",

Use the \"Move topic\" feature at the bottom left of the thread.But, if you don't want to do it yourself, you can take advantage of the \"Report to moderator\" feature at the bottom right of the post.My suggestion is to use the first option first.",

It's the main point of this forum (to discuss and help each other) so don't be afraid to ask anything in the appropriate boards. Anybody who would try to ridicule you would be the stupid one.",
