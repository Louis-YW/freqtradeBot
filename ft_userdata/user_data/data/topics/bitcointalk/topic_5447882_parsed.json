Some of those projects have 50-100% annual inflation. Means that some of them can reach new level of adoption, ATH in volumes, ATH in marketcap and still not even being close to price ATH. As for the dex tokens in general, I believe that in 2021 it was a novelty and hence such spectacular gains. Even though the technology has aged a bit, I am still positive and in my opinion the returns on investment in good DEXs will be greater than the whole crypto market in general. The only thing that can threaten this is the attacks of regulators on altcoins.",

The dexes are the strenght of decentralization on defi projects. Without them the altcoin markets will be doomed. As far as I can see, the problem here isnt them but the community has been wrecked by previous landslide dumps last bull run. Apparently the nft era has gone down and those liquid tokens associated with them got fallen too. Maybe a new era and something new would keep them alive again and probably keep them to continue. But all in all, these dexes are important to trigger another bull run aside from bitcoin sky rocket time waiting.",

However, it is important to remember that the cryptocurrency market is highly volatile and can be affected by various factors such as market sentiment, adoption rates, technological advances and regulatory changes.Although the DeFi 2.0 model may have shown some weaknesses, the development and evolution of the DeFi ecosystem is still ongoing, and this token is at the forefront of that innovation. As such, they can continue to play an important role in the future of decentralized finance.",

The rest are just a replicate of this two giants and without the Defi hype coming back they can' survive.But the rest will need there to be another Defi hype in the next bull market for them to recover fully. Every bull market comes with its own hype so the attention will be shifted next bull market.I see lots of layer 2 projects coming up recently and I feel there'll be a hype on this projects with polygon and arbitrum leading the way. We also have AI trend still yet to hit its highest potential and I think we'll see that in the next bull market.",

Only a few altcoins and those are the exceptional ones that did recovered and have reached more than their past ATH.But the majority in speaking even if they're a very popular token from any of these defi or exchange token, once they've fell and dropped a lot.

If the role works well, the user will still use it and the value will recover over time. As for the ATH of each coin, I'm not sure they'll be able to surpass what they're used to, but I'm more optimistic about the returns they'll bring in the future.",

Therefore, I would not buy these tokens up to more than 5-7% of the investment portfolio. The popularity of decentralized exchanges will grow, keeping some tokens (1 inch) on the wallet helps to reduce exchange fees.",

      "body": "I think the future of DEX in the crypto market is very potential and there will be strong growth in the near future. Like traditional exchanges, DEXs allow users to exchange their cryptocurrencies with each other, but unlike traditional exchanges, DEXs do not require intermediary control from a third party. This reduces security risks and increases the transparency of the transaction process. This makes the DEX an attractive solution for those who want to trade freely, without the paperwork, bank accounts or high fees required to use the services of a traditional exchange. With all these benefits, I believe that DEX will continue to grow and become the main means of exchange in the crypto market in the not too distant future. So if the above DEXs meet such criteria well, the tokens of the projects will also benefit without a doubt.",

Simply because these tokens start from small circulating supply then later own increase until the max supply was reached. All start-up project has the tokenomics of releasing the total supply in tier throuh specific time table. This token manage to reach all time high when their token supply is at the lowest level. Right now most of them increased there total supply to optimum level which is the main culprit for the continuous price decline.Unless this project has a deflationary mechanism to decrease the total will make reaching ATH again possible. DeFi hype is almost over due to scarcity of liquidity that coming from VC money. Banks are struggling which is the main source for capital so I doubt that DeFi will be prosperous again without the liquidity that they need.",

Furthermore, these cryptocurrencies have established large communities, and when the bull market returns, we can expect people to flock back to these projects to earn some decent profits.Nevertheless, predicting the crypto market's behavior is always a challenge since the nature of crypto is volatile.
