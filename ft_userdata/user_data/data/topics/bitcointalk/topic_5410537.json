  "content": "The conflicts between Russia and Ukraine have brought with them quite a delicate controversy for mining companies, many of which have chosen to withdraw from Russia to avoid any mishap, but doing so brought with it significant losses. SBI Holdings was one of these companies that decided to partially stop mining operations just at the moment when the conflict between these two nations began. This fact caused them to lose approximately “2400 million yen”. Furthermore, according to data extracted from the “BTC.com” blockchain:QuoteSBI Crypto mining hash rate plummeted around 40% from 5,600 petahashes per second (PH/S) in mid-February to 3,300 PH/S on August 18, 2022.Despite the fact that this country was one of the largest cryptominers in the world, circumstances have led them to decide to withdraw completely from Russia. Could the SBI present losses again? Taking into account the current situation of bitcoin mining, could withstand the blow?Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/sbi-lost-40-of-hash-rate-after-stopping-mining-in-russia-data",

Be it for political reasons like this, or the quest for cheaper or more reliable power or unfriendly regulations it's going to keep happening. The ones that plan ahead and have good business plans will survive, others will failIt is worthy to put into consideration that at all time high, total mining hashrate from Russia is less than one from China in contribution to total global mining hashrate.So let's assume this migration has any short term effect that should be smaller than what happened with the Great Mining Migration from China 2 years ago. Finally, things are fine from that migration, so no worry about Russia Mining Migration.Despite of some weaknesses and bias factors from data collection methodology, you can check this topic. Just to have a historic view.After a few months of China crackdown on mining. Check it out!",

After all there was an extra electricity capacity that was being converted to money and is not anymore. So they can either attract another mining farm with cheap electricity or start buying ASICs slowly and fill that gap themselves.",

Ignoring international norms and excessive cruelty, of course, causes outrage in the international community and therefore many foreign companies seek to leave Russia even if they suffer material losses. Perhaps the tightening of legislation regarding cryptocurrencies, as well as the controversial attitude of top officials of Russia to the mining of cryptocurrencies on its territory, played an important role here. But such an ending is generally natural. Russia is now rapidly turning into a pariah country with which self-respecting companies do not want to do business.",

Moreover these companies know that situation is only going to worsen off which is why they are just trying to move out so that at least can save them further recurring losses even if all of this comes at a big one-time cost.  I think more and more companies from Russia would eventually do these things if all this doesn't stop for next few months to come",

They could even make money from it.Well, they have the hardware already so they won't have to pay for that, but moving it will mean that they will get both a bit \"down\" time that will be profit loss, and there will be moving costs. Aside from that, what are they going to lose? Nothing.In return, they could get a ton of help and money from some governments to build solar panel stuff or even wind turbine which would be too big but would be very profitable and they would get money, plus they will get tax breaks as well for doing that which will mean they will profit even more in the long term.",

More than a thousand large companies have already left Russia because of the war it unleashed in Ukraine. In Russia, both exports and imports are sharply reduced. Sanctions isolate it from the outside world. The Kremlin has long understood this and is now desperately looking for a way out between a bad and a very bad option for her to end the war. Even the citizens of Russia have already understood this, they are fleeing this country and taking capital with them. Every month they withdraw more than four billion dollars from Russia, and this situation will not only continue, but also grow. The process has been launched and will continue by inertia even when Putin decides to withdraw his troops from Ukraine and the sanctions are eased.",
