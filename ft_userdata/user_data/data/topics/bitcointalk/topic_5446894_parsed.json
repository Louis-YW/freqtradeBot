Bitcoin is the less volatile coin, I still find it difficult to use leverage more than 5x, while I prefer 3x. I prefer 2x for altcoins. It is better not to even use leverage for some altcoins. When I started to trade, I went for 125x, I lost all my money. I used 10x, not that good. I do not use more than 5x now. If I am very sure of the market, but not common, I can go for 10x and not going beyond. 10x is very volatile and not advisable too, only for special time you are more than sure that market is going towards your direction.",

      "body": "if the volatility maybe cryptocurrency is greater volatility compared to forex. the greater the leverage in forex, the greater the risk, so that most traders hold transactions until they experience a margin call. for beginners I think a leverage of 1:200 is good, that way we will be able to learn discipline, and look for opportunities that really have a small risk, because if we hold it while it's floating minus, it will stopout automatically, so our capital is safer , because there may still be several trading opportunities again, all of this is closely related to trading psychology",

So to trade high leverage is advantage if you know how to manage your risk because you have more borrowed money to trade for your benefit.",

If you use leverage in trading, a small move in the market will be very profitable, but the opposite is also true if the market goes in the direction against you. 1;1000 leverage is extremely risky especially if you are a beginner. Mostly used is 1:100 and 1;500 leverage but it also depends on your lot size. The smaller your lot size and the smaller your leverage, the lower the risk. It's a bit difficult to understand, so you need someone to assist you if you are a beginner. That's one of the reasons why people don't think about entering forex.",

But we also know that it's also a bad way to lose when the market is against your position. Forex has better leverage xx than crypto. It's risky but fun at the same time when you just have less money to roll. I remember with $200 capital, I can earn $1 per pip, and sometimes the market swings up to 70 pips a day, especially on the days where there are terrible news and nonfarm payroll days.",

Most days forex pairs trade maybe 50 pips or so. So if you trade a standard lot which is 100,000 units you would make $10 a pip which is $500.So with 1000x leverage you would only need $100 or so depending on the pair to open the trade. And you would get stopped obviously when it goes 10 pips against you. Probably less due to spread and margin requirements.",

Also, it depends on the strategy and accuracy of trading of the trader, yet it would be appropriate to mention that leverage is better reduced for better account planning and safety. There is no way a trader would call himself a good manager of his account with high leverage, it's certainly detrimental to the success of such a trader.Some desperate brokers will allow as much as 1:3000 leverage, I wonder what a reasonable trader would do with that. Conclusively, the best leverage should not be higher than 1:200 if such traders are planning their money and risk management properly.",

If you understand the way to trade crypto then you can apply it to forex because it is same mode of action and same indicators to help and guide you.In my own perspective, you can't totally apply your strategy from crypto to forex. First of all, cryptocurrency is very volatile but forex is not so much. Due to the small market capitalization of crypto, the price can be manipulated a lot. Like when you trade in crypto, you think the manipulation is only here but it's not, then you think the market has normalized but it suddenly goes back to the top to get liquidity again where stoploss of small traders were place before the price continues. That's what I've experienced in crypto trading, but in forex there's still manipulation, but it's not so difficult to see where the manipulation is. That's why you can't totally use your strategy in crypto to forex unless you backtested it and modify your strat. There's one thing that what I really like in crypto is that it can possibly make people rich in no time.",
