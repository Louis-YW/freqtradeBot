  "content": "Having a social media handle that is the same on every social media platforms will enhance your brand equity and makes it easier for users to find you. It makes the marketing process easier and simpler. If you have a different handle for every platform, people will be confused if that is the same brand. Getting a domain name with a matching handle will allow users to find your betting platform more easily. That shows high level of business preparedness and professionalism. What’s more, it’ll make printed marketing materials clearer and memorable.",

You're trying hard to sell your domain at a very good price I Google and see if there is information about the domain you're selling and this is what I see, see no information about the voting if it was done in an online public voting poll And checking a tool for the projected price of a domain and this is the result, so don't expect that you're going to sell it for thousands of dollars, but you're one lucky guy if you sold it at the price you want.",

      "body": "I don't think it matters much, but if you can find a domain name that suits your casino, it will allow you to compete with other casinos and be less competitive. Usually, the domain name is chosen by something related to the business you want to build and if it is about gambling, the choice of a domain name will use the word gambling or something related to the game or crypto. After that, for marketing, they can use the brand and if they can provide good service, people will bookmark the website so they can directly click and visit it.",

I mean they could have turned primedice into a casino as well, they didn't need to buy stake, and they bought it for a pretty cheap price if I am not wrong, cheap compared to what they are doing with it right now of course.But, they bought it because they believed that if they had a good brandable name, they could be working everywhere, and they got handles for it as well on social media. If you can buy a name like that, which is both English and brandable that would be perfect. If not, then do not go with xxxdice and put whatever there, or anything like that, make it reasonable and related to the topic.",

He thinks he will target the right audience but I think that most of us here are not planning to create our own site but most of the users here are just posting because they can relate on some topics and most of all is to earn something because they are enrolled in a signature campaign. Posting the stuff that he is going to sell in the link posted by @acroman08 is already a big thing as there are buyers that visits that section.",

It's confusing and out of style.For what, you name your website and it's on Facebook and then it will be a different name on Twitter. Well, that doesn't really make sense right?

Those who might believe the ideas or things they create are more important than the identity of those who created them.Over the long term, some of the gambling accounts I followed turned out to be scammers. Others ended up losing money and deleted. Having a consistently profitable name in the gambling industry is a badge of honor reserved for very few.",
