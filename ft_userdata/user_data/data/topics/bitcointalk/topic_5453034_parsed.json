There are a lot of natural resources on African lands; crude is not just the only thing, as you have stated, and these resources are being secretly and openly extracted either by the country's government or private entrepreneurs. But the question here is: what are those resources made from selling out those resources used for? To me, it's not about having those resources or even knowing the worth of those resources; it's about how those resources are being used for the betterment of the nation and not for the enrichment of the leaders. Talking about Nigeria exporting their crude overseas for refining is not because the country lacks the capacity to set up a working refinery, which they can use to do that, or they lack the knowledge of doing so; all I see here is greed. For the country to own an active refinery, it means a lot of private individuals who are also government officials won't be benefiting from exportation. There are about three private exporters of crude who are making a heavy sum from it, and they will always try every possible way to make sure that their earnings remain. Let's watch and see what will happen if the Dangote proposed refinery is concluded and commissioned, and if there will be a little change even though it is a private refinery.",

We can follow the example of Qatar, a small country in the Middle East that has become one of the most economically powerful countries in the world today, relying solely on its natural resources.  African governments should think about how to extract the natural resources that Africa has from nature. Because natural resources are endless, if they can extract natural resources well, then they can export those resources to different countries and the economic system of their country will be strengthened a lot.",

They have mineral resources but lack the technology and machines to mine and process them, this is the situation in most poor countries. Instead, they look to developed countries that have the technology to help them do that, and of course, the developed countries will take advantage and find ways to keep their distance so that they have more benefits. I think the 3rd world countries rich in mineral resources will find it difficult to self-exploit and produce in the future, the great powers will find all ways to restrain and make poor countries dependent on them. That's why the world still has huge disparities between countries.",

Africa is blessed with natural resources but they lack the needed human resources. And the best personnel Africa needs is good political leadership. If the continent is ruled by right leaders it will lead to the development of economic manpower. The political class must make the right policies that will make Africa attract the right investors that will tap her rich resources. Africa needs foreign investments because the continent lacks the funding to turn its raw materials into finished products. Until this happens, Africa will continue to be a poor continent amid rich resources.",

If Africa can make use of their resources well, they will be more independent, free from indebtedness and indirect colonial system of other countries.From the story you have described, I can only conclude that there (in Africa) there is still a shortage of smart people to manage the resources that are already there. This means that what is still lacking there are human resources who can be relied upon to properly manage all natural resources and can provide benefits to every citizen who lives there. If you think about it, it's really unfortunate if the citizens there can't feel the slightest bit of prosperity in their lives through the results of the natural resources they have.And one more thing, isn't there a group of people or organizations admonishing the government to care more about their natural resources so that citizens no longer buy natural resources imported by other countries into Africa? The problem is that natural resources that are very useful like that can clearly change countries in Africa to become more independent even though they don't immediately develop at a greater level. So this is where the concern of the government must exist so that every problem can be resolved properly and correctly.",

Nigerian situation is just not understandable, a capitalist system that encourages monopoly. It is appalling the rate of corruption and that pulls down the political will to take political actions and decisions. Africa is rich in natural resources but the leaders are only rulers who are interested in pride, embezzlement and inhuman tenets for the masses. Particularly in Nigeria, for the records, all the states have a commercial deposit of natural resources but yet the economy is nothing to talk about because of corruption, vote buying and rigging to force unqualified people with no admiring administrative records in power who don't know their left from right and can not take proper and sincere investment decisions to harness these resources .

But here's a curveball: instead of focusing on the traditional extractive industries, why not shift your attention to renewables? Imagine the Sahara not as an empty wasteland, but as a solar power plant that supplies energy to not only Africa, but the entire world. What about countries that are primarily coastal using renewable energy sources like wind and waves?What about the oil industry? So it's the same as if you sold oranges but bought orange juice at a premium. Why not make your own fresh juice at home? Africa needs to find other uses for its oil than simply exporting its crude product. Simply invest in the necessary infrastructure, and the issue will be resolved.",

Some governments have mismanaged, abused, and abandoned these resources, preventing the populace from fully benefiting from them.There is definitely a squandered chance for economic progress and self-sustainability in Nigeria, where petroleum is refined abroad and imported at a higher price. The same holds true for other minerals that are not being handled properly, such as coal, salt, kerosene, gas, and petroleum.Greater independence and escape from the cycle of debt and foreign control may result if African nations are able to better harness and manage their resources. African countries have the opportunity to realize their full potential and advance the welfare of their population through building strong infrastructure, enacting sensible laws, and fostering accountability and openness in the management of natural resources.It is crucial that African governments give careful resource management first priority and foster an environment that promotes investment, innovation, and local participation. They can do this to get away from the indirect colonial systems narrative in history and open the door for sustainable growth and economic prosperity.",
