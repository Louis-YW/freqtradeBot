Firstly, Bitcoin provides a secure and decentralized way to gamble online, which is attractive to many gamblers who value their privacy and security. Transactions are processed quickly and can be completed without third-party intermediaries, making it a popular choice for online gambling sites.Another advantage of using Bitcoin for gambling is that it allows for more anonymity than traditional payment methods. This can be especially important for gamblers who wish to keep their gambling activities private.Furthermore, Bitcoin transactions are often cheaper and faster than traditional banking methods, which can save gamblers money and time.Many online casinos and sports betting sites now offer exclusive bonuses and promotions for Bitcoin users, which can provide gamblers with extra incentives to use Bitcoin for their online gambling activities.Can you tell us another advantage of opening an account in a Bitcoin Sportsbook?",

The advantage of gamble using Bitcoin, it's just minimize of getting target by criminals.",

That is true, but these are used by blockchain gambling sites, most gambling sites today are centralized, not decentralized. Most bitcoin gambling sites today's are requiring for KYC, no privacy. Quote from: nitrobetting on April 24, 2023, 03:34:18 AMTransactions are processed quickly and can be completed without third-party intermediaries, making it a popular choice for online gambling sites.Bitcoin transaction can be completed without any third party or intermediary, but most gambling sites like I said before are third parties. Quote from: nitrobetting on April 24, 2023, 03:34:18 AMAnother advantage of using Bitcoin for gambling is that it allows for more anonymity than traditional payment methods. This can be especially important for gamblers who wish to keep their gambling activities private.With the third party casinos, no anonymity and no privacy. Quote from: nitrobetting on April 24, 2023, 03:34:18 AMFurthermore, Bitcoin transactions are often cheaper and faster than traditional banking methods, which can save gamblers money and time.It may not be cheaper for local transactions on local casinos, but far cheaper than cross boarder transfers. But in gambling, what I have noticed is not how cheap the fee is, fiat local transaction that I have made before are zero transaction fee, but bitcoin transaction is processed faster, especially than the international fiat casino with wire transfer that can take over 2 weeks. Quote from: nitrobetting on April 24, 2023, 03:34:18 AMMany online casinos and sports betting sites now offer exclusive bonuses and promotions for Bitcoin users, which can provide gamblers with extra incentives to use Bitcoin for their online gambling activities.I think this is about the casinos, no the payment method used. Quote from: nitrobetting on April 24, 2023, 03:34:18 AMCan you tell us another advantage of opening an account in a Bitcoin Sportsbook?Sportbooks are bookmakers, they deal with sport betting, there are casinos that support bitcoin deposit and withdrawal. Also that some gambling sites can have both, I mean gambling sites with sportbooks and casino together.",

If one day somehow people decide to stop using bitcoin to purchase stuff for some reason -and that's not going to happen any time soon- we don't need to worry if bitcoin will lose its usecase. Gamblers will always demand bitcoin because it is -almost- anonymous, not regulated (in most countries anyway) and you don't have to do KYC on the casinos that don't deal with FIAT.",

Also the transaction is fast and anonymous as you have said and that makes it very interesting to those was don't want to associate themselves with gambling.The society serotype people that gamble so many won't want to be associated and if the fiats were been used, it'll be hard to not get associated either through depositing or withdrawals from the casino platforms.",

If you aim to play for decentralized casinos, you can go and play in grey areas where casinos are not that really bad but they are actually not accredited ones. So the chances of being scammed is quite high. Same with anonymity issue, it can still happen as long as you’ll play in KYC-free casinos.",

The other thing that I liked when it comes to using Bitcoin as means of gambling is the low amount you could input on every bet you will make. I think 17 satoshis is the lowest when it comes to sports gambling and 1-2 satoshis at casino games.For those who love long parlays like x1000, they could input a low bet to avoid getting rekt faster or they could try different types of bets and take the chances for a jackpot for just a small amount at risk.

Now we have a lot of casino's competing for that niche market, billions or dollars flowing every year.

The documents they required was a my passport and proof of residence. The so-called Bitcoin anonymity totally destroyed. For me the biggest advantage of Bitcoin in online casino or gambling is the ease of transactions. The convenience. There's assurance that I can get withdraw my winnings to my account even during the weekends. Another advantage for the player is that it helps to increase the knowledge and interest of regular people about Bitcoin. That is, if you were not so knowledgeable about Bitcoin but loved gambling, you'd want to know more about it. It is a plus for the gambler.",
