  "content": "As I take see am for twitter @truthfully83 concerning the whole woroworo(problems) wey we d experience for the country. I no weda em make sense as I wan share am here cos the matter too long. Raising from new naira policy, redesign, cashless policy, 2023 election and who Buhari d back to be our next president. QuoteFor the sake of these two , Buhari will do everything humanly possible within his powers, to see that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, their APC god, doesn't win the 2023 presidential election, through the back door. Buhari doesn't forgive, neither does he forget. The open betrayal of the process, by other Aspirants, in favour of Tinubu did not sit well with the likes of Ameachi, Osinbajo, lawan, & President Buhari. After voting, when the results trickled in, Buhari was seen to be virtually unhappy. But the president had his plans. The party primaries were over, Tinubu was declared as the winner, everyone returned back to their normal lives. So it was time for president Buhari to proof that he is truly the C-in-C, and Aso Rock still controls the political process in Nigeria.Buhari knew the likes of Elrufai, Ganduje, & co, can not win election, without riding on the backs of popular candidates, or vote buying. Because in their local domain, they are not popular without him. Many of them wouldn't have been governors, without Buhari in 2015.So Buhari promised to play his role as C-in-C, when the time is right. As they have denied him the right as president to choose his successor, they should also ensure that their candidate, wins the 2023 presidential election, through them. Under a free & fair electoral process.As far as he, president Muhammadu Buhari remains the president, he will deny their presidential candidate, all the instrumentality of states, including Federal might. That their candidate must win the presidential election under a free and fair electoral atmosphere.Tinubu became the new bride of APC politicians, he became the most important person in the party, as they all snubbed Buhari and Aso Rock, while they run and gather around Tinubu for political promises ahead of time. Even Tinubu himself also snubbed Buhari...As he shopped for his running mate, but Buhari wasn't bothered. If Buhari was to be informed of his vice presidential choice, he knows Buhari will never support a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Something Tinubu had proposed in 2015, but was vehemently rejected by Buhari.After settling for Kashim Shettima, and snubbing all the G9 governors, who stood by him, it was time to make political promises, and share positions to them ahead of time. For the real politics to begin. It was time to begin the real politics, on how to win the election.After trying all available permutations, on how to garner votes, to win the 2023 presidential election, the bulk eventually stopped at the front of President Mohammadu Buhari. As the most important person, Tinubu and the APC needs, if they must win the presidential election.Like dogs, those governors shamelessly returned back to Buhari, being led by Elrufai, to apologise to him, in order to make peace. To beg for his support as never before, so Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, can win the 2023 presidential election. Buhari in his usual way, told them that he is not against Tinubu as the APC presidential candidate, neither is he against any of them. But what he will promise them is, Tinubu must contest and win the presidential election, in a free & fair atmosphere, without external advantage.Fearing for any uncertainty, Tinubu through APC governors, strategically distributed almost a trillion naira in cash, all around the country, for vote buying purposes. Because he was hell bent on winning the 2023 presidential election, no matter what.Emiefele being the Governor of CBN, got wind of the information, on how Tinubu, through APC governors have strategically distributed raw cash all around the country, for vote buying purposes. He took the information to Buhari, and showed him proof. Buhari was furious, but there is little or nothing he could do, because those governors had immunity protecting them, by the constitution. So Emiefele suggested a currency redesign, to stop them, and many more like them who are hoarding the naira from circulating.Currency redesign was long overdue, coupled with security reports before Buhari, on how bandits, kidnappers, militants, terrorist, and politicians are hoarding the naira, from circulation. Reducing the 3.32 trillion released by CBN into circulation, to just 500 billion only. Buhari hurriedly approved Emiefele proposal. To properly checkmate Tinubu and his vote buying Governors. The currency was hurriedly resigned, with just colour changes to the big denominations, with fewer amounts released into circulation, to quickly chackmate those politicians. Buhari gave Emiefele the approval to draft policy implementation, that will make vote buying almost impossible with the new naira note. That he will stand by him. That was why cash withdrawal limit, was added. To checkmate Tinubu, APC govs, & all those hoarding cash to buy votes. That reason why no matter how Nigerians cry, Buhari is not ready to shift grounds, to allow the use of those old currencies. Because he has concrete proof, as to how Tinubu through governors had strategically distributed raw cash, for vote buying. Despite court pronouncementLink for the ogbengeh information: https://mobile.twitter.com/Truthfully83/status/1627031529619685376Wetin be una take for this matter as the truth don reveal em self of how the kasala for the new naira notes and old currency take happen",

How much politicians dey give people for polling unit to buy vote… e no dey pass 10k so this stopping electoral fraud issue na story for the gods.

If we are to go by this news and it happens to be real then my assumptions were all correct as it is because of one man the whole country is going through this currency swap issues. I have had this thought over and over again what prompted this act from the president to approve the currency redesign by this time? Wouldn't have been better they did it earlier 2022 but it was towards election they had to hurriedly redesign the currency for swapping. I had sensed this for long now but some how it will check mate financial activities in the country and for those who are preparing for vote buying, it would not be business as usual. The game has changed, go win your election fir yourself without vote buying.",
