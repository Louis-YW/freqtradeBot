So, the difficulties of driving it are different. It is possible to strengthen the super cars by modifying them. Super cars are designed as realistically as possible in the possibilities that mobile devices allow.https://thebend.io/storage/2022/03/2.jpg The km features of the super cars are active. In other words, the first maintenance of the car should be done when it reaches 150,000 km. If it is not done, some of its features will decrease in percentage in races. When the super car reaches 300.000 km, heavy maintenance should be done. The mileage will be reset after heavy maintenance of the super car is done. The fuel feature of the super cars will also be active. If the super cars win in the big race, + points will be added to the features of the winning super car. Super cars can be damaged in races. RACESThere will be 5 types of modes in the races. LEAGUE MODEFREE MODEDUO RACE MODEQUADRA RACE MODEGRAND TOURNAMENT https://thebend.io/storage/2022/03/Screenshot_2022-03-24-11-53-09-370_com.DefaultCompany.TheBend.jpgThe features of the super cars in the races, the ability of the user to use the super car and the luck factor will be effective. As super cars take damage, their efficiency will gradually decrease, if they take more than 50% damage, they will be out of the race. For the car to participate in the next race, it must be repaired in the garage.   WINNING STATIONSBetting races: Users will be able to race against each other in Duo and Quaternary Races with bets and the winner will receive the bet BEND token. Super Car GalleryHere, users will be able to buy, sell or rent super cars between each other.Since the number of super cars will be limited, users can add an X model super car to the market to sell or rent it to another user at the price they have determined, after we have sold the entire quantity limit determined for that X model. The prices will be determined entirely by the users themselves. NFT Super carsThere will be only one of these specially designed super cars and each will have its own NFT token. The person who owns the NFT token will be able to use whatever supercar the NFT token owns. BILBOARDS Billboards in the game can be rented out to users. If users wish, they can publish advertisements other than pornography on these billboards and earn a profit from the advertiser.  Grand TournamentHere all users can participate in this tournament. The races are in groups of 10 and continue until the final with the elimination method. Thousands of dollars are awarded to the first, second and third place winners in the final. These rewards are not paid out as BEND tokens. These rewards will be paid in Tether or BUSD. BEND TOKENIt is a token using the BSC network with a maximum supply of 1,000,000 to be used as a means of payment in the game The Bend. With the BEND token, you can buy and modify super cars and participate in races with it. BEND token will be used when selling or renting your super car. In your betting races, you can only set the number of BEND tokens as your bet. Only BEND token will be used as a payment tool when renting billboards and then using them for other advertisements. If you win the big tournament, we will pay you in BUSD or TETHER. The reason for this is to prevent the winner of the race from creating a dump by selling these tokens if we give the prize as BEND tokens. If there is a user who wants it as a BEND token, he can buy the BEND token with the BUSD or TETHER award we will give him.",

Players will buy them with BEND tokens ? I see a download section on the site, but it leads to nowhere. Question appears - players will have to download a game and do steering and etc by themselves, or each race will be random? Player will have to simply join race and wait for results? Last but not least - what KYC is for ? Players can buy BEND tokens on a DEX, but will have to pass KYC to play? This will ruin this game.",

      "body": "What's the purpose of gradually releasing 2,500 token monthly for 100 months? First, the amount is almost insignificant to the circulating supply that it'll affect current price or buying power, second, 100 months. Really? You're that confident of your project that you're so she it'll still be around after 8+ years?",

I'm sure they're doing an early release, still preparing some important documents for everyone to learn about their project and are focusing on some listing websites like Coinecko. If you're asking about how their app is or how the game is I think we can only see the pictures for now, because what I see they will be releasing the app probably in Q4 on their roadmap.",
