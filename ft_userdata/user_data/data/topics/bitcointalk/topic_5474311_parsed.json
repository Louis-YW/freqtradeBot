You are just telling us your plans or project you are establishing in the background which doesn't concern anyone on what you are saying, and for a newbies like you with no activities on bitcointalk to post a bounty here it's a RED FLAG",

Do these tokens have value and are being traded, or do you plan to gain value for them by trading on the DEX before trying to add them to any CEX?To promote here, you need to purchase a copper membership to show photos, send money for a guarantee, or ask a campaign manager to manage them. Campaign costs vary according to the quality of posts and the number of participants, but $500 per week is the minimum and extends up to $6,000 per week.",

Since its like a part of marketing to ask something then you put a twist about explaining something about that. Just create a ANN thread then try to indicate the whole information about your project then let people ask there these questions. But if you really want to have an idea about posting a bounty then better go to bounty section of altcoin section. There's a lot of post their that can give you some information about how those manager work with those programs. Or you can hire a bounty campaign manager to help you out manage your campaign if you don't really know how to handle it. Also you can ask for advices on these people about what other methods they use to maximize the exposure of their past projects.",

Because every bounty program certainly has a concept that is being developed so that the direction is clear and the road map is also neatly structured with goal stages that will be completed in stages. But if you just want to give away coins for free through a bounty program, I think you need to tell where the coins can be exchanged so that the participants who take part in your bounty can feel the money and buy whatever they want.",

I'm not being judgemental here but frankly speaking, most of this project are not reliable at all. Of course, I know all altcoins are not reliable but at least there should be a sign of truthfulness and honesty between the team, investors and the promoters. Some of this project are just out there to scam investors. Checking through the website and from the information it contains, I see no difference quality from what I said earlier. It seems OP is the CEO of the project and not replying to some concern issues here is passing some messages.Sadly, the hungry hunters are out there to promote anything that comes their way without doing single research on the project. Perhaps, they care less because most of them are spamming with this project and that project on social media platforms.",

But the problem is that we can't discuss further about what you want to look for because you didn't try to explain in more detail. If you intend to promote the tokens you create through a campaign, perhaps you can visit more relevant boards because there will be many people discussing there appropriately and accurately, our forum has boards that are relevant on one issue to another.Many people have suggested accuracy regarding the posts you make and if you intend to develop them maybe there will be much more focus there. I also want to suggest one thing and that is when you are serious about developing this then don't create scam coins because it will not give you anything much bigger.",

Most of the tokens that are promoted as a result of the bounce campaign do not make it to the market and most of the tokens are unsuccessful. There are many Bounty Managers who have been managing Bounty for three to four years but they have no news of payment and if they have sent payment from any project then that payment is not useful to Bounty Hunters. There are some other ALT coins in the market including Ethereum BNB which are successful to catch but these coins never give you bounty as reward but can give you token as reward which token value less.
