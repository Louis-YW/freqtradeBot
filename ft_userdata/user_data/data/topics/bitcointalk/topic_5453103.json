From what I understand, WordPress is primarily used for blogging and content creation, similar to platforms like Blogger or Medium. It's hard for me to imagine a legitimate exchange operating on WordPress unless it's a scam or phishing attempt posing as a legitimate exchange.And as for the Cookie Consent Plugin, I don't see what it has to do with any of the above.",

Thank you for your time and assistance!Now there is a large-scale KYC implementation throughout the exchange platforms. So, I'm sure, things like VPN, consent etc can affect the availability of these resources. All the exchange platforms get large profit, and large profit without legal issues is impossible, that's why KYC tends to appear everywhere.",
