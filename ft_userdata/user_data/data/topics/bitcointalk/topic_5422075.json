  "content": "Why aren't w talking about the biggest scam in crypto currently Everyone seems carried away, with the issues of FTX Exchange, Every single day, a lot crazier things are happening everywhere, yet everyone is talking about FTX, Just in case no one knows, The ethereum foundation just basically rugged everyone that staked their ETH for ETH 2.0 rewards before the \"merge\". On my research hundreds of stakers can no longer withdraw their stake Eth or their earned EthIt's been noted that the ethereum foundation quietly erased the timeline, Why they had set up on their website for the people who staked their ETH for ETH 2.0 rewards. Currently everyone's ETH is struck on a smart contract with no roadmap or timeline for when they'll be getting their assets back which is absolutely worrisome With the expect withdrawal time frame unknown, it will amazing you to realized that few weeks back there was a news that the Creator/Founder of ETH sold a massive bags oc ETH, and lot more and other shocking information were all exposed. With the current situation of things revolving around the Crypto space, one just need to be extremely careful with this big names players.

Don't get tricked by centralized shitcoin who offer staking option that will make you to earn money without doing anything, you're just like leave your coins on the exchange.",

We need to keep spreading the news how unsafe centralised exchanges are if we want crypto adoption to be better, this FTX mess have ruined some reputation that crypto have managed to build in the past years. We don't want this to keep happening.",

Quote from: Solosanz on November 18, 2022, 08:12:52 AMBecause a real Bitcoin enthusiast wouldn't ever bought a centralized shitcoin,I tend to agree, but if you like to stake in a high risk that's easy to make money, altcoin/shitcoins are the best for you. But, don't put a large amount as your investment in the long term, just stick to Bitcoin which gives the true meaning of a decentralized network that's far from centralized that everyone has a fear of now.Remember always the golden rule in crypto \"Not your keys, Not your coins\".",

Most of the forum user are interested only on Bitcoin and centralized drama like this usually happening on social which is the hot spot for shit coin and pump/dump trader.Quote from: Solosanz on November 18, 2022, 08:12:52 AMI always say top 10 coins on Coinmarketcap or Coingecko is useless, they just rank it based on the marketcap, not from the utility, decentralized and trustworthy. Don't get tricked by centralized shitcoin who offer staking option that will make you to earn money without doing anything, you're just like leave your coins on the exchange.Yeah, It’s useless to use coinmarketcap or coingecko ranking since they are market aggregator and not a review website. But categorizing a worth it token based on utility is very objective and obviously no one can come to the right ranking that will be approved by all crypto user. The ranking based on marketcap is the appropriate way since it shows where the money is. A project with solid whitepaper but without any capacity to materialize it is still shit coin imo.",
