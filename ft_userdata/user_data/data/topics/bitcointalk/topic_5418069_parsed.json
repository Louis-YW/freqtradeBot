      "body": "I think what we can learn from this is that Bitcoin Derivatives can be a great tool for traders and investors to manage their assets properly. Yes, financial derivatives are still traded on a formal exchange with capital market companies. In a perfect world, economic derivatives would not. 1 way to store value and protect wealth. But I'm not sure if it's possible, whether we will see Bitcoin Derivatives on stock exchanges in the near future or over the next ten years because many people are afraid of their money being kept and not under government control.",

Most people won't know what you're talking about if you ask about derivatives but if you ask about futures it will ring a bell. In short, futures are a way for people who don't want to touch bitcoin for various reasons to speculate on its price. It's like cheat trading where you place a bet on the price of an assert without trading it. It's understandable when you're into very expensive things like real estate and want to speculate on the market but don't have enough money to own a property and also don't want to invest in shares of a company that does. With Bitcoin that is easy to buy, divisible, more or less anonymous, the reasons why someone would choose futures over the real thing are lame. Is it the future of money? Bitcoin is, but betting on its price is not. How do you want to change anything and support this revolution if you're afraid to own bitcoin?",

      "body": "I mean Bitcoin Derivatives can be a kind of Bitcoin Bonds that could be the future of money. Bitcoin is virtually or literally an electronic financial  instrument, which is official an electronic banking check. Bitcoin is cryptographically signed for secure transaction and safe keeping in the Blockchain Ledger. BdCBitcoin Derivatives is a future of money under a new Protocol soon will be implemented for scalling Bitcoin. It might become Bitcoin Derivatives Credit or Contract. (BDC) in the near future will open a new financial market for distribution of Bitcoin based other financial products. When the Governments will introduced the CBDC then BDC can play role along with to play a drama which the Central Bankers is utterly unaware of. If finally the Central Banks globally issue the CBDC then that will be a great opportunity for Bitcoin Big Bang. Belive me the Central Banks are going to commit suicide after they introduce the CBDC. They are planning to over take Bitcoin with CBDC but that will not be the case. I have other plans, if it tries to collide and suppresse Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. As you know Governments are trying to regulate Bitcoin in the UK and In the USA. How they Re going to regulate it when they have no power over Bitcoin ? The Bitcoin is the decentralized  electronic banking check, under the financial rules, the government cannot regulate the banking check. They can only regulate the bank but not bank issued check. You all need little more financial literacy to fully understand about decentralized financial service and Bitcoin the electronic cash system. Only Governments allowed to regulate what Governments have issued from Central Bank. We form government for good governance but Governments and the central continously debating our money by Q.E. and inflating the financial market with tones of paper cash. Now they are trying to fool the public with CBDC. Governments has no rights to authorise order to the bank to pickpocket our money. We want the financial system should be decentralised forever. We will pay taxes for Governments to manage the good governance affairs.  Governments must adopt Bitcoin for collecting taxes. This is good for government. We don't want any bandits Governments controll our financial system. Let's work together and fight for our economic right.",

      "body": "Bitcoin derivative trading is used by traders, it is used to maximise profit or loss in a way buyers and sellers enter into a contract of an underlying asset which is bitcoin. Which means the traders are not actually trading the real bitcoin, but speculating on the future price of bitcoin using derivative contract. That is why the actual price of bitcoin is not the same but slightly different from the derivative price of bitcoin.Quote from: Aanuoluwatofunmi on October 24, 2022, 07:28:07 AMDon't get this wrong OP, your question is fine and ok but you don't need to persuade anyone to writing on your thread just to receive compensation for their contributionsCompensation is not against any rules on bitcointalk, only begging is against one of the rules.
