The level to which a nation and its citizens are enlightened and educated, as well as the poverty level in that nation, can be reduced to a minimal level but can't be eradicated. Quote from: Black susano on March 17, 2023, 03:13:20 PMBitcoin has helps the poor by Increasin their savings and access to capital also it has help around 1.7million people in my country and also it has also impoverished people to control their investment.Don't you also think Bitcoin can make more people in your country poor than they could ever imagine if they are not properly educated about the currency? What if the people, someone who has just a thousand dollars, make a move to buy Bitcoin at this current price of $26,400 with the hope to see $30,000 next week but the market turns against him instead of $30,000, he/she ends up seeing $20,000 without proper knowledge the holder move and sell out his/her holding, will you say Bitcoin has helped him escape poverty or helped him increase his poverty level?Bitcoin can serve as an investment, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will push poor people out of poverty in an instant. I hope you note that Bitcoin is not a get-rich-quick scheme.",

While Bitcoin may have some benefits in helping individuals control their investments and increase their savings, it is not a panacea for poverty eradication. It's important to continue to work towards creating sustainable and inclusive growth through various initiatives and policies to address poverty at the national level.",

Poverty can be reduced through infrastructural development, employment generation, education, foreign direct investment, and security. People need to be educated to understand bitcoin, they need to be employed to invest in bitcoin and they need adequate infrastructures to engage in bitcoin transactions and trading. Bitcoin might be part of the option to lift people out of poverty but it is not the only solution. Bitcoin needs an enabling environment for it to deliver some of its dividends.Before I forget, if you stop corruption, most nations will become developed. The government must be sincere and give its citizens freedom to choose their economic paths.",

Additionally, Bitcoin's value is highly volatile, which means that it can lead to both significant gains and losses for investors. Therefore, it may not be a reliable source of income or savings for people living in poverty.Bitcoin may have some potential to help alleviate poverty, it is unlikely to be a comprehensive solution to the issue. It is important to address poverty through a range of measures that address the root causes and provide long-term solutions for sustainable development.",

Bitcoin is not created for this purpose, so I don't expect that if you adopt Bitcoin you'll be out of that poverty because it will still depend on you, it will still depend on how you deal with this market. Bitcoin is too risky and too volatile, there's no assurance on making money so if you invest without the right knowledge, you might become more poor because of that.",

Poverty means you are not able to help yourself as an individual, so how much do a poor person have to invest in bitcoin and grow it to an extent to make huge profit and how many years can that be, 4 years, 8 years or 12years depending on the time of halving? A poor person barely feed from hand to mouth and won't have savings for investment. How much fraction of Satoshi you need to invest thereof.

Please help me with it? I understand people who would have bought Bitcoin luckily at a lower price have made good gains but this doesn't means all the poor got access to it. Also it's just like stock market when it comes to price appreciation so if a poor person would have put money into stocks as well the his fate would have been same only. So I don't agree that it has alleviated poverty of any nation or even 30% of poverty sticken people of any nation.",

To think that this industry could cure the long term problem is absurd. Indeed this industry is profitable but think of the people around you; not everyone is an investor for a reason. It could be because they are aware or afraid of risk because they cannot afford losing or because they don't have that amount for them to put into risk.

I think they need to find a way to get more money first, be comfortable and then invest and save. You do not get rich by saving alone, people should understand this. Bitcoin cannot end poverty, it can reduce the number of people and prevent some people from fallen back under the poverty line. If a poor person thinks that his small investment in bitcoin is enough to turn his fortune, he is only living in fantasy.Bitcoin alone cannot end poverty. There are many causes and factors that result in poverty, and until those factors are addressed, poverty will continue to exist.According a publication I just read because of curiosity to know the many causes of poverty, there are nine major causes of global poverty:Quote- INADEQUATE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND NUTRITIOUS FOOD. - LITTLE OR NO ACCESS TO LIVELIHOODS OR JOBS. - CONFLICT. - INEQUALITY.- POOR EDUCATION. - CLIMATE CHANGE. - LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE.- LIMITED CAPACITY OF THE GOVERNMENT.- LACK OF RESERVES.I found some of these causes interesting and difficult to believe until I read in details. If it interests you, you can read in the details the nine major causes of poverty HERE.",

Poverty is a big thing for most countries that are known can't tackle this problem. And there are rich countries as well but still have some bit of percentage of poverty through their citizens that lives far from the city.  Dealing with poverty is so hard and it shouldn't be just taken by the people who are on that line but also the government has to do something about it. It's not new that there are a lot of bitcoin holders that have been on that line until they believed that bitcoin is their life saver and it did when the price went up.Financially, they've been in a better situation and dealing with it still will depend on the person that owns bitcoin. Because he may have bitcoin and seems to be financially free but, if he's not capable on it and doesn't have the financial education on how he will expand and retain that wealth, it will be useless because he might just spend all of his profits for nothing.",

The thing is, before anyone profits from Bitcoin, they must invest money in it or get jobs that pay in Bitcoin.  Bitcoin can help alleviate one's status if they have something to invest in it.  But the problem is the majority of poor people don't have much money to invest in Bitcoin nor have the knowledge to participate in Bitcoin jobs and freelancing.At the national level, how can Bitcoin end that country's poverty issue if the government itself is banning Bitcoin?  Or let us say they acknowledge Bitcoin but the people who are in authority are corrupt.  The problem of a nation can only be solved by the government, Bitcoin may help in the forms of tax revenue from the start-ups or new bitcoin companies establishing their business on that country but I don't think that Bitcoin alone can end the poverty of a nation.",
