Every Altcoin plays a role even if it may not be immediately obvious to us?  Some of them did and still do play a role but most of them play a negative one.Quote from: The_funnycrab on December 16, 2023, 08:55:55 PMFor example, some species may appear to have no direct impact on the ecosystem, but they may still serve as a food source for other organisms or play a role in nutrient cycling.I presume you wanted to say some Altcoins serve as 'food source' for other Altcoins or play a good role in Pumps and Dumps.  This does not help Bitcoin in any way in my opinion.Quote from: The_funnycrab on December 16, 2023, 08:55:55 PMHowever, it's important to note that some species can become invasive and disrupt ecosystems, but even in these cases, they still have some impact on the ecosystem.Like Ordinals or what?  Most of the Altcoins are invasive species and disrupt Cryptocurrencies.  Particularly Meme Coins and all the other Shit Coins that pump to Heaven and beyond.Even now, I still do not get it.  What exactly did you understand about Bitcoin?  The best lesson you can take out of this thing you are saying is that Altcoins suck.",

      "body": "Yeah, I'm not really sure what the OP was getting at either.  Like, he randomly brought up something about the economy of community and getting creative, which seemed kinda out of left field and  and then he tried using this analogy about ecosystems that was just confusing instead of clarifying anything. I guess maybe he was trying to say it's important to have diversity and that even small things can make a big difference? But the way he explained it just made it hard to follow their train of thought.  I couldnt quite grasp the meaning from how he worded it.",

Give yourself a rest, it's been told for so many years and never happened and will never be. Bitcoin is the entire ecosystem here and the food chain lies to itself and all of these organisms you're saying will be eaten by it.",

Although it already there it can be seen by lot of people, if you are a good listener neither from the outdoor or indoor if someone should tell you I want to make an investment on crypto. Why didn't they go for the shitcoin ??  Many people always go for bitcoin because they know it impact not now only, but also in the future. Even though there's risk in it too but it has high impact than the shitcoins.It very good to know the impact of Bitcoin before you judge neither it equality with the shitcoins. They can never be.Quote from: Churchillvv on December 16, 2023, 09:22:58 PMWow   It sounds like I'm having a biology class or something! Like wtf?

Op This is not a biology class but he made something clear that is the crypto world itself. the OP didn't elaborate much about what he truly understands about bitcoin. the title thread has not been explained on what he said from his  statements. seemed that he just copied a random statements and created a thread title mentioning bitcoin. so the OP better edit his post and say about his take on bitcoin so we know what your opinions are and maybe help you a lil bit on that, how bout that?bitcon is not some kind of specie though.   but i can agree that right now btc market has somehow impact in our financial market as big stakeholders are onto this industry.",
