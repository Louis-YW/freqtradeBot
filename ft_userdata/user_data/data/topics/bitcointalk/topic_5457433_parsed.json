I \"closed\" my thread because I didn't have any collateral to put up. (BTW I still don't know how to use the site properly, so pardon me for that (:I don't wish to make myself look any worse than I already have so I'll leave it at that.I don't have friends that are willing to loan (It's considered taboo/selfish to ask someone for a loan, especially when it's only $100), and we don't have pawn shops where I live.Thank you for the suggestions though, appreciate it",
