      "body": "This is indeed an interesting topic, but @OP, *please* edit the uppercase!Let's now analyze your friend's arguments:1) \"BTC is not backed by any asset or business\". Not true. Bitcoin has the strongest ecosystem of all cryptocurrencies. There are lots of businesses working with it, exchanges, miners, merchants, other service providers, financial businesses (Grayscale etc.). And of course all the users and hodlers. Every Bitcoin bought by these entities, or on behalf of them, is the \"backing\" Bitcoin has.2) \"ETH and major alts have asset backing and real use cases\". I would take this with a huge grain of salt. Of course Ethereum has an important ecosystem too. But most of the services offered by the businesses working with ETH smart contracts are directed to a single public: people wanting to speculate with ETH tokens. For example, most DeFi projects are contracts where you exchange one token for another one, speculating which one could become more valuable. There are DEXes where the most valuable items are - other DEX tokens (circlejerk anywhere?  ). NFTs have a bit more real-world backing, but are also at the end used mainly for speculation. The way NFTs are currently used is also quite strange, often they seem not even contain a hash of the \"digital work\" they're representing. The only topic where I think ETH has indeed a better \"backing\" than BTC are stablecoins and derived assets. But the businesses assoaciated with them are often quite shady, so I don't know how \"valuable\" that backing may be (see the whole Tether controversy and of course Terra/Luna, even if it wasn't primarily ETH-based. Maker/Dai had problems too in the past, they may return.).In conclusion, I don't think that the \"ecosystem backing\" ocurring in ETH is stronger than Bitcoin's. I would argue the opposite.",

Coming to btc it's utility is the easy transferring and storage of value which no other asset outside Crypto world provides this is what is bringing btc's value.",

He's skipping the reality that bitcoin is the widely accepted cryptocurrency.

Btc does not have.Probably your friend has the wrong impression of what a true economical ecosystem is.Smart contracts can be used in some deals, but that doesn't mean they have an ecosystem it means they have applications for it, an ecosystem is a situation where each of the parties involved is interdependent on the other and can influence them, there is no real business other than some stupid jpg game that has anything close to resembling such a thing. Just because two people might want to make a deal that would be replicated in a smart contract doesn't mean they are forced to do it or they don't have the option of completely ignoring smart contracts and preceding in a traditional way, just as the entire world is doing right now!None of those businesses (tokens) are matching one of the main points in the definition, and that is a \"constrained\" space limited by borders or laws, just how tether can issue tokens with the same value on Tron and ditch Eth without a fuss all those systems can be recreated in an instant within a different border. None of the said parties is completely interdepended of the other one.Furthermore, 99% of the altcoins there are just participants in this mess, issuing tokens on a different chain, what's the backing they are receiving, at the end of the day every single token altcoin NFT and even Bitcoin is backed by only one thing, the trust of the people who would spend x amount on it, thinking that that's how much they are worth it, nothing else. Crypto kitties were valued in hundreds of thousands of dollars, now they are worth pennies, what's their backing power?",

This argument will always stay irrelevant, because it doesnât make sense to base basic business operations on a costly, centrally controlled, out of the businesses control and with no legal binding ledger when the business can achieve the same thing cheaper, more secure and better adapted to their needs themselves. They donât need ethereum or any other shitcoin to have smart contracts or more automated workflows(if they really need it at all), except if they wanna go bankrupt or give up part of control over their operations for no benefit. It doesnât make sense cost and operations wise, it does simply fail in practice and is actually inefficient. Thatâs why you donât see them do it, despite the hype, despite the technology being there since years. Ask the people who actually handle the finances, processes or tech stacks of businesses on this idea, let them do the calculation and not some people who are just interested in hyping up useless tokens and donât even run the use cases theyâre preaching themselves.",

This will also change relatively soon as we're transitioning into a digital world, and therefore a digital money system, which likely won't be backed by physical precious metals.

From that simple realization, which requires doing a lot of research, you may conclude that bitcoin being a convenient and efficient medium of exchange is the only use case bitcoin has and the only one that matters. Other use cases, such as a store of value or an asset for speculation, are just derivatives of that main one.

The exception are stablecoins - their value is the same as the value of a currency that they represent, although in some cases it's not guaranteed, especially with algorithmic stablecoins. Having a large ecosystem with many active users generates a lot of demand for a coin, which results in higher price. But altcoins don't really have big ecosystems, they merely pretend to have it.
