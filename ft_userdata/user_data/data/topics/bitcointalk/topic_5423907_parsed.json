JavaScript? This does not happen with forms on most other sites, JS or no JS.I don't know if this helps, but if I start a post, then click somewhere else (usually by mistake, no matter it's another topic or out-of-bitcointalk link), when I hit the back button my text is there, nothing is cleared.So my first idea would be that maybe there's something on your local browser. I see PX-Z has the same conclusion.Maybe you can try this with a fresh browser (either in VM, either a completely new browser than what you use on a daily basis). If it helps, I've tested this on both Chromium and Firefox.",
