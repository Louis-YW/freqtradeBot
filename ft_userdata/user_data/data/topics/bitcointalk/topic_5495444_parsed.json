  "content": "This stupid grandma Warren. A letter? Does this honorable senator want to increase American military presence in the middle east and escalate the situation into direct war because this grandma is anticrypto? Does she know what she is doing or is everything only because of corporate interests by her backers? Who are the biggest political campaign donators on this grandma? I will not be very shocked if much of them are people from the traditional banking industry.US senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Angus King (I-Maine) this week warned in a letter to government officials that Iran’s Bitcoin mining industry has created a revenue stream big enough to weaken the effects of economic sanctions.Crypto mining allows Iran “to purchase imports, move funds domestically and internationally, and fund Hamas” and other terrorist organisations, the letter said, adding that this “ongoing activity by the Iranian government threatens our national security.”The letter, citing numerous sources, noted that Iran is one of the world’s biggest Bitcoin producers, estimated to account for as much as 7% of the global market in 2021, when its mining revenue may have totaled $1 billion.It went on to say that “Iranian cryptominers are required to sell the crypto they produce to the Iranian central bank, which in turn uses the crypto to pay for imports and exports.”The letter was sent to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, questioning them on what the Biden administration was doing to deter Iran’s evasion of sanctions through crypto mining.Read in full https://www.dlnews.com/articles/snapshot/senators-say-iran-using-bitcoin-mining-to-evade-sanctions/",

The USA, as a country, doesn't accept Bitcoin, the USA hasn't also invented Bitcoin and what rights do they have to warn someone about the Bitcoin mining industry? If anyone has any right to warn someone, it's probably Satoshi but it's not even him because Bitcoin was created with the aim to be decentralized, with no central power.They are basically telling Iran that Bitcoin mining lessens the effect of economic sanctions and they should stop it to suffer from economic sanctions. That doesn't make any sense to me. How can I tell someone to stop doing something that's not my job or my invention? Haha.",

I wonder why there's still Americans cast their vote on those type of person since its like they are been dictated and don't have freedom to choose whatever they like especially on their investment. If the official of Iran is so weak then maybe they might get influence by what that Senators says or write to them. But hopefully they have the same stand the same with El Salvador President so they can shut down this entitled old skeptical officials and they should leave those miners since they are not on their jurisdictions anymore.",

The same set of senators raised the alarm that Hamas is been funded with cryptocurrencies. They are just surprised that Iran has been able to withstand Western sanctions. So they are just seeking means to place more sanctions on Iran with this Bitcoin mining claim. The contribution of Bitcoin mining to the Iranian economy is insignificant compared to the size of the economy. Considering the decentralized nature of Bitcoin, it will be difficult to stop Iran from gaining from Bitcoin mining. Quote from: bbc.reporter on May 06, 2024, 03:33:00 AMThis stupid grandma Warren.

Does she know what she is doing or is everything only because of corporate interests by her backers? Using the word stupid to depict a 74-year-old senator just because of her views about crypto might be inappropriate. As a lawmaker, her job is to propose laws and it is up to the house to determine if her position is good or bad. The reason for her constant attack on the crypto industry might be because of her ideology or negative perception of the industry.",

They will make more money and they will be able to fund their military even more, if Iran can mine 1000 BTC in a year, the US should mine BTC and get 10,000 in a year, foolish woman.

You know better than to hire someone with outdated views and ideas as stale as old bread, and yet why are these people still allowed to give a seat? Biden is the biggest example out here. The fuckwad is already 2 hard coughs away from kicking the bucket and he's still a part of the US presidential candidate run. Here in the Philippines it's pretty much the same thing really, but at the very least, we're seeing progress and more and more young adults are being provided their seats, biggest shining example of this is the Gen Z mayor of one of our cities here who did more in the few years he's in service than the guy before him who took the seat for idk, decades?",
