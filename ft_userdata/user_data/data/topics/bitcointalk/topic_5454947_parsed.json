Because if you don't strengthen your mind when facing the harshness of the market, then you really aren't ready to invest. If you only buy, you just sell, anyone can do it, but you can't necessarily control it fundamentally. The factor of people staying on the investment path is knowing what they are investing in, having certain goals and targets where they know when to take profits and when to accumulate asset value.",

For those that are starting to invest then investing into those assets are good and could be enough.With regard to finance, money, and investment, we need to consider many things. It is not always easy to make a buying or selling decision, even at the right moment. Because usually when you want to release or sell ownership, it often occurs \"Wait a minute, maybe in a few hours the increase will be more than now\" and in the end, the person loses selling momentum. Various types of investment assets depend on how high the risk is based on the fluctuation value. The higher the risk of the asset, the higher the profit you get. Unless you have a stable type of investment asset and don't experience a significant increase when it's bullish.",

For an average Joe who thinks that investing is as simple as OP makes it to sound will have their own bitter experience about making an investment in something you have little knowledge about. Worst situation is where they then decide to trust a third party individual to make and manage this investment for them that they have no proper knowledge about.

Here's my advice, invest only a small percentage of your income monthly in whatever you think that's gonna be worth of your risk. Let's say Bitcoin, invest the 10% of your income in Bitcoin, monthly, but this is gonna be for long term investment since Bitcoin's price is not always low or high, so you gotta know when to buy. You can also save your money instead of putting it on Bitcoin when its price is a little too high for you, then use your savings when the price meets your expectation.",

Anyone with even the slightest amount of financial literacy understands how fed rates affect markets, but there aren't always causal associations between interest rate changes and immediate market effects which is why this advise wouldn't work for the average person.If I had to give someone advice, it would be to invest early and let investments mature over a period of decades. As long as you diversify, there isn't a need to try and time the market. Even small investments compounded over a few decades will give you a hefty return. Most countries offer a public savings fund that pays out when you retire -- do not rely on the solvency of these retirement programs. Invest early and seperate from government backed pensions/social security.",

I have able to observe it out and for sure other people do too.In speaking about economical events on which whether FED rates would up or down, there are indeed times on which it doesnt really care at all or this crypto space doesnt really correlate from time to timewhen it comes to fundamentals and if you are really that following in some sort of pattern then it cant really be that precise from time to time.This is why its really hard to make up some predictions in speaking about price movement or condition on such scenario. This is why whenever you do step your foot on crypto space then you should reallymake yourself that get prepared for whatever things you would encounter randomly. Come or bare into your mind that there's no such thing about assurance on following with some pattern.",
