      "body": "Some reasons that make recovery was so fast for matic- meta adoption- good scalability and small fees- supported by so many ecosystem- the blockchain has been working smoothly. this far better than solana which was first layer blockchainIm actively using this blockchain other than BSC. polygon has become the most potential second layer solution to compete with the BSC blockchain which has been backed by binance. When the bullish come and you will see massive recovery gonna happen with matic. I do like how the developers to handle its blockchain.",

Thatâ€™s really worth noting down because imagine how pissed they must be considering they lost millions of dollars in such pity way. It could take up some serious time and efforts to earn that much money back. FTX is already not believing into returning any sort of money to anyone since they have worst loss ever. Other markets where they have invested is high risk. If they start to sell something then they will do it at mega levels and could end up creating chain reaction of selling. Better move everything into the wallet. Good idea.",

Sam and Caroline will be relaxing in the Bahamas in their expensive home, and we will no longer know the details of the investigation.",
