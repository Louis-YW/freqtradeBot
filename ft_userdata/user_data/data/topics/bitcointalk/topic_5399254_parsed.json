You've already said it, there are tons of fixed scams that's why these kind of idea already had been avoided. You cannot just let the online people of this forum be part of something we already know that won't went well in the future. You can still take this Gambling and Gambling Discussion as the community where you can share and discuss the games and bets. Yes, a telegram group would be a better and a much convenient medium. But it can be a road to exist a way bigger problem.",

If you have financial capital, I suggest you open your own website if you really run an abetting site that does not rely on any of their party platforms. Another factor is the reputation that you must to build so that they will trust your gambling casino. However, good luck with your plan.",

Just go to any official discord of each sport (if there is one, most eSports have them so I'm basing it on that), then find people you can discuss with in there about the ongoing tournaments and who they would think would win. There may be a lot of opinions, but that also helps filter out some biased views imo. No need to make it a specific \"betting group\", since honestly, groups like that just reek of them doing the matchmaking themselves.",

The telegram link that he provides is a telegram group dedicated for gamblers that do live betting. Technically it's a room for sharing there prediction and help each other to analyze prediction and win together. I knew that you think that he is planning to create a live betting platform on telegram if you just read the title and quick scan the post.OP, The idea is good and telegram is best for that discussion purposes. The only thing I can comment is to limit the person that can give prediction to control shit prediction and to increase the chance of win rate. Let the veterans only allowed to give prediction and normal user is just allowed to comment about it until he has a good portfolio.",

It really gives me some insight about what to look for and expect. I’m not making a gambling website or what, it’s just a kinda forum. Those who bet live normally knows how the thoughts can change with just a comment. So i want to have a group where people can share their views or whatsoever on games. eg: chelsea vs man u. The on going match is 1-0 @73 minutes.. and man u isnt attacking or whatsoever. But i feel like buying 1-1. Then comes someone who analyses the match and give his opinion that maybe 1-1 isnt possible… so you know, i kinda will be cautious when bet. At least looking at this kind of vibes and environment in a group ya. HAHA!!",
