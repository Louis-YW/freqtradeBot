  "content": "Hello. I was hoping someone would know but I need a newer version of CGminer that supports pure solo addressing. I can do this in Cgminer 4.1.12 with my gekko miners but the gridseed  I cant find anything newer than 3.8.5 and it doesn't support this argument,--btc-address <arg> Set bitcoin target address when solo mining to bitcoind (mandatory)I was reading about following the instructions for compiling a new build from Github but I dont see anything about compiling the gridseed libraries or support files into it. this is an example of the arguments I use for a gekko or antminer to pure solo mine with to a local node.cgminer.exe -o http://127.0.0.1:8536  -u pos  -p cap --gekko-newpac-freq 450 --btc-address CeNJXn5KgXeaFMtgVwuJaK2rU8uPcGNCgiThe --btc-address argument is not supported by cgminer verison 3.8.5 which seems to be the most recent version that does support gridseeds.Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated in brining this older miners back to life. Thank you in advance.",

Solo mining isn't anything new, how did it ever work on old versionsof cgminer?There are different types of solo mining. The most common is solo pool mining like over at ckpool. This is called pure solo mining using a local node/wallet to mine against locally. In standard pool mining you just need your standard address port user pass.  In pure solo mining you need your local address 127.0.0.1:port user (which is the local pc user name) pass which is the local PC password and then a wallet address to send to. Its the last part that newer versions of gcminer support but I havent found one that supports gridseeds that can use it.",

I just purchased gridseed 5 chip,  these little USB  ASIC miners feels quite cool, green and red light.  Nengcoin scrypt mining side  is working perfectly fine.  the sha256 side there is GC3355-cgminer repo that is based off old cgminer version that does allow btc-address kind of solo mining.  It mines fine with other coins like WCN widecoin at pool, but it won't work on cheetahcoin solo mining (probably won't work on pool either) because of same old error that required gekko newpac/compac F to upgrade to newer version:  \"errors: (bad-cb-height) bla bla\"Gridseed 5 chip is mainly scrypt miner.  The sha256 side cost too much energy 10 G/s on 70 watts, probably not worth mining sha256 side other than curiosity to play with it.",

I agree with you that Gridseed 5 chip is not really suitable for bitcoin or sha256 altcoin mining.  Dual chip is not true, it is mainly a scrypt ASIC USB device. But for new kind of scrypt coins Nengcoin (NENG) tailored to home smaller miners and solo miners and has restriction on big ASIC rigs,  I am pretty happy with gridseed 5 chip device so far.  This is great beginning or low cost device for new miners to start for learning, and possibly making some money on Nengcoin (NENG).  The electricity cost running gridseed 5 chip on scrypt only is so cheap, well suited for high cost regions in north america or europe.",
