Thank you. Your question is very high and demands for more thorough means for answering them one after the other, but let me give a try from my end base on my own personal understanding.1. The information you could need is nothing than the seed phrase to have access to each or any of the corresponding wallets he is using, now come to think of the chances of getting this keys.2. Being a novice, I expect you to do nothing to it than to see such and ignore it, not knowing that it's what can be used to have access to a wallet, but having little idea on what seed phrase is, you can just grab it and keep to yourself as a lifetime opportunity, it you tell someone, they may deceive you to get it away from you.",

      "body": "Many thanks to all who have responded. I sincerely appreciate your time and trouble.I have to say, I am somewhat bemused by some of the responses. The idea that I could be on a mission to scam others would be particularly humorous to anyone who knew my 'technical skills'. Also, the idea that the story of finding the greatest fortune the world has ever known can no longer be original because others have already told it speaks to a lack of imagination. I can think of similar stories that have been written by many different writers and all were worthy of the retelling and reinterpretation. In the interests of transparency, I have been doing what research I am able to on the subject, but I am not a Bitcoin expert and was really seeking confirmation of certain beliefs I held from a community that really does know about Bitcoin. For a story to be believable, it must be factually accurate. For example, if I were to attest that Satoshi's Bitcoin could be accessed with seed phrases I would have been wrong and maligned and my story flawed and dismissed. I knew that much. What I wasn't sure of was that if Satoshi had recorded on paper how to access his Bitcoin holdings (yes, I appreciate there could be 20,000 wallets) how might he have done it to be believable in story form. (A suggestion was made that all of that information would probably be on a digital device, like a memory stick  (like others have imagined the story). I like to imagine that Satoshi might have also recorded his wallets' information in good old-fashioned paper form.)I like to imagine that Satoshi may have recorded every wallet he created with every block he solved onto a spreadsheet and then printed it all out. I like to think he was meticulous about it. I like to imagine that the form this spreadsheet would take would be five columns: mining date/wallet password/public digital key/private digital key/number of BTC mined (typically 50). And that will give anyone all the information they need to access his fortune. I am still not entirely certain of what form the public and private keys would take. I believe they would both be strings of random numbers and letters (alphanumeric), sixty-four characters in length. (I am still not sure if this is correct and whether the letters would be a mixture of upper and lower case. I will research some more.)Again, for transparency, I write fiction for a hobby. I have several novels self-published on Amazon, one by an Amazon publishing house, and one series once with a small publishing house. I am thoroughly enjoying writing this book, which will be called 'The Saviour'. For the record, I have long been mesmerised by Bitcoin and what Satoshi Nakamoto devised to bypass the financial institutions that control us all. I, for one, imagine that he is probably turning in his grave to think that control of his vision has been hijacked by the very financial institutions he set out to negate, and turned into an asset class for investment. Oh, the irony. RIP Satoshi.Once again, thanks to all responders. Over and out.",

If you want to write something, write about Bitcoin fact, and avoid fiction or conspiracy theory.
