And if your purpose is to hit blocks then it won't actually help you need a large mining farm to be able to find valid blocks and mine.",

So you mean that it's a chances of finding blocks the leading zeros might be \" fail finding blocks\"?The chances of finding blocks on solo mining is pretty small that is why most of solo mining only mine for lottery.If you have a big farm you have a big chance to find blocks to mine. The time or leading zeroes is depends in your hashrate and difficulty to find a valid block.Here's the formula from wiki Quotetime = difficulty * 2**32 / hashrate where 'difficulty' is the current cryptocurrency difficulty level of BTC difficulty network and 'hashrate' is the amount of hashes a miner finds per second.Source: https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_in_Mining",
