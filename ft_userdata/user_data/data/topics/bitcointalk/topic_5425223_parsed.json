In terms of people a lot aren't remembered well to begin with here (username placement is quite subtle and is often not the first thing you check - if you've not got a unique avatar I probably won't recognise you). The only other way I'll know who you are is if you provide some use/controversy enough that people quote you - or I think your posts are good. Historically, humans have had very little to remember concisely. Since agriculture, you have to remember how your land looks and how you'll recognise it when you return if you get lost and that's about it. Your brain wasn't designed to read a few hundred thousand words a day and retain it all. No one really knows how memory works too but I think we can all remember a time where we've thought of a memory we had no idea we knew or one that has spontaneously appeared (or both) and I get that a lot here. Am I going to edit a post I made 3 days or 3 months ago with a more detailed response? Will it even be read if I do? (this is a thought of mine I have quite often so if you have thoughts I want them).Some people get comfortable too. History proves that more advanced things generally replace less advanced ones, no one looks at it as proving anytbing they don't want it to (such as the Mt Gox and ftx saga and all the other identical instances).",

If you check closely you can see that it only someone you love or that always have been good or doing things the right way you wish are the one we always remember or think of.",

As a human, to be remembered, you do not have to do what everyone is doing, you have to be special to leave a mark so that people will celebrate you for what you did. People who did nothing and had no influence are quickly forgotten, just like things that go bad and cannot be fixed.",

Our brain has developed but our long term memory really is not that great, we need constant stimulation & reminders to be able to recall some events.I am obviously not a neurologist but recent events obviously are fresh in the memory. Past events are more difficult to remember as clearly as something which was last week for example.",

People lose interest in old topics that were once important to them as it is human nature to forget about things that are no longer important.In this technological world everyone is occupied with social media, technology, and gadgets, which have made life easier for us. However, these advancements have increased distances in our relationships. Our memory mainly operates in short-term mode and our ability to store past events has reduced drastically. This is the main reason for forgetting things and people.",

If you lose a loved one, the experience will be very painful during that period, but eventually you'll move on, except there's a memorial for the deacesed, him or her will be forgotten as time goes on, this is why history and achaive is very important so we can look back and remember important events that concerns us.",
