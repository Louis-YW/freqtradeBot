How does someone make a name for themselves in their first post connecting some multiple accounts? Better yet, why would anyone expose three of their accounts just to make a name for a brand new one? I feel like maybe this is personal. Or, a member who is not looking to use their main account to expose the accounts. I very highly doubt it is the same user exposing his own accounts.",
