Unless you stick to p2p transactions, but if you want to exit some crypto for fiat you would have to pass KYC for every single wallet address that you used to receive funds and transferred funds to virtual asset service provider (as they call it).",

For example, it is likely that they don't need to know how many coins you have, what food you eat or which toys you buy in the sex shop. Even if you're a law-abiding citizen who have never done or think of doing something illegal or immoral, it is still not their business and they don't need to know about your transactions. Thanks to wallets offering coin control functionality, you have a better chance to preserve your personal information. If someone is forcing you to \"whitelist\" your address or re-use address, they simply want to infringe on your privacy rights so that they can control you or affect your financial decisions. If that is the case, then you should consider switching to peer-to-peer transactions with individuals who don't care who you are or where your money came from.",

Anyway, I believe that sometimes, it's even good to keep it simply simple by reusing addresses. All these privacy induced precautions could even make one lose/misplace one's data and not remembering where it's kept. If you hide something hard enough, you might even end up losing recollection of where you've hidden it. To be frank, I don't even understand the rational behind all the address change when I know I don't go around broadcasting to people that I'm into crypto or that I hodl Bitcoin. The only people who will be in danger of this are the braggart who derive pleasure in boasting and displaying fake lives on social media.",

You are giving a pattern of receiving Bitcoin to the analyst. Nothing else here. That's the only thing you are exposing here.Quote Anyway, I believe that sometimes, it's even good to keep it simply simple by reusing addresses. All these privacy induced precautions could even make one lose/misplace one's data and not remembering where it's kept.You have to remember one seed key only. Nothing else. You can generate as many address as you want from a single seed key. It's hard to maintain whenh you have a lot of seed key. But we don't need that. You can use one seed for many address, in many ways even not connecting one with another.",

I do not see any form of privacy doing transactions this way, I believe this is why we have mixers. OP, are you trying to hide how many Bitcoin you moving into your hardware wallet? Why? This is not necessary at all unless your money is not clean or you are hiding for other private reasons, even if this is the case mixer is the only solution, using several Bitcoin addresses makes no difference.",

Imagine, you are receiving your salary from your real-life job at an address and again, receiving your signature campaign payment at the same address. What have you done? Linked up your real-life identity to internet identity. This is an example only. Mixers are centralized services mostly. Who confirms that they don't keep any logs? You only trust them most of the time. You can't verify the reality.",

That can affect your privacy, and you may or may not care.Using a different address each time for a single person accomplishes nothing because the person already knows about the transactions. If you reuse your address with a single person, then that person can only see transactions that they already know about. Reuse with single person has no effect on your privacy.Quote from: jackg on February 20, 2023, 04:25:51 PMReusing addresses can make fees cheaper though tooThat is false. The fee generally depends on the number of UTXOs, regardless of what addresses they are associated with.",
