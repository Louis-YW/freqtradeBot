  "content": "I was in a relationship with this guy for almost 4years, things between us was fine the vibe was just lovely, he met my standard, like what more would a woman want in a man such as him? We were happy. Until the day I felt sick and we got to the hospital, they check that it wasn't something to worry about and he said we should check our Genotype which I agreed. I never knew mine so the result came out and he's SS while I'm AC, I cried my eyes out that day. We just couldn't get things to work out between us but to go our separate ways.In our society today some people do go and check their Genotype while some don't think is even necessary. Is it cool to take a girl/guy you haven't get to know that better but still catching feelings for each other to go for a Genotype test? Is some how awkward to me.In some cases you'd see something like SS + SS = Incompatible. AC + SS = incompatible. SC + SS = incompatible, like the both parties are madly in love. Is really painful to leave someone who you've spent so many year with only to find out that both of you can't get married. Not cool to me but what can we say. In the other case where you have the \"perfect ones\" per say, you'd see;AA + AA= compatibleAA + AS= compatibleAA + SS= compatibleAA + AC= compatibleAS + AS= compatible.They're all cool right? Is it that they're the only ones that are ok to stay in a relationship and the others ain't?This is what rest that one person I truly loved, felt like beating myself.",

(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sickle_cell_disease)Yes, I have read before that it is very common for people in Africa to suffer from that condition and even there are communities were people are excluded because having that genetic illness. Here in the Americas, we do not pay attention to our genotype, I have never checked mine and I don't think my parents have, it is less common here.Interestingly, some scientists have found that those with the illness are more resistant to malaria, so there a theory that sickle cell disease could be some mutation developed through time in African people so they can survive Malaria (which attacks red cells)I have got not much to say, just to wish you good luck in your life and hopefully you can get with someone you appreciate and he appreciates you back eventually.",

Is some how awkward to me.It will interest the whole world to know that in Africa, particularly some part of Nigeria, so many young girls have been married off to men they don't know, nor love, for the sake of culture.This culture gives more priority to the men (Patriarch) than women and because of that, families of the bride do not care about her feelings before giving her out in marriage without considering the health implications. eg; genotype incompatible.A typical example is when a crown prince or a royalty picks interest on a lady, the family of the lady makes it a sanctity to marry her off to the prince without observing or taking into cognizant the adverse effects of such decisions. In most cases, the couples have incompatible genotypes and the lady faces more challenges and humiliation.",

Depending whom you ask, some may argue that people from Africa were forced to change their way of living and thinking because the colonization, both political and cultural; I assume some young people there prefer to embrace the western values over the old African traditions, it is the same here in LATAM, people here are influenced for the cultural spheres of power of USA and Europe. It is the way it is, I just hope we can continue to keep the good things of our culture and do not absorb the negative things from foreign nations.

Sickle cell trait can also affect Hispanics, South Asians, Caucasians from southern Europe, and people from Middle Eastern countries. More than 100 million people worldwide have sickle cell trait.AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGYSickle cell disease also affect many people in almost all the continent of the world but Africa has the highest population of those infected. And the reason why many sufferers of this sickness die is because of Africa's poor health facilities. Most wealthy citizens that suffer from this sickness seek medical attention abroad and they live healthily. The less privileged have no other option but to avoid the intermarriage of genotypes that will lead to the birth of sickle cell offspring. Genotype tests are a compulsory requirement by most religious bodies before marriage will be conducted. If both partners have any genotype defect the marriage will be recited by the church, parents, and even friends.I have seen true lovers miss the opportunity of staying together because of this genotype issue. It's really heartbreaking but we have to endure this situation. Adopting children might be a good option but it is expensive and most people can it afford it. I know it sounds strange to many people that not having children after marriage in Africa is unacceptable.",

Also in many African communities people who were born with it are mistreated and pointed out as cursed people and similar things, they are pushed to being Outcasts, in some occasions. The only permanent solution for it would be to receive a narrow bone transplant, which would slowly and steadily replace the faulty red cells in the blood with normal ones permanently. However, it can be an expensive procedure and a compatible donor would be needed. Narrow bone transplants have also the possibly to cure AIDS, but that is even a more special case. Look for the case of the \"London Patient\" and South American who was cured of AIDS that way.",
