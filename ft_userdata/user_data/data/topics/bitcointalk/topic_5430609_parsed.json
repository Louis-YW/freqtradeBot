  "content": "Guys, Zionodes now has Aleo Servers available for lease on https://aleo.zionodes.com/. It seems like a great idea, especially given Aleo's profit potential. I had been researching Aleo for a while and was looking for reliable options to mine the coin. I was glad to hear that Zionodes decided to offer the servers for lease on their trading desk because I am already a customer with them, and quite satisfied with their service too.So far, here's what I know:1) Aleo has one of the largest fundings of around $298 million, which is more than FIL's $258 million.2) It will soon be available on the mainnet, which means that profit potential for early adopters today will be very high (maybe even 2-3x, not sure).3) Zionodes is leasing it for $75-$140 depending on mining requirements (so assuming the profit is even 2x on the lower side, it is an easy return for a short-term investment).4) Funds have been raised from investors including Samsung Next, Polychain, Kora, and others. (Source: Crunchbase and other websites)I believe it could easily surpass FIL & Chia. What do you guys think?",

I had created a new draft cause initially the price and leasing period I provided was wrong. I have updated the details on this thread itself now with the right details, and will delete the other post.",

The upside is quite nice imo (at least for now). I don't think it will be great after the mainnet launch, but for now it could easily be 2x imo.",
