Where do I go about doing that, any ideas on cost, etc?Why would you want to build back up an old coin.  Why not just start a new one you are probably better off.  Trying to revive an old coin from scratch is usually very hard to do.  Cost will vary but be careful to not get scammed by anyone in the process.",

And I also advise you to filter out those developers that are going to apply for the position, as you have said, you might be scam here. I don't have any idea about the cost though, but just like any other startup, you need some capital to begin with. Best of luck.",

If you still can't see that then just go to freelancer websites and have those developers go into your thread with the same posting.The cost of it varies on the experience of the developer. But, I am sure that this isn't going to be as cheap as some might be thinking since it's a task and skill that's in demand and needs technical knowledge.",

Why don't you try to learn from what already done by ethereum POS merge? this will give you a small insight about what must be done first. The fact that changing the consensus means you shall implement the new code. I think that ethereum POS implementation proposal can give you best answer for that",
