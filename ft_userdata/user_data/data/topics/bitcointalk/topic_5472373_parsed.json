From what I know of Patrick, he seemed like a good guy. I met him once. Â No, I'm not working on this project and won't get my \"shill\" Â  , but I would like to get a coin as a collector. I think they look good and I'm sure I can trade for a deal on the secondary market. I will probably get at least two. We do trade brass redeemed pieces for more  ......just saying.
