It's very likely, especially when considering how strong Bitcoin has been performing in January. Maybe we'll already see numbers above 25k tomorrow or next weekend but even in a bearish scenario, Bitcoin is unlikely to go below 20k again. Quote from: Wiwo on February 15, 2023, 11:47:17 PM2 What are the variables to consider in making future uptrend predictions? I would have a close look at Bitcoin's halving. It's just 1 year away and is likely to play a major role. Halving from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC per mined Block is only 50% but it's also massive at the same time.Â  Remember: last all time high (65k USD) we didn't had a new halving to boost Bitcoin's price but next bull market (2024?) we'll have a halving.Â  Bitcoin seems to be very bullish right now but of course, we don't have any guarantee.",

That the price suddenly soared from around $16,000 to more than $24,000 just within January was probably not expected by majority of price analysts. It really surprised me. I would have assumed that this month of February will be a correction month and that the price would hardly be reaching $25,000. Everything changed when I looked at the chart for the past hours. I am now almost certain that $25,000 within February is an easy target. That's because of another surprising move in the price in just hours.",

We are in for a more exciting time this first quarter of the year and we should be prepared for some price increase, so the best thing to do is to continue to hold.",

As it looks today, bitcoin could still reach the $25k mark this month. Things are looking good so far, even if the price increase is just coming to a standstill. But that could change again in the next few hours. Since we still have a few days until the end of the month, I'm staying positive and think it's possible.Â  Quote from: Wiwo on February 15, 2023, 11:47:17 PM2 What are the variables to consider in making future uptrend predictions? You have to keep in mind that the market itself is unpredictable. Today is looking good and tomorrow the price may fall again and no one can really say how the price will develop. The next bad news can pull the price down again and vice versa, i.e. good news can steer the price up.",

There is a huge chance that we can break the $25k barrier, we are almost there, $24,400-$24,600.

Good and positive news in the market, such as the CPI statement from Feds. I think it's one of the prime movers, because every statement they have to make, the market moves with it, whether positive or negative. Not only crypto but the rest of traditional market.",

Bitcoin price presently is a shock to everybody, since it is not up to 24hrs that the price moved up to 24k+. It is very possible that from this moment to ending of this month,bitcoin price will reach 25k because the prices changes within a twinkle of an eye,just like it did some 13hrs ago.

In addition, the bitcoin price also almost touched $ 25k before finally experiencing a correction and dropping back to the current price.And hopefully, the correction this time doesn't trigger the price to decline again and return to $24k and still be able to stay at the current price so that today or tomorrow, the bitcoin price can break $25k and still increase.

Maybe it's not the perfect time yet for us to hit it because hitting it could lead to more possibilities or more price growth.We are only at the first quarter of this year but things are getting exciting already. How much more if we proceed on the later levels?
