This version includes various upgrades that will improve our network's functionality, interoperability, and efficiency. These enhancements open the path for the seamless integration of new validators, as well as the deployment of Catena bridge.The following is a list of the updates included in this upgrade:■Smart Contract Enhancements: Improvements to smart contract functionality to improve performance and usability.■Interoperability with the COSMOS network: Our platform now supports smooth operations with the COSMOS network, promoting better collaboration and integration.■Max Priority Fee Check: We included this option to ensure that transaction fees are handled as efficiently as possible.■Upgraded voting parameters: We've improved our voting system to offer greater efficiency and transparency in the decision-making process.■Refreshed Votes Timestamp Increment: This feature allows for more accurate tracking of voting activity.■ZK Functions Added to Cryptography Engine: Zero-Knowledge functions have been added to our cryptography engine, improving privacy and security.■Connection Error Metrics for Nodes: We've included error metrics to help in the identification and resolution of node connection issues.■State synchronization Upgrades: it allows more efficient syncing over the network.■Node Communication Speed Improvement: We've enhanced the speed of communication between nodes for improved network performance.■Addition of VDF and VRF functions to the Randomizer Engine: The introduction of Verifiable Delay Function (VDF) and Verifiable Random Function (VRF) boosts the reliability and integrity of the randomizer engine.■Consensus Enhancement Using VDF and VRF: This enables a more efficient consensus mechanism, lowering the likelihood of network disputes.■Increased Retransmit-Stage Capacity and Reset-Cycle: Enhancements to our retransmission capacity assist guarantee that data is sent across the network more effectively.■State Engine: Improved Node Storage consumption and Auto Pruning Function: We've improved our state engine's node storage consumption and included an Auto Pruning Function, which automatically removes redundant data from the blockchain to conserve space.■Safe State Engine Auto Pruning: We've built an advanced pruning feature that safely deletes extraneous data while retaining essential information.These improvements represent a big step forward in our attempt to develop a more resilient, efficient, and inclusive blockchain network.We look forward to experiencing the positive impacts of these upgrades with you.⬇️Twitter:https://twitter.com/catena_networkMedium:https://catenanetwork.medium.comTelegram:https://t.me/CatenaOfficialExplorer:https://catenascan.com",
