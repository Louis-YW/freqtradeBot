What a shame they only got a penny it should have been the overall winnings to be given to that guy so that he won't talk. I don't think you're part of that luck in the first place that you are entitled to be given some charity. The thing with people who are ungrateful is that no matter you gave or not they still have something to say.",

Social media is breeding people with a high level of entitlement, what if he hadn't given him a dime, what would they have done.",

It's like taking a loan and when it's granted, its like you are required to treat the people around. It's really a nonsense attitude.Gambling is not an exception. A lot of winning gamblers  are actually showing their generosity by giving other gamblers a good amount which serves as their \"balato\". Although its not bad as long as you are doing it with goodwill, but to be honest let's just cut this attitude because we are not obliged to do this in the first place. Note that its not easy to win in gambling, and before you win, you are losing a lot first before hitting your luck. So if you analyze it carefully, you are just gaining back the money that you have lost. If you decide to give, its like you are making a charity event, you give without asking for return.",

Its someones money and if he do able to win up then its their full rights on what they should gonna do with it.Neither he would really be having plans on sharing it up or would really be that basically be keeping for himself considering that he's still that break even after all the years that hed been doing gambling.Its not really that shocking that people around dwould really be always have something to say on which its never been that something new anymore. People do really love to judge,people do really love to make out some sayings, people do really love to make some issues, people do really love on assuming things which they dont really even know on whats their situation behind.In overall, its better to ignore about this stuff all the way.",

Jealousy between different people is a story as old as humanity itself and is never going to change. There is even good recommendation that if by some miracle you were to win a huge amount on something like the lottery, that you do not share that even with family, as it can heavily affect your relationship due to the sense of entitlement that you talk about. The best thing you can do as a casual observer of it is to discourage it and then simply ignore the kind of people who would beg for money. Also, you must not forget that writers love to generate controversy when writing articles like this because it acts as clickbait and draws in a lot more viewers, so they can even imagine such angles out of thin air.",

The OP didn’t broaden what actually transpired well, according to what I read on X was that the person he gifted the 100k after winning was actually the person that helped in predicting the game for him or maybe one of those punters that show up they Game and the eventual winner actually went ahead and played that particular game and he won, and his heart of generosity (because I see it as such) he gifted the other punter that amount which causes the fuss by others who thought he should have given more. For me I don’t see it that way, he didn’t had an agreement to drop a certain amount of money should he win but rather he went ahead to gamble his own money, had he lost would the other punter have compensated him?, this to me is similar to someone discussing a business with you and how it will yield profit and you went ahead to invest in that business with either your money or loan business, I don’t think this person will point hands at you if you gift him anything later because it was never his entitlement.",

Let stop the self entitlement claims towards fellows gamblers that won big amount of money. The attitude is disturbing. source.If I am the winner I will just laugh at them since I don't have any obligation to give a share to those entitled guys on my winnings. They didn't contribute anything so for sure they can't ask more bigger than that since its just part of good will to the winner that he share some small part of his winning. If they can't understand well there's a problem with their attitude and the winner shouldn't add more because he need to secure his self for better future since winning that amount is rare to come to other individual that's why he shouldn't get affected with those call outs since for sure there are to many people understand and appreciate the amount he give.Self entitlement towards other peoples winning is bad attitude and they should know that they don't have right to dictate those people  who win its because that's not their money, if they also win for sure they do the same so they should not get greedy since nothing will happen to them.",

The OP didn’t broaden what actually transpired well, according to what I read on X was that the person he gifted the 100k after winning was actually the person that helped in predicting the game for him or maybe one of those punters that show up they Game and the eventual winner actually went ahead and played that particular game and he won, and his heart of generosity (because I see it as such) he gifted the other punter that amount which causes the fuss by others who thought he should have given more. For me I don’t see it that way, he didn’t had an agreement to drop a certain amount of money should he win but rather he went ahead to gamble his own money, had he lost would the other punter have compensated him?, this to me is similar to someone discussing a business with you and how it will yield profit and you went ahead to invest in that business with either your money or loan business, I don’t think this person will point hands at you if you gift him anything later because it was never his entitlement. Also, if the punter gave him that pick, or sure, he himself also got that pick and won something. This is what people are missing: these guys don't give out picks and not pick it themselves. Also, if the punter himself did not ask for anything in return and still got something out of that lucky pick, why would other people be mad on his behalf? I sometimes don't understand the entitlement people has in today's day and age. That money the winner used to bet came from his funds and not the punter's, and so even with the pick, if there's no money to risk, there's never a money to be made.Or even if the punter did ask for something, why would he if he knows that pick will win? Why did he not bet on it and reap the rewards himself?",

Below in the image  is one of many tweets from the critics.\"too small\" Jesus christ people are rather entitled sometimes. From what I've seen from other posts it was told that said punter was the reason for the win but in the end, it's not like they had a contract/agreement for said bet and the money should've come from the person themselves, not the punter. That N100k should be more than enough as a show of appreciation imo since there could've been nothing instead really. Now this ain't nothing new, but it's like asking the lottery winner to give you 1/10 of the prize money because you \"contributed\" one of the numbers when asked earlier (sometimes I know people who ask others a number or two for their lotteries). Kinda dumb if you think about it like that.",
