  "content": "For those who don't know what limit order is, it is a buy or sell order that executes at the minimum price set by the trader or even better. This allows traders to set a limit price to buy and sell crypto currencies.       Most of you reading this might probably be thinking \" okay that's cool, but why use limit order\". Alright let's take this as an example;A particular stock let's say it's reducing or increasing at an exponential rate and the trader is fearful of the market volatility. A limit order can be applied to give the trader control over the execution price. Limit orders can also be used to pick specific amounts even when the crypto is yet to reach the given mark, limit orders are automated so investors need not worry about watching the market 24/7.       As you've seen a limit order is very important in crypto. For those interested in purchasing a limit order, if you're using binance simply;(1) log into your binance account, go to TRADE, there you'll see CLASSIC and ADVANCE. click on CLASSIC you can also use ADVANCE but for this example I'll be using CLASSIC.(2) After you've done that, move to the search bar and enter BNB then choose the BNB you wish to trade. Example; BNB/BTC, BNB/BUSD, BNB/ETH. We'll be using BNB/BUSD for this example.(3) now scroll down to the SPOTBOX and select LIMIT. set the price and amount you wish to buy then click on BUY BNB to confirm. Once it's complete a confirmation pop-up will appear and your limit order will be placed on the order book        Investors should also bear in mind that limit orders used in crypto usually lasts for 24hours, so it's advisable to always review your open limit orders from time to time to keep up with the ever changing market conditions.      If you're still interested in reading more on limit orders, click on the link below.https://coindcx.com/blog/product-tutorials/what-is-a-limit-order-in-crypto/",

One thing with instance buy is that it doesn't really give the chance for multiple offers and getting more than the desired price.      Thanks though for the corrections, I will apply them in future posts.Quote from: Saint-loup on November 27, 2022, 09:58:47 PMI agree with Accardo about the appearance of your post and its readability, you should try to improve it if you want people to bother to read and to reply to your topics.Anyway even if Limit orders are important you mustn't neglect or underestimate Market orders, especially Stop Loss orders and Take Profit orders.

This can be used for buy/sell limit orders. enough to help traders to deal with strong market fluctuations.",

      "body": "Limit orders only matter if you are going to trade, especially short term, which a hardcore bitcoiner does not do. If you expect Bitcoin to reach $1M at some point in the future, it's not worth it to set up a limit order to try to buy at 16,160 instead of 16,165.40, only to be left without buying because the price goes up and you have to place a new, higher limit order. For that you buy at the price of the market and that's it.",

One thing with instance buy is that it doesn't really give the chance for multiple offers and getting more than the desired price.It depends on the coin you are trading or converting to. Assuming you are converting to bitcoin, expect the market order (what you refered to instant order) to be filled at a market price shown as the bitcoin price on the exchange, which is very useful for many traders to avoid limit order frustration. But for some altcoins or shit coins, market order can be at a price not shown and far less (if you want to sell) or far more (if you want to buy) than the price shown, which makes the order not to favour the buyer or seller when the trade is filled, but with this too, limit order will not be filled at the limit price shown that was set.",
