Everything is really that been hyped up and of course this would really be pertaining on how they would really be able to make money.Usually they would really be making those fake conflicts and argumentation on which they would really make things to be heated up and on the time that it would be making some hype then this is where they do mostly prefer because we know that the more people watching the more money that they could generate which its not really shocking anymore in todays world where everything is really been that rolled out with having that very common intent.",

Because if this is just real we always see some blood gushing from their faces often and we see some real skills from their fighters but this is not how traditional boxing works because this is just a mere entertainment not gonna be fit for the crypto community to talk about. Because what the crypto community wants are sports you don't really have any idea about it's ending like boxing and basketball so they will gonna talk about the games and the fight just before it happens.",

They are made because these influencers have huge followers and fans which made some boxing promoters and networks interested for business purposes. And of course, many casuals with zero to little knowledge of boxing will watch these fights because they thought these are super fights and are real.The only time I watched a live celebrity match was when I tuned in during the middle of the fight between Jake Paul and grandpa MMA legend, Anderson Silva. It could be real but there is also a part of me that tells Silva was controlling himself not to seriously spank the special child.And of course, I will try to watch Fury-Ngannou. I would love to see the inactive and slow-as-turtle Francis Ngannou brutally put Belly Duck Fury to sleep. It's a mission impossible though as Fury will humiliate Ngannou with his stiff jabs. Ngannou will be gassed out after 3 or 4 rounds and might beat himself by not answering the bell. Still, I love to know that Francis gets paid 8 digits after escaping from his shogun and dictator.",

I bet that's what the fans paid for so it's definitely not fair to censor it. It's not surprising lots of people come but looks like they are not in an arena, people are just sitting in a lawn chairs. If this Kingpin promotion gonna do this regularly, they gonna make a lot of onlyfans celebrities join. King Kenny seems to have boxing skills, he's got head movement but also showboating. They should invite Jake Logan as it can attract more ticket buyers.",

I'm not interested in betting on kingpyn boxing, I don't know the history of each fighter that will compete, I will avoid betting on kingpyn boxing as much as possible.",
