  "content": "Going to make this short and simple, hopefully someone will point me in the right direction.I made an account on CEX.io in hopes to transfer some of the Bitcoin instantly. Upon registering and paying for ~$3000 BTC, I was prompted to take a selfie with the debit card used for the purchase. I did, and it went through.Now when I tried to send the BTC to another address, I was prompted YET again to verify my identity. This time through means of Drivers License, International Passport, or National ID Card. I attempted to verify my identity at least 30 times with both my Drivers License and Passport and found I was unable to do so. Every time when I was about 67% done with the verification process, it failed stating there was an error with the documents I provided. I've since contacted support with no response. I've even tried to transfer my money into FIAT losing some transaction fees, with no ability to withdraw the money until I \"verify\" my account.The images of my documents are not blurry, are indeed high quality, and yet I still get denied every time. I'm hoping someone will point me to the right direction where I can have this situation fixed.User ID: up158037423",

I did, and it went through.Most exchanges will require some sort of KYC registration if you're dealing with fiat, so if you plan to use another exchange make sure you check out the verification first before you transfer any money. I see your posts and it looks like you did transfer money first before you found out that you need KYC (regardless of what is your purpose of depositing and withdrawing quickly), I hope you can stop doing that since you'll likely end up losing a lot of money if your KYC fails. If you don't want any of that I suggest checking Bisq if you just want to buy BTC.

Try to pm or send an e-mail again to the profile linked by omega above. Try to contact their support again when you can, wait for a few hours or try at another time. If that doesn't help maybe make some noise on their social media.Quote from: fakeunholy on January 17, 2023, 08:12:40 AMI'll try sending him a PM on-site, although it says he was last online on 1/12/2023.Give it a few more days maybe. Some representative stays offline for some time from time to time but if they are online most of them will respond to your thread afaik.",
