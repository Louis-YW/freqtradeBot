  "content": "Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million and that means that it can not be manipulated like fiat currencies. It's limited supply means that no centralized authorities like CBN can mint more of it and cause a likelihood of inflation. Bitcoin was structured from it's creation as a decentralized digital cash with a limited supply which makes it an hedge against inflation.Many people have lost their Bitcoin forever because they can no longer send it to another wallet from the Blockchain, this happens when a person loses the private keys of their wallet. These Bitcoin that are in the Blockchain but the owners can not sale them are parts of the 21 million finite supply. If the amount of the Bitcoin that people holds begins to be lost because they have no control over it in the Blockchain forever, due to the lose of their private keys, the effect will be deflation. Although the amount of Bitcoin lost through this means might be insignificant compared to the amount that is in circulation now, but if the loses keeps occuring in the future, it will certainly lead to deflation The effect of deflation is abnormal increase in price which can cause Bitcoin to be overpriced in the future. My question is what do you think will be the adoption and usage rate of Bitcoin then, whether it will increase or decrease?",

Though I can say that carelessness or lack of proper information on how to store their coins contributes to loss of Bitcoins. But then some other factors like natural disasters or death can lead to loss of such coins. A lot of people, keeps their privacies even till death. And lost times these kind of people owns large amount of Bitcoins and due to so many reason they hid it away from everyone even their loved ones doesn't even know about the amount of btc they hodl. Many of these are some reason why lost coins might be in the increase.

I believe the CBN you are talking about here is the central Bank of Nigeria. I would agree with you that the supply of Bitcoin having a finite price would help it not to be manipulated but that's not always 100%.The price of Bitcoin like almost every other crypto-currency is volatile and so demand and supply goes hand in hand. I believe you understand what whale is and how they play a part in affecting the price of crypto-currency. Large holders in unionism can actually drop the price of Bitcoin if they decide to sell off, creating panic which can further affect the price negatively.",

My question is what do you think will be the adoption and usage rate of Bitcoin then, whether it will increase or decrease?It's not abnormal, it is how Satoshi design it. It will not have any effect on the adoption and usage it.

[...]No one can resist innovation, bitcoin & crypto adoption will massively grow from year to year, in line with statistical data from Statista [3], the lack of actual circulating supply of bitcoin because lost bitcoins cannot be a benchmark for reducing bitcoin adoption in the future. That may happen if there are not many units in bitcoin, or the minimum transfer in a bitcoin transaction is 0,1 0,01 or 0,001 BTC.Providing a little information regarding units in bitcoin, we have bitcoin (BTC), bitcent (cBTC), millibit (mBTC), bit (μBTC), finney (finney), satoshi (sat) & millisatoshi (msat). You can visit bitcoindata.science to make conversions for each unit [4].Back to the discussion about adoption, because we have these units, of course a real reduction in supply due to human error will not reduce bitcoin adoption in the future, even now we have LN which can make payments as small as 0.00000001 bitcoin or 1 sat [5].[1] https://coingape.com/blog/approximately-7-8m-bitcoins-have-been-lost-can-they-be-recovered/[2] https://rewallet.de/en/blog/bitcoin-statistics-2023/[3] https://www.statista.com/statistics/1202503/global-cryptocurrency-user-base/[4] https://bitcoindata.science/bitcoin-units-converter[5] https://dci.mit.edu/lightning-network",

Bitcoin as an asset should increase in price, and it's beneficial to investors, so scarcity is a good thing. Bitcoin as money should be convenient to use. It seems that in general, economists believe that a slight controlled annual inflation is good for fiat because it motivates spending instead of hoarding. If we accept that perspective, it's a problem. But it's an ongoing concern, then, as Bitcoin keeps growing in price. As for a usability perspective, Bitcoin is divisible into satoshis, so there's plenty to go by even if the price per coin gets much-much higher.",

That was when some people started looking for where they kept their private key and couldn't find it, and their coins were lost forever.
