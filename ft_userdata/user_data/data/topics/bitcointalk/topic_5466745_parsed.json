I'd like to connect with cryptocurrency investors from around the world and share our insights and experiences.Mainstream coins or altcoins?, your question is too ambiguous, friend, you must first understand what the words \"mainstream\" and \"altcoins\" mean. Let me tell you, the word \"mainstream coins\" in crypto means referring to coins/tokens that are often used or known by people in crypto itself, in this case we can define mainstream coins as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) Binance Coin (BNB), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE) or Tron (TRX).Meanwhile, the meaning of the word \"Altcoins\" on the crypto side is any crypto asset other than Bitcoin (BTC) itself, do you understand at this point? Not only me, I'm sure all the responses that will come in will also talk about the confusion of your question.",

I checked on Coinmarket there are none, so what is the difference between mainstream coins and altcoins?If called mainstream means altcoins that are on the rise? Well connected with investors from all over the world, is that what is meant by interacting or wanting to show that we are investors? I don't think that's possible.A little confusion, if between mainstream and altcoin why not choose bitcoin?",

If that is the case then it's good, I mean since this community is obviously focusing on it as the name implies and with a lot of us here into BTC, then I suggest you try it yourself instead of meme or hype coins.As for altcoins, I do agree, just look at the top 5 or 10 coins in the marketcap right now.
