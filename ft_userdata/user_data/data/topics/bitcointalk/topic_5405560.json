Today we see many things that deviate from Satoshi's original idea, and not only in terms of the price that you mention.Regarding the price, I guess what bothers you is that the comparison is made with the dollar, but it could be done in another way. Those of us who hold Bitcoin care about the purchasing power it has. When the Bitcoin was worth $1, you could buy a car with 1 Bitcoin? No. Today you can? Yes (as long as it's priced at $20k or less and the dealer accepts Bitcoin or you'll have to switch to fiat to exchange).So, I say 1BTC=1BTC always put it in historical perspective, because 1BTC with which you bought just some chewing gum, is not the same as 1BTC with which you buy a car.",

For a service provider or a businessman selling something in the market place, they literally meant BTC as currency so price is important.",

On top of that you are looking at topics in places that are focused on the price like the speculation board but if you go somewhere else that is not about the price like the technical boards or sites like stackexchange you won't see any discussions there. Not to mention that the speculators are more vocal than others.In any case, bitcoin price is important because as a currency it has to have a value and that value is reflected in the price. It also has to be more stable (which it still isn't) to function better as a currency.Price also affects bitcoin's security since it directly affects the mining profitability and the hashrate.",

At the end of the day if we are seeing that the adoption is increasing in the long run and regardless of the short term drama, that means bitcoin is successful since it is doing its job. This adoption increase is mostly reflected in the long term price rise (2 years ago it was $3k and now it is $20k).The type of adoption is not important either because bitcoin provides many utilities for different people. For example it acts as a hedge against inflation or as a censorship resistant currency or simply for speculation or as an immutable timestamped database and a lot more.",

They participate in Bitcoin market for profit, with their naive speculation that they will get profit in near future, after a few weeks, few months or not longer than 1 or 2 years.With this standpoint, they are speculating price of Bitcoin. It is not good but it is how the crowd come with FOMO and leave with panic.They should adjust their standpoint and look at Bitcoin with its value, not its price. What is value of Bitcoin? Its use cases, its utility for people. I am sure use cases and utility for Bitcoin are increasing, not decreasing. Its value is growing despite of market ups and downs.",

If you are saving for the long term, the current price doesn't really mean much at all, except you can accumulate more Bitcoin right now, than you could last month. People do obsess over the price a little bit too much I feel. Although, that's only natural if you are a investor looking to profit on your investment, rather than use it to escape capitalism, and the banking system. Quote from: mk4 on July 08, 2022, 06:24:13 AMWhether we like it or notI'm not sure why we would even care what other people use Bitcoin for. That's the beauty of it. I don't look down at speculative investors looking to use Bitcoin as a means of obtaining more fiat currency, and the same as I don't look down on the sort of elitist attitude of holding regardless of what happens.People are free to use Bitcoin for whatever they want, as long as it's legal. That's perfect, and I certainly don't have the authority to tell someone else how they spread or spend their wealth.",

If that percentage is at least 20%, I would say that it is too much, considering that most people will never be able to escape the influence of a centralized system built over hundreds of years. You are right that most are waiting for the right price and their exit point, and in the end Bitcoin will become something that will be controlled by the richest if they find their interest in it.

A society that has become completely materialistic cannot perceive things around it in any other way than through value - so the most expensive things are the best, while the cheap ones are less attractive. This was also reflected in Bitcoin, which is a very good and positive thing when it is in a bull run, and in the moments when it loses its value, labels of Ponzi schemes, multi-level marketing, and environmental destruction begin to be attached to it.",

Now let me clear you a bit about it. For me i noticed if the price is very low or low people seems to spend more volume of bitcoin for transactions. For instance; I want to pay for a goods worth $1000BTC with current price in Bitcoin is ~0.043BTC but if the price get higher to $67k or more then i can only spend little less in Bitcoin. E.g. Goods worth $1000BTC at the price of $67k would be ~0.0141BTC at then no one want to lose his or her Bitcoin when the market is low. This could also be a reason why people are focusing on the price instead of the core value, though some might be for a profit probably buy at low waiting for the market to get higher for them to sell and make their gain.",

Sad, but it is how people's minds are working until they realize what they should have done while Bitcoin is cheap! Once more, I'll refer to this very important subject that is probably the hardest to accept and actually use it in real life. Time Preference. We need to lower our Time Preference so that we care more about the future than we care about the present! Bitcoin, among other things, can and is being used as a storage of value, for those who are lowering their time Preference, but unfortunately most of us are trading for more shiat money!Well, guess what? We are sucking value out of Bitcoin when we sell it for more shiat money that what we bought it for!And many times, what happens is even worse, for the ones seeking the quick buck. You buy at X, sell at Y > X, then, many times you re-buy at Z > Y... See, what happens to the profit with respect to X -> Y? It may have vanished because you bought it at a higher price than what you previously sold it.",
