Perhaps by doing so, you are helping to promote Bitcoin adoption. But if you choose to hold your Bitcoin without spending it on something, that is still a good idea because if the bull market comes, you will still be making profits on your Bitcoin holdings. But it's really cool to get a cup of coffee with and pay with Bitcoin.The choice is all yours, either to hold or spend but all depends on what your want to use you Bitcoin for.",

      "body": "It is understandable to want to hold onto your Bitcoin instead of spending it, especially given its potential for appreciation. However, it is important to consider the benefits of spending your Bitcoin as well. It can be a great way to support the adoption of cryptocurrency and to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem. Additionally, using Bitcoin for purchases can provide a level of privacy and security that traditional payment methods may not offer. That being said, it is ultimately up to each individual to decide how they want to use their Bitcoin.That is the beauty of Bitcoin, it provides the flexibility for users to choose how they want to use their assets. Whether it is holding onto it as a long-term investment, using it for everyday transactions, or a combination of both, the choice is entirely up to the user.",

The point is that while the price is bound to keep rising on long term, there's no guarantee for it and, even more, on short term it can easily reach the point the price is much lower than you'd like to see.I've bought sats, earned sats, spent sats. If I look back I would have a good situation by now if I would have kept them all, but I didn't. I go by the \"spent some, kept some\" policy. Indeed, if I look back maybe it was not the best one. But even if Bitcoin price will be tomorrow absolute 0, I'd be still on profit. And this helped a lot my morale during the past crypto winter.There are pluses and minuses, as you see, in each approach. You should do as it suits you best.",

Have you got any statistical other my record to prove this assertion?I think it's inaccurate to say most people are making purchases with bitcoin or any cryptocurrency at that for a means of payment. We don't have up to 10% of world population to be using bitcoins and even worst still, merchants whom are ready to accept it for a mean of payment. The few that have tried have got jurisdiction issues as, bitcoin is outlawed in many nations and could be seen as breaking the law to own or transact in bitcoin.Still, having yo spend some of your coin when opportuned isn't a bad idea but, having to empty a large all or a large part of your portfolio isn't the best of approach. Hodling is still what you should be doing if you can afford to.",

One of the most important purpose of bitcoin according to satoshi himself is that it is a currency that is could be for payment purposes. There’s absolutely nothing wrong in using it to pay for your goods or services most especially if they are cross border transactions. This will only save one from stress of going through bank fees because bitcoin is solely here to ease our transaction burden caused by fiat. The main purpose of holding on to bitcoin is first as a store of value and also to earn profits as it increases. Using bitcoin as a payment gateway is when you have fiats to pay for them easily and you are hoarding fiats and then giving away bitcoin easily in every transaction. This is considered bad because of fiat’s lack of value and it’s ability to depreciate with time",

Bitcoin can be use to buy things directly and indirectly. Like the direct way is when the seller accepts bitcoin in his or her payment option and you do the transfer direct to the person's wallet. While indirect way is, you have to sell off you coin to your Fiat currency and use it to buy the goods.You can't hodle bitcoin forever, definitely you must spend it one day when the price of bitcoin has well appreciated.

The good thing is that you should spend it wisely and hold yourself accountable for your actions. The positive mindset here is that you know what you're doing and believe you're doing the right thing for your future benefit. Those who buy and sell do not necessarily want it to go that way, but sometimes life circumstances force you to change your initial investment strategy. When such things occur, you have nature to contend with for what appears unrealistic because everything is already predetermined.Bitcoin is designed for transactions, with the primary goal of serving as an alternative to the fiat currency we use. Its primary goal is to function similarly to fiat currency, so spending bitcoin after purchasing it to hold is still normal. Buying and holding is another aspect entirely related to the investment aspect of bitcoin. It's fine to spend; there's no need to argue about whether this is a positive or negative mindset.",

While it is required to HODL if one needs a large return over a duration without living in penury now, I see no foolishness in spending or reinvesting some of its yields in sorting out some current challenges that need money attention. It is wise if other means of earning can be used while your coins rest, it is also wise to explore other opportunities with careful thought.",
