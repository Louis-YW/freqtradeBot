  "content": "There are few games that remain extremely active in the midst of a crypto winter - the X-Metaverse is one such game. Launched in May 2022, this community-favorite online interstellar warfare strategy card game has been praised for its intense battles, subtle strategy combinations, and diverse nurturing gameplay.This article reveals information about X-Metaverse gameplay and how to profit from it, as well as a host of other interesting facts.X-Metaverse official address on BNB Chain0xb080171c8999c336cc115d4d8224c2de51657a1c6 Ways to Make Money on the X-MetaverseX-Metaverse is tailored for hardcore gaming enthusiasts who want a thrilling experience in the metaverse. Players can earn money by playing X-Metaverse and feeling the adrenaline rush. The game's pilots and space battleships are economic assets in the X-Metaverse, earning income from activities such as interstellar combat, racing, mining resources and trading.The most common way for new players to earn money on the X-Metaverse is to actually play the game. As you play, you will receive XMETA in-game tokens and generous amounts of in-game materials. The easiest strategy for gaining these in-game earnings is to use up your energy in PVE and PVP modes.1.PVE modeBy completing PvE levels, you can earn up to 400 energy cores per day, which is worth about $1.17, and if you stick with it for a month you can get a price of more than $30. This is the most stable game since gamefi 6 months, he brought me a few months of stable income, is my lunch and I am very grateful to X-Metaverse.2. PVP modeYou need to spend effort to participate in arena battles. You can fight bosses to get gems to set in your battleship to increase your combat power, so you can get a higher PVP ranking, your ranking will determine how much XMETA you can win. That's an average of nearly $125 a week, which is a huge amount of money for an average family. The extra tip is that you can PVP every day between 6:00-8:00 UTC and 18:00-20:00 UTC each PVP win will give you an extra 6 points, which will give you an even bigger advantage. If you want more points you can also duel during this time!3. Space JumpYou need to put XMETA in your prize pool to race against other players' space battleships, your ranking will determine the percentage of XMETA prize pool you can win, 2-4 minutes to complete a race, the highest prize is up to 55K XMETA, worth $184. It's an exciting race game that makes us excited!4.Battleship retrofitting and sellingWhen a space battleship is retrofitted, a new space battleship will be raised and all of its skills and attributes will be changed, and you can either use it for battle or sell it on the market. When you SR retrofit three times with a failed result, you will 100% get 1 SR class space battleship on the 4th battleship retrofit.The current market price of N-class space battleship is 1,350 XMETA, worth 4.5 USD, while the minimum cost to perform 1 retrofit is only 34 USD, a gain of over 492.94%, which is a huge ROI, let me answer your last concern for you, the NFT trading market in X-Metaverse recovers SR battleships every day by mysterious forces (I guess maybe it's official , but I'm not sure, that's my guess) I've tried it a few times and it keeps me immersed in battleship retrofits every day.5. Farm stake PoolParticipants can use XMETA-BUSD LP trading pairs, Space Battleship NFT, Pilot NFT, to stake for rewards, the annualized yield remains above 150%, which is very stable APY has lasted for at least 4 months, the usual round time is 30 days, the latest 1 NFT stake total prize pool is up to 864K XMETA, worth $2,896.6. Stake DAOA part of all X-Metaverse revenue is destroyed directly and a part is added to the DAO dividend pool. DAO dividends will directly benefit everyone in the community by participating in staking veXMETA to receive voting rights and game revenue dividends. Dividends are paid every 30 days and distributed based on a percentage of the veXMETA dividend pool holdings, and everyone can initiate proposals to the game to fix some of the illogical structures that are taking the game one step closer to true decentralization. All the concentration of power will be well relieved. That's what I've always admired and trusted about the project, and they've been working hard on the game. I hope it gets better and better! I think the game will become as phenomenal as AXS/MBOX/SSS and will have a high position in the future WEB3 space.It's all in the gameFrom Axie Infinity to the X-Metaverse, blockchain gaming has injected excitement and competition into the space. The advent of blockchain has led to a scenario where a user push economy exists for games. Technology puts players in control, allowing them to make money by using their time, energy and skills effectively in the game.What makes this game X-Metaverse amazing is that both newbies and veterans can enjoy this game. They start at level 1 and as they gain levels, experience and gems, they go through complete and exciting space battles.",
