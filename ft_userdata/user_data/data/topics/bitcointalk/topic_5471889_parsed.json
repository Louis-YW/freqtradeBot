      "body": "Not all rich people gamble, that I know. Many of them want to keep their fortune intact so they rather do business than put it into high-risk expenses like gambling. I don't think gambling will satisfy my ego. We have different things on our minds when we get rich and gambling in an intense way is not one of my goals. I'd rather invest it in real estate and wait for the returns even though it will take time. My kids will probably keep that business going and they will be the ones reaping the rewards which for me is a success in my life. IMO, I don't think you will still think about gambling when you have loads of money in your wallet and in your account. I bet you will think about something else where you could spend it wisely.",

Drake has a net worth of $250 million and makes $70 million a year. If he bets $250,000 on a bet, it's like someone with an average net worth of $250,000 betting $250. If we consider his income, it's like someone earning $50,000 a year betting $170.So it is not so much a question of ego as a question of percentages.",

It’s really insane to see it if we use our own perspective since we don’t have money and we can’t afford it but it’s really different if you are already on their situation since you will keep chasing for more.Human has no self satisfaction in nature and once they on gambling. Betting an amount that is in proportion to their financial status will only satisfied your cravings for gambling.",

Assuming someone is a millionaire who is spending $1000 in a casino every so often, they won't get cocky and sink a couple thousand more for their 'ego' to be satisfied. Besides, what would feeding their ego do in this situation anyway when they can't enjoy gambling properly? With the number of rich people I've met that is into gambling, none of them seem to feed their ego in every gambling session that they do. They're just out there to have fun, and not make everything about them, or get serious in gambling to get more money in the end.",

For example, if it's me I wouldn't risk betting thousands of dollars because my ego simply is satisfied with smaller bets and I will enjoy my gambling session losing or winning. Gambling doesn't guarantee you to win 100% of the time, but sometimes I do feel the urge to bet more my money, and it leaves me feeling confused and bad.",
