Link to Mineable Token WhitepaperThe reason why 0xMT is born: after the DeFi massive widespread on the Ethereum mainnet, gas fees for transactions have become too high. This has a relevant and heavy impact on all the projects, and particularly if considering mined-tokens: submitting solutions and claiming rewards have become too expensive.The alternative is offered by the Layer 2 Chains: with its low gas fees, fastness and smart-contract execution capabilities, it is the most suitable environment to give rebirth to bitcoin through the tokenized minable asset 0xMT.

      "body": "Great news! The latest development in the world of cryptocurrency mining has made it possible to mine 0xMT (Mineable Token) with Forge and ABAS (Arbitrum Bitcoin and Staking). This exciting opportunity allows miners to access these assets and potentially earn rewards on all three tokens at once. To get started, all you need is the pool address, which is http://pool.0xmt.com:4444Mining 0xMT with Forge and ABAS offers a user-friendly experience, as it allows you to set up your mining operation and then forget about it, letting the technology do the work for you. This means that you can focus on other activities while your mining rigs operate autonomously.The best part is that mining ABAS and Forge alongside 0xMT comes at no cost. You don’t have to pay any fees or invest any capital upfront. It’s an excellent opportunity for miners who are looking to explore new cryptocurrencies without financial risk.Payouts for your mining efforts will be sent out regularly, typically every few days. This ensures that you can see the fruits of your mining activities and enjoy the rewards for your contributions to the network.To start mining 0xMT with Forge and ABAS, follow these steps:Set up your mining hardware or software.Access the mining pool by using the provided pool address, http://pool.0xmt.com:4444 or stratum+tcp://pool.0xmt.com:4444Connect your mining equipment or software to the pool by configuring the necessary parameters. This will enable your devices to join the mining pool and contribute their computational power to the network.Once your mining operation is up and running, you can sit back and relax, knowing that you are actively mining 0xMT, ABAS, and ForgeRemember to regularly check the pool address and any associated documentation for updates and instructions. The mining community is constantly evolving, so it’s essential to stay informed and adapt your mining setup accordingly.Main pool websites: https://pool.0xmt.com & https://pool.forgetoken.org/",
