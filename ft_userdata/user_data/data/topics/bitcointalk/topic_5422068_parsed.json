      "body": "I am not an escrow but it is necessary to use escrow in dealing with people that you do not know personally. The usual way here is by sending the funds to an escrow and once confirmed and secured, the goods will be sent to the buyer. If you are selling tokens, you have a choice to send it to the escrow or let the buyer send its payment to the escrow first.The most popular escrow I always heard of in this forum is @minerjones. You can send him a dm.",

So you should be careful when doing deals.with the rating on your recommendation list it is worth considering, given your good reputation and can be trusted by many people. I will choose to do further transactions with the escrow list that people often use (in the tread link you provided) Also, not all ratings are decent and trusted with the flags or redtrust they have (which have bad behavior, of course there are some). I'm not worried because there are more people who are trusted here on the forum, either escrow with any transaction. the advantages of the forum make me believe that even though I have been around for a long time, here it is more comfortable to at least have a sense of anticipation of what might happen.",
