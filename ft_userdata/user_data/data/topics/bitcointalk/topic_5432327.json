I mean that if something like what killed the dinosaurs will happen, I'd say that mining will be in trouble. Possibly humanity too.Quote from: Stedsm on December 29, 2022, 08:48:43 PMDo you think that some day, if miners are to stop their mining for a longer period, maybe a week or a month (very least/rare chances of this to happen), will it become an opportunity for small miners to merge and mine and try their luck at finding a block when the big numbers are out of the game for some time?Your question tells only one thing: you should read much more before posting.If a big number of miners go offline (or get stopped) the chances are pretty big the difficulty will remain high. So the small miners will not really stand a chance.The small miners can chip in only after the difficulty adjustment has kicked in and reduced the difficulty significantly.

If the hashrate drops to half after one week, then there will still be 2 weeks until next adjustment.Of course, it can happen very close to the adjustment block/moment, but the chances are small.However, if the difficulty goes down very much then yes, probably smaller miners will have a chance again. They may need pools be adapted for them though.But I would not be hoping for such situations because then a business with a lot of dormant (less profitable) ASICs can fire them up and perform a 51% attack.

But after two months of blocks every 40 minutes, how low do you think bitcoin would go in price?",

Definitely mergers would happen as this will add on a pools computing power to have a higher chance of those block rewards on a regular basis .",

      "body": "Well considering it is literally impossible to claim\"Bitcoin mining hashrate fell more than 13% in one single day\"I wonder who actually made that claim?It's completely impossible to know the world mining rash rate on any particular day.It's impossible to even estimate it reliably.All you can use is the diff change every 2016 blocks, to get an estimate of the average world hash rate over that 2016 blocks (usually about 2 weeks).That too is also an estimate, and not exact at all either.Using Erland's CDF over a set of 144 blocks, it says quite clearly that the hash rate can stay the same for a day,and yet within +/-1% possibility change by more than 21% i.e. on average, once every 100 days it will drop or rise by more than 21% for no reason than random variance.On average, once very 8.5 days it will drop or rise by 10% for no reason than random variance.Across a full diff change, 2016 blocks, the probability of it being more than +/-2% wrong due to random variance is, on average, once every 5.4 diff changes.So yeah, anyone making claims about the hash rate change over a single day, has clearly misunderstood whatever data they read,or worse, believed data they read somewhere that was displayed by someone without any statistical understanding of bitcoin mining.",

So natural if you asked me, i will say natural disaster really does has a great negative effect on mining activities.In business a disadvantage for Mr B. could be an advantage for an advantage to Mr A.,  so most definitely if a natural disaster forces the big miners off for a period it's an added advantage to the smaller Miners to easily hit a block or some blocks. That's how business entails anyway!",

And as for small miners, they could get some advantage over a big facility being shutdown, but the percentage would be very low. If you have a strong mining system and others are being out of the competition for natural disaster, then the percentage would go a bit high, but the difficulty stays the same for some time.",

      "body": "It's possible that a sudden drop in mining activity due to natural calamities or other reasons could create an opportunity for smaller miners to try their luck at finding a block. However, mining difficulty adjusts regularly to ensure a consistent rate of block production, so any influx of small miners could potentially lead to an increase in difficulty once the larger miners return to the network. Additionally, mining profitability is largely dependent on the price of Bitcoin, which can be volatile and unpredictable. So, while such an opportunity may arise, it's important for miners to consider the potential risks and rewards before investing in mining equipment and joining the network.",
