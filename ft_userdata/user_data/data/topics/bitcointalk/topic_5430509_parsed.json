I think this video [1] is the best for you since it's short and he explain a complete step to connect it. Are you a developer and have create a mini game? maybe you can create new thread about your project in this forum on project development (if you want to let users to test your project) or you could create official thread in Announcement section.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEquMcxkIAk",

      "body": "The point you should get through is to choose the SDK you want to use. With the above example, you can learn more about how to integrate it by looking at its https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/ documentation. Another option is you can choose another SDK, Moralis.I don't know much about the web3 and unity development ecosystem, but as a suggestion, you better seek recommendations on which SDK to choose, a good implementation of an SDK would surely make the development practice more comfortable, and especially if it is maintained.",
