  "content": "\"Roughly every four years, the reward for successfully mining a bitcoin block is cut in half. This event, known as the halving, reduces inflationary pressure on bitcoin. Currently, rewards are 6.25 BTC per block ($170,000) and in April 2024 they will be reduced to 3.125 BTC per block ($85,000).Currently, publicly listed miners mine at a cost of $10,000-$15,000 per bitcoin, said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at mining consultancy Blocksbridge. Once the halving happens, these costs will double, bringing miners’ breakeven point to $20,000-$30,000.Operators with higher production costs per bitcoin will have a more difficult time surviving the halving. According to data compiled by Zhao:Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG)- $8,200Cipher Mining (CIFR) -  $8,600Riot Platforms (RIOT) -$10,400 per bitcoin in the first quarter.\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/07/bitcoin-halving-is-coming-and-only-the-most-efficient-miners-will-survive/",

Nevertheless you can set up a rig and mine, you learn something and you might get pay-out off as you mine. Depending where you are mining. It's kind of hard nowadays alone to download the core.",

There panels out there that can handle decent sized wall rigs so maybe it's unseen thus far?Yeah, all those miners who have poured millions into data centers and gear are just so stupid and they haven't figured out how cheap solar energy is, they need some random dude on a forum to tell them so.An S19 burns 72kwh a day, in a scenario in which you get 6 hours of peak sun, remember just because it's sunny outside doesn't mean the panels are producing at full capacity, so you need 15 kWh of solar panels to be safe and 40kwh in batteries equivalent and this is to keep you safe only for one day.Now google a 10kw solar panel system and tell me how \"cheap\" that is!Anyhow, mining revenue per raw th is still 20% higher than at the start of the year, including that is the picture of dropping energy rates all over the world and it stops beings such an apocalyptic future. Remember that at the start of the year, the revenue was almost half of what is now so if miners have survived that they will survive a having even with just a 25% increase in price.",

I have a solar mining setup at home, basically for gPUs not Asic miners, even with GPU miners I can't run them at night because my batteries can't run them till the next morning, I only enjoy mining once the sun rise in the morning, so that's like 8am to 5pm of continuous mining, but once the sun goes down, it's problem.

Storm like wind.Those destroy wind turbines easily.Quote from: kano on June 12, 2023, 11:23:24 PMEnergy storage is, to be blunt, in it's infancy, and anyone trying to store 100's of kilowatts or megawatts will have already learned the hard way how problematic, with current technology, that is.That is a plus. a big one too.

I am guessing you meant wind turbine energy, I am from Nigeria and I heard Turbines are good in a windy area, what can you tell me about this? I think he meant steam turbines because those are the only ones you can predictably turn on at a fixed hour when the sun goes down, wind although still predictable close to even 48 in advance wiht new er technology if it doesn't happen it doesn't, so you're stuck with no power.Quote from: Z390 on July 16, 2023, 07:58:52 AMIt's why I haven't started mining Bitcoin with free energy yet because it takes lots of watts from the wall. As long as it costs you even a penny to make it's no longer free. Solar panels, wind turbines and batteries cost money, thus making the produced electricity not free.",

You have the option of mining from 8:00 to 17:00 with solar panels, although I don't think you don't have rainy and cloudy days, but wind turbines are wind dependent and each turbine has an optimal wind speed for maximum power. You will not be able to mine at night without batteries. But for lighting, it can be used, but it is better to ask local experience in using such equipment and how it works in conditions of storms, sand, dust and similar weather conditions.",
