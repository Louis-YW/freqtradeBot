AFAIK, Bitcoin core is the only wallet that generates the .dat files.But if you're just referring to the wallet file, then there's is no way to import it and I don't think you could add it to internal storage unless your device is rooted.",

Anyways, in the case you are talking about a wallet file created by electrum and it's not encrypted, you can open it using a text editor application on your mobile phone and get your seed phrase. If your wallet file is encrypted, I don't think there's any solution other than opening the wallet using a desktop of version of electrum and export the seed phrase.",

The safest way is to repair your laptop or remove the hard drive from the laptop before you bring the laptop to a professional technician.And then next time make a backup of your seed phrase so that you can recover your wallet on an Android device.",
