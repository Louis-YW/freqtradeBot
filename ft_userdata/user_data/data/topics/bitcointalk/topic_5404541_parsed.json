  "content": "I am really new here. My machine's network is under the supervision of an administrator. Previously I used mining software with no software fees (so I guess no communication other than with the mining pool I set). I successfully bypassed the admin's supervision by using OpenVpn to proxy my communication with the mining pool.However, now for some reason, I am using a mining software with software charges, NBMiner. I used the previous way, but unfortunately now the admin is able to observe my behavior from the network.At first I thought it was the mining software that requested the DNS, and the address of the DNS server was provided by the administrator, so he was able to find me. Later, by accident, I know that administrators were able to find the Stratum protocol to discover mining communications as well. So they find me. I think it's because the software author's mining pool is not proxied by OpenVpn, thus it is not encrypted by OpenVpn.Here is the solution I came up with (unverified): I now proxy the address of the DNS server with OpenVpn (a public DNS server not provided by the admin). From the results of the tcpdump command, when I turn on the vpn, my machine will not directly access the DNS server. Don't know if there will be other issues.Also, fundamentally, I think I need to block all communication from the mining software other than the address I set the mining pool to, but I don't know how to achieve this.I don't know if I'm right or not, please help, thank you!",

      "body": "Do you know how nbminer actually works and have you just installed it on your machine as before and set up. The proxy (vpn) for it to mine through or set up the proxy (vpn) to catch all your computer's communications and forward them through it.Can you look at how to get the logs from Nbminer and copy them here (removing any personal Information that might be stored there).Finally it looks like they mine on your machine for themselves for some time and you mine on it for the rest (not sure how this works but maybe 1 minute is spent mining for them and 99 are spent mining for you - you might have to allow access to one or two of their servers too in order to be able to mine).",

I don't know which OS you are using, but the gist is the same for all of them: Open your firewall software, and whitelist the mining pool address (if it asks, choose TCP protocol), then set all other outgoing connection to \"block\". To temporarily stop the blocking, disable the firewall software.",

      "body": "If you're restricted by \"your\" network administrator, you should think very carefully to the possible consequences of what you're doing.If \"your\" administrator is actually the admin of the company you're working for and you're mining with their machines, you may face charges for spending their electricity and maybe also for the extra wear on the hardware. Plus, obviously, the risk of getting fired.Since I don't expect you earn that much from mining... I think that you should consider thinking it through, instead of finding ways to bypass it.",
