I believe during his tenure he didn't start any new war and probably he would have discouraged these on going wars. Trump looks more humanitarian despite being a republican, he dialogue more than going to war. His policies didn't bring inflation to the world in general and if he is speaking the way he is speaking now, he probably have seen things not going well.",

When Mr Trump speaks, I’m always reminded of the saying “an empty drum makes the loudest noise”. He has no plans and cares more for himself than he does for the country. If someone would ask him to explain in detail what his plans are to stop the Ukraine war and now the Conflict between involving Israel, he would certainly digress from the question and talk about every other thing aside answering the question.",

      "body": "Donald Trump would likely at least try to go down in history as the president who stopped two wars during his second term, but I believe there would be some problems for both Ukraine people and the people in Gaza. Unfortunately, Trump has already said he would try to stop the aggressions as fast as possible, wish is something which could be taken advantage of by Russia and especial Israel to get a ceasefire under conditions or territorial changes which would be specially positive for their purposes. Trump has already shown to be biased in favor of Israel, that may mean Gazans could lose their territory in exchange of a fragile peace and I do not have doubts in my mind the Republican party would push Trump on not being helpful to Ukraine and accept the annexation of part of that country by Russia, in exchange for peace. Anything he would do, so he may be recognized as a peacemaker. I would not be surprised if he demanded to be given the Nobel Prize of Peace after he pulled off something like that.",

Obviously, Americans should make some wise choice in this coming election and never vote for someone who is a puppet like Biden, Obama, or Bush. I'm not saying they should go for Trump but I'm sure they don't need a puppet president once again to start another war because it could be the last time they could choose a president because the next war will break out, will ignite a high chance for World War III.",

Some president who own businesses that manufacture warfare and arsenal for war or have friends who are into such will not hastily stop wars but those who do business different from that would not benefit from it so they could not be looking that direction. Trump I think is more on the financial market, stocks etc, so probably he may not want to go to war but would want more financial stability. Moreover, as a president he didn't start a war and that is a plus when he is talking peace talk .",

I can't also visualize what he would have done to stop Hamas from attacking Israel. All we can do is speculate what would have happened. But I think Biden looks weaker than Trump so he would have had more influence on both Russia and Israel. It will not be easy to end the Russian-Ukraine war because the terms of peace will be costly. Ukraine will never want it cede any of its occupied territories, meanwhile, Russia has declared all the occupied land independent. Many powerful nations also have an interest in the war in Ukraine, so it will be difficult to negotiate for peace. Stopping the war in Gaza will be more simple. If the US withdraw its support for Israel, the bombardment of Gaza will end. But Trump is highly pro-Israel, so he might have supported this attack on Gaza. If Trump takes the US out of NATO, the alliance will become financially and militarily challenged.",

But I think Biden looks weaker than Trump so he would have had more influence on both Russia and Israel. He won't provide military aid to Ukraine and Russia won't be tempted to keep attacking. Here Hamas is wrong but that can't be enough reason to start invading a country and its only happened because US sent their Aircraft carrier as means of support and threaten other nations so like in both cases Biden induced the war in one or other way.",

I know he's a businessmen and he would do all those things that would profit him but in his tenor there were less wars and the inflation wasn't that high. Let's see if he gets elected as president once again then what new things he will bring with him. I believe those politicians are good humans who stop the wars and think about economical progress and Donald Trump is one of such politicians.",

I don't think Trump can do that. No one can, Xi will not be able to do it too. there's been conflict in every neighboring country and even decades past the conflict still is growing. When China fails and India develops further, these two will also clash. Every government is just waiting for the other to get weakened and they will exploit the weakness.",
