I thought that by now people got smarter, but no, I see they're just greedier.I know I mentioned it the other day but with rented places I see it happening more and more because landlords are getting greedier and tenants are getting more snarky about power. At least around here a lot of rental spaces had a separate meter for each office / tenant. You paid you bill and that was that. But more places are now seeing electric as a profit center and charging people if you use it or don't. So they use it. No it's not free but if your bill went from between $75 to $90 paying direct and now it's $180 fixed then yeah you are going to say f--k it and use more power. *The $75 to $90 was power use, not the full cost of the account & other charges. Same now, the billing is different but its close to 2x the power charge + the \"admin fee\" and so on....-Dave",

Just taking that off the table and doing this purely from a financial perspective.  -DaveI worked at a large (20k+ people) computer company out of grad school (this was several decades ago) with lots of buildings, some older, some newer spread out over a larger geographical area for the part I worked with, maybe 2000 people in that section of the state, with plenty of areas that were empty except for maybe 1 person.  I wouldn't have done it if bitcoin had even been around then, but it would've been easy to have a few miners in one section of the office and no one would even see it.  With that many people in so many different buildings, multiple floors, secure areas etc also, I doubt they would've noticed the change in power usage. It may not happen on the scale shown, but one or two in a closet off the office or under your desk, I bet that happens pretty frequently.",

A lot of students also did this from their dorm rooms at university, but the sudden spike in the electricity cost.. lead to several of these rooms being raided by campus police.

Firstly, someone normal can be fined or even fired because it was his/her responsibility to prevent such stealing. Apart from that, stealing from the governemt is usually punished severely and I wouldn't advise anyone to risk their freedom for the sake of getting some cash. That's why I said \"Stealing is bad\": it's not only morally bad like in the first example, it can be very harmful for the thief himself, and not in the \"afterlife\" or some \"reincarnation\", but here and now.",

Most of them probably teens leeching electricity from their parents and overheating their poor GPUs for some mili-ETH.But just recently I heard about an IT guy working at a university nearby, who had some ASICs running alongside some real servers. And there are probably so many more similar activities that are going unnoticed.Nice for decentralization, not so great if individuals are directly affected - but my guess is it's usually large companies or public place (-> tax payers) that are getting drained. Otherwise it would quickly ring some alarm bells as soon as the latest energy bill is presented.",
