This already dumped so hard and celer network rarely used by the developers to create their own dapps. Im sure that this network is having small traffic on its network. It may be pumped soon but none knows when that will come. Quote from: LordOfCryptoMa on June 01, 2022, 04:08:51 AM I invested a huge amount on it but I'm in a big loss since I invested on it.Yeah caused by the chart is always going down without even trying to go up. People already very familiar with it. People have been moving their money to the promising token like polygon.",

I invested a huge amount on it but I'm in a big loss since I invested on it.After taking a look at the coin I do not see much future for it, it has crashed more than 90% since its ATH and it keeps going down, with the latest drop happening roughly one month ago, now since the coin has right now a market cap of 100 million then it is difficult for it to pump, as those which like to pump coins prefer coins with a market cap which is way lower so they can pump it as high as they can with a low amount of capital, so if I were you I would be thinking about cutting my losses.",

It's in the green, and you could've profited from it. I hope you have been able to cash out some of your profits or something unless you have entered at the peak, which will be so far from the current price. Why did you choose this, btw? @OP",

I was once a holder of this project but it seems the developer hit a dead end and just delaying the development to prolong it's life but nothing new or interesting dapp inside it besides this project was backed by Binance. Maybe CZ will pump again this project so it's still good to accumulate some of this token because it has a pump potential with CZ magic. I don't recommend to hold CELR an amount that you can't afford to lose. This is a high risk high reward token. Thanks for reminding me again about this token.",

I invested a huge amount on it but I'm in a big loss since I invested on it.You can see for yourself, that the token you are talking about has done a fairly high rally in 2021 in September. And for the altcoins themselves, if you find something like this, the solution is not to get trapped. The high price has been reached very successfully and dumped to a price you know it is back to the point where the price of this token started. But if you have your own research that tokens can come back, maybe this isn't the time. All focus on Bitcoin price growth which rose this year. We're supposed to be dealing with a fairly long bear market until the 2024 halving, but no one knows when that will happen.",

I invested a huge amount on it but I'm in a big loss since I invested on it.I did a small a small research about this coin and it seems very promising. I checked its stats on cmc and all are looking great, the volumes, the marketcap, and it was listed on so many top exchanges like binance. I can sense that this coin will soon pump along with other great coins when the bear market ends or when the bull run enters so keep your patience still.You may see a red or a negative profit but that was only for temporary. You aren't in a loss as long as you didn't touch anything so don't over think about it as it can cause you to do unwanted things but better if you unwind outside for a while. If you have some funds left you can always invest for more.",

I invested a huge amount on it but I'm in a big loss since I invested on it.I think they need a catalyst for them to pump or wait until the whole market turns green once again. You're not the only one here that was in a loss unless you really buy it at the top, that's for sure a 70% decrease from your portfolio or even more, I guess. Well, as I have said they need a catalyst but you need to research more regarding that on what are they trying to develop.",

Many atlcoins have fallen deeply due to the recent market crash not just Celer Network, CELR is one of the projects released on Binance Luanchpad, which is a layer 2 project. But it doesn't seem strong enough to compete with other projects so they don't get much attention, the project is still active and developing so I think OP should keep holding instead of cutting loss now. He should wait for the market to start to recover then can cutloss at a higher price than it is now.",
