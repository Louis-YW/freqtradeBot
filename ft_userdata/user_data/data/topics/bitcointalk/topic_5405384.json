I doubt though that there are single whales responsible for this. I think that Bitcoin and Ethereum for example have become so big in the last few years that it is almost impossible for a whale or for a handful of whales to manipulate the price of this projects. What really brought the market down to todays level was the collapse of Terra Luna two months ago in my opinion because it was totally unexpected for most people that a top 10 project in terms of marketcap could collapse so fast and easily and since then the crypto space is full of fear and uncertainty.",

LOL. the recent prices drop in crypto market was caused by the crypto trend starting to weaken, then supported by negative news such as the collapse of $LUNA, problems with the Celsius platform and also information regarding the bankruptcy of Voyager (IMO). Maybe soon we'll see more price drop than today. It all depends on the trend as well as sentiment.",

The impact that already made by those whales are so big for the cryptocurrency market right now. The fact that once the whales are dumping together and market became very panic.

It's not the whale but the global economic has been pushing people to dump their tokens and exchange it to the cash or fiat money to keep their value from the volatility. You must also aware if there are some crypto companies that already collapse and even venture capital like 3ac was also going bankrupt as well. That proves that if the world is not yet fine for now. The roller coaster may still continue if another bad news will come very soon. prepare yourself. 3AC is also one of the elephants in the market but has also filed for and filed for bankruptcy. The market is certainly controlled by the whales, but only for a certain moment and then closes after that, they don't have enough power to manipulate all the time. The cryptocurrency market today is already a part of the world economy, so it is impossible to stay out of the current crisis. Once the world has stabilized high-risk assets like bitcoin will still be a lot of roller coasters.",

Although you are right about not to tag every market movement to whales, it could any other reason. It could be as a result of the economic instability the whole world is currently facing. I don't think there is a known reason out there that causes the bear season.",

Traders makes a lot of money from this roller coaster ride, its a good pump and dump and if you are able to ride of those trend, then you can be able to earn some money. Whales on the other hand are just doing their best to protect their money, and we can also expect that some of them are really playing with the market right now to earn some money as well.",

Therefore, the market can be controlled by the money flow of many people. But I don't think big investors play much of a role right now. Because the world is in a crisis in general, and investors are panicking and selling their cryptocurrencies, causing the market to fluctuate. In short, in my opinion, not only the crypto money market but all economic activities are in trouble because there is a financial crisis around the world right now.",

Few recoveries in Feb and March and then going down April-June.As for the manipulation, whales have been in the market for so long that maybe they have control of it. Although one can argue that as the market gets bigger, the more difficult it will be for them influence. But what they do might really affect the price if you see big sell orders in an exchange or some social media highlighted that there is a huge movement like withdrawal.
