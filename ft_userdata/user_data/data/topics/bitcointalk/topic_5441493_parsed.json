      "body": "I smell something fishery in INEC,all the assurance they gave to Nigerian citizens on conducting a free and fair election is barbash. As reports from observers and party agents said that INEC has failed to upload the result from the PU to Abuja immediately after the elections are over in PU. INEC came up with silly excuses like,no network, inability to access password and low battery. Imagine small children talk,this has proved to Nigerians that it is INEC that is rigging our elections and giving us bad leaders that the citizens didn't vote for. Nigerians are patiently waiting to hear who is the winner of Saturday's election and I think INEC is looking for a way to manipulate the election in favour of their candidate. Gos will disgrace and frustrate whoever wants to change the votes of the people.",

We also pray that whoever is the choosen one will change Nigeria and make it a better place for us all. We hope this time around that the economy also changes for good because the present economy in Nigeria is not favourable.",
