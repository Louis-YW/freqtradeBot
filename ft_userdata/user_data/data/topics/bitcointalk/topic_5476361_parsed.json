Hope to cooperate with all the powerful project parties. telegram: https://t.me/citex_enWebsite: https://www.citex.clubI've never heard anything about this CITEX crypto exchange. Is it really in the club of \"world's largest\" cryptocurrency exchange platforms?What the hell is a \"mining currency exchange\"? Do you mean altcoins, that are profitable for mining?What the hell is this \"free listing event to support the development of mining coins and valuable tokens\"? This seems more like shitcoin shilling to me. Truly valuable tokens and altcoins don't need free listings on a crypto exchange. How many domain names does CITEX have? I did a Google search and there are citex.info and citex.io domains as well as the citex.club domain. Which one is the legit domain?",
