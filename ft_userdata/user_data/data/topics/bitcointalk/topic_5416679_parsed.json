      "body": "I normally wait for a certain number of candles but I'm a bit random with it. If I remember I have a position open and haven't received any alerts, I'll normally wait for double or triple the previous trend (in candles) before closing my trade (say the price bounced from 20000 to 21000 twice and took 4 candles the on the drop and 3 candles on the rise, 12 candles later it's probably less likely to happen again - and a risk to leave the trade open). This also often happens because a tightening range (where the resistances above and supports below) have already coincided/crossed by the time I opened the order or there might be something on a higher timeframe that becomes more obvious.A lack of movement imo is generally a bad thing if you're trading sub 4h candles (1d timeframes).",

Reason why this is important is because you are probably not the only trader to think like that. Eventually others will get bored and start to sell and it’ll go against you. So it’s wise to always get out if the trade doesn’t look like it’s going to work.",

      "body": "If I set a stop lose and take profit, one of it would surely trigger within a minutes or hours (but usually minutes) unless I planned for swing trading which I will have to set the stop loss and take profit to have more far price in a range from the mark price. When I use scalping, the option triggers very often. Maybe because I do not like going for day trading. I prefer scalping and swing trading instead.If I go for day trading and the price do not get to stop loss or take profit price, I will prefer to just close the order if I am making some profit already. But if it is loss, I use different approaches like checking if the market would correct itself, or if my analyses is suggesting me to just close the trade. It depends.You may not have the satisfactory info from us because trading there is more to trading with different approaches. It is good for people to close trades, it helps to minimize losses, but I have many different approaches that are still very different in a way to have profit from each position opened.",

How long should we let our positions open depends on the type of chart we use for entry price. It should not be longer than 28 candles before we should exit and close our positions. Profit, draw or minor loss, it is good enough if we can close our position without big loss.QuoteBecause for example, the trade you opened becomes sideways or stable, and no pumps or dumps happened that triggered your orders, so for some time, your trade is still open.But it won't move sideway forever. Price has to go to a break out or break down at the end of a price channel. That is time when it is very risky to let our positions open.QuoteSo, do you have a limit for your trades? Like 1 day, week, etc?If I use 1 hour chart, I will not let my position stays more than 28 hours and usually I would like to close it after about half of day.If I use 1 day chart, I would like to close it after 2 weeks.Of course it depends on when I enter. Above duration is if I enter at early of a price channel.",

I don't know what triggers me but maybe being impatient that nothing is happening.And after for a while, will think of another price target for SL and TP and that's it.I guess it's normal for the majority of that since we're all having different thoughts about the market and all of a sudden, we change our minds when we don't see any move.",

Like 1 day, week, etc? If nothing happens, are you closing those trades manually?If you’ve not heard of the term stop loss in trading, check out this link to help you understand what it’s all about.https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-limitorder.aspEvery trade we get into requires us to know when to get out, whether we’re making a bitcoin profit or not. Establishing a clear stop loss level can help you cut your losses; a skill that’s very rare in most traders😴.🤥Choosing a stop loss is not a random activity, and perhaps the most important thing to note here is that you shouldn’t be carried away by your emotions – a great point to set your stop loss is at the cost of your coin. If, for instance, you acquired a coin at $1,000, set that as the minimum point you’re willing to trade your coin. This will ensure that if the worst comes to pass, you can walk away with what you invested in the first place.🤥The same applies to profit levels if you target to get out of the market after hitting a certain minimum profit; stick to that. Don’t be greedy; it’s never a nice color on anyone!😊😊",

You can't understand this question or attempt to answer if you have not been trading, as a trader you will be locked in between this kind of decision.So my answer is yes. I do exit an order that is taking unnecessary time to trigger because with experience sometimes you lose after waiting that long.Quote from: GreatArkansas on October 11, 2022, 02:40:37 AMBecause for example, the trade you opened becomes sideways or stable, and no pumps or dumps happened that triggered your orders, so for some time, your trade is still open.Experience have taught me this that when market is sideways for long, it could be a result of market price and indecision going on at your back (yes lol because you are not there present only through the trading channel or platform, exchange), so it is better to stay out and allow whatever that wants to hit the market to do just that while your capital still stays safe at the time. With experience too I have learnt that it is better to have your money than to unnecessarily lose it and there is always another opportunity for profit. Another lesson to this, when the market seem quiet or sideways for long, something is about to hit the market either a new trend will be formed.",

When sideways happen there's a chance that it could possibly disrupt the technical analysis you are using as a guide but yeah it depends, Sometimes you just need to reposition or change plans like putting the fund allocated for that trade to other positions since you don't want to be stagnant in a position that give you slower result than you are expecting.",

Sell off tokens at a price you are comfortable with, wait until the price drops, and then buy tokens again. Of course, if the price does not adjust as you expect🤦‍♂️, you could either lose money or Bitcoin in the process.🤭🤭Short-selling Bitcoin also incurs high costs and risks. For example, you might need to pay custody or Bitcoin wallet fees to store the cryptocurrency until the trade occurs.🙆‍♂️ You will also have to bear the risk of Bitcoin's price volatility. If the price goes up (instead of down, as you'd hoped), you could end up with significant losses. Certain exchanges also offer leverage for conducting such trades. Again, the downside to using leverage is that it could magnify gains or losses.🫠🫥",
