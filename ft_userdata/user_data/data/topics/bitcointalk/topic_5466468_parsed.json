  "content": "The topic is Investment or Forex trading (fx), so here  is the thing , I'm more into Forex and I should say this,  they both are some how related deal using the key word \"trading\" actually.My overview on  ForexForex trading is pure trading normally meant for the big guys earlier in the days and when I'm talking about the big guys then I'm talking about the real market influencers but was eventually  broken down to the level  where we have brokers getting into market,which gives us chance at the lowest level  according to the model,to have access to game.Forex deals with a lot of currency pairs, synthetic markets,  and even cryptosat large by buying and selling according to the trend in the markets either an uptrend or downtrend. Forex deals with a lot of technical analysis  which can be monitored for a short period of time or long period of time before entries.Now let's  talk about  Investment.Investment can come in different ways but what we are actually insinuating on is holding a pair of a digital currency for a particular period of time by simply buying to sell over the period. However the digital currency here can mean currency pairs, most cases crypto  we can also invest in physical asset but what we are concerned  here  is simply Digital currency Now let's choose  For me  I will just go with Forex trading and my reasons is thisLearning  Forex gives you the foundational level and knowledge to Investment,when  you learn Forex you can predict what to invest on,which gives you two additional knowledge  at a time.However, you might be in support or the other way round or might have anything to add or correct,all welcomed let's here your choice",

I for talk say we need to understand say when we talk about investment, no be only cryptocurrency hodling be investment or the only area wey be investment. Like you have different investment before crypto, although I read where you say you dey particular about digital currency and I take am to be crypto hodling but not FX (trading) or crypto (trading).Having said that, you need understand again say when FX is mentioned say that one mean trading fiat and crypto investment mean hodling crypto because people still dey trade crypto and that one no be crypto investment again because you fit lose all your money for anything wey be trading both FX or crypto trading and FX no be fiat hodling. So you fit still see people wey dey hodl fiat and that one fit still be fiat investment/hodling just like crypto hodling or investment. But I know no who go want hodl Naira and call am investment because inflation go chop am finish and scrap him head like as if him enter barber shop. So , but people fit hodl $ € and other foreign currency as fiat investment because potential to rise dey there and high.QuoteLearning  FX gives you the foundational level and knowledge to Investment,when  you learn FX you can predict what to invest on,which gives you two additional knowledge  at a time.For this level, I no really know wetin you carry for mind because when you talk about FX that one na trading fiat currency, so if you dey carry \"knowledge to investment\" join am except you dey talk about knowing the fiat wey you want hodl for your domi account like the politicians and the \"big boys \" dey do. Them dey keep foreign currency for their domicilliary account and expect am to appreciate just like crypto or bitcoin.However, you fit know about the strength of other foreign currency and their economy if you dey do FX but strictly, when you talk about FX then you dey talk the trading of fiat/currency no be investment. And that na very risky thing to do. If you don read about am you go know and that na why people prefer to still dey hodl crypto than trading it. So, me I choose to hodl or invest in crypto not trading.",

One of dem when en check en yearly transaction en discover say e don loss upto $23,000 live, so when I dey hear all this kind things e dey discourage me.The main reason I take investment sef na because the coin wey I dey invest on na very promising coin wey e no get as e wan be Bitcoin must rise because of many factor eg scarcity.",

Firstly,  EVERYTHING YOU DO IN THIS LIFE IS A RISK, even life itself is a risk.Thus, you have to make risk to get somethings ,it now depends on how you want to define or establish your risk. Back to forex , Forex is no Gamble it's is considered gambling when one is controlled by greediness or entring into trade without analysing which eventually leads to loss of funds which brings to the risk part if you don't understand or have a proper knowledge about it then you are risking all your funds because all you will continue to do is gambling.",

I wouldn't learn forex trading because I don't want to save my funds in fiat currency but in bitcoin that has great potential and it also serves as an hedge to inflation. Trading is risky and can lead to great loss. Investment is the best and I will only invest in bitcoin and not in fiat currency because bitcoin volatile nature makes it a profitable business that holding bunch of fiat currency of any kind. If you keep fiat currency, you will end up regretting how the value has depreciated but when you hodli bitcoin for a long period of time and you could be able to see the bull run,you will be certain of making profit. Don't let anyone deceive you on Forex,it is hold and the cryptocurrency has taken over the trading business.

Forex na trading like I try explain on my own understanding. Investment for forex or crypto na when you no trade am and you just hodl am for your wallet, exchange wallet as the case may be for cryptocurrency, and if you keep your dollar, Euro or pounds etc for your domiciliary account. But if you talk of FX, that one generally mean say you dey trade am , so if you dey trade fiat currency or cryptocurrency then you are not doing investment but trade and it is risky anyway. Investment na if you only hodl am. Well my little idea be that.",

      "body": "First of all, trading is not for everyone. To become a trader, you will need to learn about it. With knowledge and experience you can become a better trader. But the chance that a person will not become a successful trader is higher than for the person to become a better trader. This is because some people will go the wrong way or be doing one thing or the other that will be resulting to losses. There are certain things to be considered before trading, you have to know about how to manage your risks and how to trade in a way that you will overcome emotion.Investment is also good, but it depend on what you want to invest on. If you invested on a shitcoin that became dead, your money is gone. Before you invest, you need to make research about it and know how risky what you are investing on is. If you buy a land, or you are investing on real estate, or you buy bitcoin after a massive bear market. All these can be a good investment. If trading is considered as gambling, some investments are also like gambling.If you invest on less risky assets, it will take less energy from you, you do not have to panic of liquidation after little unrealized loss, you do not have to keep tracking your positions in the derivative market. In this regard, trading is riskier, but that does not still mean that you cannot trade if you learn about it very well and have a good experience already. In my opinion, assuming I am having $1000, I can use $10 to learn how to trade, $100 for trading, and the rest to investment on less risky assets.",

To me, what distinguishes them is the risk involved in them in relation with the process of learning them. To be FX trader, the risk is high when you don’t have any knowledge about it but can be predicted with sufficient knowledge and practice on the market trends overtime. If I am going into investment, which is solely buying and holding, I don’t need to learn much about the market to know the better investment to go into, I just need to buy and hold overtime and wait for my money to increase. The risk here is high and can easily get you bankrupt as we can’t predict the market movement unlike FX that can be determined through learning overtime. In some cases, investment can be researched and analyzed before going into them, but the tendency of them going sideways is still higher than that of FX. The end point is that, they are both risky, but one can be controlled through extensive learning.",

Sha dat one aside, when you say investment I no understand clearly which angle wey you dey go because you no specify the investment if na only cryptocurrency investment or general investment. But sha since you say na currency pairs, weda na only crypto oh abi general investment I go still choose investment because of some benefits wey I dey see for investing wey pass trading (and I no dey talk only about forex trading, it's trading in general too). Forex market do me something sha so I no too like dat side but investing dun bless me so my vote go always go for investing. We dey talk of currency pairs here so see some advantage wey me dey see over trading. Make I just make the thing more understandable, you dey ask weda you go prefer to trade cureency or invest in cureency by buying and holding right (investment)?  When you invest for currency pairs, you dun get the currency for your wallet be dat like when you buy Bitcoin. E go give you the privileges say if the market no do you well today, you fit just hold your currency until the market dun turn green for you to sell but forex go just kick you out of the market if you no stop the trade yourself  Dey dun prove say holding sure pass trading, make.i use Naira and dollar give example, person wey buy dollars when e low like dem 180 +/- dey seat on wealth right now. Sha we all know say trading dey risky and even say you good no mean say market no go fit show you shege at times but investing just dey peaceful as you fit commot mind for your investment rest Make I just stop here sha but things plenty way I fit talk to give investing the victory but dat one no mean say trading no get e own benefits as well like getting instant profits because you no need wait days or months to recieve your cashout like when you do investment.",

I learned forex trading in the years back and it was not easy for me and I also believe that it is meant for science and mathematics related scholars because the calculation that is involved in the process is not for everyone. Different fiat currencies were use for the trading and forex trading was a hot cake and by then I have not even hear cryptocurrency because it was the early morning of cryptocurrency. Forex trading is fully for mathematics and those who not good in mathematics can't go into it which make it very much different from investment. There is no calculation in investment. You only buy the unit of bitcoin or cryptocurrency you want and store it in your wallet and wait for the bull to come and sell them off. Yes as you tok am forex trading now na for di big boys and not for everyone like di first time when im first come out. And for people wey like to trade dem dey do am and people wey like investment sef dey do am everything na choice. Many people go fit choose trading because im dey give daily income and u fit make better earning from there if you sabi do am well. But as for me I like to choose investment because there is no too much stress in investment. As I said earlier before investment is just keeping di coins on the wallet and wait for di market to rise and you sell dem as you want am.But if you have di stress to work you can diversify the investment. You can invest and also do di trading as well but dat one you go need more funds to do that, if you go fit provide di money for the two den nothing do u again. And also as odas wey don tok am, the risk wey dey inside forex trading e too much, person wey no get liver w no go fit do am at all.

Investment like I know it is not limited to digital assets as trading itself is another form of investment... you invest time, resources and even money in order to make more money. Investment in the form of buying and holding digital assets such as Bitcoin is a wonderful approach that have proven to be very profitable but requires a lot of patience and discipline to be able to hold amidst the temptation to sell when in profit or fidget when in loss. Trading on the other hand have higher risk and higher returns.  High risk because it requires very delicate skill and discipline to scale through. But when the skill is mastered, trading is far more lucrative than anything you can imagine. Most big holders of Bitcoin I know are people who made money from trading and decided to invest in Bitcoin.
