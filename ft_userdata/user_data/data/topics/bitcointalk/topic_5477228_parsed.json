Just like during the scacity of momey, you no see wetting happened to banks? The money wey CBN bring make them shear people from different banks the bank managers keep the money, dey shear am among POS Marchants. E Â come make the naira dey scars that time. we go go bank to collect money na problem. Highest Dem fit give you na 3k. Dem dey sell the note to only POS people. This na no tell you say the curruption dey everywhere because if financial institution no ft maintain there dignity by making everything equalibrum, that is to tell you say if the common man do desame I no go too blame them.the government wey we dey look up to don fail us naim they cause all this things. had it been the government dey produce public transportation with better price tag of transportation fee before them they put all this law e for better. But Dem dey put law without providing proffer solution to it. If you know the cost of 1 keke and how the youth dey manage to make money from am, you go know say e no easy for them too. Â No be say I dey support them, but I dey talk base on putting myself in their shoes, you go also know wetting dey make them do those things. Me I bellieve say wetting go cause that price hyke na that ban wey Dem place on tryciclis. And anywhere such thing they, e be like a forbidden zone, and anybody wey dey run am dey at risk and the price of the risk them take naim be the price increase.",

That could be an opportunity in the sight of the transportation guys and for them it's there opportunity to move the market prices upward at a particular time. But as it is an opportunity for the transportation guys , it will not be to the travelers or commuters since as a passenger you're always looking for what's favourable to you and within your budget.This is where the government is supposed to come in, to ensure there is a proper checkmate of the rates and that such rates are standardised and monitored by the related regulatory bodies including that of private car owners. The same issue is what we face with commodities, because there's an increase in the exchange rate and fuel subsidy removal, prices of some commodities have skyrocketed and still increasing by the day and no government body is taking a leadership role towards salvaging the situation for the benefit of the average and poor Nigerians. We are indeed the architects of our own problems.",

And they are believed to have some money saved aside for bribery of caught. We all knows how corrupted the country is and also, the risk of their lives and their Keke has them the reasons for such a high charge fees. This is not something that they are taking chances by over charging for their transportation services. @ OP, atleast you denoted it that they don't change such a high about of the nights during the day.",

      "body": "Na Bayelsa State this thing happened. Na because of change of #50 Aboki man used knife stabbed the Ijaw boy to dead at the middle of this year. The boy just came from Abuja and and he was paying #50 a drop at Abuja so when he came to Yenagoa, according him, before he was stabbed to dead and when the argument was going on, the place he entered the Keke was not even reached the placed he entered the Keke at Abuja. And the Aboki said he would not give him the change so, they argued till Aboki brought out the knife from the Keke and stabbed him to dead. So with that anger the Ijaw youth burnt down the Keke instant and all the Abokis at the area ran away. And the governor heard the news so curfew was used to ban the Keke driving for Night so taxes took over the night movement.And according to taxi drivers the way Keke used to drink fuel is not the same way for Keke so they have to charge high to meet up the expenses. Because where Keke is using 2Ltrs of fuel the taxi can use 5 ltrs of fuel therefore if they charge the same with Keke then they would drive at lost. And that is why they are charging higher in the night. Op this has nothing to do with the forum activities and if this matter dey bother you then you have carry it to your social media handles to air it out there and users would have discussed with you there. I am making comment to clear the story. Bring cryptocurrency related discussions so that we can discuss well.",
