  "content": "Always make sure you take crypto ventures as high risk way of making money because threats lies in every corner, this is why investing only what you can afford to lose is the best strategy ever, there are few mistakes that newbies always do when glimpsing into new projects that I will like to correct..A project can raise millions today and still go awry in future, do not let this be the reason of your investment in any project, those millions of dollars you read that they raised online is sometimes for the team's fat pocket only. A project that's been Audited or Doxxed means nothing, this days teams will appear online and in video and they will still rob people, it doesn't count anymore. Partnerships is very good but still not 100% guaranteed that a project will perform better in future, I have seen people getting too excited because of multiple partnerships, few P2E projects are down 98% right now upon all the partners they got in the bull market, I doubt they will ever recover.Many people trust projects with low max supply easily, they start calculating in hundreds of dollars per coin ðŸª™ in few years, 10,000,000 supply is less than 21,000,000 of total max supply BTC has but yet this doesn't mean a project will perform so great because of its limited max supply. Do not bet on promises that Team members give you, they are saying that to ease your mind so you can probably hold and invest more or bring in more people, relatives and friends, and projects that do deliver gives no promises to their investors.Team's and Developers past experience matters but we are human, greed can consume even the most loyal hearts, do not bet your hard-earned money on a human's trust and promises, only invest what you are willing to lose. Take care",

Crypto is infested by a lot of scammer and at the same time newbie traders are always the victim on this kind scheme. Crypto is already risky even before but the existence of NFT and other new shit idea that makes scammers scam easily by just creating garbage NFT and worthless token makes the crypto space more risky. The fun fact is people never learned to stay away on this shit project despite that they already know that itâ€™s a scam. People only wants to ride the hype so they will never learn.",

Why do I suggest that, the main thing is that bitcoin never promises anything grandiose about its potential but traders and investors will play a direct role in creating its potential in the market.On the other hand, bitcoin is an asset that is also not completely without risk. There are a few things to consider for anyone looking to invest, adopt as a currency, and the like. The risk is real, it is a high value currency so a good understanding will help them to minimize the risk.",

You should also carefully analyze your personal finances and give a detailed plan for your investments so that in the event of unexpected changes, you will find it easy to protect your funds. In the end, each person decides whether or not to make the step into crypto investments, but the key thing is to take this step without unrealistic expectations and without neglecting the risk that exists therein.While there is no investment that guarantees returns or a safe haven from market downturns, crypto investing is particularly risky due to its unregulated nature. Anyone considering buying crypto coins should first educate themselves about Bitcoin and the crypto world in general. It's also worth doing further research on each of the coins you're interested in to make sure their usage suits your needs and expectations before buying them. The market is full of sharks and scammers, so be careful!",

You're right as well, there's no doubt that alot of people have make it from investing on altcoins, but let's take the survey abit and see, how many of those altcoins they have invested in the past are still existing to this day? how many investors loose their money away all because of this investment with altcoins and compare it to the ones that survived it by making fortune out of it, alot of wealth have been diverted through this and many lives have been displaced into trauma due to bounties, the gain is high quite alright but the risk is higher than expected at the end and only few narrowly escape their trick.",

To be quite honest, I can't really think of one. While there are strong altcoins out there like Monero or Ethereum, they are obviously not as solid as Bitcoin itself. So if we are talking of threats and therefore risks in the wide crypto market, Bitcoin is indeed the safest choice. It's the only coin worth HODLing.",

Thank God I have come to the real knowledge and understanding of cryptocurrency in totality.I met a friend the other day who is seriously into altcoins he makes again and he makes money from them according to him. I had no problems with that, but he was discrediting bitcoin investment. I asked him why don't he invest in number 1 cryptocurrency which is Bitcoin instead of gambling without altcoins and shitcoins. His answer was simple, bitcoin will not give him good profits. Â I said well it is because of the profits that makes people to lose money .There is no way altcoins will rise without bitcoin rising, for altcoins to rise means bitcoin has risen and pulled them.This means bitcoin will also give profits even if not massive but the sure thing is that in 5yrs time, bitcoin will still be here which cannot be said of some other coins.",

So the answer is anytime you decide to invest is best but your goal should be holding long term say 4+ years and you can check it has always given return to holders in this cycle.Second rule says invest amount you afford to loose or better do DCA in it to accumulate more with the amount you are willing to invest overtime.Now for the altcoins/shitcoin projects you are saying then yes there are many ways to scam people and most of them are pump dump scheme setup to fool you around but still you can make profits out of them in short term trading as many do but not trust them for long term because they don't have any utility and liquidity in the market so coins will be lying dead in your wallets with zero value.So better sell them at right time to make profits.It's really hard to judge a project by reading documents as they can be easily manipulated and you can write and promise anything that sounds lucrative to the investors and once you raise funds they are transferred to some other address and bypass the exchange restrictions and can't be freezed as well so they are rug.But also sometimes there are project which provide return to you with some utility but it's hard to find so best is to stick with good alternative only.",
