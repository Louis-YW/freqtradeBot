Just can't seam to get the bitcoin-qt to work to start off the magic and run Bitcoin core GUI. Error message:bitcoin-qt: cannot execute binary file: Exec format errorI'm wondering if the original download is wrong?Kit: Rapsberry Pi 4 (8GB Ram), running Ubuntu latest version with an external ssd ready to go.Any ideas would be a massive help... I'm in a google / youtube tutorial doom spiralstw",

It is ARM, so you want to download bitcoin-24.0-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz assuming that your version of Ubuntu is 64-bit (otherwise bitcoin-24.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz).I recommend that you follow this guide: https://raspibolt.org/Note that the guide assumes that you are using RPi OS Lite 64-bit which is derived from Debian 11.

The main breakthrough was:@ETFbitcoin uname -a worked perfectly and let me know it was a 64-bit set-up.

So I don't know if it was a mistake or you wanted to say/express something else.I know, I know - in theory and also in practice; such as issues with only 4GB of RAM being detected, when 64-bit started to become mainstream and people continued installing 32-bit Windows... It's just that I remembered that ARM64 chips don't run 32-bit OS, since ARM64 is not a direct superset of ARM32. But it seems I was wrong about this.Regarding backwards compatibility: the way-to-go is installing 32-bit binaries on a 64-bit OS [on a 64-bit chip]; not installing a 32-bit OS on a 64-bit chip. There's not really a reason to install 32-bit Linux on a 64-bit chip.",
