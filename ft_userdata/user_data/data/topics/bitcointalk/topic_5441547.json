With the current difficulty on AVERAGE with 100 TH you should find a block in about 58 years as you said.But difficulty keeps going up so that Â number keeps going up.It is however luck based.

      "body": "The best attitude for solo mining is: don't expect to ever earn anything. Can you do it? If you can, then you should! (You have other means of income, etc).So its like playing lottery, and the higher your hashrate, the better your chances. Those 58 years are an average. If you look at the pools history of finding blocks, you will notice they may have bad luck or good luck, same here. What if it takes you twice that? what if it finds it in a year? You never know.Like i always say, chances are getting lower and lower (with diff increase), but its never zero.",

Would be similar odds to winning the lottery?Yeah, that sounds more like a lottery. You should also take into account the halvings, so for example in just a year you'll earn only 3.125BTC and in 4 years only 1.56BTC for finding a block so the longer you mine the smaller is the reward. And yes, there is a chance of not finding a block at all...",

I assume that you must be using R909 or Gekkoscience USB miners. If anything else, I 'd like it if you wanted to share your experience.If you use USB miners, then the miners write that they consume no more than 10-15 dollars per year and an increase in the bill per month by 1 dollar will not be very noticeable. But another problem for these miners is that not all pools support such devices with low hashrate and you are unlikely to catch a block solo. But you will have a great time setting up the equipment and with experience you will tell how you mined bitcoins.",

Something like a \"set it and forget it\" thing running at home. And if by any luck I hit a block, then I will never forget it in my life. I thought about running some Gekkoscience USBs that reach 400GH/s. Have you tried it?",
