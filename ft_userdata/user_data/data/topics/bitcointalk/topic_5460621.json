Since then, Nigerian police changed the narrative that it is banned in Nigeria and anyone involved in it is going against the law. They usually arrest the citizen in question and use it as a means for extortion. I don't know if it's everywhere but around south, it's a norm.",

What if the person lied and is investigated and noticed he is into cryptocurrencies?There has been police brutality even before CBN banned bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Your look and how you interact with police also matters. At least, I have never been arrested before.Some people too are actually making their money illegally online and using cryptocurrencies to mask it. Some people also uses other businesses to mask it.",

At least, I have never been arrested before.Some people too are actually making their money illegally online and using cryptocurrencies to mask it. Some people also uses other businesses to mask it.That’s where the main problem lies. People involve in illegal means of earning and cover it up with bitcoin when they’re asked what they’re into. For example, no any yahoo boy will tell you he’s one, what they usually say is that they’re bitcoin traders. When police found out that this is where they mask and cover their illegal means of earning with, they termed anyone into cryptocurrency as a Yahoo boy. After CBN shared that circular to banks not to trade cryptocurrencies, the police still use that as an advantage to clamp on those legally into crypto. They believe all crypto traders are wealthy, so they easily extort them when they find one. Although, your look and how you dress also matters when you’re caught and want to be investigated by them, it is also good to dress responsibly. I just hope and pray things get better soon for the people.",

Me and you know say before cryptocurrency start to exist,na so police dey behave. All the time them won give you wrong charge just to extort money from you. The bad ones go arrest you because them no say poor man no dey into crypto,and say you go fit bail yourself. Those police wey catch you no go fit carry you go court because them no say crypto no dey illegal but na money them want. Already we know how Nigeria police dey commit atrocities just go get money for the street.",

Before using trading has always been the way out of this harassment but this days dat one no go sell again because every yahoo buy claims to be a bitcoin vendor or trader but when further investigation is been carried out, they'll later discover that he was lying as they find things that implicates him as a fraudster. Things like clients information in regards to their maga wey dem dey scam so using a trader can bring more aggression towards you and might make them beat you up.The simplest thing to do na to tell them you be freelancer (or you work remotely online) to go further you fit tell them you're an online marketer because that's what most of us are that are enrolled in a signature campaign. This platforms dem wey they hire you make you advertise for them for the forum as you dey wear their ads so na marketing you dey do for them so you're an online marketer. Telling an authority officers that you write on a forum and get paid might sound like a lie and before you get the opportunity to explain further, slap fit dun land you for face and by that time to dey explain go just tire you. Use big worlds instead of trying to make them understand what you do, so them go give you the opportunity to explain.",
