      "body": "Not everyone can be successful. Success requires both luck and hard work. Binance CEO CZ has a lot of cryptocurrency knowledge and is very hardworking which is why he has achieved so much success. As a result of a lot of hard work and skill, he has now become one of the richest people in the world. The success of the one who was once thrown out of the house will create stubbornness in everyone's mind.OP the person you suggested to invest should express interest in investing himself. You should never force him to invest. Whenever you force him to invest, he will blame you for life if he invests and loses in the investment. Especially I do not advise anyone to invest by selling property. 5% to 10% of income should be invested every month/week to invest. Because the property is very valuable once you sell it, you will not get it back later. That's why I always recommend to invest part of the income in Bitcoin.",

I think the biggest lesson that anyone involved in investing should clarify from the beginning is that it is better to balance risk/return. I also witnessed many people failing to borrow money and defaulting, and then there were tragic situations where they committed suicide. Before, I had some questions about why not all of us are rich, but after the process, I realized that if we are patient, better results are waiting for us.It's understandable that we did everything right from the beginning, either no one would understand what we were doing, or they would actually understand bitcoin and crypto in the same way that we do. Because this is a common asset, you need to be responsible for how it will affect those around you.",

Aside from the fact that the house is his only property, his parents are also living there, where do you want them to move to?Everything is not about money, my friend, a good living goes a long way as well. It's not as if your friend is facing some financial challenges, at least you didn't include that in your explanation, so why the desperation?Mind you, for others to have sold their properties to buy Bitcoin and it worked for them doesn't guarantee it will work this time. What if it didn't work this time? What kind of friend would you be? This is why you should even give him breathing space so that everything will not bounce back on you. There is no certainty anywhere, we are just speculating and hoping that everything works well with our investment plans in cryptocurrency.Besides, the rule of investment urges us to \"invest the amount we can afford to lose.\" Selling his property is certainly not part of that. But if the guy must invest at all, he can still do it a little by saving towards it and get to invest his own meagre bit if he can't do much.",

Just because someone sells or mortgages their house to invest in Bitcoin or make any other investment has a high risk, and just because CZ did well doesn't mean by any stretch of the imagination that everyone else will do well. Even more so when I understand that, as happens to many people, they have all their net worth in their home, so if it goes wrong they are left with nothing. I am in favor of a slow approach to enrichment following basic rules of personal finance, but there are always those who do these crazy things, and most of them go wrong.",

Your words remind me of several motivational speakers who come up with good ending stories without considering that everyone is different. There are many stories of people who have sold valuables and lost all because of investment. So you have to take note that everybody will not be like CZ. QuoteShare your thoughts on this as to what you consider a wise counsel...Although Bitcoin could give higher returns on investment, real estate is also another good place to invest. It has fewer risks compared to Bitcoin and has greater security. If his house is his only means to invest in Bitcoin, then he shouldn't invest. This is because the house is meeting an important need not just for him but for his family. One of the golden rules of bitcoin investment is to invest what you can afford to lose and I don't think he can afford to lose the money he will get from selling his house. Let him focus on seeking alternative means of income that will enable him to save to invest in Bitcoin. Diversification is the spice of investment, hence he shouldn't sell the house.",

If his parents is not agreeing to him then he can't do anything about it, simply as that. Maybe if he has a job or something, then he can used that money to invest slowly just like what the majority of us here are doing. It's a slow and steady grind, but at least you have total control of everything.So I guess don't go extreme and to far to sell all his properties just saying. Just invest what he can afford to lose and then see how it goes for him. We still have less than a year to do that before the block halving, so it's not to late for him to go and put some money on Bitcoin.",

CZ acted based on his personal conviction and not because of advice from anyone, in this case he has no one to blame but himself should anything go wrong. For your case, you might have generations blaming you for misleading your friend should anything go wrong. As a matter of fact, he iight take risk and Bitcoin price increase giving him huge profits but if he loses his wallet or got hacked, you will receive the blame. So I am of the opinion you advice him to invest what he is comfortable with.",

This is a controversial example to use. CZ was already successful before Bitcoin.

It wasn't a case of a retail employee who sold the only property he owned to invest in Bitcoin, in a make or break financial move.From all publications about him CZ was never one who valued properties like houses and cars a lot, Wich could have made doing away with the house much easier, particularly it he had wealth locked away in other different digital assets.Quote from: wallet4bitcoin on November 26, 2023, 02:12:54 AMI suggested to him to pay deaf ears to what people will say if he wanted to invest in anything as it was his life and his money.
