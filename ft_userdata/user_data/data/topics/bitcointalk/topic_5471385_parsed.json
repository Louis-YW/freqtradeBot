But bounties need huge social media accounts, and many followers, signatures need rank, and faucets need huge fan following. I am not making excuses; I know earning money is not easy. By spending some time, I might be able to make money in 3 of the ways I mentioned but. It would be a great help if any of you guys, would share some good ways to earn online money in BTC or in any token, not necessary to be from this forum but from other online platforms is also appreciate able, where we have to do some tasks (not surveys, they don't work here). I know my question might be off-topic, or might not be liked by most members, but still, I thought to create it, because many members have a lot of information, that they can share. I am not being greedy or here for mainly money, simply asking community members to share their knowledge so we can help each other this topic will not only help me, but it will also help many. Please mention legit and those ways, that you have used for yourself and made a profit. I tested many surveys, but did not end up good for me, many affiliate platforms, but they also need huge visitors, which I don't have so I left it. I know if anyone has a secret tip, he might not want to share it, but a side hustle is always proven to be good. Just to point out, I am already doing a job, but as I said, a side hustle is always good. You can share methods to earn in any type whether it is in BTC or in ALTs, whether it is mining apps, but should be legit ones. I hope I am not being too off-topic and annoying.",

I know my question might be off-topic, or might not be liked by most members, but still, I thought to create it, because many members have a lot of information, that they can share. Since you really asked for one, then I can say you can just be a little patient and keep on posting quality things and helping comments that aid others' needs and questions. Then you might earn some merit as you are just a rank away from entering full member rank, and when you get the reward merit for the rank, you will rank up, and you can then join any active signature campaign that's available, and if the manager finds your application worthy among others, then you will be hired. This is the best and most reliable way I have seen to earn very easily. Earning by just being yourself and wearing a cloth and a face cap is all that's needed, and the pay seems to be stable based on the campaign that you are in. Don't just give up, and you will start earning from your signature, and you will then know what it feels like. And if you have any skill that you have aside from this forum that you can handle as a remote job, you can also create a service thread where someone can hire you for your skill and then pay you with BTC or whatever token you prefer.",

If you have tried, affiliate marketing or referral programs and you found out that you’re not the type can can produce up to a thousand sales or referrals to the site then the best way for you to earn, which you can use to generate passive income is “skill monetization”. As already mentioned by some other users, you should look for a skill that you’ll be passionate enough to learn and when you’ve done, then locate sites like fiverr or Upwork or any other freelancing site (you could as well try Bitcointalk) and try to get someone who’s in need of your skill and charge them for your services.If you should continue with completing tasks for faucets and survey sites you’ll only end up wasting time that could have been spent on more productive things.",

So when I was in your position, I always stayed tuned on Games and Rounds Board where I can earn BTC for free. There are several free raffles that you can do without a task, just enter your username and address. Or, if you are a collector, and want to earn free BTC inside the card, you can try to visit  Collectibles, there is a lot of free raffle which you can do with or without a task. And, on the  Micro Earnings board you can earn some satoshi and altcoin on other websites like freebitco, yannik biz, litecoinfaucet, and etc. So, the forum is complete, if you are patient and persistent in doing it daily, I am sure you are enjoyable being here.",

Coming here to make money is not greed or something bad, but the truth is that if you put money in front of you in the short time you spend here, then it may be hard for you to make the money you said you were here for. My reason is that putting money in front will not make you learn what is necessary for you to know before you start earning, and you cannot earn on this forum without the knowledge of cryptocurrency and other things that are needed when you start participating in signature campaigns or bounties because the knowledge you acquire will guide you to write meaningful and helpful content that will help the forum members.However, I can see that you almost get to the rank that you will start participating in the signature campaign, which means you will soon start earning in crypto currency as you wanted, so I'll advise you to put in more effort, obey the forum rules, don't spam while you start the signature, just to increase the post-account focus, and you will achieve your goal of being here.",

This forum also builds good communication and understanding regarding digital currencies and their always updated developments.
