      "body": "Kucoin actually doesn't support USA which is why you won't be able to verify your account. People from unsupported countries are just taking advantage of the no-mandatory KYC policy. For leverage, last time i check they have a maximum of x5 for unverified accounts.If you go to r/kucoin and search for similar situations, you'll find mix responses. Some have smooth experience and some have been asked to KYC...  What I'm trying to say is, you should be cautious with them because technically they aren't allowed to operate in the USA.",

      "body": "There are some exchanges that do not provide service for US citizens, this is not because of the exchange but because of US government that do not allow that. US have exchanges of their own, I will do not know if Kucoin support US. Even if Kucoin support US and providing services to US citizens that register with them, I am still certain that they will not be able to use Kucoin future trading.But this is what I saw online:Quote from: https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/kucoin-review/The United States has strict regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges, and KuCoin is not licensed to operate in the states. Quote from: https://www.investopedia.com/kucoin-review-5214172KuCoin is not licensed in the United States, but Coinbase is licensed in the U.S.; KuCoin offers 600+ cryptocurrencies.I will advice you to use the exchanges available in US and know that those exchanges may not support future trading.Quote from: mk4 on July 19, 2022, 04:12:09 AMI'm afraid your only option is to use a VPN and hope that your account doesn't get locked.

The US financial authority, Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) doesn't want any service to offer future trading to it's citizens or else they will be drugged to court. That's why most of the exchanges backed offI have never used FTX.us, but you have  a very small chance, and limited choice. Try this - https://derivs.ftx.us",
