A lot of persons much have heard about Bitcoin from someone or somewhere online and since Bitcoin has Being a life changer for so many early investors, alot of these people have spread the word through what they have been able to accomplish over the years. I'm most countries some have heard but don't actually know what it can do or even how to use it. The rate of adoption is still growing though so I believe that with time, they will get to know more about Bitcoin and consider investing on it.",

Now that you know of how widespread the renown that bitcoin has, I think that should tell you something about how good of an investment and currency bitcoin is, it's something that you should talk about your friends with, this is an opportunity of a lifetime and people will tell you that it's too pricey right now but in the near future, you will not be saying that because bitcoin is a long-term investment and a present full of doubts is going to be filled with a future of regrets that you didn't invest right now.Remember to learn how to DCA with your investments though, it's always smart to invest but even smarter when you time and manage how you invest, DCA is pretty easy, at it's most basic, it's buy low, sell high but there's some carefulness and timing surrounding it.",

It seems crypto awareness has increased this year in every corner of my locality people are either discussing crypto or tapping their phones to get some airdrop. However many of them don't have solid knowledge about Bitcoin because most of them see the sector as a get-rich-quick scheme. If you ask them simple questions about the industry, they don't know the answers. Most of these people in rural areas are cheap prey to scam projects.",

But I think the truth is that it is not too common in most places, maybe it is mentioned in the place you are talking about but it is only a rare story and there is no need to talk too much about its popularity. But I admit that the acceptance of bitcoin is growing, but similar to many other things in life, there are different barriers to access, such as simply having the internet to use problems that cannot satisfy all needs.",

You could be surprised to know that someone in a remote African villages knows quite much about the US presidential election way more than the actual citizens and this is what the information age we're in has helped us to attain.Anyone that has a mobile device and knows about financial system should have in one way or the other known about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. The issue is that although Bitcoin has spread around the world, it hasn't gotten to a stage where you can easily transact with it in local market for so many factors. Business people don't HODL there money but rather prefer it to be in liquid and flexible form such that they can use it for business purpose whenever they want to. For daily business transaction, fiat does better job compaired to Bitcoin so although it has gotten to all the part of the world, it's not yet gotten to the position where it can become a legal tender that's usable for most business activities.",

Anyone who enjoys investing in bitcoin will want to tell others about his profits, and he will want to encourage others to invest and benefit from it as well. So I am not shocked that Bitcoin has spread over the world. Many people have heard about bitcoin, but some do not understand how it works and some do not have enough money to invest in it, This is why you may believe that people do not know about bitcoin since they do not have enough money to begin investing. Bitcoin will eventually be ubiquitous and everyone will want to receive and invest and be profitable. I'm seeing bitcoin prices dropping these days, so it's a good idea to invest now and leave it for the long term because some investors invest when the price is falling and buy for the long run.",

If this people had not made the effort, maybe you would have been the only person in that village with the knowledge of bitcoins. We all have to keep making efforts to try make sure people get the right information about what bitcoin is because as much as you will like to think that bitcoin has spread all over the world, it has not, and there is still much to be done because there are still places in the world where people have never heard about bitcoins.",

Good old cash is still #1 for most, especially out in the sticks.   That said, prolly smart to keep the crypto conversations on the down low.  Some folks might wanna take advantage if they know you got skin in that game.  Not everyone's intentions are pure, so trust your gut if something seems off.",

With the level of enthusiasm Nigerians have shown for cryptocurrencies, it is not surprising that Bitcoin has reached even  the rural areas. I find it interesting that the farmers were open to accepting bitcoin as payment for their crops. To my knowledge, most of the farmers in the rural areas practice subsistence farming which makes me wonder if they make enough money from the business to invest in Bitcoin.",

But all the spread that you see is still limited if we take into account that only two countries in the world recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender (El Salvador and Central Africa) and that the major financial institutions do not officially support it. It is true that many exchanges that list Bitcoin and crypto have official activity licenses in many countries, but their services are still limited for traders and those looking for investment opportunities.Recently, Binance exchange announced that it has more than 200 million users, which is considered a huge number of people registered on one exchange, but it remains a small number compared to the total number of the world’s population, although it indicates a significant increase in the number of crypto users globally.",

Because that's what I read though that Africans have been using Bitcoin a lot, although there could be governments around that continent that might resists Bitcoin.So far the only country that makes Bitcoin legal tender is El Salvador under their President Bukele. But regardless, yeah, we don't have the numbers, but it seems that every year, there could be some growth rate as far as adoption goes and there are small nations that are either friendly or in the grey area as far as adoption goes. So still a win-win situation for us and maybe in the next 10 years we will see businesses, and institutions begin to use Bitcoin as a form of currency and or investment, or uses it's blockchain technology. Although there will be a lot of challenges, like regulatory and legal framework, but the future looks bright.",
