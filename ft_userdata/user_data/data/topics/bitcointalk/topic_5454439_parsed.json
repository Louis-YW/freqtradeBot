We've seen tokens before which had more than a 1000% increase upon its release and one is indeed PEPE coin. However, it does not mean or even guarantee that all meme tokens would have the same result upon its release in the market. Another thing to consider is how well it would sustain its market value 'coz SHIB, DOGE, FLOKI, and PEPE did not manage to do so. These are the popular meme tokens in this industry and this should be a warning to those who have high hopes. Know what you are engaging yourself with. The only thing which controls the market price of meme tokrns are popularity and demand, therefore changes on these factors would reflect to the market price which makes its value highly volatile.",

That's why the risk is also quite high because it's a meme coin. Then its value has dropped a bit so far on Binance, and probably many people bought it now, because they think it can make them rich when the bull run comes.",

Try for example about the current hype PEPE.You would see in both ETH and BSC networks or even others which does have tons of Pepe-named attached coins which are trying out to lure investors because of the hype and this one is no different.",

Maybe in a quick flip situation it's profitable since there's always a temporary hype where you could use for profiting. So far these meme coins are just surviving due to famous people acknowledging these kinds of coins for people to invest like Elon Musk.",

Tax is usually playing around 10% on sell and buys.To make it look appealing and interesting then they do having that renounced contracts but in overall if you find that the token had already increased its price 2x or 3x then it is somethingthat would really be hard to get in unless if you could gamble then you could still get in but dont get surprised that on the time that you had bought then it wouldreally be some dump afterwards and never made out some recovery and this is something a very common cycle with memes.",

Many of these projects don't last long after they were initially hyped by some special investors because they were hired to draw in money so they could profit quickly. As a result, in a short period of time, those unique investors will simply sell their tokens for a profit, then abandon the project and it becomes die project.",
