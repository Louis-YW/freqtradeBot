  "content": "Hello everyone. I have some experience with various hardware wallets and I admit that I am more than happy with the ones I have tried, especially with the coldcard.However, even though I have watched multiple videos concerning paper wallets and why people shouldn't trust them nowadays, I feel like they are safer alternatives and I want to discuss it here.So, how can a hardware wallet be a better option than a paper wallet?I know, that a simple piece of paper can be damaged or lost, but, apart from that, how can it be hacked ? It seems too safe to me and I reckon that the only thing I need to do is to protect this small piece of paper from thieves or from physical damage.I have implemented a key-pair generator myself and I run it on a computer that has never touched the internet. Thus, I get a private and a public key and then I print it on a piece of paper.Alternatively, I could save the keys on 2-3 usb sticks and then protect the usb sticks, in order to avoid every point of paper failure (i.e ink stains, water etc). Isn't that extremely safe ? Am I missing something here ?On the other hand, when you set up a digital device, even though the keys don't \"touch\" the internet, don't you actually trust the manufacturer and the code that they provide? And, simultaneously, you must maintain a piece of paper (or metal plate) where the seed phrase is written, so, technically it's the same thing.thanks",

Otherwise, I would consider it the exact same thing as a hardware wallet.

I only use open source wallets, but I have the ability to do so because I am a software engineer. Well the only thing I want to do is to create a wallet for my children (not yet born haha). I plan to send BTC every month and never withdraw. Essentially that's what I do for myself too, using a hardware wallet. But I thought, why not trying paper wallets for my kids? it still seems safer to me.",

You could be sealing in some crap, or find out 10 years later that the lamination has turned yellow / brown and you can't read the words though it and can't un-laminate it without risking damaging the wallet.A good 'indestructible' paper is probably better to print on: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5296179.0As with everything YMMV some people like the seedplates others like other methods. -Dave",

The process of using a seed phrase to generate key pairs is a one way process via various hash functions. You cannot start with a private key and derive a seed phrase which produces that private key, unless you are doing something very non-standard which I absolutely would not recommend.I would say the main benefits of a hardware wallet over a paper wallet is that they are much easier to set up and configure for the average person, and they are also much easier to spend from in the future. Paper wallets are a poor choice for the majority of crypto users, as they do not have the ability to set them up in a safe and secure fashion without doing something wrong, relying on third party software, leaking information online, etc., and will also tend to import them in to a hot wallet when they want to spend from them. Paper wallets can be very safe, but only if you really know what you are doing with them. You should be using a permanently airgapped device (i.e. not just one which is temporarily offline) to create them, and they should only ever be imported back on to this permanently airgapped device to sign airgapped transaction when you want to spend from them.

Paper wallets are more like login/password for your banking application; you can use them to access your deposit account, but they themselves don't provide you an option to withdraw funds.

That's the main drawback of paper wallets: with them, you need to always rely on external (and probably insecure) software to sign and broadcast your transactions.

Can you give me specific mentions?You can use any old computer as an airgapped device to either run a digital cold wallet, or to securely generate paper wallets. An old desktop or laptop works well. I always suggest opening up the device in question and physically removing any connectivity hardware, such as ethernet cards, WiFi cards, Bluetooth chips, etc. That way you can be certain you will never accidentally connect to a network and risk your data or your coins. Once you've done that, you should format the device and install a good open source Linux distro of your choosing.Once you have a permanently airgapped device, then you can install software such as Bitcoin Core or Electrum to generate and run an airgapped wallet. You would create a complementary watch only wallet which contains only your public keys or addresses on your internet connected computer in order to watch your addresses for incoming transactions and so on. You can then use this watch only wallet to create unsigned transactions, move the unsigned transaction to your airgapped device via either QR codes or a USB drive to be signed, and then move the signed transactions back again to be broadcast to the network.Alternatively, you can use your airgapped device to generate paper wallets. For paper wallets, I much prefer using a seed phrase to generate an entire wallet rather than a single key pair for a variety of reasons. It means I can have multiple addresses rather than just one, which is better for privacy. I can create my paper wallet by writing down a seed phrase accurately by hand. Writing down a key pair is prone to errors, and printing a key pair adds additional risk in that the printer may be WiFi capable or have internal storage and so on. Importing a seed phrase also avoids the risk of importing a private key to some software which will send your change to an address you do not have saved anywhere and will therefore be lost.
