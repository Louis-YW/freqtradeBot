Since the government is yet to fully support it this clubs will definitely be breaking rules by publicly advertising or advocating it. But an advertisement on a live match won't be a bad idea, and I don't think it will be breaking any rules anyways, as there are already a few crypto-supported platforms that run ads on public space like that without undergoing some kind of sanction.",

      "body": "Little intro to my context: It is a decentralized platform, it is a means of payment with very particular characteristics that make the individual have individual financial empowerment like never before, for anyone.We can expand more on its qualities, premises and technical characteristics, but with the above it is enough to achieve adoption, I ask you, do we need more?Now, any additional boost, as is currently the case with many brands or related companies: Exchange, restaurants, casinos and a large etc., is only an added boost for each of those brands, that is, the phrase; \"use bitcoin,\" or \"bitcoin accepted here,\" it is an additional hook for your services or product.If bitcoin is promotion in a campaign like \"bitcoin\" without having an added service, it is a financial revolutionary movement, that has the added that any government tries to stop or prohibit that type of marketing idea, that is what makes it prohibitive in Many countries, they do not want empowerment.The only one who has done that and has been able is called Bukele, he has used bitcoin in its essence as a financial premise for individuals and as a means of payment, hence, for now to any other country where bitcoin is allowed, for any type of advertising a product, it must have an associated service.Anyway!. The adoption of bitcoin is a peaceful, idealistic movement, perhaps in the relevance of other historical movements that have arisen from individuals and that is where \"you\" as an individual develop it and sometimes depending on it you just have to be part of the process, buy, sell, hodl, trade and if you have more financial potential create ventures, e.g. such as goods and services businesses, then \"You\" add ads: use bitcoin here or bitcoin accepted here.",

I think this will send a strong message to billions of people across the world who do know but does not embrace Bitcoin usage.  In many years, Bitcoin increases its adoption without advertisement at stadiums and I only see Sportsbet.io is a first, likely, cryptocurrency gambling site that advertises their gambling platforms on skirts of some clubs like Wolverhampton and others as well as in stadium and press conference.Altcoin has Terra as a famous advertisement but that project is a scam Ponzi and collapsed in 2022.Without advertisement at stadiums, you see Bitcoin already achieved very good adoption growth. I am positive about Bitcoin adoption even without advertisement at stadiums.Your hope is unrealistic because Bitcoin whales self-respect their privacy and not all of them publicly reveal that they are Bitcoin whales. So requiring them to publicly sponsor for Bitcoin advertisement is unrealistic.",

Do you think some of these have not been done?Like I recall when some of the musicians wanted there shows paid for using bitcoin. I could recall snoop dog at a time. I had rumors of 50cent and even some basketball stars sorting out the option, at least a part of their earnings be paid in bitcoin. Surely it did trend for a while but then, away it went (@ the trend).No doubt it pooled in some investors but still, we are where we are now.Hence, even having bitcoin sampled on a billboard won’t change much. It’s already being done by the many casinos with football clubs sponsorship deals. The word out is how they use bitcoin in placing bets on their platform. Watford FC had it on their Jersey at a time but still, we are where we are.There isn’t going to be any swift pace and nothing would promote bitcoin more than the bullrun so, just seat back and watch the times unfold.",

I dont think so, I dont think this is going to make a huge impact, there are only a limited amount of people that are going to get influenced but this kind of promotion but I guess it is better than not promoting at all, I know that there are some of this that already happened in the past. But it just doesnt really make a huge impact Bitcoin I guess cryptocurrency wasn't really that popular at that time.But still, if we are going to compare the users in the past year to the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin users/investors right now there was obviously a huge difference in it, and cryptocurrency this day, in my opinion, was just huge compared to the past years where there where barely a few people that know cryptocurrency, because at this time cryptocurrency and Bitcoin are already promoted by a lot of companies and even banks where you could already buy and sell or invest cryptocurrency in banks platform which I think a really big help because a lot of users have its opportunity to invest in cryptocurrency.",

Yes if every person uses Bitcoin massively the world will gain and rise as you expected. but, we have to not forget, that every country has rules that make Bitcoin forbidden to use, so that situation people who have Bitcoin in their wallet would find it and difficult to use it. They don't know how to invest his money into bitcoin because that country who have sponsor football league has banned bitcoin.

Companies, which are the most interested in doing that, are more likely to want to advertise a shitcoin than bitcoin itself, or their own company, as happened with the FTX Arena.

Crypto.com is a big sponsor of sports events and I've seen their logo being placed on some football stadiums. Does this lead to mass crypto adoption? Nope...Be honest here. You want crypto adoption mostly because you want the prices to hit the moon. You don't care about the poor bastards, who put their coins in centralized crypto scams and lose everything. True crypto adoption will come, when the newcomers stay away from big crypto companies and keep their coins in their own cold wallets.",

Of course we all wish more people would invest in Bitcoin and use Bitcoin. Currently many people know about Bitcoin but are not accepting to invest in it,and the main reason is that there is no specific group or company to systematically sponsor it. I appreciate your suggestion, that if Bitcoin is promoted by a football club, it can also help promote Bitcoin a lot, and many people may be inclined to invest in Bitcoin. Bitcoin itself is not a company, but the big whales together can make this campaign work very well. If a football club is sponsored it can give a great message to the people and even people who don't know about Bitcoin at all will be interested in investing in Bitcoin. There are many ways to promote Bitcoin if put in the effort. A major online store mechanism to allow players to pay in bitcoin or transact in bitcoin will help promote bitcoin in all these ways and thus people will start getting interested in it with more certainty. I think, Governments' patronage will be necessary to implement all these proposals, as there are many countries where cryptocurrencies are banned.",
