In that case, I'd look into using bitcoind's RPC.",

I have to do that manually.ThanksSorry for this noob question which is also a bit out of what is being discussed, but i want to get something straight.I know kraken is a centralized exchange and run custodial wallets, and if i am not wrong, the use of custodial wallets for any type of transactions except trading are always discouraged on this forum.my question is simple, concerning what the op is asking about, are there no non-custodial wallets available with a feature which permits sending and receiving Bitcoins via API ?Personally, ive not come across a non-custodial wallet with such a feature, or maybe i didnt pay enough attention to the features of the non-custodial wallets ive used in the past.Answers, confirmation or correction is appreciated.",
