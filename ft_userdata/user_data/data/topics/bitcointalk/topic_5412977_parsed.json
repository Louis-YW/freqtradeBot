Yes they even knew that the token is prone to scam and aware of possible rug pull. But their not halfwits. They just risking higher than typical people. Cant really advise newbies or anyone to invest on such hype coins or tokens but this kind of situation are being ride by some CTs whom are not afraid of losing but instead brave enough to earn a lot of multiplier knowing the consequence.I remember my degen plays before that even earn 20x to 50x knowing its a scam but of course I knew the risk. Its just a shamed to take advantage of such an event where a popular person died.",

As previously stated, we should be cautious about the projects we invest in at this time because scammers are becoming more well-known, so any new information they learn will be used to perpetrate fraud, particularly with regard to NFTS, which the writer claimed to be the case.

I sincerely hope no newbie here is that dumb not to be able to discern that this is another activity of scammers.Maybe the scammers after hearing this news immediately made tokens and traded them on the DEX they continued to trap many people with the theme (Queen) like this and I read the article that this meme coin increase has increased by several percent due to their much interest in the newly created token a day that's why I guess the scammers seem to keep preying on the falling victims in their tokens.It's ironic that there is such a thing but there are still many who get stuck and buy it.",

      "body": "Unfortunately, the cryptocurrency space is still new and unregulated, giving scammers plenty of ways to dupe unsuspecting victims. It's sad that scammers are taking advantage of the Queen's passing by introducing tokens featuring her name. The truth is that using the name of anyone or anything for promotional purposes in the cryptocurrency space will eventually be identified by a vigilant community, and in most cases be condemned. Especially when it is about a deceased person. As the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow, so too will the number of scams that come with it. The best way to combat this problem is by banding together as a community and being vocal about these fraudulent schemes whenever they arise. If you see someone promoting tokens that seem fishy or are taking advantage of recent world events, please speak up, because as long as we continue to remain silent, then scammers will continue to get away with their crimes. The cryptocurrency and blockchain community is one of the most innovative, hard-working groups of people in the world, and we should not allow ourselves to be taken advantage of by criminals who are only interested in making a quick buck. The more we speak up, the less likely they are to succeed.",

This shitcoins works like a ponzi and risk taker investors knew it but still they are doing a high risk high reward scheme. Only few innocent newbie fall victim on this because it’s very hard to find this kind of tokens if you are not familiarize on where to find it.
