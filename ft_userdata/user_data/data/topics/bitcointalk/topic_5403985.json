  "content": "There is a Latin word \"Tempus Fugit\" which simply means \"Time Flies\", because I could remember when I registered an account on the forum and luckily today (24 June 2022) celebrating my rank of a Full Member. It's really amazing and I'm grateful.All these wouldn't have been possible if not for your undiluted supports, love and words of encouragement for me, and I really appreciate. You guys are the best and I'm happy to be among you guys on the forum full time now.MY FORUM JOURNEY AND LESSONSWhile searching the internet one fateful day in June 2021, I got to know about this forum as a site you learn and discuss about Bitcoin, but never did I had an idea how or where to start from, as the home page was too cumbasome to comprehend, and I finally got to register on 20th June 2021. It took me time to understand the forum, as I tried, tried and gave up in my first 3 months. But thanks to God I didn't quit and today, celebrating my new rank. I know it's wasn't easy, it was tough, it was hard, but despite it all I kept pushing forward, and I know there is someone out there who is also facing the same struggle like I did, and am here for you. Because i ones took a break off the forum when I was feeling confused and exhausted to learn how the forum works and came back. So it's not a crime to take a break if you are feeling exhausted, as long as you won't quit, because I never did, and that's why am celebrating today.MY ADVICE TO NEWBIES AND OTHERSAs a result of my few months of activeness on the forum, I have learnt to understand that it's good to take a break sometimes, as long as you don't plan quitting. Because frankly speaking, it's actually not easy here, it's not easy coming up with a good thread, it's not easy helping others understand a particular concept and it's not easy maintaining & promoting a conducive atmosphere on the forum, and that's why I always respect all ranks irrespective of category, because we have got people here who offer for free what others pay $100 to $1000 to learn from an online course, and that's why I appreciate them allSPECIAL APPRECIATIONI wish to appreciate the following persons Slow death, ETFbitcoin, CryptopreneurBrainboss, Halab, Davidvictorson, Kingsden, Rruchi man, JayJuanGee, pooya87, Pmalek,  Cryptocurrencyking, lovesmayfamilis, DdmrDdmr, SatoPrincess, Lucius, seoincorporation, famososMuertos, uneng, so98nn, igehhh  and more others whose name not mention above, because I am really grateful for your support and encouragement you gave to me here on this forum. You guys are actually the best.MY THREADS SO FAR ON THE FORUMI have got only 18 threads posted so far since I started the forum till this moment of my new rank as a Full Member on 23rd June 2022.

Congratulations!However, I have to tell you that there is a special thread dedicated to this in the Reputation section:Announce your rank up, merit or any achievements that makes you feel great!I suggest you lock this one and post there, as some people might see this thread as a covert way of trying to get merit, and although it sometimes succeeds, I don't think it's the right thing to do. I think it's better that all such celebrations are concentrated in that thread.",
