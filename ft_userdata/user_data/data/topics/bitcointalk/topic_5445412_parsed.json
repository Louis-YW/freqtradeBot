This makes it a lopsided comparison to make.That aside, there has been improvements over the years to scalability, with both off chain and on chain solutions, and there would be more in the coming years, while maintaining decentralization.",

This approach can significantly increase the TPS rate while maintaining a high level of decentralization.another approach would be the use of Side Chains,   these are separate blockchains that are pegged to the main Bitcoin blockchain and allow for the processing of transactions in parallel. Sidechains can be used for specific use cases, such as smart contracts or asset tokenization, and can help to reduce the load on the main Bitcoin blockchain while maintaining decentralization.",

With VISA, it can be up to 120 days which would be a period I can sleep well.If you paid with a Visa debit, credit or pre-paid card, a chargeback is an option. If you need to make a chargeback claim, make sure you do it within 120 days of purchase.With Bitcoin, 3 confirmations are good to go and if it is a transaction with big amount, 6 confirmations are enough for me to be safe. 6 confirmations equal to about 1 hour that is much shorter than 120 days.Choosing between two options, sleep well after 1 hour and can not sleep well within 120 days. Make your choice!How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?",

Like, one says we have low transactions, one says we can use a lightning network while some debate about the liquidity issues in a lightning network. I don't know but this definitely makes me think, bitcoin has not been developed properly nor has the issue been resolved fully. The VISA, definitely we cant compare them with the bitcoin because let us face it, we are missing that piece of code that will make the original bitcoin faster or at least comparable to it. Let us face it, VISA is good thought their settlement is said to be real-time, the money transferred is netted after hours of time on the server but it works just fine!",

EG online gaming. livestreaming, torrentsi do laugh how you want blocks to have 1tx of 4mb but dont want 4mb of 8000txusers dont have the choice because the only main dev of protocol level coding is core. thus everyone is WAITING and begging for CORE to allow more transaction count, becasue any other brand trying to do it will get REKT. and core as you know have a roadmap of wanting to push people off the network into other networks(you favour) as their plan.. and as you keep saying for the last 6 years \"be patient\" yet all of these topics over the years made by thousands of people wanting transaction scaling on bitcoin shows its not just a minority asking for more tx count onchainstop pretending its user decision or user fault for no upgrades.. core have become the only party offering ability to upgrade and yet they are not offering the upgrades the people want and only offering upgrades corporations want(gateway formats to lock people into other networks for middlemen rewarding of facilitating payments)",
