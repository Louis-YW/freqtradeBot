  "content": "Hmm, I love to read and trying figuring out new things. JayJuanGee never depressed me with his wall of text on Wall observer of BTC/USD. Today I noticed a few interesting things about the Bitcointalk forum. Most of you guys maybe know about this. But I just discovered those things today.Why are the bots on The Most Time Online?I noticed my time logged in is about 3 days and 8 hours so far. I visited the stats section today to see if these stats also belong there. If so, let's who is the top guy. I saw 10 most-time online accounts and I realized all of them are bots. They never posted on the Bitcointalk forum. The Interesting fact, 9 of them were registered in August 2018 (from august 14 to august 17) and mitmivan was registered on July 24, 2018. Their Online time is huge, Over 22529 days for the 10th one. Which means almost 62 Years Â . Oh man, Theymos joking with us. I am not sure why those dummy accounts belong there. If we can see some real accounts, that would be more interesting.No Important Announcement for the last four years.I was trying to figure out what is the difference between this image  and this image I noticed the lighter Darker one has new posts and the other one doesn't. I saw the last topic created on Important Announcements about four years ago. Only VIPs, global moderators, and administrators can post there, and they didn't create a single thread in the last four years. The board icon remained the same for the last four years. I guess there is really nothing to announce, right? Mods and Admins, Think about it if really you don't want to share anything. Otherwise, the Museum authority will contact you soon to archive it Â .",

      "body": "The forum statistics were disabled a long time ago, hence the reason page views, and posts sort of stops around 2017. I think its safe to say that looking at those time online stats, it's very broken. Some stats appear to be still tracking, but others aren't. Think it goes without saying, take those statistics with a pinch of salt. I do believe they were disabled due to a ongoing DDOS attack at the time, and the resources required outweighed the benefits. At least, that's what I recall from memory.",

Most time online list, is it a bug?I made an attempt at trying to unveil how SMF counts online time, but there may be more tricks that boost the values, likely using multiple devices/sessions.Going briefly over the above listed threads, the ruling hypothesis was that those accounts are bot accounts that do not need to post, but rather likely scrape the available data on the forum, possibly from multiple devices/sessions.

For example, theymos used to post about vulnerabilities about Electrum, and other Bitcoin software a few years ago. However, I do believe he now uses the \"news\" header for these sort of announcements, and links to a discussion thread about it, rather than posting it themselves. So, I don't think it's a lack of important announcements, but rather being handled a bit differently through the news header, as there's definitely been important announcements conveyed through that feature in more recent times.",

Except OP is prompting theymos to embark on something drastic once again.Yeah, those kind of announcements are made in the Meta section, since they're forum related. The important announcement section that OP refereed is located in the Bitcoin Discussion section, which generally means its more Bitcoin related stuff to go in there, rather than forum announcements. According to the guidelines theymos posted, albeit potentially outdated, that would echo that sentiment. I can't really answer why that section isn't used much any more though. I guess over time users here have come accustomed to each section more, and announce these types of stuff like compromises etc in the relative section. Probably, also due to the forum now being a bit more organised than it originally was. For example, Electrum vulnerabilities tend to get posted in the Electrum section. I guess it would be useful for someone to quote the text, with sources in the important announcements section, to help condense the information a bit more.",

Not sure about the idea of making it flashing though, I imagine that'll have a lot of backlash. Plus, there's what you consider critical enough to have it basically distract users. It would probably have to be pretty critical, and at that point users probably already know of it. Although, I get most of my news from Bitcointalk, so I suppose others would be the same. I literally don't ever visit any Bitcoin news sites, and only occasionally check real news.
