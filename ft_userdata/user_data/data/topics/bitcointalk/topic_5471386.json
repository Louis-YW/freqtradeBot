Are they anonymous or is that a bug? It looks a bit weird when you have a list of named users and then a blank one with some random profile picture.Why not make an ANN thread on the Service discussion board if you want to attract new users or looking for feedback? Not many people visit this board afaik, so you'll get less exposure here.",

By LN, I mean the Lightning Network, as I'm sure you know. magicmicks, or @metamick14 (also my Twitter profile).Geyser is a bitcoin crowdfunding platform for creators who want to monetize for their projects ideas. We make it super easy for creators to get started and for contributors to fundraise their projects. So far we have helped creators raise over 26 BTC in just over a year, have over 900 projects on our platform, and route around 1-2BTC every month. In short, we are powering the bitcoin creator economy. We are seeing 3 main areas of activity: Educators, Creatives/Culture, Communities. Educators are doing great work in spreading bitcoin adoption in different ways from teaching courses to orange-pilling, Culture/creatives write books, make movies, sell art and make music around bitcoin, and Communities make meetups and events happen.Â  On top of running the platform for creator crowdfunding, we run Geyser Grants, where we do bitcoin givaways to projects that are doing valuable initiatives in fostering Bitcoin Education, Culture, Community: https://geyser.fund/grants. It's only thanks to anonymous Bitcoiners that we can make the Geyser Grants happen, and so far we have raised over 3BTC in Grants. Would love to know if any of you would be interested in supporting our Grants, and to foster what area of Bitcoin.Happy to answer any questions!",

What is the mechanism for selecting projects and the project license required? Will it be open source and available for commercial activities, or will the final project be closed source?Include more details, such as financing conditions, payment deadline, will partnerships be established and shares distributed or will they be tokens, and will project managers receive Bitcoin?Add a link with more F.A.Q will be better.",

You need to be careful with the content, you need some kind of moderation, because to have a picture of a burned child on the site isn't nice, some sensitive people will close the page after see that pic, and I'm talking about the \"Save Gaza and donate for children\" project. What i like about your project is how it breaks all frontiers, doesn't matter where we are, the contributors and projects are global, so, a big +1 for that.",
