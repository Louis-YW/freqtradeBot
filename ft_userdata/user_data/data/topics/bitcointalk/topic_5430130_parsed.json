Good hardware wallets keep your private keys offline, but many of them still require connection to an internet connected device in order to operate, meaning they are not a cold wallet in the true sense of the word. A true cold wallet is usually though of as an airgapped device which is never connected to the internet. It generates and store the private keys offline, signs transactions offline, and then only the signed transactions ever touch an internet connected device to be broadcast.A true cold wallet in this sense is safer than a hardware wallet if it is set up and used correctly, but this is often too difficult for the average person to do.

Electrum is a software wallet. Whether it behaves as a hot or a cold wallet depends on how you use it. If it is simply installed on a computer which you use every day and is regularly or always connected to the internet, then it is a hot wallet. Your wallet files and all your private keys are continually exposed to the internet, and such a wallet should only be used for relatively small sums of money. If, on the other hand, you install it on a permanently airgapped computer which never connects to the internet, and use a complementary watch only wallet in order to create and broadcast transactions, only then is it a cold wallet. Doing so keeps your wallet files and all your private keys permanently offline and never exposed to the internet, making it much more secure, but also harder to set up and work with than a hot wallet.",

I don't even know this before, I thought cold wallets are separate and centralised where the platform or the centralised entity keeps the key for you, so that means that all those centralized platforms offering people cold wallet are red flags? I see paper wallet more like a backup of a cold wallet. Because, you know, paper wallet is just a private key (or seed!) and an address you should store on paper, or steel, or whatever (and you may need cold wallet to safely spend it).Cold storage is, for example, an Electrum that always stays offline. Usually you have on your computer (connected to the internet!) another Electrum too, with a watch-only wallet based on the same seed as the cold storage. This second Electrum will see the transactions, but cannot sign them for spending. And you'll use the cold storage only to sign transactions. Viewing the money flow, creating (unsigned) transactions, broadcasting the transactions after they were signed - these will be done with the watch-only wallet.The transfer of transactions (from watch only) to cold wallet for signing is best done via images or QR codes, but it can be done (in a bit less safe way) via USB stick. This depends on the wallet software capabilities though.The (larger) centralized platforms most probably use cold storage too, in a way or another, for safe keeping the bulk of user funds. But they do that for their own safety (hacks cannot touch the cold storage), not for users' sake. The user deposits/withdrawals happen with hot wallet (online wallet). Sometimes, the platform will transfer funds between the cold and hot storage, depending whether there are many deposits or many withdrawals. The use of cold storage don't make the exchanges significantly safer (they can still get bankrupt) and the fact an exchange uses cold storage for their own use doesn't make the cold storage evil. Cold storage is just a tool. Best is to learn and use the same tool for yourself since it's good, no matter who others are using it.",

You instead hide them under the mattress and hope hackers don't come with a wrench. Hardware wallets are a lot better in this regard: they combine the safety of cold wallets (private keys are isolated) and the convenience of software (hot) wallets (very handy in day-to-day transactions). If you aren't sure, go for hardware wallets.QuoteAlso Binance CEO said Cold wallets are not really safe like people think.Binance CEO is partially right: cold wallets are seen as the most effective way to protect your cryptocurrency holdings from unauthorized access, but there are many altcoins that exist that allow such access regardless of how far your crypto is from the online environment. For example, stablecoins can be frozen and stolen even from those wallets that never touched the Internet, all that may happen because the level of their decentralization is rather very low.",

In that scenario, a good hardware wallet becomes the best choice for that person.Indeed it's safe but as we know most people are not aware about security to that level where they use airgapped devices to keep their funds safely so hardware wallets are really good option for them if they keep the seed phrases safe and physical custody with them.The people need to realise the safety of their funds as they always click on the links they see over internet and have funds or say wallets on the same device which even poses more risk to their funds.So cold storage is safe as your keys never leave your device but hardware wallets treated in similar manner will also work fine for them instead of using these CEX which have 100% risk so they need to realise this ASAP.Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on December 19, 2022, 09:39:08 AMCZ is not your friend.

He is giving these advices to make you fool so you keep funds with him and they have access to your funds.They put restrictions on your withdrawal,sell your information to governments and much more with zero privacy so still beleive in what he says? Which business person will tell you that go and buy something from other shop as he will say the next one products are not good so he is making same marketing techniques to attract more people to Binance.The warning on forum from @theymos also indicates not your keys not your coins and if you can't get handle your funds with your custody then what purpose is to invest in decentralised coin like bitcoin?
