      "body": "I remember when I was first introduced to Platin coin, it was valued at $4.11 and I was told to buy a digital miner within the platinum coin dashboard for either $100 or $300 and I'll break even after months but it'll still be mine.I didn't believe it'll see the fall it's seeing now. I checked coinmarketcap.com and I saw its price at $0.016, a 99+% decline over the years, I don't see this as a good pricing for the project'.",
