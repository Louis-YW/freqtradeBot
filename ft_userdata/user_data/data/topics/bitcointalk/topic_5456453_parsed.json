      "body": "Well this was a game I did play when I was a kid. But it was just 1 wish and this 1 wish was for infinite wishes. It is cheating but if I had 3 wishes now I am older so it would be easier to make choices.I want enough money to take care of my family for until they are all not alive anymore. To be able to cure the most horrible deadliest diseases. Cancer, aids, dementia, and blindness and deaf for just some examples but all of them.Last wish something fun like able to fly. It would make me different then anyone in the world. I would want to have this special ability.",
