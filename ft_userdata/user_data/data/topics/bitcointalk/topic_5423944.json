But yes, if the hash rate drops a lot, the next adjustment will come in ... much later.But the thing is that realistically it's very unlikely to have such a major drop. This is the beauty of being decentralized. Many countries/regions. Many not even using electricity from the grid. They can't all just go down all together.",

Luckily there's no such thing as a global power grid, so while large scale blackouts may happen, their effects will usually be somewhat localized (though admittedly the scale of that locale may be as large as Continental Europe or the East / West of the USA). At least if you ignore global catastrophic event like geomagnetic storms or nuclear war.Apart from that your calculations are correct: If you cut the hashrate by 95%, average block interval increases to 200 minutes and the difficulty adjustment will take that much longer. However also keep in mind that this also assumes that none of that hashrate comes back within those 277 days. And as much as I love Bitcoin, in the unlikely case of a global blackout that knocks out 95% of the world's grid for almost a year, Bitcoin is going to be at the very bottom of my priorities",

We would then just let it self adjust again from that new level, and it would slowly creep back up over the coming months and years as humanity slowly recovers from whatever massive disaster has befallen us.",

Since 2009 this situation has not happened but the more time passes the more likely it is to happen, especially with the recent news.

The miners in your country will continue, and maybe make up 5/10/20% of global hash rate, but the rest of the world will mine much faster. So the moment the (transatlantic) internet connection is restored, you won't have the longest chain, and your latest blocks will be orphaned and all transactions in there will be reorganised.",

If the difficulty is based on a hashrate of 200 EH/s, and you have 100 TH/s, then it will take you the exact same amount of time (on average) to find a block whether the other 199.9999 EH/s actually exists or not.Quote from: Wronsk on November 28, 2022, 06:51:26 PMbut wouldn't there be a way to improve BTC's algorithm to consider a large and fast variation of its hashrate (maybe with an average time of the last 50 blocks or any suitable system)Some altcoins have attempted this, and it has often resulted in miners gaming the system to maximize their profits, generating lots of blocks in quick succession and then very few for a sustained period. Having a fixed difficulty adjustment also protect against some kinds of Sybil attack in which an attacker could trick you in to accepting a malicious chain.",

Not that much hashrate is located in Europe specially this year since electricity price has been shooting up.As for US the same arguments apply, there is only a portion of the hashrate in US not all of it and not a significant percentage. And they are spread across USA and they use various electricity sources that includes for example solar power (that is not a grid to go down).",

And that if BTC does jump to $22000 or $25000 or something else how fast will we se a hashrate spike. No waiting on gear, no setup time, no configuration. Just however long it takes to drive to the datacenter and start powering up the miners and chillers. I know there are a lot of places sitting idle since it just does not pay to mine at the current prices, add $6000 to $9000, which is a lot of swing up from where it is but still possible in a short span of time. And all of a sudden there is going to be a bunch of us looking at the hashrate going where the hell did those miners come from?-Dave",

New miners won't be ordered if they're not profitable at the moment, so only old miners can be idle. And considering the difficulty still went up this year, the share in hash rate from idle miners gets smaller until the moment they're not worth it anymore even if the Bitcoin price goes up a lot.QuoteI know there are a lot of places sitting idle since it just does not pay to mine at the current prices, add $6000 to $9000, which is a lot of swing up from where it is but still possible in a short span of time.

I'm wondering, do we have a list of hardware efficiency overtime? We can verify that it's the more efficient hardware that drove the difficulty up.

If the price doesn't go back up in the medium to long term, then eventually miners who are dipping in to their reserves will run out of their reserves and simply shut down, and hashrate will come back down again.
