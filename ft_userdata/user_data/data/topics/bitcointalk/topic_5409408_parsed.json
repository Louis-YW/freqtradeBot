Binance were always giving so many event for its utility token include staking and many more. You can also try to join in BNB vault as well. The wallet for BNB like trust wallet was also offering staking pool to the its users. There are so many choices available in the market but the choice is yours.",

(I dont mean hack of services).Thank youFor staking I think its not so much reward for bnb and ada.  But if there are launchpads on binance,  then youll be earning more from it provided that you are having a lot of bnb.  Its kinda low pool on their exchange for bnb and even ada so youll need to find a decentralized which giving a good reward.  Not surr for ada since I am noy fond of usimg their network.  But if for bnb,  pancakeswap have variety of pools or farming.",

      "body": "I've got BNBs staked on Binance itself. The reward isn't that great but the other one that I've taken was like a promo of 15 days and it wasn't bad at all. After it ended, I've just literally put that into the normal staking offer that they have. Yes, I know the risk but I'll take it and hopefully, I won't end up badly with them since it's the mother platform of its own token. So, despite being not that high in returns, I'll just put it there to have some tiny bits of bnb added on my balance until I stop.",

Staking bnb in Binance is one of the options but there's still risk in it. We know that it's a good idea to be there but the staker should understand what's with it.Like having the risk and it's a custodial service where we put our bnb's there and they hold the private keys of it. So, invest, stake and deposit what you can afford to lose there just as what I've said.",

I think the best place to stake BNB is Binance because you also have an advantage to get discount fee to trading, so if you're using Binance as your exchanges, you will get the benefit. It's better to use few % of your money to stake and the rest money you invest in crypto should use non custodial wallet.",

(I dont mean hack of services).Thank youIf you want to stake for BNB, it's a good idea to use the Binance platform. It will be more secure for your assets than using other platforms. The advantage of staking on the Binance platform is that you will get a share if they release an airdrop, or as a BNB holder. The risk of staking is that you lose the opportunity if the coin price is rising. You cannot sell them if the coins are still staked. Another risk is that you can't sell it if the coin price really drops.You can stake if you are a long-term holder. It was very profitable because the number of coins had increased.",

(I dont mean hack of services).Thank youFor BNB? why not go directly to binance since they are the one who's reputable to handle those pools and I think this is much ideal or smart decision to choose because they are reputable compare to any random staking pools outside. This is also what peoples suggestion so maybe grab those and don't go with less reputable since the risk is huge there.",

Staking has its own risks, including:Missing the moment of reaping big profits when asset prices rise in the midst of a lockdown. Crypto assets that are being locked cannot be sold until the agreed lock-up period expires.As previously stated, the validator is responsible for maintaining the stability and security of the network. If the validator is successful, it will get a reward. On the other hand, if you fail, you risk losing all the coins you bet.Storing assets in digital wallets is vulnerable to hacking.",
