The rewards will be weighted, meaning the more hashrate you bring during the testnet, the more you will get.Effective starting today, April 17th, at 16:00 UTC (4 PM UTC), the reward schedule is as follows:Day 1 (April 17th-18) - US$1000 to be airdropped to testers.Day 2 (April 18th-19) - US$1500 to be airdropped to testers.Day 3 (April 19th-20) - US$2500 to be airdropped to testers.Rewards will be distributed in $IRON‚Äîthe native currency of Iron Fish, shortly after it's tradeable. Be sure to save the keys you are using on testnet‚Äîyou will need them to receive the rewards on the mainnet. Assuming the current hashrate, a single RTX 3080 would earn $125 through these three days. Hurry up, as there is not much time left until the mainnet launch!Join us now on stratum+tcp://iron.fpmp.net:8888 ‚Äî the endpoint will remain the same on mainnet too!For any questions, please refer to üêü-ironfish¬† channel on our Discord server: https://discord.gg/96TS7h3uj8.
