  "content": "Hi, I´m OrangeHodl and just registered as a member. Not sure if this was the right place to post this in. But after being a fan of crypto (mostly BTC) for a while, and having 7+ years experience designing art for the movie industry, naturally I gravitated towards making something really special and cool for the crypto community. So I began making crypto art posters, with a bit of cinematic feel to them.I have worked on projects for Netflix, HBO, Lionsgate etc), I have designed the front cover art on the DVD cover for Sicario for example, and made the winning poster for the TV series Murder In The First (the grey/red one that pops up in IMDB) to name a few.I really want to share and show the crypto community what I have created and its similar to Beeples artwork in a way. An inspiration for sure. I´m open to any critique and would like to see what the response are. What you like, what you don´t like etc. Also happy to answer any questions you might have.Heres a link to my collection: https://opensea.io/collection/thecryptoartcircle",

      "body": "Hi, MbitrThank you! I´m glad you like em . Not selling or offering anything physical yet. But I´ve actually thought about it. I prefer selling them as NFTs but thinking of offering something physical with the NFT too. Seems to be popular. But that would be for the NFT buyer so transaction would be ETH.I will have a look at the link. Good tip!",
