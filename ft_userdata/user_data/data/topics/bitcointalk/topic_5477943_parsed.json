Not too long the year will come to an end and I have been thinking since I started this forum and have started learning much about bitcoin and cryptocurrency. I have decided to take a bold step in starting a life as a blogger in Bitcoin specifically. It's difficult to know how to start, but i have started watching video lessons on blogging and the first thing I was asked to do is to create an account on some blog sites like Medium, Wordpress, Wix and Tumblr. I know some people may be wondering why i have to share it here. The thing is i need encouragement, insights and resources that will help me grow and successfully achieve this goal. By next year i want to be officially a Bitcoim blogger because am proud and i feel like one now  Perhaps i can find a mentor here.",

Since you are watching YouTube videos I believe the cloud that is creater around blogger by YouTubers should be enough encouragement for you because they all have what you're look for here in the forum. Since it requires alot of information to be a blogger you have to read alot, DYOR etc and be honest. I also hope you won't be part of false information that spread everywhere. For sharing your idea to be a blogger I'm not a fan of such I would have you better keep it to yourself and achieve the result than share hence at the end you won't be able hit the target",

My suggestion to you if you want to become successful as a blogger, you need to find your platform. Either create your own website or join in one where they do articles like LinkedIn or Medium or if you want, maybe start here creating your own topics and posting it here, make sure that it's not just a wall of text when you're writing here, mind the spacing, margin and how you cut your paragraphs.",

There are tons of information here, you just have to search for it, or draw some inspiration regarding what you want to write next.So just baby steps, you said that you watch video so create a account already and then move on from that.It's going to be very hard to find a mentor though, I mean everyone here could be very busy. It's not that they don't want to help, but most investors and traders in crypto are busy IRL.But in any case, best of luck to your journey.",

I  have come across many blogs on Bitcoin in the past, but they seem to fade away after some time. To get resources on Bitcoin you can always visit the forum as there are lot of content here that has not been updated. For resources on Bitcoin you can visit Bitcoin.org there you will find the whitepaper and other useful information on Bitcoin. Medium is the platform that you should use as Google does index good quality articles from Medium. It is easy to customize and easy to write on Medium, you can get traffic towards your blog from within Medium. They have their monetization plan for blogs that have decent traffic you might be able to qualify for it if you do it the right way. Please do not spam the forum with your blog links using your Bitcointalk ID to get traffic from here as it might result in a ban. When you reach the rank of a Member you can advertise your blog in your signature space.",

If you want to become a blogger then choose any one from Medium, WordPress, Wix, Tumblr. This will be very easy for you especially if you are a present intelligence person.

Blogging is not easy and you’re going to feel discouraged along the way especially when you’re doing your best and you are not getting the views or outreach you expect. The key is to stay consistent and keep working towards your goals. Getting materials and content shouldn’t be very difficult. You’re in one of the biggest bitcoin forum so you have that advantage. I would advise you don’t spend too much money on ads and promotions. There are other ways you can increase your audience without breaking the bank. Connect with other bloggers in the industry and propose a collaboration. Not everyone will agree to this, so send to as many as you can. Also don’t do too much, focus on a niche and build your community by constantly engaging your followers.",
