So with di devalue of naira, coupled with price increment of every commodity for market, everybody suppose readjust di way wey dem de take spend money. I believe say project wey you mean na investment, dat one good, but you go understand say na secondary need im be. You need to meet up your primary responsibilities first before you begin to think of project to invest in, na wen you don at least satisfy dos needs before you go start to think of investment.If increase in price of commodities for market make you come de struggle to make ends meet, best thing na to focus on the most important things wey be food, shelter, transportation etc. If e de possible to learn one trade, begin de use am hustle by di side, dat one fit help to earn extra income for your project.",

Infact I come make I resolution say any day wey clubbing hungry me, that money wey I for spend there I go use am buy bitcoin add for my bag. The same thing for all this hookup girls wey I been dey pay 30K per night. No be person advise me to focus on my girlfriend alone. As things be now I dey plan to go pay for my girl head make I marry because e no easy this period. Since I come stop those kind lifestyle I know how much bitcoin and some other strong Alt coins like Ethereum, Solana, Bnb wey I don gather.

Because that thing been dey help me save money.Even as the economy hard like this I think we also need to reduce drastically on the kind of unnecessary expenditure wey we dey do. Just like as them talk say \" sew your coat according to your size\" if person no learn how to minimize your expenses as a young man wey never marry. If you Mary e go definitely affect you and your marriage.

What they have to do is just adjust; if not, it will be very hard in the country, and if we are not careful, we will start hearing of squid issues from various sides of that country due to hardship, but we are not praying for that to happen. We should try our possible best to help the needy, and some of the money we spend on expensive and luxury items can also be used to help the low-class people living in Nigeria.QuoteRight now food commodities are very expensive in the market,  but it is better for one to buy this food stuff in the market and make your food yourself than to go to eateries everyday to buy food.

Meeting up with project in this hard season one  just needs to be very discipline on how money is been spent and you will still leave happy life.This is just a fact: eating food now in the eateries will consume a lot, as you say, and even due to the cost of food in the eateries, some people prefer to stay hungry and decide when they will reach home and eat rather than buy food from the eateries. If they are not making these plans, they will end up not meeting their needs and also the needs of their families, but still, food commodities are increasing daily. And again, those that are engaged in hunger just to provide the possible need for their family can end up facing some medical challenges like ulcers, which are caused by hunger and are a critical health issue that is happening to many people, especially those that are responsible for providing the need to their families. That is why I am emphasising those who have the money to help others who are still suffering and struggle to survive.",

Things are really hard right now, everywhere in this country. I remembered when the fuel hike stroke into the land and things began to change drastically. House rents don skyrocket. Vehicles don dey expensive for market so even as a car dealer, you no go dey make profit like before again and na so car don dey very expensive now. Everything is on the high side.As the economic crisis been come in, car wey I dey try use jejely use am hustle, no dey easy to fund again.  I dey buy fuel of 10 litres at the rate of 2,000 Naira before now which use to take me around 100 kilometers, now the same 10 litres cost 6,500 Naira now. Mind you, salaries did not increase and the naira have further devalued over the time.So, it's like the case of when the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch. If you mislead yourself by failing to adjust your means with the reality, you will only lead yourself to more distress. It is better to cut your coat according to your size. I had to delimit my movements with vehicle and whenever I travel, I make sure that I have to factor in all my appointments for a day and attend to them all at once.",

Things are no longer looking funny, but we must survive and how do we go about this? We have to uplift whatever we do to meet the economy standard. As you said earlier that price of things have skyrocketed and everyone has increased their own price, to continue to finance your project, you also need to increase your ways of income. If you sell things for instances or offer a service, make sure you double the price as well so thay you can also be able to purchased things as well, there is no other way than this one.There is a big challenge though, if the federal government doesn't increase the salary earners, they will continue to live in darkness for long time. Look at it, a person who have 3 kids and a wife been paid ₦35,000 a month, how do you think they will be able to keep up with such economy lifestyle that literally everything has triple in price, how do you not expect criminality not increase my brother? The only way for projects not to die is either the government reduce inflation and make sure that the price of goods is reduce or increase salary payment and for other non government workers, they should also increased their service charges to meet up with economy standard.",

If you calculate the money you spend in eateries to get food for the month it can x3 or x4 of the money you can use in getting food to stuck in your home. Meeting up with project in this hard season one  just needs to be very discipline on how money is been spent and you will still live happy life.Wetin you talk, na so e be and we dey really see how the economic situation don scatter everything for person, even our personal expenditure don change because of how the economy of the country dey reall eat us up. But with d way the tin dey go, e don dey show how Nigerians strong and no go allow any negativity wey dey happen for our country go take affect the people. Everything na time and dis kind hard economy na him still dey show the potential of person and great talent wey dey hidden inside am. We no pray for bad economy but if he come, we go still arrange well how to live an average life without been clamped down by the bad economy situation.",

      "body": "OP, you really had made good point here and no contrary.I have a friend who lived in one of the economical cities in the South East with a lower cost of living but has relocated to my City  somewhere in the South South which is regarded as one of the most expensive cities with a very high cost of living for this country.Back then we lived together at the South East, he is unknown to lives outdoors and the unproductive spendings then at his arrival to join me in the South South,I clearly let him know know that aside the hard economy that the city is exorbitant because I needed him to take early conciousness measures so he doesn't feel the enough money in the bank would take him a life time to maintain his reckless and luxurious spending lifestyle but guess what?He said to me that he is not better than those in the village so if he goes broke he still has a room at this father's house there in the village.I felt sorry for him but since he isn't a kid, I stayed back and watch how things goes with him and not up to 6months he is complaining giving blames to the federal and state governments due to the unusual value rate he that tends to drain his funds with no tangible reasons as a caused of my early notice to him.But after the 6months has thought him lessons we could limit his spendings.Morals >>> Learn to understand the kind of people you are surrounded and the kind of advices you are offered.Learn to grab the goal of the one that says... \"Let's merry to infinity\" and when the other says \"be conscious for tomorrow's\" at when the finance is yet unstable and imbalanced.Learn to give benefits of doubts at where your well-being concerned is preached.Learn to live by advices of the experienced because there could be probably no second chance offer at your ignorantic time.",
