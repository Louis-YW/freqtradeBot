The price thing that you noticed is because gas supply that changed over years. And no one believes in gas nor neo. Both are dead for like 4 years. It's just pump and dump. Nothing more. And it's easier to manipulate smaller asset.",

I believed its a pump and dump hame on the whales without much FA on project then whats the hot deal right? Also the marketcap of gas is sweeter if youll invest on one of them clearly we know which one has higher upside.",

Have the people trading a NEO utility token GAS decided to believe in it more than native coin NEO?This site have good article related to recent price spike of Gas token https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/here-is-why-gas-token-price-spikes-by-300-in-one-week/Read it there for sure you can find it more interesting when you read up the article they have written. Also Its current price growth create more hype so expect that there would be more price action for that token since many of its holders are been so hype with current happening on Gas token.This is interesting and wonder how far it will go knowing that altcoins would provably experience a bull run so maybe we can see more pumps from Gas token.",

Have the people trading a NEO utility token GAS decided to believe in it more than native coin NEO?The first pump incident occurred at Upbit, which then spread to other markets such as Binance. I think this is just hype, we also need to remember that on November 13th Upbit will be home to a major conference focused on the NEO network. Maybe at the conference later, we will hear about the updates that will occur in the NEO network.This article might answer your question: https://captainaltcoin.com/why-is-gas-price-up-here-are-reasons-behind-the-50-pump/",

Market cap when it comes to crypto doesn't mean much because of the ever-changing circulating supplies.

If they cannot find it, they are dumped on the market, lowering the price. In most cases finally reaching the market cap before the issuance of new tokens. Marketcap shows how much the entire project is worth. The price of one token is only the marketcap divided by the supply.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on November 12, 2023, 11:48:03 PMNEOs Market cap was at $2Billion, Gas' marketcap was at $800M.So in 2019 NEO was a little more than 2x bigger than GAS. Now its 7 times bigger which proves that this is not the case at all that \"people trading a NEO utility token GAS decided to believe in it more than native coin NEO\". In the long term, exactly the opposite is true.",
