Not having good food to eat in a foreign land mostly food that is familiar with one, could stand as a hindrance to any  Bitcoin investment goal within the longest or shortest possible term upon waiting on return of investment. What's your opinion?",

Don't invest when you don't have a steady source of income.Am not trying to complete my post count , if that's what you think of me creating this post. If you however feel and think that this post should be in the off topic section, then I see no reason why it shouldn't, or I should have waited till tomorrow to make this post. Anyways, I speak from experience having travelled through states within my country just to eke a living, or should I say it was because of a 9-5job I left home to another state to live and earn. Upon the decision to diversify or venture into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies while sourcing real life means of earning so as to invest in bitcoin steadily, it became harder to eat my own home cooked delicacy or even have my favorite meal cooked properly to my taste.I don't have the appetite to eat out anymore even when the money is available, and it has had an adverse effect on my health and thinking, and what is it they say about health, it is wealth obviously, if you get the drift.  Feel free to move this post to the off topic or even the beginners and help section if you please.",

What's your opinion?When you move to a foreign land you should also look for groceries or market for supplies, I don't think there would be such place that doesn't have market that sells food or at least fresh meat or vegetables to cook.And also before moving out you should at least learn to cook food for yourself so you wouldn't need to rely on others to have a decent meal or healthy meal.I don't see any reason why a person would work on a foreign land if they couldn't even cook their own food? for me it seems that the person isn't really ready to get out of their comfort zone.",
