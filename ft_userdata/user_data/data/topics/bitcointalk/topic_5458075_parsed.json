This should also be happening in America.Thank you for signing it into law King Charles.A U.K. bill giving regulators the power to supervise crypto and stablecoins was approved by King Charles Thursday, marking the last formal stage that makes the bill law.Read in full https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/29/uk-crypto-stablecoin-rules-receive-royal-assent-passing-into-law/",

As far as shitcoins are concerned, I believe that such control is necessary, and whoever wants to escape state control with bitcoin has the means to do so.",

      "body": "The UK does not have the lowest taxes on cryptocurrencies and doing business, although capital gains tax is only 10%. Most likely, the UK law will be similar in essence to the MICA Law, so that it is convenient to work with other European countries if they want to become a financial crypto center.https://koinly.io/guides/hmrc-cryptocurrency-tax-guide/\"How much tax do you pay on crypto in the UK?For capital gains from crypto over the £12,300 tax-free allowance, you'll pay 10% or 20% tax. For additional income from crypto over the personal allowance, you'll pay between 20% to 45% in tax. The exact amount you'll pay will depend on the transaction you've made, the tax that applies, and the Income Tax band you fall into.\"How can the crypto industry be developed with such taxes?",

It will be easy to track crypto community users with exchanges that operate in any country that want to regulate the crypto space and I believe the EU or UK is not the only country that will go that direction. The means to know the number of people in the space is mandatory KYC, so is either you are hodling your coin through your wallet or you subject yourself to KYC if you want to trade.Tax collection is another purpose for regulation.",

It's just really hard to balance.After the unexpected disastrous end of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, I think there is a need to supervise these exchanges. Most of the owners of these crypto-related businesses run them as their private businesses without considering that they are people's money. People that use these exchanges should enjoy some level of security from the government. If possible these exchanges should be charged to deposit lump sums with regulators which will serve as guarantees for customers' funds. This will enable customers to get their funds back in case of any financial problems.
