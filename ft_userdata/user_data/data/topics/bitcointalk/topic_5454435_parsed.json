If the opposing parties had joined forces, we could have avoided turning the election into a tribal and religious conflict. Instead, the focus should be on rebuilding the country and putting an end to the ruling party's shameless actions. I hope that even after eight years, we can eventually remove Tinubu from power. It's disheartening to see the lack of remorse or consideration for the current state of the economy. The overnight removal of fuel subsidies without implementing appropriate measures to mitigate the impact is concerning.",

To move the country forward go hard with the high level of rigging wey every person know. Is not like in the past wey people no too dey put eyes down and now the margin for rigging and mode of it na slap on the masses.Who e even be you like say win the presidential election?

Lol... my brother you dey talk about love one another, you don see love without money for pocket? Hunger dey everywhere, no be home video. For the other hand, me I no believe say change go start from the people oo, no. Na people in government go begin change. Them go begin change by enforcing the right thing. If them begin call bad thing to be bad thing and punish even their family members and friends wey do bad thing then change don begin be that na and every other person go fear to do wrong. The theory of social contract don carry power and authority give the people elected or selected (any how them enter there ) to lead followed by the authority to command obedience through even guns. So change start with people in authority and even for Nigerian system, change start from the number 1 person be it the president or governor because Nigeria be like country wey dey practice unitary system of government mbok.Quote from: Davidvictorson on May 31, 2023, 11:50:10 PMFrom wetin I understand about the removal of subsidy eh, e nor bad at all.

Like NLC dey follow government in the past talk say make dem repair refinery but dem leave that one go allegedly support dangote own wey obviously dey out for profit. Now NLC and TUC through their presidents, come. Joe Ajaero and Mr Festus Osifo respectively don dey remind them on Aburi we stand lol. Meanwhile, that subsidy na the cost wey dem dey take carry crude go abroad, refine and bring am back. So na who cause am wey make dem dey carry crude go abroad? Na the question be that wey NLC dey ask.The spokes person to Tinubu, Dele Alake don already start the talk talk and lie lie wey dey inside. We still dey where we dey if not worse off. God help us.",

Nigeria they budget trillions of Naira to pay for fuel subsidy, me and you know say no be all that money dey go into paying for the subsidy, plenty still dey enter some people pocket, the money wey Naija dey budget for subsidy too much, and e dy affect the budget for other sectors of the economy.

You go know sae anything like voting during the election period don end for millions of Nigerians side. People no go get mind to come out to vote ever again.
