I am having difficulty browsing around the pages.Menus are not clearly loading, the text box tool icons are not loading, index page board icons are not loading, left and right icons (last post) on the topic list for boards are not loading.I tried to clear cache with possible everything. Ctrl+Shift+R, Ctrl+F5. Cleared my browsing history. But nothing is working. It seems something wrong on the server side, CSS messed up or something.",

It seems anything that was supposed to be loading from forum default asset files, are not properly loading.

In the regular browsers (I do not log in from clean web) I see not logged in pages are just fine. My internet connection is absolutely fine. This concludes, it has something to do with the TOR circuit.",

You do not take advantage of Tor Browser which have strong fingerprint protection.Using TOR browser comes with this disadvantage that I need to login every time when I open the browser even if this is with the captcha bypass URL it's an extra headache. The browser also does not show emoji's that I use very often. If anyone have solution for these then I would appreciate knowing them. The emoji things do not need much attention.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on October 17, 2022, 11:13:58 AM2. This forum use cloudflare onion service[1], which let Tor user access this forum without reaching exit node. I'm not sure how cloudflare handle Tor user who do not use Tor Browser.[1] https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-onion-service/Not technically sound about this but it sounds using direct TOR browser is a good idea.Quote from: Foxpup on October 17, 2022, 09:39:45 AMAs I mentioned in my other post, the image proxy for external images is unaffected. Only images on the forum site itself are affected.You are right. I overlooked it.The problem still exists. I can do things but it's just annoying. I changed my internet connection an hour ago but there are nothing has changed. In the same browser every other websites are working fine except the forum.",

So far, I have never experienced it, even I have never heard of this problem before in 2 years less than 2 days of my participation in the forum. I use TOR, Firefox [infrequently] and Crhome to access forum, but honestly I haven't had the same problem. So for now, I don't really know what the problem is. But, does it have anything to do with some of the scripts you install?",

This troubleshooting removed everything from my browser and restarted fresh. It even removed the TOR setting which I had to set again. But the same problem exists with forum. All other sites are loading just fine. Images hosted on other sites and posted on the forum are working fine. But the images/icons that are supposed to be loading from the forum server is not working. At this point I am fed up and tired of everything from my end LOLQuote from: dkbit98 on October 17, 2022, 05:44:56 PMI also think that Cloudflare might be causing problems for you, but it's strange how it only affects certain users and not everyone.Even if does, I have no idea how to get it and fix it. Earlier today I logged in directly from TOR browser and everything was fine. It's only causing the problem when I am using it on firefox with TOR connection.Quote from: _BlackStar on October 17, 2022, 03:21:49 PMBut, does it have anything to do with some of the scripts you install?Right now with the clean setup, the browser have nothing installed.I am graphically blind and everything is plain text to me LOL",

BitcoinGirl.Club, I don't not use Firefox so I don't know if this happened to me too, but what if you don't set TOR in firefox, does this error still occur?I don't know who will be responsible for fixing all this, but I hope it will be fixed soon because I'm sure a lot of people use Firefox to login the forum account.",

While it could reduce your privacy, IMO it's still better than using Firefox + Tor.Another problem with directly using the TOR browser is the browser response slow. Sometimes it even do not load page until I need to restart the browser. I was using it yesterday for an hour and faced all these slowness. I made a little change on the TOR browser to store the password and the captcha bypass URL so that I do not need to access the password backup file every time I am logging in.
