  "content": "About 6 months ago I created https://orangefren.com/. Also available at http://rnwis2whetqcj4oknksnc5l24jbh33nflunifff3xtjjonnoxu3ld6id.onion/.OrangeFren.com lets you quickly compare the rates among instant, KYC-free, exchanges trading Bitcoin (including on Lightining), Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, USDC and USDT.The comparison takes into account the amount you're willing to trade and (by default) your region.At this point the site queries about a half a dozen exchanges, none of which require a sign up.For trades from Bitcoin into Monero the site also shows atomic swaps when their rate is better than that of instant exchanges.We also partnered up with some of our best exchanges to offer the OrangeFren Guarantee - a security deposit provided to us by the exchanges to compensate our users in cases of disputes with the exchanges. The specifics vary depending on the exchange, but the most common points include compensation to the user if an exchange runs off with their money, doesn't respond to their messages, lies about the previewed exchange rate or when the user is asked to answer KYC or SoF questions and passes the verification.You can also use our service through our Telegram bot: https://orangefren.com/bot/telegram. It has the same functionality as OrangeFren.com with the added ability to request price alerts delivered through a DM straight to your inbox.If you'd like to follow our project we're most active on Reddit as u/OrangeFren.I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!",

However some check if the coins are tainted and then require SoF verification.This never happened to any of my users and in the case of exchanges that have a reputation of doing so in the past there's a red warning on OrangeFren.com.It's unfortunate, but sadly unavoidable if the exchanges constantly require liquidity from the huge CEXes.The OrangeFren Guarantee does not apply to all exchanges listed. Currently it's only for trades on FixedFloat and eXch. Although I have suggested the service to others too, including the one you mention, they have declined.I will look into the reports regarding the service you mentioned and probably add a red warning for them too.QuoteCan you share how much they deposited for this?Currently we compensate up to 2k USD per trade with FixedFloat and up to 1k USD per trade with eXch. Note that with the exception of an exit-scam our compensation maxes out at 10% so under normal circumstances that's a proportionate compensation for trades up to 20k and 10k respectively.Our reserves are naturally larger than the per trade maximum.",

And list the exchanges in [Blacklist] of unreliable, 'taint proclaiming' Bitcoin services / exchanges?Taint only exists if people believe it does! The notion of \"taint\" is very bad for Bitcoin. Allow me to quote myself:Quote from: LoyceV on June 09, 2022, 08:39:08 AMI've seen several posts lately from people willing to treat Bitcoin as non-fungible because they believe some coins are \"tainted\".I'd say this is a severe threat to Bitcoin, and I wouldn't be surprised if governments use this because they can't stop Bitcoin in any other way. If people believe Bitcoin is \"tainted\", they won't accept it anymore. \"We\" should really inform people not to fall for this.Nobody would reject a dollar bill because it has previously been used in a crime, despite the fact that 85 to 90% contains traces of cocaine. Claiming Bitcoin isn't fungible is just plain stupid.Quote from: OrangeFren on August 12, 2022, 09:51:00 PMThis never happened to any of my users and in the case of exchanges that have a reputation of doing so in the past there's a red warning on OrangeFren.com.I didn't see any warning on the selective scammers I mentioned. It's better to avoid them entirely.Quoteour compensation maxes out at 10%I didn't catch that when you wrote \"compensate our users\", but after checking the meaning of the word, it turns out \"compensate\" doesn't mean what I thought it would.There's a flaw in your Untraceable Bitcoin with Monero: the exchange you use knows exactly which Bitcoin addresses belong to your IP address if you're not using different Tor identities.Your Disclaim affiliation is genius:",

      "body": "QuoteSo the \"KYC-free\" claim is misleading  Well... we've never observed them being non KYC-free to our users. And if they start doing that and the users go through their verification we'll compensate them for their trouble and loss of privacy straight from the exchange' coffers. It's not flawless, but if we only listed exchanges that will never check if your coins are tainted we'd only be able to list one and I suspect it's only a matter of time, before they too are forced to change their business model.QuoteCan you share how they check that?Unfortunately no, because there is no objective standard, just like you say it's entirely subjective. Anecdotally I have reason to believe stolen coins are considered tainted, but coins from DNMs are not, but that's just me connecting the dots from the things I hear, please don't rely on this observation. Aside from the warning users an exchange might take their funds if they appear tainted we also warn users if an exchange is known to send tainted coins which then cause inconvenience when the user tries to spend them.QuoteThe notion of \"taint\" is very bad for Bitcoin. I fully agree with you. However so long as Bitcoin's blockchain is transparent it is unavoidable. The only (admittedly partial) solution which comes to mind is the use of Bitcoin's Lightning Network of which I am a strong supported and actually before OrangeFren.com I spent my days creating tools for lnd professionally. For that reason OrangeFren.com does separate comparisons and collects separate rates from Lighting exchanges.QuoteThere's a flaw in your Untraceable Bitcoin with MoneroYou're right! Thanks for letting me know! I'll go over the post and fix the error.QuoteYour Disclaim affiliation is geniusThank you! The website actually started off with that idea, however nobody ever used it. Recently I was actually planning on removing that feature entirely.",

My rationale was it's best for new users to already have accounts on P2P exchanges to avoid the temptation of going with one of the huge CEXes which are atrocious from a privacy standpoint.QuoteIMO there should be clarification if the exchange ask for KYC/SoF.I considered adding that, however it's hard to get a good source for this. I've seen exchanges break their own ToS with respect to requiring verification or allowing the user to get their funds back if they refuse to answer questions.I can ask the exchanges outright, but if they lie or change their mind in the future like some did with their ToS then I'd be giving the user a false sense of security.",

Bitcoin on Lightning is a bit tricky, because there's only a few exchanges that support it and most don't service US customers, however in the coming days I expect to be able to list another Lightning exchange and it'll be one available globally.You might also be seeing few offers, because recently many of the exchanges faced difficulties with their liquidity providers surrounding the Monero hardfork.",
