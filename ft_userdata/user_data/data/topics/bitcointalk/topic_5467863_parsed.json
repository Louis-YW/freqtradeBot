If we look at the 1st match of this World Cup so England team is confident because England won the last world cup. I agree; they have high confidence as the defending champions. They are the favorites to win the first match due to their very strong team, good form, and a well-balanced batting and bowling lineup. As far as I know, their batting lineup is the most explosive in the world and capable of scoring big runs quickly. Additionally, their bowling attack is also very good and capable of taking wickets at a good pace.",

The contingent got their visa less than 48 before their scheduled arrival. Pakistani media are complaining that India delayed the visa, in order to disrupt the preparations and to prevent Pakistani players from getting acclimatized. Anyway, now they should concentrate on the warmup matches (first one is against New Zealand on 29th September, and there is another one scheduled against Australia on 3rd October).",

The last time it was T20 World Cup in 2016 when the Pakistan cricket team visited India. If we talk about India, it is a long time since they were in Pakistan for the 2008 Asia Cup.Both nations have a strong love for cricket, but what a pity that they can't go to each other countries to play bilateral series. Bad for the nations, bad for sports and bad for the sponsors.",

We do not need to check the adaptability of the teams in India conditions on their warm matches but actually the purpose of the warm uo matches is that the teams get used to the playing conditions and have a match practice with a competitive team, before the start of the World cup.This helps the team to check their combinations of bowling and batting, though winning the match is not the motive of warm up matches. The primary purpose is to find the right combination before the start of the WC.",

Teams will get some know-how about the weather conditions, humidity, and the pitches. Choosing the right combination might not be the sole purpose of these warmup matches. As far as the right team combination is concerned, I think it will be decided on the actual match after assessing the pitch and ground conditions. We all know that teams have already somewhat fixed the combination, except for a few changes (depending on the pitch) on the match day.",

Also, this is my last post in this thread. It is spamming, why would someone create a thread only on ICC World Cup discussion. There are threads which are for prediction pool and there are mega threads, that are best to discuss about Cricket. The biggest issue here is that we as cricket fans are not united. The obvious reason is that none of the users from Pakistan, Bangladesh, India and Srilanka tend to forget political issue and be fan of this wonderful game. As of now self moderated threads which a big are being questioned because of spam. You know the reason and why it is being questioned. While big football threads are still not being noticed as they are not that stupid like us. I believe that this thread should be closed by the OP before someone points it as a spam.",

But still, we should not change our bias for the teams as sometimes i feel the stronger team do not play with full dedication however a team with a lower rank, tries to take every match seriously and this is true for the warm matches too.Today the host India will take on England. This would be a more viewed match today as compared to the other one between Australia and the Netherlands. I would like to see how the Netherlands perform today as they were the ones who didn't let West Indies make it to the World Cup.",

We saw Sri Lanka try their best. We saw Bangladesh try their best. Both teams tried but those who performed better won. We always just calculate the ledger whether we can go to the next round due to winning this match or if we win this match we will get points, if we lose how many points we have lost all the time we have to calculate beyond these things, those who are their best. Couldn't get back into rhythm I saw all those players found their rhythm for Bangladesh don't you think this kind of result in this match will encourage them in future. Every match is important to the players and everyone is on the field to win.",
