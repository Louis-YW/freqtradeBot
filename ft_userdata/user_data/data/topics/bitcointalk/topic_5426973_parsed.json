  "content": "Today, a bitcointalk user Spiroll just made an announcement about new gambling site, called by spiroll.app Source : https://loyce.club/archive/posts/6141/61411347.htmlWhen i asked about how much their bankroll, OP said they have $250,000 as bankroll, which is \"too small\" compared their max winning amount on one of their games, crash game with $5,000,000. After that, another btctalk user @Zhi Wei asking OP about how's affiliate, commission calculated, withdrawal and asked OP to sign message about his bankroll site.No answer from OP, then he edited and deleted the OP ANN post and changed the title to \"delete please\"I've archived the deleted ANN as evidence, since OP can't proven the bankroll which is Red Alert for other people as well.https://web.archive.org/web/20221208141843/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5426851.msg61411347",

      "body": "I feel that it's important to mention here that there are a number of new casino sites being promoted on the forum whose operators don't want to provide evidence of their bankroll and how much money they have available for payouts. While we can't say that all of these sites are scams (they haven't scammed anyone as far as I know), there's definitely reason to be cautious and something to be aware of before depositing at any new casino. The bottom line is that if a casino operator doesn't want to show proof of their financials or answer questions about their bankroll, then there's probably something fishy going on.",

We know lot of new gambling site also doing that, instead of prove their bankroll, they prefer to run away and deleting all evidence so we can't trace them (luckily we have loyceV's data). That's also one of their goal to attract people come too and playing on there, build up more money until they have enough bankroll to prove they have more money than max winning amount.Thanks to other people as well who searching their website data",

Having only 5% of the maximum profit as bankroll means they'll be forced to scam when someone wins big. A sustainable maximum for the profit should be about 1% of the bankroll, in this case (assuming they have $250k) should be $2500. That's 2000 times less than the current maximum.I'm posting here as Reference link for the neutral feedback I'm going to leave. I kinda think they deserve a Newbie warning Flag too.What's with all those broke people starting \"casinos\" lately?",
