      "body": "Trading is riskier, there are a lot of traders, especially newbie traders that just want to trade and make profit, but in the process of trading to make profit, they lost some of their asset, and if they trade more, they lose more. So, it depends on you. Are you a good trader? Have you traded and make profit than loss? If you are a successful trader, you can trade. But if you are not a successful trader yet, or maybe you are a beginner, do not trade. If you want to start to learn how to trade, use a very small amount of money. If you have experience enough, you do not need advice because I believe you know what to do, but above all, use the money you can afford to lose to trade. Holding is better, you do not have to check the market all the time while holding, you know already that it is bear market we are, if you hold bitcoin for long, like 2 years or 3 you will make profit.",

Bitcoin is on bear but when the bull come, hodlers will start smiling. If you are a trader, it comes with its own challenge of liquidation, fluctuation etc.",

Because no one can tell when the bearish will end, whether you want to hold or trade you must successfully maintain or accumulate your crypto until the bullish phase begins. You can use a small part to trade for example with that UCT and another part for you to hold (of course in a non-custodial wallet).",

All suggestions are welcomed.Holding and keep buying is perfect in this kind of market condition since the current price is at the support level which means there is a high chance to reverse the trend and earn more if you accumulate and sell later. It is less hassle too because you don’t need to think when to sell because your goal is simply keep buying. We might not see this price for a long time once the market already recover so done waste this opportunity given to us by weak hands to accumulate and become millionaire in the future.",

The market is very tricky at this point that if you must hodl then it has to be on a long term goal. Trading on the other hand will be more profitable but the risk is higher when compared to hodling. But ensure to do enough research before picking a choice between trading and hodling.",

All suggestions are welcomed.SOL, Near, Link and BTC ofcourse. These are my favourite 4, top coins with minimal risk and all 4 of them in completely different sectors which means if one project gets failed it is not at all correlated with other one's success. These sort of combinations are generally the best. And Sol and near are obviously going to be best blockhains in coming future with ChainLink too being one of the important asset of the crypto community as well. I think you can change BNB with something else as BNBs growth I feel won't be that exponential in coming future.",

If you're good in technical skills in trading, you're in but if you don't just go for investing.  The higher risk means the higher potential of gaining profit and that's trading and if you want to play safely in the market investing is suitable for you. If you've already these coins that you've mentioned above, just hold because it might you're right, a bull market will come and it seems there's a sign.All coins that you've picked are good and have potential except UCT which is I think stable coin.",

All suggestions are welcomed.Well I hold all of them tho  , if you're confused to choose between holding or trading the first thing you should know is the risk between them. With trading you can't always in profit but when it comes to holding for the long term with at least 2 cryptos above for example you hold BNB and BTC you can get the highest chance to profit in the future rather than doing trading. If you want to increase your capital it's better to look for some job out there and spend a little bit % from your income to buy this dip.",

What i do encourage especially new investors is to coin they will accumulate and hold for long term. While some of the investors feel excess lost after bearish market is the kind of currency they invested during long term.",

You can track UCT on CMC to know how it is mainwhile the price is very low now compare to when high so I think holding those currency will give a very good increase in time coming.But for sure I will hold as many post suggested I should.

It's the riskier option, but also the option that could get you the greatest amount of profit in a short amount of time. Hodling on the other hand is more for people who don't really know much about trading or don't have the time to min manage their trades. It takes time, yes, but if you chose an asset that performs well over time, then profit should be pretty easy to come. It also reduces the stress and other mental/emotional stuff you get when trading so it's like a burden off your shoulders.",

In the end, your effort will be nothing.The best practice, in case you do really love a specific coin, after you manage to double amount of coin you have, it's time to hold it tightly, very tightly. My advice is when you don't have plan to sell that coin and are a really long term holder.Hodling is not actually good, especially with altcoins in bear market.",

The one I am planning to hold is BTC and ETH, I don't plan on holding much on BNB that's why I consider it as a coin that I can use for trading. I don't mind BTC and ETH losing it's value now because of the market cycle but on the other coins I have, I'm monitoring them.
