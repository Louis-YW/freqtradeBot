Every entry into an altcoin project is most often due to the expectation of high income, and for all those who did not manage to realize themselves in the bull market fully, it will be challenging to do so at a time when interest is declining.I would say that it is a very high risk with a much smaller potential for significant growth.all new investors should first keep in mind that the current price of bitcoin is very low. There is no guarantee of what will happen and in what period, but it certainly carries much less risk.",

After they do this, nothing should be worried since Bitcoin is the best coin to invest during bear market and the coin wouldn't get hacked due to decentralized and high security. Unlike those shitcoins there's will be a whales who own most of the coins, in Bitcoin there's no whales that can control 50% of Bitcoin supply. Mostly address that contain high number of Bitcoin is centralized exchange hot wallet.",

      "body": "My biggest problem with altcoins is the way it is been influenced by rich investors who holds more than half of this coins. Once they see to pull the plug off it affects the minor investors. Looking at these coins you mentioned they aren't even top 10 of Altcoins so I would say I it will be hard to pull up after this bear. It takes a genuine coin like bitcoin to bounce back from such period. So just like the others suggested, the person should just switch over to bitcoin. And if he wishes to still have some Altcoins he should rather stay with the top 5 but bitcoin stays the best option for store of value",

Same goes to Venture Capitals VCs which got a lot of belief and capital from retail investors. Those people invested without research and they spent money by following VCs.QuoteWhat will you do in this case? Bitcoin firstEthereum and BNB will be my next considerations but I will buy these altcoins after Bitcoin.Reason is Bitcoin is a market leader and it will start a new bull run first. Ethereum will follow Bitcoin and BNB should be next altcoin to follow Bitcoin and Ethereum.",

However, I would ask him to research before deciding.In this case, it's a good idea to ask your friend to do some research and weigh the potential and downsides. For example, if it is found that Alameda & FTX are the top investors, then he/she should be selling it. With the consideration if the price rises, both of them will do a dump by selling all the tokens they hold and later this token has no value.However, if they only support not making large investments, tell him/her to look at the long term potential, how the project is performing so far. Compatibility of performance with roadmap and other factors. If everything is fulfilled, your friend can hold.But, as @examplens said, when the bearish comes, most new projects will hard to survive. so, tell to your friends to take a consideration to sell, if the loss is not more than 30%, to sell gradually and look for other options that are more convincing for him and ask your friends to do more research about current progress of this project.

Both are low-cap projects, in case both of these projects do not have the investment of FTX and Alameda, I still advise him to sell, even though it will make him lose, it is better than losing everything. But I would not advise him to sell these two altcoins and buy another two I would recommend he invest all that money in bitcoin to ensure his safety as well as the ability to recover the losses Mina and Fuel inflicted on him. Given what happened with FTX, we should stay away from altcoins as far as possible.",

We have been watching every big crypto scam scheme collapsing other scam schemes connected to each other, increasing the possibility the tokens you mentioned are also going to be impacted negatively by FTX's influence. We are living uncertain times, and in moments like this the best you can do is to avoid altcoins and focus on bitcoin to mitigate risk.",

I will instantly suggest to just sell those and just buy bitcoin or other top coins. We are on a bear market and it's common that weak altcoin is doomed to fall and given that it is connected to Alameda and FTX which also has a bad reputation today, I assume that there's a high chance that those coins the newbie is holding will not last long until it's value drop at a significant price that he can't sell it. Again I don't have any idea about those coins but given the scenario we have today, It would be better to just hold bitcoin and other strong coins knowing that he is a newbie and don't have a necessary experience on crypto to survive.",

Well i am not sure how much they sold as collateral, but selling time was while ago i think, if something else doesn't get revealed i think they might have hit the bottom.
