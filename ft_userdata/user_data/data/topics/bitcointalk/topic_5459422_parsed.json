  "content": "Hi all community:I think To analyze the long-term outlook of BTC this glassnode chart is quite interesting. We can observe whether Bitcoin price might experience a dump leading up to the halving event or not.https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1675842010261979137?t=SabfX80yr5HyODx0t1b9tw&s=19In the last 600 days i think there has been a gain of 1.4 million Bitcoin among long term holders according to the graphic showing their position. The total supply of BTC in the market is 19 million some thing. The green highlights on the chart indicate that there are 14 million BTC held by long-term holders while 4 million BTC is though analyzed lost. Lost means that when these 4 million BTC were transferred to their respective wallets, they have remained untouched. So, there are 1 to 2 million BTC available for trading.This is very positive news for long-term holders, and from this point of view it propose that Bitcoin prices should not be dumped until the next halving event. This is because miners receive mining rewards which creates selling pressure on the price of BTC in the market.",

Halving is the event that everyone looking forward which means it is an important part of crypto and bitcoin that will have a big effects the future of it.Base on past history of bitcoin, the price is always at its low whenever the halving is approaching halving period. Many investors still believe it would happen, most are even predicting a price low close to $20k. Although I also have some belief that it could happen, the issue around ETF this days is actually shaping the market trend. If many institutions move in the same direction as BlackRock and other institutions then we might be in for the price range of $30k plus till next year. Another concern would be government policies, should there be strict regulations against bitcoin or cryptocurrency in major countries in the upcoming days or a major collapse of any of the big exchanges then we might be faced with a dump. Because some investors will be forced to sell should any of the two above happens",

Bitcoin could have gone lower before the halving, or it could have approached its past ATH value. Both of these are still possibilities, but nothing to worry about if you want to hold onto them long term.If you pay attention to the price chart on the daily TF, then bitcoin price may look very close to undergoing correction lower than $29k, but anything to the contrary is possible. I was expecting bitcoin to be higher ahead of the halving instead of lower than $29k, but I'm not worried.",

We can observe whether Bitcoin price might experience a dump leading up to the halving event or not. No one knows for sure what bitcoin's condition will be before reaching the halving for the future, but theoretically bitcoin's journey can be studied based on historical data and what I see the journey before reaching the halving must have decreased before reaching the peak of the halving.Quote from: Compromise me on July 11, 2023, 12:57:55 PMIn the last 600 days i think there has been a gain of 1.4 million Bitcoin among long term holders according to the graphic showing their position.

Lost means that when these 4 million BTC were transferred to their respective wallets, they have remained untouched. So, there are 1 to 2 million BTC available for trading. Realistically the journey of bitcoin has spawned a lot of understanding for people and we are also finding long term holding compatibility for bitcoin rather than being actively traded, so more bitcoins are sitting in holders' wallets than are currently active on trading exchanges. If I'm not mistaken in the past year there was a statistic that was shared that more bitcoins are stored than actively traded and even then if my memory serves me right, from many things that we have found and people have come to the conclusion that bitcoin is indeed more suitable to be held in the long term to make big profits. Another reason is that we don't need to pay attention and worry about how the market conditions are going at all times.",

There was actually a dump in 2020, but this was a black swan event due to covid and US closing its borders.How do you understand a \"dump\" though? Is it a 10% correction? 20%? Some people see 5% and they go into panic mode. 10% would only be 3k down, so 27k bitcoin. Still bullish!Bitcoin doesn't even react to the news as much as it used to, which is a sign of maturity and it doesn't follow stocks like it used to.",

Investors are wise, they want the price to remain constant before the price halving as they are continuing to buy at every possible time.",

A lot of people would actually lose faith on bitcoin but am certain that bitcoin isnt going to dip again although stability of price is what am expecting till the halving passes by.",

Most long term holders have always chose to hodl than sell. Yes, but we have to look at why the miners is selling, or why they are selling pressures on them, it's simply because it's business, so they need to sell at some point to keep their operations going. So for miners, there are always selling pressures so I'm not surprised by it.The selling pressures could come from retail though, if they chooses to sell for whatever reasons, maybe they see the price going down hard, or there is a FUD then so be it. We can't control who is going to sell and who is going to have a diamond hand.

But for long term holders, it doesn't matter though, we are looking for the long term so we won't be selling even at the height of the next bull run.No one can control, selling or buying is everyone's decision. This is also what makes the crypto market very volatile. Those who sell at a loss will only waste their assets, but those who become diamond hands, they will survive until their target is reached. But some whales also manipulate to get cheaper prices by spreading FUD to make the market crash.As a long-term holder, FUD and such are just signals to buy back at a lower price. But when you say don't sell at the top of a BullRun, you have to see at what price peak the target will be reached.Remember that you don't have to hold for the rest of your life, when the Bullrun comes and the new ATH target is reached it is a good opportunity to sell, but if the desired ATH target has not been reached then it will be a long journey.",

Its experienced last halving edition and I don't think accurate with next time halving in 2024, better not holding bitcoin fund after halving and sell it when get moment on higher price before buy back later after halving with lower price.Inside with FUD possibility with bitcoin drop exactly after halving time any community publish with bad news, but its worth comparison with 290 days left before halving last edition and right now checking again has the same progress with bitcoin price?",

This is of course an extreme scenario that I brought up only for illustrative purposes. But you should always remember about the demand, instead of looking only at supply. Supply is not known perfectly, because we don't know what Bitcoin holders plan to do, but at least we can get some info from on-chain activity. But demand is completely unknown to us.",
