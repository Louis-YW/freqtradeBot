Optimism was a good second layer blockchain but i just found that if the transaction fees are still high unlike polygonQuote from: Z390 on June 06, 2022, 06:37:26 AMWhat do you think about this second layer blockchain project? This is good for long term but the prospect will not be so bright like the first layer blockchain that has its own ecosystem. Quote from: Z390 on June 06, 2022, 06:37:26 AMA good one or not worth it? A good one for long term. Quote from: Z390 on June 06, 2022, 06:37:26 AMThe billion supply for 1.2$ from a new coin seem to high in this bear market, what do you think ?That's not a bit problem that selling pressure caused by people are still dumping their free OP. Once all of tokens already dumped and im sure it will be pumped",

Im not sure of its worth but its the first l2 to deploy so interesting project actually. The supply is much bigger in my opinion, and once the free airdrop have settled then we will see its worth once its been used by a lot of users. For now its launch isnt good since we are in the middle of bear market. So technically we could see a good movement from it once the bull run hit up again.",

If the developers do not provide additional preferences to OP holders, then we can expect that the value of the coin will decrease to several tens of cents.",

The billion supply for 1.2$ from a new coin seem to high in this bear market, what do you think ?The token really serves no purpose right now. Additionally, the future of WEB3 is not L2, it's scalable L1s like NEAR and Candle Chain. L2 blockchains can have high gas fees due to being on Ethereum and the time to go off of the L2 to Ethereum can take a week. You don't have those problems with sidechains. In fact, NEAR has the only 1000 trustless Ethereum bridge and CNDL has 2 second transaction and 0 fees.",

Maybe. Are they better than ethereum ? NO. The most useful projects amongst these layer 2 projects are those that allow cross chain swaps on their platform. They have the real utility and can push up token value in the future.Optimism token almost crashed the OP blockchain in a simple surge in the week of launch, what happens when theres full deployment of chain utilities and potentials? The future is far off. Lets see how it goes",

Lets see how it goesthe future is maybe far, but development is on-going, and that is what really matters in long-termit is really hard to predict token price, and I will not try to do that, but Optimism platform goal is not to have token price appreciation, it is to have a way to fund public goods and profitable public good ideas, and OP token is a great way to do thatthere is an on-going turmoil on sellers, and even proposal to black-list all addresses that sold OP airdrop, for eventual future drops",

The advantage of this project is of course the cost and speed of its transactions, but so far not such a wide area of application, waiting for Ethereum 2.0, perhaps after the merger something will change and commissions will become even cheaper and the speed even faster.As for the price, the fall by 75% was caused by airdrop, but I think that the price can easily return to these values. I did not sell my tokens because I did not manage to catch a high price, and there is not much sense to dump like all of them, I will wait in the medium or long term, the price may grow after consolidation, if it goes lower, I will buy some more to my portfolio.",

Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad one, it just doesn't really capture anything new for the market. This is why I believe that we should not really be making a big deal out of this at all.I get that we are going to end up with some coins that will be brand new and then take the place of the old ones, all the top 10 ones right now aside from 3-4 of them will be replaced one day, and that is what people are looking for, the ones that will replace, but optimism doesn't look like that one.",

But I do not understand what is the value of the OP coin in the network, in which even the commission is charged not in this coin but in ETH?",
