      "body": "It must be centralized exchange site. Remember that if you wanna dealing the dex and you must know the risk. The risk can't be avoided but at least the exchange site like binance has a good protection for your money rather than try to stake on the decentralized exchange site. The problem is once your key will be compromise and then your money can be stolen by the scammers or hacker. Cex is much more relevant for me",

Most of service could be terminated due losing to much asset and company can't covered the loss.1-5% loss could be still can be handle, but more than 10% could be make the company have problem (It's based speculation).",

Centralized solution is not safe too because \"not your keys not your coins\" and in worse case scenario - if users money are worth more than their reputation, in their opinion ... they will most likely take your money.Quote from: ryzaadit on October 12, 2022, 10:43:56 PMSo far \"Binance\" with SAFU.Binance is the best place I think. Just wanted to add that not everything available on binance is \"SAFU\". Binance has various staking products and part of them are provided by other companies. Its always worth to read TOS before trying anything.As I can see they splited binance earn to 2 sections:\"Principal ProtectedThe same number of tokens deposited to Savings and Staking will be returned to you along with yields paid out in the same type of token. See our Terms & Conditions and FAQs for more details.\"\"(High Yield) Higher Potential RewardsAn opportunity to receive higher than average gains but with corresponding risks to your invested cryptocurrencies. Only invest what you can afford to risk, regardless of how high the potential rates of return.\"",

Any suggestion for insurance against smart contract failure, hack, etc...?There is no safest place to stake stablecoins, and it can pay good returns but as far as I know, Binance is a good place, and you can get pretty good returns, especially if you stake a lot of stablecoins there. At least I tried it myself, but I don't stake too many stablecoins, but I use BNB as the main coin to stake.Also, staking stablecoins on Binance can be a way to increase your number of stablecoins, even if you have to wait a certain amount of time. But before you start, it's better to read the articles on Binance to know more about what to do.",

You can only find insurance feature on CEX like Binance and Kucoin but there’s a downside that you don’t have your private key. There insurance too is useless if the company loss is due to bankruptcy and not through hack. There’s is no 100% safe in crypto or even on real life banking yield offers.I highly recommend DeFi like Beefy instead of CEX because they offer a higher APY while it’s decentralized. You can have a assurance that you will still get back your tokens anytime.",

This is crypto and you can't think if crypto just like a bank that will give you more guarantee for your money. The risk will always there. That depends on you whether you have agreed with such condition or not. I meant you must also aware that if these days anything can happen with the platforms just like when it has been hacked by hackers. So, you must think for twice before try to stake your money. There are too many people who are looking into something that would be secure and trustworthy and they could still make some money. Unfortunately that doesn't exist, and they will be losing all of their money if they are not careful enough.This isn't something that could happen too rarely neither, they could lose their money all the time, at every corner of crypto there are people who are looking to make you lose money, and if you are not careful then you will be trusting them as secure place to invest and stake stablecoins, and you will never be able to withdraw it back. So only do it in places like Binance or similar, just to make sure it’s a place that doesn't need to scam you to be rich.",

The biggest risk is keeping it on an online exchange which is prone to hacks and you might get all your crypto stolen. Honestly now you are better off just keeping it in a savings account since the yields is higher than it is on a stablecoin right now. Those 10-20% APY lenders all went broke and many ended up losing all their savings. I don't recommend investing just for the yield. The reward is just not worth it.",

However, there is no place that can be the safest place to bet stablecoins or other coins because they have their own risks. Many people have used Binance as a place to bet a lot of coins and maybe they are satisfied with the results. So you can try staking stablecoins on Binance too.",

For staking, binance is probably the platform that many people will trust the most, it is also not completely safe but can be called the most reliable platform in the market.

It was then that I understood the extent of the risk involved in staking as some members have persistently warned against getting involved in it.

Centralized exchanges can also be hacked or worse, crash like Mt.gox and we still lose money. Once you have accepted to participate in cryptocurrency, you should think about the risks we face, there is no concept of absolute safety in cryptocurrency. But speaking of staking, binance is definitely the place we can trust the most, as it is the largest exchange today. We may feel safer placing our assets on it, compared to other less popular platforms.",

Don't try to find it all in one service, where everything will be better than others. They do not exist. If it's reliable and stable stablecoins staking pools you're looking for, then you need to go to Curve.
