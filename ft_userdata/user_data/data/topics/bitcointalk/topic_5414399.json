Unstable prices and a gradual decline in prices gets a large portion of bitcoin holders scared enough to sell off a large chunk of their assets. In these so called “trying times”, selling off assets are encouraged and people are inclined to sell because of the unstable and/or decline in prices.     I’m curious on your thoughts and opinions on how much bitcoin and/or fiat currency would be considered safe to hold in a bear market like the one we’re currently in.(eg:70% fiat and 30% bitcoin). Understandably, people would have different thoughts and opinions on how much is safe to hold cause income level varies among individuals.",

I only use fiat money to pay daily expense and for emergency funds if I needed in hurry, if Bitcoin continue to deeper, I will sell all of my gold and stock to convert it to Bitcoin. Because it doesn't make sense for me to hold fiat for long time, we're suffering of high inflation rate and even you hold for 4 years you wouldn't earn anything.In Bitcoin it's different and that's why I sold all to bought more Bitcoin.",

Personally I'm entirely into crypto and more specifically bitcoin, with the exception of the money I need for daily expenses, so I believe to have more than 90% in btc and less than 10% in fiat. If it's safe or not only time will tell. Life is full of uncertainties and sometimes you are surprised when you least expected in a negative or positive way. I hope to be surprised positively on this matter, with the permission of God, as soon as this bearish market is over.I mean, at least from bitcoin you can expect something futurely, while the same can't be said regards fiat.",

FIAT is what makes bankers happy and people miserable.Do you recommend this as a general rule for investors in bitcoin?Someone who had 90% of their worth in bitcoin before the market recent crash from the ATH would have lost over 60% of the value in a year, which could lead to serious financial crisis, especially if it is for a pressing need. Fiat losses its value as well, but bitcoin is much more volatile.I will recommend a more reserved amount of about 20-25% in bitcoin and an average of another 35-40% in other investments, and the rest in fiat.- Jay -",

Call it there and never touch it for ever again until the trend reverses. Of course Bitcoin holders would not think of selling off a large chunk during these times and usually the ones that do are those we call it - panic sellers and they are quite common in here. Back then I was like one of those sellers and I learned it the hard way.No point of selling of assets during these \"trying times\" you mentioned and it is even a bad idea. You know what they always say:QuoteSell high, buy low",

You're not being encouraged by anyone! You do what you want. What if Bitcoin was land and you bought it because you liked where it lies and thought holding it might be good for the future. Then suddenly some people came to you saying they'd buy it for half the price you paid for it because apparently the market price went down. Would you sell it to them? I sure wouldn't. The thing with investment is that you must have some money to live on and some that you invest. If you feel bad because the market is down and you still have enough money, step away from it. Do something you like, have some fun, come back in 6 months to check how things are.I currently hold more bitcoins than I had in November 2021 and whether I get a $100 or 2 from a signature campaign I add it to my portfolio. I've been doing the same thing in 2018 and 2019.Bear markets are better time for holding bitcoin than bull markets. In a bull market you should be selling and buying in a bear market. Unfortunately most people do the opposite which is why the world is full of poor people.",

Understandably, people would have different thoughts and opinions on how much is safe to hold cause income level varies among individuals. There's no definite answer to it as it solely depends on an individual's risk capacity. If someone has a stable income and a good amount of surplus money to invest, he might want to invest more into cryptocurrency in the bear market due to its volatility. I would personally do that if I have money. Because then I will be able to make a huge amount of profit during bull cycle. So it is really subjective and depends on the risk taking capacity of an individual. Also one thing we need to keep in mind that never put all your eggs in one basket. Diversification is the key and we must diversify out of crypto market. Your portfolio should include gold, bond, stocks, bank deposits etc. So when one asset goes down, you can have support from other assets.",

But as for the safety of your money, if you don't make any errors, it is certain.",
