  "content": "GM fam. If you do trade on an exchange, wanted to ask you about your favorite option so far.Last week I was discussing with some friends the benefits Binance offers: quick trading, minor crashes within each year, and also the liquidity it already has created over the years. They told me they preferred more risky options and not the classic ones. I regularly trade with [MT4 + Broker] tho. Just curious about how you think the in-exchange trading is evolving at the moment with this topic or news like the one I shared below [read today].Source: https://tokenist.com/binance-trading-volume-now-larger-than-the-next-13-biggest-exchanges-combined/",

But know that you will have to be fully verified in a way your identity document would be requested for. Which means KYC is mandatory. Have the rules changed? It used to seem like KYC was used as a condition for Withdrawing for larger amounts. Binance is their current largest exchange number one. So naturally their trading volume is large, and this benefits many traders due to the rapid changes. I think many traders choose echange because of various considerations. One of them is the convenience of security. Regarding KYC, I think some exchanges do that for security. In addition to regulation as well, because I believe exchanges also have risks from rules in a government. The most important thing is that they take good care of the document. Although we don't know it for sure.",

All Binance users have to get verified before any withdraw.Quote from: Luzin on September 21, 2022, 01:00:48 PMOne of them is the convenience of security.You mean convenience over security. Because exchanges are not considered to be secure and not advisable to have your money left on exchanges. Noncustodial wallet is better. Cold storage wallets are recommended.Quote from: Luzin on September 21, 2022, 01:00:48 PMRegarding KYC, I think some exchanges do that for security. No, not related to security at all. It is related to regulators enforcing them, just like the case of Binance. Regulators wants exchanges to follow AML and CTF rules. Quote from: Luzin on September 21, 2022, 01:00:48 PMThe most important thing is that they take good care of the document. Although we don't know it for sure.There are data breach on exchanges times without number now. The perfect way your data is safe, is to remain just to you. Once given out, hackers might possibly be able to get hold of it. Customers data can even be sold by the company to third party. They can even voluntarily give it out to third party.",

No doubt with Binance is most recommended exchange global market for trading exactly when giving access trade using local money pair, I saw each country have local pair for trading in Binance and make easy for withdrawing to our local money account without have to trade stable coin again.Quote from: Oshosondy on September 21, 2022, 08:40:39 AMNot bad to use Binance, but never leave coins on Binance or any other exchange.

I think that KYC think was a requirement for most account holder and it also has some limitation of how much worth of btc can be withdrawn at a time, I think probably 0.6 in btc or something close to that I can't remember clearly. But apart from that I don't have fears with Binance, so far I have not heard of issues although it is wise to go with caution, it still a centralized exchanged.",

Usually, cex isn't preferable, especially to holding funds and providing personal documents. Keep in mind, whether you use Binance or not for KYC reasons, you have to be ready always to provide KYC documents you use any centralized exchange. For cex, I have been using Binance for a long time and hadn't faced any issues yet. But don't hold any amount there unless you are trading for a long time.",

I’ve been trading before on MT4 and all I can say was it has a limited trading offer compared to binance that almost all financial feature are already there including savings and options which other broker don’t have.The current strict regulation on exchange right is still a good event to protect user for possible exit scam which is the typical cons of crypto exchange before since no one regulates them.

I guess Coinexchange has gone extinct now with Poloniex just there with less patronage. Even in 2017, Binance had little or no reputation as an exchange that just newly got on board but I took my chances with it. Glad I did. Fast forward to today, and from years of experience, I would rather trade on an exchange whose trust rating in high but trading activities are low as against one with low trust rating but a high trading volume. This is why Binance continues to remain my favourite platform till hate. It has both favourable trust score and huge trading activities.",

In any case it is still odd, because one of the things traders must be actively doing is to monitor and to reduce their risk as much as possible, as this is the only way to survive for long in the markets, so someone which is looking to increase their risk even further is someone that in my mind will lose all their capital sooner rather than later.",
