And you have to wait for some minutes or hours to be confirmed by the Miners.",

The first is to find someone who would do it face to face, which is of course risky, but in a public place if you judge that the person is \"normal\" it can be the best (cheapest) option.2. Another way is to use one of the DEXs (decentralized crypto exchanges), but payment to your bank account or any other payment processor may mean that your tax office may get access to this information at some point. -> https://kycnot.me/3. The third option would be to find a crypto ATM that does not have KYC, but you should know that this method is the most expensive because the fees are from 5% and up. -> https://coinatmradar.com/4. There are online sites that sell various things directly for BTC, so you can buy something and then sell it for cash. -> https://spending-bitcoin.com",

One thing you have to decide is how you want to receive fiat money in such a trade. If you expect payment to your bank account, then it doesn't make much sense to look for anonymous transaction methods other than P2P. If you expect an exchange for cash, then a meeting with the buyer in person is your only option.Id just say move slowly and don't take big risks.  There are ways to trade under the radar if you're smart.  But better be safe than sorry!",

But for some instance that there's no local exchange found in your country and the known exchanges won't support a withdrawal to your location, then they're right about finding a p2p market where you can sell those Bitcoins you've got on your electrum. Given the situation that you want to sell it anonymously, the choice of doing it on those platforms like bisq is one solution. You don't have much option at all since if your country banned Bitcoin, people are likely to cover themselves from being a holder of it if you try to go with your local p2p.",

Since you’re concerned about maintaining your privacy, it’s better you use a decentralized exchange like bisq to trade your bitcoins for fiat.

There are several options for exchanging Bitcoin. If you don't find a direct exchange, you can do a double exchange, which can certainly help you cash out your Bitcoins.
