However, to be able to launch something in the midst of a economical crisis, then it has to be something rather special, and make sure that it can withstand the different pressures right now. The thing is, running a business is actually extremely difficult at the best of times. Unless, you have a service or product that revolutionizes something or is just in the right time, and the right place; it'll be extremely difficult to do so. Although, having said that; Bitcoin offers a unique situation where not all services are available at the moment, and therefore you can sort of learn from the mistakes of popular fiat companies, and potentially create a service based of the successful ones. Honestly, a trustworthy way of paying for your rent or mortgages would be appreciated, but then most users here would rather withdraw their Bitcoin from an exchange, and just pay via a direct debit into their mortgage/rent.You're right though, there's an opportunity to be had not because of the current economical situation we find ourselves in, but the fact that Bitcoin still hasn't matured enough to have its commercial boom.",

But notwithstanding you can always say there is an opportunity for entrepreneurs to make the most of any situation, but it is not just as easy as saying it, starting a business can be pretty daunting, and the current global economic situation makes things even more difficult.I'd not agree that now is the right time to start a business from scratch, prolly people who already have businesses prior can seek ways to implement additional features that could help generate more capital for the sustenance and growth of their business, but to throw yourself in the mix of it all considering what the economic situation is, and with the already extant competition, you might be knocked out of business pretty quickly.",

Since, a lot of people don't pay themselves for the first year or so when starting a business. It entirely depends on the business obviously. If there's high demand for it, then you could get lucky. However, with some of the examples given in the original post, exchanges aren't cheap to just make, and no entrepreneur will have the bank roll for that or the trust required either.",

As a person of business one should always have back up plans A to Z so that one can tackle the situation like those mentioned in the OP. There are big companies and small companies as well who manage their business way advance with modern roadmaps. They always have plans on what to do if situation such as inflation / high interest rate occurs and to what level they can drop the revenue and still run the business in proper way possible. With the marking of inflation they will pull out smart moves and still keep business operations running as it is. Any company that is under managed will reach the doors of bankruptcy but not the one that I mentioned above.",

      "body": "The biggest difference compared to old times is that there used to be a lot more companies who would buy other companies that did badly. So if you owned a company that had any potential but no money, someone with money would come to you and pay you a small sum, allowed you to walk away with \"something\" instead of nothing, and you would say \"I sold my company\" instead of \"I bankrupted my company\" thanks to that person. Then they would takeover, fire thousands, sell assets, and make a profit out of it, or they could manage it better if they want to but that rarely happened. These ruthless takeovers are not being done now, because why spend your money making chump change when you can make that much with just bank interest, FED increasing rates caused companies to bankrupt more frequently. Thats not the only reason, but a pretty big one.",

Steve Nickles, a law professor at Wake Forest University, has already said that \"bankruptcies leave gaps for entrepreneurship.\" What do you think could be the opportunity is here for entrepreneurs?When general motors faced bankruptcy back around 2009, the acting CEO was asked to step down and was replaced by Ed Whitacre. Ed was tasked with restructuring the giant automaker to make it profitable once again. Ed Whitacre got rid of the GM private jet which could cost as much as $50,000 per flight. He reformed GM's corporate culture of excess and extravagant spending. Which was sometimes defined by company funds being used as a personal slush fund by corporate execs. The GM which emerged as a result, could sustain itself once again.To some extent, we might say the same negative precedents GM struggled with in 2009 have intensified more than a decade later. Leading to many billion dollar business ventures failing. It can be observed in the change in twitter policy from previous CEO Parag Agrawal to current acting CEO Elon Musk. The best and the brightest are usually not in positions of power. The janitor scrubbing floors, could potentially be more intelligent, resourceful and harder working than the CEO running the business. (Irony being what it is, there was a man with one of the highest IQ's ever measured who was actually a janitor.)Within the last 50 years, we have seen many small businesses succeed to become multi national billion dollar industries. The overwhelming majority of our progress and innovation is coming from the bottom, rather than the top. Perhaps the trend will continue, or accelerate? Or it could trend in the opposite direction. If anything is certain, it is that the majority of our failures and bankruptcies are stemming from the culture of excess and extravagance which defining a privileged upper class.",

Failure, especially on the scale of massive, national economic failure, leaves opportunities for new ventures to take hold in the market space that were previously unavailable.In short, yes. As entrepreneurs and business people in general, we need to look for opportunities even during troublesome times. In the process of moving forward, sometimes we are bound to come across some adversaries along the way. For me, I believe that a valuable lesson from the Chapter 11 experience is never stop pushing forward because of fear. If you do, you will miss out on countless opportunities in life.

This was definitely a seeding activity for the economic crash and start of inflation during that point. The factors which OP mentioned were not responsible for it, but they got initiated due to pandemic after effects. Excluding WAR situation others were definitely the reasons for same.  Now, when the War broke out it was aggregating factor because it involved one of the biggest supplier of oil which again is one of the crucial fuel to drive the economy world wide. In short everything was inter connected and it started that very chain reaction to make businesses go bankrupt.",

Most of the challenges that the world is facing now regarding sloggish economy is as a result of the COVID pandemic. It grind the major manufacturing countries of the world and that caused production to drop, the effect of which is scarcity of goods and services then the available will become very expensive to get, causing artificial increase in value. Before the covid year in 2020, the rate of inflation was not as double as it is now meaning COVID-19 challenges was attributory to the effect now, production and supply chains are not what they are used to.",

It was like there was a Domino effect that have happened. During the time FTX went bankrupt, the world have already recovered from Covid.We should not defend FTX but the reason why FTX got bankrupt is already given and that is because the founder is playing carelessly with his costumer's funds. He did trading, investing, gambling and then donating some of it to the governments without their customers' consent. Speaking of the governments, they can only order you to close your business if it's illegal but if not then maybe the owners close them due to the effects of the recession.",

Mismanagement of funds is but just a tip of reasons that can make a business fail or bankrupt. Poor managers with poor people skills, and an unchecked financial record that keeps track of expenses and investment, are among other reasons too. The FTX saga is purely the blame of the owners because they failed to realize that the customers money isn't theirs and didn't invest diligently. Am sure no regulatory body nor board members cautioned or interfered in how the owner used clients money, and this is one big lesson to learn from, because people learnt to pay closer attention to online investment and investors and governments enforced strict agencies and bodies to monitor huge businesses with customers money. I learnt from people's stories that while money comes and goes, it is always better to have financial discipline and knowledge of likely products or services to diversify once financiers begin to follow in bankrupt light.",
