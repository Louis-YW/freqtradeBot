      "body": "Risk is inevitable when dealing with cryptocurrencies. You can earn fractions of profit on your coins by staking your money at lending and exchanges platforms. The risk is that you might be scammed by the platform, like it happened with some companies this year. The most notorious one is Celsius lending company which scammed hundreds of thousands of investors in the whole world. Sadly there aren't any guarantees to prevent us from being under this kind of risk.",

The bear market started a few months ago and is currently down about 70% from the last ATH.and you ask how to make a small amount of crypto assets without risking anything, of course, it's quite difficult if you don't want to trade. The risk of trading is worth the payoff, and you should trade with trading knowledge. The risk of loss will occur if you only trade with your filling and not with trading knowledge. Earn a small amount of crypto without trading or risking your assets just by joining the airdrops and some of the bounty campaigns in this forum, and you have to be patient to get them.",

With the crypto's best feature like buying them in fraction you can actually start to fill up your wallets dollar by dollar and see them growing in the future terms. If you are not investor and do not want slightest risk to be taken then I would suggest you to work on the online earning sites which will pay you few cents to dollars per surveys or other side gigs and you can cash them out in various altcoins. You can also add various faucets including freebitcoin to boost your fractions.Â  However, go with the first advice because dont forget we are at flat discount!",

I am not considering trading because the risk of losing it all, any other ways? Well there is still the possibility to earn a few fractions of different crypto coins through a faucet for example. In this case you need to be aware though that you basically only get like a few cents per claim at most and in most cases you can only claim once every day or so. So even if you are claiming every day for like 100 days you only have a few dollars worth of cryptos. So you definitely will not get richt here even if we are seeing another bullrun in the future. If you really want to start from absolutely zero though then you can use those few bucks in a few months for your investment then and maybe with luck you can slowly but surely increase your portfolio value.",

Everything here is a risk, even if you stake some of your coins to earn, that is already a huge risk on your part.So I guess there's nothing like what you have describe, not risking your assets to earn small amounts of crypto. Possible if you join bounty and signature campaign, still up to you, but obviously, the bargain is that you will have to make more time in this community.And for me the best thing to do right now in this bear market is just to accumulate as much as you can and HODL, and then wait for the next bull run.",

I have been explained so well below. Try to staking is the best choice for now to avoid the volatility in the market. I think that mostly of people are doing staking for their stable tokens. Quote from: S3300 on November 03, 2022, 02:00:00 PMI am not considering trading because the risk of losing it all, any other ways? There are few ways that may make you feel interested to earn money without any riskStaking stable tokenFarming used stable tokensPlay to earn looking for job related with the cryptocurrencies. Those things are having low risk if you are doing it. I guess since you didn't wanna try to trade and then you may always avoid to deal with everything that can make you lose your moneyThe best way for you is trying to staking + doing play to earn mechanism. You can earn passive income combined with active income from doing play to earn. Some games were offering free play to earn mechanism.",

You later use that link to create your second account which will be used to trade daily. You have to trade safely enough to close your positions with draw results at least.

We are already in a bear market for a long and the current market behavior seems now in the balanced phase where corrections end. It's just that we are now waiting on some factors to trigger the possible bull run but we shouldn't rush on that.Just do our usual, buy low sell high. Even with the current price trend, impossible that there's no such price swing will happen on the way. We just need to think of a strategy that we can use in different market scenarios. If the goal is just to accumulate, then anyone can consider doing a DCA or just buy regadless of the price.",

I am not considering trading because the risk of losing it all, any other ways? I believe that there is no need to look for magical ways to earn money, and in the case of cryptocurrencies, this rule also applies. Do you want to earn? Offer a service or product that others need. There is nothing surprising in this. It doesn't matter what currency you get rewarded in, be it traditional or cryptocurrencies. Would you like to accumulate your crypto every day? Then take payment in crypto or convert ordinary money into them. In this case, you don't risk your assets.If you want to increase your assets by investing them, then the risks already begin here. Therefore, you will have to choose what to sacrifice and for what.",

If you want to start from zero we have airdrop, bounties, testnet and join the AMA to get the reward it's not too big but at least it will be several times the faucet reward. To go even faster, I think he should find an outside job and just work hard for a few months, he will earn a considerable amount of money to start investing.",

If you are trying to point to staking pools, I dont think they are worth putting your money in.Investing in a casino's bankroll is what I could suggest provided that casino has a long term reputation and you are willing to risk that money on that casino even in cases of hacks and cheating/exploit users. Because the casino always wins, it is like keeping money in a bank savings account and you get a decent percentage interest if you are keeping it in for years.Beside that you would want to trade, not on altcoins but on bitcoin - trading will be giving you chunks of money at erratic intervals, depending on markets.",

I am not considering trading because the risk of losing it all, any other ways? Actually, the bear market has not just started but started a few months ago and we have been feeling the effects for a long time. Many new coins or tokens are still unable to adapt to the bear market, especially Bitcoin which continues to fluctuate sometimes very drastically.Regarding expecting crypto income but not wanting to risk our assets, it means we just want to get coins or tokens for free, right? If so, we may not be optimal because we really have to see new projects that launch various programs such as signature campaigns or other bounty campaigns, airdrops, referrals, and other promotions. But of course, this will not be easy to get valuable results. We could say, high risks, high return probability. If we don't want to take risks, we will also get modest results, although sometimes they may be unexpected. But, if we are taking risks with our assets, we must be also ready for every probability that may happen to our assets. That is why here we have asset and risk management.",
