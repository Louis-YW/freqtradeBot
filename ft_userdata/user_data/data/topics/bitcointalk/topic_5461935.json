      "body": "Know that if bitcoin price fall, it is another opportunity for many people to buy. The greatest asset of all time which is gold which is the largest asset in marketcap still have time that it will fall and a time that it would increase. Although gold is not as volatile as bitcoin which can be related to higher marketcap. Bitcoin marketcap is lower than what it would have been in many years from now.Quote from: Kodec5 on August 03, 2023, 11:11:06 AMAbeg make we come talk am wetin we fit do wey go make bitcoin more popular wey be say e fit pass down to our coming generationOnly what is need is the adoption, as it goes on, more people will invest in bitcoin. The fiat is getting devalued, this will also encourage people to continue to invest in bitcoin.It is also worth knowing that Nigeria is among the fist 10 countries with the highest bitcoin adoption. Nigeria ranks among top 10 countries in crypto adoption globally – Report It is also worth knowing that the more the marketcap and adoption, the less likely the volatility.",

      "body": "With massive adoption of bitcoin, it will surely be there for our generation because so many investors have seen that bitcoin is superior to fiat currency in terms of inflation. So they have started using it as a store of value to save their money from depreciation. Bitcoin has good potential and I don't think that anything can bring the price to zero. If the price of bitcoin dumps,this is how it is designed because the price of bitcoin is being controlled by demand and supply. Imagine gold had been existing since ancient of days because of its value,I believe that this is how bitcoin too will survive due to its high value and high volatile nature.",

Considering the merits of lightning network in our next generation one of which transactions would be validated in millisecond.I think Bitcoin adoption would be passed to generations to come.",

      "body": "Bitcoin is not for one person alone, and Bitcoin is not for everyone. The reason why I said Bitcoin is not for everyone is because, In the population of Nigeria or other countries, not every citizen will agree to accept or adopt Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a blockchain-based technology, and not everyone can accept or believe in that technology, but that doesn't mean that some people will not still believe in it and can also convince others to do so. The way some people believe more in real estate and would convince some of their fellows to do so, that's also how some Bitcoin investors in the country would believe in Bitcoin and could also convince some of their fellows to do so as well. Everybody has the choice of their investment; real East investment is not as volatile as Bitcoin investment that's why some people like it that way because they believe it provides them with minimal risk compared to Bitcoin.",
