But I don't know what you're thinking right now if that's the case, because I personally when I'm short on money always look for more solutions to earn money through work that I can do. That's all and never thought about printing money myself, robbing or the like, because basically I prefer to make money comfortably and safely.QuoteIf we central Banks don't start again then we gona create our own money with crypto or Simple using Stable coins created by communities.It won't be a problem if you are able to generate and use it for your own needs, because in some places in the world they still don't accept payments for goods using stable coins. But if at your place or in your surroundings there is someone who wants to accept payments via stable coins, that's really extraordinary because it will make it very easy for you. Especially if you yourself can continue to generate and collect more stable coins.QuoteIf we dont do that we gona suffering problems coused by shortages of money.Now do it if that's what you need and by doing that you can avoid the problem of lack of money that you mean.",

      "body": "If a stable coin does not depeg, it has the price of the fiat it is pegged with. Example is USDT, USDC and TUSD that is pegged with United States dollars. If you want to have those coins, you will need to buy with fiat, something valuable or work for it and be paid in one way or the other. There is nothing changed than for you to look for ways to earn money.",
