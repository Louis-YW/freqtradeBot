Coz you can try Apex legends, CS 2 and PUBG Battlegrounds.",

I know Apex Legends, CS2, PUBG and other FPS games but I fell in love with the COD franchise.I have started my games through the good versions of it but not too expensive to buy. So, you got the idea on which games I have started to play but I also max out the discounts if ever Steam is on sale as long as I can afford to buy one.",
