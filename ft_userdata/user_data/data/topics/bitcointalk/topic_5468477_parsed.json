  "content": "As you were reading and commenting on my previous post, few of them even accused me asking the casino $1,000,000 .00 . All of the pm paid users by the casino little didnt know that i asked them either supervisor or 1,000,000.00 as stake support was not responding to my chats properly, as 3 of the agents on chat gave me he information of bet which i placed with 2 mines as 11 mines. ( later on stake.com deleted the chat citing on it was editorial error ) . 1. 1,000,000$ allegation  First thing first , I asked the casino to bring the supervisor online or pay me $1,000,000.00 as few of the agents were just revolving the chat ticket in themselves and informed me they cannot transfer it to supervisor. they are basically parrots citing example of few of the complaints given by other people. http://[url=https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.talkimg.com%2Fimages%2F2023%2F07%2F29%2FQ5G13.png&t=654&c=CaxYQ9GaR9wR2w]https://ip.bitcointalk.org/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.talkimg.com%2Fimages%2F2023%2F07%2F29%2FQ5G13.png&t=654&c=CaxYQ9GaR9wR2w[/url]https://drive.google.com/file/d/12ACNupL6oKhtFJumN0DHA9LRRZWvCDLU/view?usp=drivesdkyou can see here , what i have written and what i have asked. so especially stake.com touts top spreading rumor. 2. support agent informing true odds placed in background. when i aseked 3 support agents and supervisors including for bet id 167247337064 , they all stated thet the bets were placed with 11 mines, while i recorded and have a screenshot of the bet with 2 mines.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tno2UEOj1XTLQkeQaD8BuKyU36gID7LF/view?usp=drivesdkthis contains the original bet which i placedand below is the screenshot if the support agent informing the bet was placed with 11 mineshttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1JwEGLHbeNldv2iAradCjjI94bR-HmHqv/view?usp=drivesdkhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1ec3WV4xaN90LqvaYKAuUTIeunO7z2RF6/view?usp=drivesdk. from this day i came to know that the backedn the bets are regustered as irregular odds. and even thiugh if the bets are archived i made a mandate for huge losses and small losses i will try to pull out the file 3. for deleted or archive bets, two different iterations.   In a casino , you have a unique bet id and especially for games mines is bet id later your hashed seed and the nonce remains the same. stake.com deletes the bet in the system and archive the dynamic format to a simple text format, so in my enquiry i gave casino guru two entry of hashes ( actually i send them the file , both the iteration of the bets were picked up casino.guru and stake.com ) .Here casino guru, didnt picked up the format but in order to deceive its readers gave an example out in public of my max winning on multiplier in order to cover up for stake.comthe question of iterations were as followsa.

[/size]https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KjyXgG3R0ia53K_yDR9LW1ev5Lhdi9ds/view?usp=drivesdkhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1xBPwwEKJ-kXyv0SX-sfCpiybzo80jRPR/view?usp=drivesdkcoincidentally the very first screenshot link consist of a screenshot of trustpilot and evidentally and out of behaviour pattern they did the same with which they did with eric whoses screenshot i had send.nothing as coincidence , just a cover up to earn business and payout using affiliates commission.i gave them all the proof , but they send me things via email , we have resolved more than 8000 complaints. 6. Casino guru being the exofficio spokeperson for the casino .  [/size]when the casino tried stop responding and askd the ticket to be clocsed, despite me asking them to compare the iteration registered of the deleted the bet Matej from Casino.guru stated that techsupport@stake.com responds to them in 34 minutes.while i send them screenshot and attched on casino.guru website. its been more than 20 days they never reply via email . 7 .things got worse , when casino guru asked me to use a third party verification tool.[/u] [/size]when i insisted the mediators CG to compare the iterations and explain , again they started bullshitting business and trying to deceive readers by throwing more extra information and creating a gimmick to shiw that casino is geniune and trying to oinch in few extra topic. out of frustration Matej from CG told me to use third party verification of bets provablyfair.me i let him provablyfair.me is a tool developed by people who are running the website .stake.com ceo and mebit founders are the same person. infact stake.com whole support team is employed on payroll of mebit.if you go to mebit.io you can see their details.so basically provablyfair.me belongs to stake.com and cannot be trusted as there is an api which shows you the result.https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlB-4-XxNNvS1FwBRmO9DGYt9LZYtEv2/view?usp=drivesdk8. There cannot be any proper verifcation of Mines , as the result you are seeing its totally manipulated. If you check on stake.com under calculation of mines you will find just a single paragraph written(check the screenshot).https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Z7SyS-VPjnoWGgHflUhoDEB7hqRE9_6you can check just few lines no code.if there was transperancy, they would provided opensource verfier in angular js so that each n very could be verified properly.But they wont  Because you dont make billions without cheating millions of people. [/u] [/size]9. At this statement , i was 100 percent confident as stake.com and casino.guru is colluding. [/u] After the fact, Matej from casino was not ready to compare the iteration and give me explanation. he was not ready to accept the fact provablyfair.me belongs to stake.com and is not a third party verification tool.when i informed him , that stake.com former partner has filed a law suit against the current partners of stake.com l he was in denial is not accepting the fact. by this I came to know these online casino have affiliate policy regarding their affiliate earning by casino.guru .Casino.guru acts as reputation repair PR FIRM , who gets money through affilaites to cover ul such things from the casino. they are basically a marketing and PR fim.below the document attched with media link of freeman vs stake.comhttps://casetext.com/case/freeman-v-stakecom-1#:~:text=Freeman%27s%20Complaint%2Dwhich%20reads%20not,than%20a%20billion%20dollars%2C%20and%2C of all the lies casino.guru had told me this is the best of lies , as by this I conculde that bith the companies are colluding to generate revenue and scam people  [/size] [/b][/u] Conclusion and some of the facts from posting on casino.guru about stake.com mines manipulation [/u] 1.stake.com is a cheat website registered in Curcao and operating from Australia and support running from Slovakia . Alone promoting the Gambling in Australia it has tend to broke how many laws , i am not even aware of.  2. stake.com cofounder edward craven father is convicted felon in 1992 australian stock market scam and its a family business of scamming money from people since 1992 , when edward was inside his father. you can google it. As its true. You cant make Billions, without scamming a few millions of people.   3.so called endorsed third party verification website provablyfair.me belongs to ceo of stake.com . if you can go to mebit.io you would come to know the details about it.Hence all the result you are viewing its totally manipulated and they have open in a new website with old domain name in krder to verify the bets. no open source verifcation as of in  4. No calculation is given out for mines in thier Result generation system , hence it impossible for any third party website to verify it. A part from that they have disabled their api where you coukd have stored many bets in the system.   5. stake.com a scamming company bsed in Curcao where there is no proper gambling authority.   6. Casino.guru is basically affiliate through money making company which charges the casino to basically handle the damage and the PR , thus by maintaining the casino reputation and getting comission on behalf of that.  7. By compairing the iteration on Point 3 itself you can verify that bets registered in the casino is diiferent as bets played in the system. If any questions , are there regarding the conculsion , you can let me know . But touts of stake.com , and casino.guru would not be entertained. enough of lying deceiving stake.com and casino.guru.Donation link:Bitcoin: BTC3FWVjyadavXYFFVk84tAzfVJvHGzAPPRET[BEP20]0xD839A45Eb55fEdC2951B1A4AeF573b58360ee79DEthereum:[ERC20]0x78a9bB018Aa8E5D24E43afb7394FDd342364Adad[BEP20]0xD839A45Eb55fEdC2951B1A4AeF573b58360ee79DTRON :[Trc20]TSg3zFyhTX3BMQiaYki9FcgWR3z26qLktKUSDT:[Trc20]TSg3zFyhTX3BMQiaYki9FcgWR3z26qLktK[BEP20]0xD839A45Eb55fEdC2951B1A4AeF573b58360ee79D[SOLANA]udGPBEhaBNpbDnmwU55RaMW8UqXCkMQGrCQRBhYgwMW[ERC20]0x78a9bB018Aa8E5D24E43afb7394FDd342364Adad",

I don't believe CG is an honest source on cases against stake. Good luck on your mission, however I see you got no supporters here, maybe it's time to stop swearing at people and change your tone?

You should change that. Secondly, I also believe CG works for stake.com . They ran my case to downhill where I was %100 right with proof. I don't believe CG is an honest source on cases against stake. Good luck on your mission, however I see you got no supporters here, maybe it's time to stop swearing at people and change your tone? Who knows, maybe you will get more help. I don't even understand why are you disputing? how do you want me to explain you this.stake.com deletes the bet id in daily basis and therby stores them in a archive file in a text format if you play regularly citing issues related to storage these dynamic bets are translated into single iteration code and stored in the system. you can check under transactions > betarchive download the text. this is something which is automated system, and the iteration in the system registered gives a different explanation to that. please read the Point number 3 from above , where i compared and explain the two iteration. the first iteration gives the correct response, while the second iteration shows the odds of 2 mines , clearly have entry if having more than 2 odds. under point 2 , 3 agent from chat support informed me about the odds registered in backend for a game i played with 2 mines registered as 11. from here i got to know the system how they manipulate.",

Then I'll just quietly drop this screenshot of your video here, showing you ask to bury the casehttps://www.talkimg.com/images/2023/08/07/GkZto.jpeg.Shall we also talk about how you fabricated an email from interpol regarding stake? And weren't you a lawyer? Couldn't they get their license revoked for falsifying evidence? Or were the laywer statement is also just a... means to threaten them?https://talkimg.com/images/2023/09/29/P3aUP.jpegso you accept the fact there is something to bury for the, , hence you sre quoting this point to me , bringing in guilt.

CG lied about the lawsuit of 580 $ by cristopher freeman on stake.com so basically they were trying to coverup for stake.com.the problem with some people and CG they dont investigate they just specualte.and when talked abut basics, they go in loops . in point 3 iteration 2 there were 2 iteration for the archives mines game.the first ine had 2 mines and game ended when i clicked the bomb.in second iteration it shiws 2 mines and i opened more than 11 bombs, hows that even possible on a mines game of 2 bombs.clearly its manipualting hence they archive the bets. but still clearly some people and CG fail the basic common sense just to compare the iteration.holydarkness. i welcome all your question, but it should be only post releated and infact the topiccof concern should be stake.com registering the bets in backend with manipulated odds , a part from that concern you will bring all the stupidest concern , then you should be thinking of qualitative reasoning skill adpat this in your life style.FYI , those two iterations were picked up CG and stake.com when i send them the archive file. i am just explaning how two iteration of same odds of a mine game are different. if you cant compare the difference between the two iteration let me know",

BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT I ALREADY FAILED with the 1st one as mines positions are 0,24,9This means if i play with 1 mine at that particular game, the mine would be at field 0 if i will play with 2 mines it would be 1st mine at field 0 , 2nd mine at field 24,if i will play with 3 mines it would be 1st mine at field 0, 2nd mine at field 24 , 3rd mine at field 9and so on (positions and the order of mines you can verify via the tool that STAKE or I have provided to you, i\"ve shared the URL where you can just copy and past the code already. (https://www.w3schools.com/php/phptryit.asp?filename=tryphp_compiler)).SO TO VERIFY IF THE GAMES WAS CORRECT WE ONLY NEED TO KNOW MINES POSITIONS AND THE POSITIONS WHICH WE OPENED/CLICKED AND IT SHOULD BE ORDERED BY THE FIELD ID WHICH WAS CLICKED OR SELECTED 1st,2nd,3rd etc..I'm a bit concerns based on your replays/analysis that you are not even sure how the game of mines works and how it generates the outcome for each game. You have found some different iteration for 2 games, which AS I ALREADY EXPLAINED, DOES NOT MATTER. IF ORDER OF MINES AND ORDER OF FIELDS OPENED ARE EQUAL TO YOUR ACTUALL RECORDED GAMEPLAY IT MEANS THERE IS NOTHING RIGGED/MANIPULATED as you suggesting.",
