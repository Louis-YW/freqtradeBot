Take Care,Yasuke NakamotoOh a Nakamoto but their Yasuke! I think you should go back playing your Ogame and let bitcoin be. It's better for everyone. You just invented something out of thin air, in order to do that, the entire bitcoin community should agree on the new valid chain which would mean the entire bitcoin community are criminals stealing bitcoins and cheating, that doesn't make sense. And if the entire community (consensus) is not on agreement, a fork will happen rendering the new cheating chain a total shitcoin like bch bsv etc.ðŸ˜‰",
