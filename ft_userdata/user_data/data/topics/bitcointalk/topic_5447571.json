No longer exists!I'm not sure, but between 2015 and 2017 there was some involvement on the part of the administration in managing communication platforms other than Bitcointalk. But, in 2017 they decided that this would no longer make sense and so they stopped using other social networks. I am not now sure of the dates and all the details.Personally I think it's good, since the forum is already a means of communication, it doesn't need other means for this purpose.",

It's not so active, but you will find some Bitcointalk members there as well.Check this replyMy bad, never mind.",
