  "content": "My friend just bought some crypto coin.  The pc screen shows a display about her investment and there's a column there called 'margin' and it has a value in it. What is that all about?  She couldn't have been tricked into buying on margin at all could she? Are there dangers to be watched out for with these bitcoin setups?p.s. it was't 'bitcoin' as such. it was a crypto currency I don't know which one.  Is it okay for me to ask such questions here ?",

      "body": "maybe its as you saidit might also be that the site logged her purchase. and is comparing the purchase price to the price today and is displaying the +/- profit or loss of that purchasewhere its just an indicator of if she is at a gain or loss if selling today. and not an account balance or anything to worry about if not interested in selling todayonly way to know for sure is ask your friend to(which the should have done before purchase) research the site they use and find out what they are using the term margin in regards with",

      "body": "its ok to ask questions. but without you knowing the basics its not as helpful to then help youEG if u knew the site she used. we could have looked up the glossary of terms page of terms of service to help work out what \"margin\" meanton balance of utility.. there are many websites that just use the word as a estimator of profit or loss if the user was to sell at that moment comparing to their purchase pricewhere as the so called \"buying on margin\"(loan) they prefer to use \"leverage\" or \"shorting\" as the termso odds are its just a profit estimator if that person was to sell today and nothing to worry aboutbut without knowing the site you speak of we cant be sure (as a very few silly sites are badly translated or coded by someone that doesnt know the best economic words to use)",

Seems to likely be the case, unfortunately. This is why exchanges should always display a sort of \"normie mode\" by default, like how Coinbase has the very simple buy/sell button; whereas the more experienced users can opt in for the \"pro\" mode.",

Assuming you have $100, you can use it to borrow depending on the leverage you used. Assuming you have $100 and go for 3x, you will have $300 to trade, but there are an amount of money that you will pay after you finish trading with the money borrowed.On all the exchanges that I gave used, you can be able to know the amount of coins you have on all your accounts on your exchange account, like main, trading, future and earning account. This can be done when you click on wallet or asset on the exchange, depending on the exchange you are using. Quote from: abrogard on February 02, 2023, 01:08:38 AMWhat is that all about?  She couldn't have been tricked into buying on margin at all could she?Which exchange is that? No exchange reputable exchange will let you unknowingly make use of margin trading, even you will have to transfer your asset from your spot or trading account into a margin account.",
