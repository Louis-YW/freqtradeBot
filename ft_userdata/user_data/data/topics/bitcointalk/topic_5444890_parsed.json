  "content": "csgo500.com banned my account and seized my money (1000$ deposit). I registered on their service few days ago with a view to placing esports bets. I placed some singles and combo bets, none of these bets were any league niche. Meanwhile I tried to verifi my profile to increase limits, but I got error while appling it however I never had any account in their service. Today I contacted live chat because there was error that did not allow me to place any bet, and there is what I was told- hellowhy i can not place any bets?\"Hello,The account you're contacting us about has been permanently banned for violating our Terms of Services.You will no longer receive any replies regarding that.\"I asked what is the reason and if I can get my deposit back but they just ignored me.This is insane that this casino can randomly reject player by banning his account and seize whole balance.The amount seized by csgo500 is huge for me that why I'm posing this thread to warn others against this scam service.EDITCSGO500 allowed me to withdraw my deposit, my winnings are forfeited but it's a fair move on their part.THEY ARE HONEST AND LEGIT SERVICE",

Well maybe it was a mistake to deposit there 1k, however their advertisement made them very legit in my eyes.Are they active on this forum maybe?",

Regardless of the fact that you claim that you use the same documents elsewhere, maybe those \"others\" are not good enough at discovering such things. In my opinion, this whole approach deposit -> game -> KYC is completely wrong, because it should be the other way around. Imagine how much time would be saved if you were caught before you even managed to make a deposit?",

Cause it can't be fair enough. Because you told me you have not created a multi-account and you have provided the document they requested. Then my question is if you are right then:1. Why they will ban your account? and2. Why they will collapse the winning of you?",
