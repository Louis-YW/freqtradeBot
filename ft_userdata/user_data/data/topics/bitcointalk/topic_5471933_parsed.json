  "content": "Alik BahshiTwo States for Two PeoplesIn 1947, the United Nations General Assembly decided to create two states in the mandated territory of Palestine, administered by Great Britain, one Jewish and one Arab, whose borders are shown on the map. On May 14, 1948, the Jewish state was proclaimed, and the goal of the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, who wrote in 1896 that the \"Jewish question\" could only be solved through the creation of a Jewish state, was achieved. At the heart of his \"Jewish question\" is the postulate: \"The nations among which Jews live are all covertly or openly anti-Semitic.\"In this regard, Herzl believed that the Jews should be given the opportunity to establish a nation-state somewhere. As a territory for the Jewish state, Herzl proposed Cyprus or the Sinai Peninsula. The search for a place for a national Jewish state continued for many years. Various options have been put forward: in Poland, in the Russian Empire in the Pale of Settlement, in British Guinea, in Argentina, in Australia on the island of Tasmania, and even in America in Alaska. It should be noted that Crimea was also considered in this regard. For example, on February 15, 1944, the leaders of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, Mikhoels, Fefer, and Epstein, wrote a letter to Stalin on the subject of creating a Jewish Autonomous Republic in the Crimea. It is the republics, not the regions. It may well be that this was one of the reasons for the hasty deportation of the Crimean Tatars as the indigenous population of the Crimea on May 18-20, 1944. Stalin hesitated for a long time with an answer, and in the end, when he no longer needed the help of American Jews, he shot the entire anti-fascist committee in its entirety. (1) It should be noted that Stalin put a lot of effort into the establishment of Israel, and rather in spite of Great Britain, and also in the hope that the Jewish state would become socialist, given Ben Gurion's commitment to socialism.Be that as it may, but fate decreed the best. The European Holocaust convinced the Jews of the world to be faithful to the ideology of Zionism, to the creation of a state for the Jews. The Jewish state was, I would say, re-established 3,300 years later on the territory where King Solomon's kingdom was located. However, strictly according to historical facts, the Jews have more rights to Egypt than the Arabs living in it, since the Jews as a people came out of Egypt when there were no Arabs there at all. (2) The determination of the Jewish people was rewarded, but for the Arabs who had lived in Palestine since 632, the date of the establishment of the Arab Caliphate, the event was a complete surprise and had a tragic consequence:- about 5 million Palestinian refugees scattered in the surrounding countries and the loss of territory: Because of Israel's settlement activities, there is virtually nothing left of the territory intended for the Arab state. The Palestinian population was under apartheid, behind a concrete wall and a barbed-wire fence, and was a cheap labour force for the Israeli economy. There is a constant quiet seizure of territory for the Jewish state, which makes the Arabs of Palestine angry.In spite of the totally disparate values of both casualties and means of warfare, the state of war is expressed in the endless terrorist attacks and attacks against Israel.The Middle East Arab-Israeli conflict, which has claimed thousands of lives on both sides, is celebrating, so to speak, its 75th anniversary, with no end in sight. This is not to say that efforts were not made to put an end to the bloody confrontation. In 1991, the Madrid Peace Conference was held under the auspices of the United States, which began the so-called peace process (3), which by 1994 was marked by the \"Oslo Accords\" between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which caused a sharp rejection of Israel by the right-wing camp. As a result, the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. (4) After the political assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the process of peace negotiations, which had begun with such difficulty, thanks primarily to the policy of the White House, came to an impasse, from which the Palestinians found a way out in war. In war, which has become an attribute, or rather a way of life, and of death, so to speak, because violent premature death is a common occurrence in the life of both the autonomy and Israel. The threat of death does not stop the Arabs of Gaza from launching Qassama missiles towards nearby Israeli cities. Unable to prevent the shelling, the Israeli army acts on the principle of revenge in response to terrorist attacks and rocket attacks, which, in principle, as reality shows, does not change the situation.In 2002, Saudi Arabia came up with a peace initiative:– all Arab countries recognize the State of Israel, – Israel liberates the occupied territories, does not prevent the return of Palestinian refugees,East Jerusalem receives the status of the capital of Palestine.Even the leader of the Israeli right, former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, acknowledged the occupation.Israel's rejection of the Saudi Peace Initiative, which is a reflection of the two-State solution, has led to the radicalization of the Palestinian community and the rise to power of Hamas, whose leaders see in the endless peace process only the continuation of the occupation and apartheid against their people, because the conditions created by Israel in the occupied territory of a failed state for the Arabs of Palestine are anything other than reservations. You can't name it. The population of the Territories is beginning to lose hope in the reality of the changes promised by the treaty. It turns out, as the Palestinians imagine, that the leaders of Hamas are right when they call for a boycott of all dialogue and assert that only the destruction of Israel as a state will solve the Palestinian problem.In my opinion, the UN made its main mistake in 1947 by creating two states on the territory of Palestine for two peoples - a Jewish and an Arab state, without first ensuring their security by the introduction of UN troops on the border of partition. Taking into account that the Ashkenazi Jews, who represented the people of Israel at that time, and the Arabs are so different in terms of mentality, culture, faith, and level of civilization, it was possible to foresee their confrontation, which resulted in an endless bloody war.The UN must correct its mistake, otherwise there will be no peace in the Middle East.

Or rather, you need to be part of the branches of a Special Tree to be entitled to the land. There are Two Trees on Earth, one is Tree of life... The other you may call a wild tree or tree of death . If you are part of the Tree of Life, you must not deviate from its root or the foundation as you grow from it as a branch otherwise you will cut off and be joined to the wild tree (the world's system). The Tree of life grew from the Word of GOD... anything attached to it must be according to the Word otherwise it will be cut off. You continue to grow from the tree as Jew as long as you grow according to the direction the branches should grow. The branches that are stuck in the old ways or traditions are cut off. The new way is the way of our MESSIAH JESUS CHRIST Nevertheless , those who follow the Jewish faith/religion are more entitled to the land than non-followers whose religion are not founded on the Word of the CREATOR. The Jewish religion is the old way. They were promised the New, which won't deviate from the Word of the CREATOR, but not all of them accepted it when it came to them.",

But they think that the Jesus of the New Testament is not the Messiah.What does Jesus say about this kind of double thinking? Revelation 3:14-18:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/3.htm14“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:These are the words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the ruler of God’s creation. 15I know your deeds, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were either one or the other! 16So, because you are lukewarm—neither hot nor cold—I am about to spit you out of my mouth. 17You say, ‘I am rich; I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing.’ But you do not realize that you are wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked. 18I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich; and white clothes to wear, so you can cover your shameful nakedness; and salve to put on your eyes, so you can see.However, this goes for all Christians, as well. Which of the Christians follow their beliefs as strongly as the religiously-minded people of Israel. So, fill yourself on the Word, so that you know the way to believe and live... Jesus, the Savior. Ephesians 4:9-13:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/niv/ephesians/4.htm9(What does “he ascended” mean except that he also descended to the lower, earthly regions? 10He who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens, in order to fill the whole universe.) 11So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, 12to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up 13until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.",

In addition, it is difficult to break Christian training if you were brought up in it. Also, even Satan acts with and uses the power of God that God gave him, just to live if nothing else (Ezekiel 28).Good things were brought into being by Jesus, but some of those things came through unbelievers. Look at all the marvels of science unbelievers do. There is  place in Isaiah where it is directly said that God/Jesus makes all the things that are done among people.The authority of the Church is given to all Christians (see the churches near the beginning of Revelation). But, even the apostles had to use it correctly because Solomon says, Proverbs 26:2:Quote from: https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-2.htmLike a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.The fruit that God is looking for from Christians is, the fruit of finding other people for salvation. What I mean is, when someone gives up his life through great torment to save somebody, he must really want salvation for that other person.",

      "body": "Like most problems, this one is an artifact of the United Nations.  In this case they 'gave' 60% of the land to 30% of the people back in the 1940's in the 'creation of Israel'.  Anyone with a brain can see a problem there.I'm a big proponent of a 'homeland for the Jews', or people who wish to identify as such.  The alternative is worse.  But things have to be fair in a natural law sort of way or any lasting peace will not be likely.  I would say to start over apportioning the pre-1948 'Palestine mandate' lands, but this time do if fairly.  Might as well do it like the game of risk where areas are chosen by the primary parties turn-by-turn, then later horse-traded.For people who don't think that there would be 'enough land for the Jews', I would point to Singapore which is a thriving and powerful city-state.  They got that way by limiting internal corruption, and not being obnoxious and dangerous neighbors to the surrounding countries.  In principle Israel could do the same, and they have the added advantage of having die-hard Israel-first nationalists/supremacists parasitizing many first-world nation's economies and running many first-world country's entire governments.  Maybe that will change when Israel uses biological weapons on the people who remain in Gaza after the bombings in order to affect a more complete ethnic cleansing (cuz they are not likely to dare put Jewish boots into Gaza.)  Maybe not.  We'll see.As people dig a little deeper into the Talmud that modern Jews use as a moral compass and realize that ethnic cleansing is, if anything, a duty (aka, 'positive mitzvah' or whatever), they may look at the influences closer to home with a little more discernment.  The current Gaza ethnic cleansing does seem to be getting more people to do a little more analysis.At the end of the day, 'he who has the money makes the rules', and he who makes the money has the money in whatever quantity they desire.  Today and for the last few hundreds of years this power has been in the hands of Satanist types who 'call themselves Jews' and thrive on war, misery, and death.  The shape of the future will be defined by what monetary solutions form up after the current one implodes.  I don't think I've mentioned it for a number of years, but I like crypto-currency because it is _weak_.  A crypto only as strong as the public confidence in how it is used.  One can obtain 90% of the 21x10^6 BTC, but if they use their influence improperly people could just turn their backs on it and make it worthless tomorrow.",

Attacking violently to Israel would only accelerate the destruction of what is left of Palestine. So what is the solution? I am not sure, the only certain thing I can point out to is the fact Palestine counts with much support within the West from left political organizations and politicians who serve as lobbyist for the Palestine people (not Hamas). If there was a way for them to leverage on that support and completely isolate themselves from those terrorist organizations, then it could turn into a game changer in favor of them. Unfortunately, it is quite obvious Hamas and other terrorist organizations are not willing to distance themselves from Palestine civilians, they need more future combatants and collaborators.",
