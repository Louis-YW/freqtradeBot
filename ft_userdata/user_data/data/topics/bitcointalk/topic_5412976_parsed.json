  "content": "Long Live the King!!!!!!Nobody wants to lose his mother to death, especially if that woman influences him positively. A mother’s love cannot be compared to the love of a spouse. She still sees you as that child she gave birth to and raised in love. Even when fathers abandon babies or children, a good mother would never forsake her child. Good mothers are the best advisers, although you need to think through them. In Africa, a mother can discipline his child regardless of his age. Even in my thirties my mother still slaps, when she is gravely angry, and African culture approves of it. They serve as a control to our excesses. The Queen was a good mother to Prince Charles. She always protected him and Prince Charles was well raised by the Queen. This news is a bitter one for the current King.But the truth is everybody wants to grow. We want to make an impact and contribute our own quota to history. Prince Charles also wanted to be King. His mother has lived a long and productive life. Prince Charles cannot deny that he had never thought of or wished to become the King. Hence, this news is also a sweet one for him. He is now king and Camilla now the Queen consort. It is dream come true. We expect a more glorious raise from the King. Long Live the King !!!!!!",

They serve as a control to our excesses. There is no comparison when we are talking about a royal family that includes princes and kings. The Queen Mother will necessarily be wonderful.But speaking of mothers in general, it is very relative. All people who practice violence on others are necessarily victims of family neglect in one way or another, in which the mother plays specific roles.In Africa, the mother enjoys a great position because she performs great functions (according to society's view) throughout her life with her children and not only for care during their growing up (childhood and adolescence).",

Queen Elizabeth II lived a memorable life and now her son is set to rule in her stead to keep up the legacy built. Despite the levely of love he got from his adorable mom he always wanted to be king before he died and now here he is... Long live the king..",

Long Live the King !!!!!!I don't disagree with you that Prince Charle would have had this thought at least at some points in his life but, death is hardly the only way for him to have come into power. There are other means for sure and who knows, the Queen now of blessed memory could have just come by a decision and her loyal subjects would be sure to accept.That way, Prince Charles would be king and still have his mum by his side to guide him and offer experience on the duty.Any always, the Queen would be missed by the lives she touched and would be remembered as well.",
