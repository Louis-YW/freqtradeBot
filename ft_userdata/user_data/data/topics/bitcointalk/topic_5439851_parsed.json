Question remains same, what about users data if these services go offline for whatever reason? I am not sure about LastPass, but Bitwarden uses a distributed server architecture to ensure that even if one server goes offline, users' data is still accessible from another server. But, both LastPass and Bitwarden allow you to access your data even if the service goes offline temporarily or even for an extended period of time. Besides, both services let you export your data in various formats so that you can always have a backup copy of your information.",

      "body": "If a server-side password manager like Bitwarden goes offline or shuts down, it could mean that you would temporarily lose access to your stored passwords and other sensitive information. This is why it's important to have a backup of your data, such as exporting your passwords to a file and storing it securely on your own device.",
