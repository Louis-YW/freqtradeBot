Emefiele warned that any commercial bank that failed to issue the new naira notes to customers would be fined N1 million on a daily basis. The CBN governor, who was represented by the apex bank’s Deputy Director, Adeleke Adelokun, issued the warning at a sensitisation on the new naira notes organised for market women in Ayegbaju International Market, Osogbo, Osun State. He said that the apex bank had printed enough naira notes to serve Nigerians.“As of today, CBN has printed enough new naira notes of N200, N500 and N1,000. But, what we discovered was that most of the banks that are supposed to collect the new notes have not collected them. So we have put a sanction on the banks. Any bank that fails to collect the new notes from CBN will pay N1 million as sanction per box per day and the amount they are to pay now will depend on the number of days they have not collected the notes,” he said.Source: https://dailypost.ng/2023/01/20/banks-that-will-pay-n1m-fine-over-new-notes-emefiele-reveals/This measure by the apex bank dey good because we no kno wetin dey really happen with this new naira notes as people dey complain up and down say ATM machines still dey dispense the old naira notes. Before CBN set the 31 January deadline dem suppose don make sure say dem don print enough new naira notes. It's very likely say e get some persons or group of persons wey want frustrate the work of CBN with the new note circulation for their own selfish reasons and in my own opinion I feel say the one million naira fine too dey small. We just get about 10 days remaining, I doubt if this new naira notes fit really go around. Wetin una think?",

The situation reports from my region of the country Abuja is quite a positive one most especially since thos week, and if you remember the new CBN 1 million naira fine on banks not dispensing new notes in their ATM and over the counter was announced last week Wednesday and this week banks are working tirelessly to avoid being cut up in the web of old notes circulated. So this week we should expect some positive development and improvement, hopefully, by the end of this week the new naira should be up to an 80-90% circulating ratio before the January 31st deadline.",

Seeing the massive number of people in banks these days with lots of money for depositing will convince you that the deadline will not be okay for the time being. CBN Governor don already talk say him no go shift the deadline because him don give dem enough time to come deposit the money. Who we go blame now?

CBN might have to review the deadline date if this is expected to be effective well.According to him, 90 days should be the usual duration, but was extended to 100 days by the bank, which is responsible for the delayed transition. After the announcement, they kept loading old notes into the ATM and even gave them off the counter while they sold all the money given to them on the black market. Despite there being too little awareness among the public, politicians continued to accuse the central bank governor of fraud and many other allegations. They even strongly criticized the new note.",

I gathered from a reliable source who told me that while they were waiting on the queue to get the new naira notes, she noticed some persons coming in and going out with money in ghana must go bags, and at end of the day, they didn't get it as they were told that they have exhausted the new notes. The public fail to understand the banks are hoarding it for their own selfish gain. It is in our blood to always profit from any given situation, the banks are making money out of the new naira notes and I see the fine as a welcome development. Though, I still think the fine has little effect on the banks because they can still be collecting the new notes and be loading 10% of their daily allocation on ATM machines and selling the rest on the black market thus frustrating the activity of CBN.",
