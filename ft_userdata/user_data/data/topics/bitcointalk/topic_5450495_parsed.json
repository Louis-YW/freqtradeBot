  "content": "I originally made this post in the Portuguese section (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450493.new#new) did a quick search in order to check if there was a similar topic, but this couldn't find, sorry if there are already something similar ongoing Regarding the faucet, well, there's no free lunch. In this case, you'll need to exchange (an email address) and a few minutes of your day \"reading\" news for your desired BTCSatoshisBTC.How? Log in to the Bitcoin Magazine app using my email address + the code received by email > Each news article has a value in Sats, which are delivered to you when they are read/scroll through.Link: (https://www.bitcoinmagazine.app/)How much? In the article I saw, a cap/max of 210 sats/day is mentioned, which is approximately 6000 Sats per month, equivalent to 1.7 USD at today's exchange rate. (kind of meh, I know, hence the \"faucet\" in the title)BUT! It can be a good path for those who still can't afford their first fractions of the orange pill, or even for those who want to start exposing themselves to the asset meanwhile learning about it. I found it cool and quite inviting.NOTE: It's worth remembering that BTC faucets used to be \"miserable\" when converted to USD, but who never thought they could have gotten rich from faucets? I'm not saying the same will happen, but to help with future abstraction, if BTC does a 100x and reaches around $290k, this monthly trickle will be worth $170 or almost $2000 USD.PS: I haven't tested cashing out yet because it requires a minimum of 500 sats. I didn't find anything really negative about the online app, and it seems that the wallet to receive your BTCs needs to be compatible with the Lightning Network. I also don't know if they ask or will ask KYC for withdrawals.OH! The classical ones: Not your keys, not your funds / DYR  Link to the news: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Crgg89grl4r/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3DDo you see this a good card to be played in order to convince more humans to look over the rabbit hole?",

One of the ones still going is at freebitco.in.Of course nothing will ever compare to this, the first and grand-daddy of all faucets:Quote from: Gavin Andresen on June 11, 2010, 05:38:45 PMFor my first Bitcoin coding project, I decided to do something that sounds really dumb:  I created a web site that gives away Bitcoins.   It is at: https://freebitcoins.appspot.com/ Five ฿ per customer, first come first served, I've stocked it with ฿1,100 to start.  I'll add more once I'm sure it is working properly.Why?  Because I want the Bitcoin project to succeed, and I think it is more likely to be a success if people can get a handful of coins to try it out.  It can be frustrating to wait until your node generates some coins (and that will get more frustrating in the future), and buying Bitcoins is still a little bit clunky.Please try it out and get some free coins, even if you already have more Bitcoins than you know what to do with.  You can get some and then donate them right back; the address is: 15VjRaDX9zpbA8LVnbrCAFzrVzN7ixHNsCWhats cool is you can see an archived version of what the faucet used to look like:Of course it was abused and emptied before too long, LOL.Quote from: Gavin Andresen on August 04, 2010, 08:40:55 PMI just shut down freebitcoins.appspot.com; it looks like somebody in Spain is being a jerk and getting a new IP address, bitcoin address, and solving the captcha.  Over and over and over again:",

They can be useful for testing sending a few satoshis between wallets or for other experimental purposes, but they are definitely not a good source of earning money. You will definetly end up wasting your time and electricity imo, It is better to find another source for earning BTC than relying on faucets. In addition to that, I think some sites provides small tasks to do pays much more than faucets do, that would be just a slightly better than faucets imo.

Some of the faucets also have pop-up ads which increase the risk of phishing attacks and I suspect it's very possible to be conned and do nothing, so it's not worth the effort.",

Only centralized shitcoin developers can afford to run an non-profit faucet and running such a faucet should be mandated per law.

Back then, on the early years of crypto market, faucets were worthful because they could be claimed instantly. You didn't take more than 5 seconds to claim few cents from a faucet, as you just needed to solve a simple captcha and an easy anti-bot test.For people who can't afford the orange pill yet, there must be more efficient methods to acquire the money needed. Even begging on the streets seem a more convenient alternative than faucets nowadays, which lost their viability after Google Adsense banned their ads from this kind of website. Google Ads was the main income of faucet's owners, which allowed them to pay decent sums of satoshis to users.",

If you are lucky, you can get bigger sats. You can also get sats from WoF as an extra.But using a faucet to generate free sats can still be used for people who have just joined bitcoin.

It's not we are still in the pre-2017 era wherein faucet was a good source for earning small amounts that could turn big in the future. And as soon as those who created faucets saw that it's going to be not a effective promotion or marketing or whatever reasons they think they can get from it. They simply stop, and then the period of scams follows, like you need to reach certain amounts before you withdraw, or just collecting data from your PC and other reasons why it become useless and a complete waste of our time.",
