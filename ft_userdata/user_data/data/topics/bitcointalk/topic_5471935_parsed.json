I havent encountered yet on a casino that do ask out log in information whenever you do tend to make some backspaces on trying out to check out something as long your logged in with that particular session then it wont logged out and stays logged in but basing up on my awareness that there are sites which are really just logging up your account on a specific period of time and if they do detect out that there's no activity on the said timeframe then it would really be logging out on which i could say that it isnt really that much of an issue but somewhat really that very hassle when to this.For me, if ever this would really be applied on most casino sites then it wont really be an issue as long you are dealing with the right or legit site or platform because you do know that it is really that part of their security.Also, it doesnt really cost an arm and leg for you to input those informations. Worrying about security wont really be there as long you do know that the site url that you are dealing with is true and legit.No matter how many times you would be logging in then it wont really be that an issue honestly. Lazy enough? Well there are people whose like this.",

Are you positive or negative on casinos asking for log-in frequently or do you feel unsafe in putting your login details every time? The security and comfort of users/visitors are our reasons for looking for and finding safe gambling sites that can provide both, especially the security of users' personal data. However, because the desire to gamble continues to increase and they cannot hold back their patience to immediately gamble, this often causes someone to neglect everything, including security. They often ignore all forms of terms and conditions when registering on a gambling site.And obviously I am very worried about this, so it makes me more careful about logging in or registering on gambling sites because, apart from involving personal data, gambling also involves money. And currently in my country there are very vulnerable illegal gambling sites where apart from the safety and comfort of users cannot be guaranteed, fraud also often occurs.",

If on that gambling platform, you use a password that you have never used before, I don't see it as any problem if after a back space you are asked to login again, as I believe it is for security purpose. This will also enable to casino to know that it is still the same user. I have seen some sites especially financial institutions that does this steady asking of password when you want to make any transactions or when you leave the page and decide to go to another page for some reasons.",

Are you positive or negative on casinos asking for log-in frequently or do you feel unsafe in putting your login details every time? Asking to log every time is actually a good thing from a security perspective and if you feel its a threat to it then its time to increase your cyber internet knowledge. And FYI casinos already have your login details but in encrypted form so even if their database leaked then its unlikely the account can be logged in using those encrypted credentials.That is why in recent days hackers targeted cookies and tokens from your browser cache so they can simply use it to log in from somewhere and it will be valid if the site allows always log-in feature.",

It doesn't seem a big issue... They are making sure you are the legit owner of the account you are attempting to login into. You just have to pay attention to the link you are accessing, especially if you received it through an email or social media direct message in order to prevent being hacked and stolen.Personally, I always prefer to access a website through google, as legit sites appear highlighted there on top positions.",

Can you tell on what site is it OP? So that people would really be able to at least be able to test it out and find it out if its really that happening. Just like on what stomachgrowls said which it isnt really that requiring extreme effort on making log in. If you aren't really that confident with your device on the time that you are logging in then you would really be that hesitating.Its your money and if you do find out that you aren't that comfortable on logging in most of the time or certain moment then we do have tons of gambling sites on which we could transfer on.Just like on what most people been saying that it not really that something could be seen on most gambling platforms.For me then it wont really be that an issue if i do really like the site on where im playing, anything that makes you uncomfortable then it would really be that just wise that you should really transferring or trying out other places because its our money then it would really be just that right that you should be sticking into those places on which you do really love and confident on where you would be staying or hanging out.",

When I read the OP at first I didn't get it but now, I see your point. My input on this is that if you have been gambling at this particular casino for long and this just starts to happen, then you should be concerned. Reach out to their customer support and share your concerns with them. However, if this is how it has been happening since you registered with them, then you shouldn't be worried at all. This is just a security feature. If you have ever signed into a US governments website, you would notice that once you stay idle for more than 5 - 10 minutes you will be logged out. And you would need to log in again. This is merely a security feature and I understand how stressful it may be.",

If remain logged in after opening the site again, it saves time for me to log in again. On the other hand, if the session were automatically out after exiting the browser, it just takes a few seconds to log in. Besides, I am already used to both situations since all the gambling applications I used and installed on my phone (local online gambling sites) log out after exiting a session.Most browsers save data, cache, and logging sessions that's why even after exiting the browser, the account remains logged in. While on the application, the only thing it saves are the username and password if allowed by the user thru \"Remember Me\" option.Talking about security and safety, let's say a stranger able to land or access our account, I don't think how can they even take advantage of the account. First of all, to withdraw funds, most gambling sites are asking for verification not unless these scammers know some trick to bypass that but that is a low chance. The only worst thing they can do is, to intentionally lose all the available balance there.",

Your gambling site logging you out frequently is just for security purpose, and you will be asked to input your username and password to continue gambling. It happens to me always, and I don't think there is anything bad in it. If you receive a link through Gmail or a normal SMS asking you to input your login details, don't even try it, but when you login through the gambling site application or through their website link and you are automatically logged out and they ask you to login again, then it is normal.I have a mobile banking app that logs me out after a few days, and they will ask me to login again to continue using the app. Binance and Kucoin Exchange also do a similar thing, they do log me out sometimes, and I will have to login back to continue using the app. So I think it's just normal, but if you receive a link and are asked to input your details, then avoid that.",
