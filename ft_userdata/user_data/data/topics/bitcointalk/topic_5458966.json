  "content": "Investing on bitcoin, doesn't require much third party validations, if they don't understand how it works, their response can destabilize your moves and ideas. Below is a CEO that purchased 30,000 bitcoin at the rate of 65$ approximately 2million dollars worth of bitcoin in 2013. I read his mail closely and understood, he didn't care about what his associates take on his decision, after doing his research he didn't hesitate about investing into bitcoin, he was sure that bitcoin will give him a good return. I've read many members complaining about being discouraged by closed friends or associates, it signifies that the person carried a low quality research on bitcoin. I don't know how the responses of his associates ended up, but he took the step with or without them. If you wish to be like them act like them. Photo Credit RIZZO",

      "body": "You are right OP, to buy bitcoin is a personal thing to do after you have made up your mind to invest. Anyone who is waiting for a third party to tell him or her when to invest doesn't understand what bitcoin is or doesn't have the knowledge of bitcoin.  Bitcoin investment is something that you must believe in before you can take a the bold step to invest. People that are ignorant or that are lazy to make research on their own are the people that needs influencers or friends or the government to buy bitcoin before they will reluctantly to a move. The first time that I heard about bitcoin was they time that I started picking interest on buying bitcoin.",

It's weird and sketchy at the very least. This influence is present I think in most circles of friends but I'll never understand why.If there's something I learned in this life.. it's that you should sometimes shut up and mind your own business. If you don't, you might be influenced into making the wrong choices or convinced by others that what you're doing won't have positive results. This guy included - I can't imagine how many people around Dan told him he'd destroy his wealth by purchasing BTC worth $2m. It's still happening in my life, I only chose to say nothing about it and mind my own business instead.",

He really is a big man. I honestly don't know if his investment is due to his deep understanding of bitcoin or speculation. But whatever the reason behind the purchase, he was successful with his investmentMaybe if I was in that year and holding that much money, I wouldn't have had the courage to make the decision to buy that much bitcoin. But if for example he is a rich person, maybe he deliberately divides his asset instruments into various sectors, one of the digital financial sectors he chooses is bitcoin. If bitcoin failed, maybe his name was lost in history, but bitcoin succeeded, he made a huge profit and his name went down in history. But whatever it was, he was a great guy, made big decisions and he succeeded in his own way",

Amid that, many news outlets had indicated a connection between them. The point is, everyone was once a trader or just an enthusiast in BTC and to become a whale they definitely had to sacrifice a big mindset which is set by friends' and families' points and statements.But you mention high risk in the title while around 2013 the future of BTC was clear and I do not know how much knowledge does this person had at that time. But, without knowledge, no one could become a whale. Means to say, the risk factor might not be that high for this person. Well it's just an assumption.",

I can see already how he might have been in his cabin, looking at the bitcoin prices and seeing it’s price is too high (at that time) but yet he went into it anyhow. That’s the courage he had which we don’t see in any investors these days. If there is any opportunity today then it’s just anytime now. The more we wait the more we are going to miss it all the time. Whether it is Dan’s $65 per bitcoin back in time or whether it is $30k in today’s date it’s anyway matches the economic growth. Just keep buying guys and HODL.",

This is the reason why, early people who got into Bitcoin never imagined that one day BTC will be reaching the prices that it got into now. I myself sold my BTC at $3000 but this was to personal needs...but I also lost some due to scam-type Ponzi schemes which adopted BTC as one of their payment schemes. People who received BTC via faucets when Bitcoin was just starting were very lucky but then again many of them sold what they got when the price started to rise up. Well, this is human nature, anyway.",

The man in question has worked for Goldman Sachs for 25 years and obviously knew how to recognize the opportunity for a good profit, and such people do not fall under the influence of other people who might advise them that something is a bad investment.Quote from: Flexystar on July 07, 2023, 01:25:42 PM~snip~That’s the courage he had which we don’t see in any investors these days. I would disagree with that statement, because Saylor has bought more than 150 000 BTC since 2020, and I'm sure there are a lot of those who do it without such data appearing in public. I think it's more courageous to buy BTC worth a few billion today than to invest $2 million 10 years ago.",

Just like him, there were for sure people that have discouraged him that it's a crazy decision. And like us, we're probably in the same situation where even our family don't believe us with what we've discovered and that's bitcoin. That's it, this is another encouragement for those that are thinking back forward whether they should buy or not.

Dan Morehead took risk with his investment too but he was brave with that decision. You can call he is smart too but that decision is surely not zero risk.I searched to see how much his wealth is now but could not get that information. I also wondered that the capital he used to by those bitcoins in 2013 accounts for how many percent of his all capital in that year. I guesed he did not use all his capital in 2013 to buy bitcoins.",

It is hard to control your minds if in 2013, you woke up and read news like China wanted to ban Bitcoin mining next month. Nowadays we know it is fud as it has been used many times and Bitcoin was not die, Bitcoin mining still exists in China but in 2013, such fud would like a bomb to kill mentally weak investors.Many top altcoins were dead and if I did similar investment like Dan, I already lost money in those top dead altcoins.https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/",
