But if you're asking me who would be rich among them all? Or they would get rich equally? All I could say is that it's possible for them to get rich equally especially if the circus have a lot of customers which can increase the revenue and income for all of them. But we all know that some positions have a huge impact to make the project happen, that's why they will get the most credits of the circus. Plus you included \"the scammer\" which could one of the factor that may causes them to not equally get rich. Corruption is the most toxic system that will destroy the equality of the people.",

I will mention two category of people that important people and people buying expensive ticket and tables for 4 person in the show, they get attracted by who is organizing the show and the type of the performers too, every performers have level and class and fees that they will charge the organizer. The organizer of the show and the artists or performer attract crowd of people which means more money so the large part of the money is paid to the performers. They are the people richer in circus because they collecting the higher percentage from the show.",

Their income might not determine if they will be poor or rich but how they use what they earn. If the dancer saves and invests wisely he might become rich. The clown might also diversify his skills by starting a business to gain extra income. The world economy indeed is like a circus with many people performing different tasks and roles to earn to survive. You can save and invest in something profitable which can contribute to the possibility of becoming financially stable. If you depend on your salary or wages alone, then you are on your path to poverty. Engaging in different legal avenues to get multiple streams of income is also a key to wealth in society. In summary, invest and diversify to become financially independent because your pay in this economic circus will not make you rich.",

Why?Because,even though each person in the circus has an special duty within it, the role of the owner is simply to profit from it.Also, to compare the economy to a circus can be really inaccurate, because a circus is not a closed system, it depends on a external inflow of money an resources. So there is a serious role which cannot be omitted: the tourists, those who \"work\" is to come in and spend their money. And we all know how important is consumerism to keep the capitalist model of the economy/the market going, if there is no one to spend money, the circus disappears, so does everyone inside.",

This is like a game of who is the king above the king. and the real king has always lived in the shadows. they control from behind.",

I've seen people not have a dime in their person but be persuasive enough to control and lead people into however he pleases them to be.

And the one on the top who manages everything and holds the most risks will likely be the richest out of the whole circus. As for the land owner of where the circus is located I don't think they make a lot of money. At least in my city the circus is always far outside near some park, the rent is not going to be high for it. Reading through your list of professions they are mostly just jobs and shouldn't be earning much more money than in another setting. Like the salesman or the performer can't be making much more money than in another venue which is not a circus. The only person that could be earning a lot would be a specialist that has a professional training, maybe when there are deadly animals like lions than get special training the handlers could more money for the risk they take.",

Individual wealth within the circus depended on their role, level of experience, and success. In addition, it is not only limited to individuals and other factors such as location and financial management also play an important role in determining wealth in a circus. As in business, the owner is usually the one who makes the most money. I guess it's true what they say, it's better to be a boss than an employee.",
