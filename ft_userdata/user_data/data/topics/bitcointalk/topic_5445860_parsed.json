  "content": "QuoteFlorida Governor Ron DeSantis has proposed a law that would prohibit the use of a federally adopted central bank digital currency as money within the state, according to a Monday release.\"Today’s announcement will protect Florida consumers and businesses from the reckless adoption of a 'centralized digital dollar' which will stifle innovation and promote government-sanctioned surveillance,\" DeSantis said in a statement.While the U.S. has not yet created a CBDC -- a central bank-issued digital currency representing a nation's fiat currency -- both the Biden administration and the Federal Reserve have been assessing the potential risks and benefits since last year.DeSantis' proposed law would also forbid the use of a CBDC issued by a foreign central bank, calling on other states to adopt similar restrictions.Here's an in-depth take on what CBDCs are and how they are different from cryptocurrencies.In January, Bank of America argued that CBDCs are the future of money and payments as most of the globe explores them.https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/florida-governor-ron-desantis-calls-for-ban-on-cbdc/ar-AA18RGkl....I don't remember anyone in a position of power and authority proposing broadscale, all encompassing bans on CBDC before. This could be the first time a proposal like this has been made.Quote\"Today’s announcement will protect Florida consumers and businesses from the reckless adoption of a 'centralized digital dollar' which will stifle innovation and promote government-sanctioned surveillance,\" DeSantis said in a statement.The only CBDC ban I remember is the USA banning venezuela's CBDC the petro:QuoteFirst U.S. cryptocurrency ban outlaws Venezuela’s CBDC ‘Petro’ coinThe U.S. executive branch issued an executive order prohibiting the use or purchase of Venezuela’s Petro cryptocurrency, claiming the currency was issued unlawfully in an effort to circumvent U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, and in particular the President Nicolás Maduro’s regime.“All transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018, are prohibited as of the effective date of this order,” the executive order reads.https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/us-bans-petro-cryptocurrency/But in terms of history, there has never been a proposal for a widespread ban of all CBDC.Over the past few weeks, I've thought about what CBDC means in terms of history. Is it simply another shitcoin? Is it visa and mastercard for central banks? Given the way governments and state bureaucracies are structured. Have we seen past hierarchies where central banks are integrated into retail markets to the degree which a CBDC would allow? It is an interesting topic to think about.",

This will be good news for the bitcoin community because the government is distracting people with these CBDCs.

      "body": "Well, I was convinced to search about Ron DeSantis's lifestyle because to understand the main reason behind his decision about CBDC I try to find the reason from start. And I came to know that he was a teacher and in the navy too, he has got a good background and reputation, After understanding the relationship between Donal Trump and Ron Desantis I can understand why Desantis is against CBDC because Biden is in favor of CBDC and elections are coming in 2024 and I can also see some breakup point between Trump and Ron DeSantis. Now I can deduct based on politics that it's an act of politics to degrade Biden's view about CBDC and to encourage the people of their party to encourage them for their agendas. At last, Trump helped him to become Governor by supporting him Inside the breakup between former allies Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis as the 2024 election grows closerHere is the source of some news about Biden's thoughts about CBDC. Biden takes a big step toward government-backed digital currency How Biden’s executive order on cryptocurrency may impact the fate of digital currency and assets Now if we come to the cryptocurrency point of view, does it hurt the innovation like from the stats what I can see is the only harm CBDC could make is not only to single citizens but it could also impact the life of political leaders like the ones who oppose it. How? Central Bank Digital Currencies and Freedom Are Incompatible. This article will help you to understand it completely, in short, all the control will be in hands of the current government's hands which will create problems for opposition parties as everybody has to move money in secret (you know what I mean hehe).",

Ron is a politician and politicians, in my view aren’t to be trusted cause they’ve always got their own personal and most times hidden agenda going forward.Here’s Ron’s statement during a press conference and I quote “ Ultimately, cash is king and of you can hold it in your hands, you have power over that and the minute it’s all digitized, somebody else is going to have control over that”. That seems like a guy(to me at least) who is in favor of cold hard cash and any money that’s digitized wouldn’t cut it. https://twitter.com/berniespofforth/status/1638100720879644673?s=46&t=Ek55yPcSGuxMGKDxl0xP_Q",

Ron DeSantis should also be bold enough to tell us his position on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.In my opinion, this statement by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is connected with the specifics of the pre-election political struggle in the United States.  The pre-election political struggle in the United States is always very tough and categorical statements on the most important issues for American voters.  Politicians choose diametrically opposed discussion positions and very aggressively defend their point of view.  It's like advertising a product - advertising should be bright, aggressive and well remembered....  CBDC is a very important instrument of the digital concentration camp and many politicians around the world want to introduce this financial instrument into our lives.  In the United States, democratic institutions of power are historically strong, so the introduction of a digital dollar into the American economy will not do without a fierce political struggle.",

His reasoning is clear -- it increases surveillance capabilities by the U.S. government. I'd add that it also gives even more centralized authority for the U.S. government to control monetary policy. Even though most banking is digital, USD is still a physical system. The U.S. government still recognizes physical cash as legal tender.Should they move away from such a system and implement digitalized tokens as an alternative -- you can say goodbye to any sense of financial independence as a USD holder. Every token you have will be controllable by the U.S. federal government. It's a lousy system.Most of the CBDC ban talks are political grandstanding, anyways. But it's still nice to see where a politician stands on these sorts of issues. Should DeSantis become President, it gives us a hint of where he'd take the federal reserve.",

I think there have been instances in the past where central banks have been integrated into the retail market at a level similar to what the CBDC allows.For example, in the US, the Federal Reserve is involved in the retail market through various means such as providing loans to banks and implementing monetary policy through interest rates. It can also be seen that some countries, such as Sweden and China, have implemented digital currencies at the national level, which can be seen as a level of integration into the retail market.",
