It's probably strongest Eurobasket in in many years and it's a bit strange, considering that after change of format, Eurobasket lost importance and spots to Olympics/World Cup aren't given there anymore.Main favorites according to bookmakers is Serbia, France, Greece and Slovenia. Lithuania and Spain also can be considered as contenders.More details about tournament can be found on official website:https://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2022",

Now both of these teams are among the favourites to win the title. Serbia are the most favoured one @4.60. While Greece and Slovenia are following them @5.00, France are right behind @5.50. The odds are really close to each other and I don't expect any other team to make a surprise too. Spain were the dominator of the EuroBasket in the past but now they have an odd like 15.00.My favourite team are Serbia. I'd like to say Greece but it really depends on how solid Giannis will play. Like some of you mentioned, this isn't NBA and maybe he can still have problems with having a good relationship with his friends in the roster and adapting to European basketball again too.",

I think it is a good video for considering how to bet on some teams. The Serbia roster is explained well also. Fiba Eurobasket instagram account has a thing called 'Power Rankings'. (https://www.instagram.com/p/ChcCFE7tIJT/?hl=en) Turkey was at 6th position in the previous weeks but they lost their position at the first 8 after the terrible losses. Lastly, Latvia crushed Turkey and then Serbia also won in a clutch game. Still, I think there is potential in Turkey's team. Might have surprising results.This will be very intense tournament. There are a lot of big contenders. For me there are 5-6 teams I would not totally surprised if they win the cup. This means we will have a great tournament to watch.",

It will be a bit of a problem in my time so I may be able to watch only one game and that will be Slovenia vs Lithuania where I also put my bet. Sorry, but my bet will be for Slovenia here at -2.5. Let's see, it should be an exciting game.",

They lost to Serbia and Latvia in their last games. However I see this as an opportunity for them to rise again. They beat Montenegro in their last game and they are highly the favourite again. Slovenia are already one of the biggest candidates to become the champions. Lithuania isn't an easy opponent and the last games between them are proofs for that. But I still don't think Slovenia will lose here. When it comes to France, they are still very strong and among the teams being favoured to win the championship. However this is the bet I'm most afraid of. Because only a few days ago, Germany defeated Slovenia in the World Cup by a huge point gap like 19. France will need to play really carefully against them to have a good start.",

But that doesn't mean I am discriminating or anything, I am actually glad that I have witnessed these players in the NBA. Now, I am a fan of more European players rather than US players.  I think it all started with Peja Stojakovic then Manu and Dirk, then right now Doncic, Jokic, Giannis, and more. What I mean by a real game is, that it gets more serious, like playoffs or a Finals game. This is the time when they play even harder than the qualifying rounds.",

Considering the individual performances, Yabusele (18 points) and Gobert (11 points, 12 assists) were the most impressive players of the match. But France couldn't get as much contribution as Germany got from the majority of the players. France were bad in especially the third quarter and they couldn't close that big point gap after that.",
