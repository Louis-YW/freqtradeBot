  "content": "It has been clear that a lot of funds have to drag the price of Bitcoin to a low against previous months' Bitcoin price,  bitcoin started the year 2023 on a positive note after it recovered from a major market crisis before the FTX and the rest made the entire 2022 a negative price period and also made the price of Bitcoin and another asset to plumb greatly all through to 2023 before the current price of 26k+ which seems to be the lowest base the market liquidity can close on and at the current price. So what next are we going to witness a low price movement or more recovery that will place us on the verge of a market break out against the next year's Bitcoin halving and anticipated bull run which can come before the halving or after the halving with both having the percentage possibilities.",

With the increasing inflation and the hiking of interest rates which only signifies one thing which is the recession I think the demand for bitcoin would certainly reduce.

Therefore, it seems to me that the summer could pass as a very boring period, unless something super positive happens, although I don't see what that could be.

I am more concerned about the economic situation because that will have a significant impact on the market. Inflation is falling and will continue to fall in the coming months, but keeping interest rates high by the Fed will actually push the economy into recession. About bitcoin price prediction, I still believe history will repeat itself, I mean, before having, there will still be another drop.",

I think we can see a sharp drop to $20000 after a long time of boredom. If bitcoin did not get to $30000 this time as $25000 support was strong, the support may still later be broken once more and bitcoin go to $20000 again. It would likely be a price drop that will not be for long as some people have set limit order in such price and some people are waiting for it. If it happened, it may be the last time that bitcoin will ever go as low as $20000 ever again.

This year is mimicking 2019 already. People that invested in bitcoin in January of his year are still in profit, unlike last year that began with bear market, continued with bear market and ended with bear market.",

I'm sure other investors will do the same as me because this is a great opportunity to accumulate more Bitcoins.We don't want to miss the moment to get big profits again before or after the halving. We may still see the price of Bitcoin like this or maybe there will be an up and down movement that can make many unprepared people panic. So we have to anticipate not to panic and be able to buy Bitcoin at the right time.Current market conditions look stagnant or sideways but it could be that in the next month, the new Bitcoin price will start to increase and return to the price of $ 30k. But whatever happens later, we should stay alert to use every moment for ourselves.",

If we hear more negative news like the lawsuits against Binance and Coinbase, then definitely the price will go down more further, but if nothing comes up, then slowly the price will go up.

Yes I expect a recovery around August to the end of the year, so the price will probably be above $30k in August.Price swings are still very likely over the course of 2023, but I'm less likely to expect a big dump to hit the market. The SEC and a few other issues have had a negative impact on the market, but if the market is supported by institutional investors and a lot of large companies, then perhaps much more bullishness can be expected.

If we pay attention to the current state of the market, which is still very positive, Bitcoin continues to show strength and managed to pass through the mid-range level without experiencing a pullback. The uptrend that occurred today I think can continue until it reaches around 29.5k, where there is a gap on the CME chart. Well, after reaching that level, it is likely that there will be a decline in the short term. But interestingly, there are currently two groups of traders who differ in their actions towards Bitcoin. Retail traders tend to position themselves to sell (short) Bitcoin, while large traders accumulate more Bitcoin (BTC).Quote from: mk4 on June 19, 2023, 02:14:12 PMI think in the mid term it's going to be quite simple I think — Bitcoin ETF gets denied, we go very likely down.

We're going to get a lot of rumours and stuff that would make the market more volatile as it is.I think Bitcoin's medium-term trajectory cannot be solely determined by the approval or disapproval of a Bitcoin ETF. While ETF decisions can impact the market, we all know there are other factors that contribute to Bitcoin's price movement and that the market reaction to news and rumors can often be unrecognizable. predictable, and not always a direct cause-and-effect relationship between ETF decisions and price fluctuations.",

Ok thank you for pointing me to that thread I have not taken notice of the prediction going on there but indeed upon a closer look at the thread I discovered that it is a bit different from what a Bitcoin speculation or analysis is. In your price prediction and markets analysis,  you made an accurate speculation and also analyze the happening in and before the halving,  I am sure a lot of other speculators will predict a bull run after the bitcoin halving but also there is a possibility that the bull run may likely also come before the bitcoin halving event because we have a hard history of bull run few months before having.",
