  "content": "Greetings Everyone! I hope you're all doing well! As preev.com has been down / unreliable as of late, I've put together my own conversion app.It's called PREECS and it's pronounced just like it looks, but you have to add a HEAVY LISP at the end, almost to the point of making spit fly out of both corners of your mouth.If you have that almost happening, you know you've pronounced it correctly!  CoolStorage.org Presents...PREECS!!It only supports BTCTC and is updated automatically every minute with a weighted price from coinbase, bitstamp, and kraken, for all your BTCTC/USD conversion needs!https://preecs.coolstorage.orgI also have a simple key-less API setup to spit out the current weighted BTCTC price. If you want to integrate it into anything, please limit your requests to one per minute as it only updates every minute anyways, thanks!https://preecs.coolstorage.org?btcusdNew PRICETAG feature!  Set the dollar amount you wish to display in BTC ($100 shown)and use the url below to embed the btc price you set into your posts.https://preecs.coolstorage.org/pricetag/100Then put the url into an IMG tag like so:To generate a PRICETAG containing cents, use the ?cents= variable ($10.50 shown)https://preecs.coolstorage.org/pricetag/10?cents=50Remember the name - PREECS!! (wipes face)I hope everyone in the community finds this app useful.Any questions let me know! (not really)",

I almost didn't see the two buttons to switch between dark and light mode. I thought they were refresh buttons. I think they would be more useful at the top or the bottom of the page and with a different icon. A lantern or something similar.",

It's one of the most worthy ones, imho.Quote from: Pmalek on September 15, 2022, 09:37:45 AMToo bad that the domain isn't simply preecs.org without the \"coolstorage\" addition. It's more catchy and easier to remember. After the first use, my browser is already auto-completing the full URL after I type preec. So imho it's not such a big issue.Quote from: Pmalek on September 15, 2022, 09:37:45 AMI almost didn't see the two buttons to switch between dark and light mode. I thought they were refresh buttons. I think they would be more useful at the top or the bottom of the page and with a different icon. A lantern or something similar. This is something I agree with. Those need better icons/better visibility.",

Maybe someone else understands and can help explain? I'm not that bright lolIt sounds like you'd requesting a feature that allows you to enter a imestamp and the app will spit out the price btc was at that time, but not sure? Thanks again!",

Thanks again!Thanks for considering my suggestion, I mean an usecase like BTC campaign payment like Chipmixer.Quote from: DarkStar_ on September 12, 2022, 04:18:05 AMPayments for this week of the campaign have been sent, using an exchange rate of 1 BTC = $21660 USD. (...txid....)Can what I highlighted can you represent with your picture where the price will not be refreshed?Previously, DS seemed to use Preev as a reference before going down.In the case of purchasing goods, the seller must go to another site to confirm the bitcoin price at the time of the transaction. With your image feature, they can show the bitcoin price directly in a thread that buyers and sellers can agree on at the current date.",
