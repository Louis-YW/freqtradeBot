So, the OP knows why we made it unlimited, but I don't think such exists as of today. I have even helped the OP to search the internet and also asked questions from the crypto guru I know to avoid mistakes, but to no avail.",

It can be increased further but for that you have to go through AML.Quote from: Pentafa on October 19, 2022, 06:56:09 AMHow reliable is Bitstamp?Bistamp is pretty reliable exchange. Never tried it myself, but few of my friends are using it for years and I never heard them complaining about it.",

Maybe you have to go through KYC for unlimited withdrawals. Binance also supports SWIFT bank transfer withdrawals, just check if your country is not one of the excluded ones.

From all I have read thus far, I think this is the best option for OP in terms of what you are looking for, $100mil at the current price is about 5200+BTC  you have to dump to withdraw that kind of amount",
