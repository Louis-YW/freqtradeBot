Bitcoin is volatile. Everyone knows that. To be running a business based on bitcoin and be so unprepared for bitcoin to be volatile that you have to start firing people suggests to me that you don't really know what you are doing. Certainly not the kind of people I would trust to look after my money for me.Quote from: LordShanken on December 05, 2022, 03:55:25 AMBTW - From my research, Coinbase and USDC are the safest on the market right now.Your own wallet is the only safe place for your coins right now.",

      "body": "The layoffs have been discussed in several other threads and probably have very little to do with how the platform is doing in general.One of my replies from months ago about it:Quote from: DaveF on June 16, 2022, 12:50:07 PMThere is a difference between 'financial problems' and \"the market has changed we don't need you anymore and the even larger profits are down (or negative)\" so it's time to reduce headcount. As I posted elsewhere many tech businesses don't do layoffs when they are doing well. It's the keep them around just in case we need them mentality. In this bear market, you can't just keep some people.I know someone who was just let go from Gemini. As she put it: Now she gets to spend the summer living off her severance package while doing nothing. As opposed to getting her regular paycheck to do nothing. The project her group was working on ended sometime in late 2021 with the deployment in early 2022. For the last 3 months she joked that her job was head youtube video watcher. So them letting those people go was not a surprise to any of them. BUT had this been a bull market they probably would still be there waiting for the next project while watching videos.....Laying people off may or may not be an indicator of financial issues. But, it's usually not a good one specifically in the tech and financial markets. And lets face it, exchanges are more or less in both of those. They keep people that may or may not be needed just in case, and they do massive hiring to get things done 'yesterday'.-Dave",

Plus with all their location it would be simply impossible to run that with just 80, especially since they deal with a lot more stuff. Some of them might have subsidiaries as FTX had.Also, two things:Quote2TM   Crypto Unicorn   2022-06-03   86They are getting another round of lay-offs, seems like the unicorn is not feeling too well, might have to get him to a vet after the coinbase deal failed seems like down is the only way to go.QuoteValkyrie Investments   Investment Company   2022-11-15   7   30%When you suddenly realize that all the promised money is not coming as all your investors lately have backed off their deals I wonder why you still keep any employees at all and not just shut down and run the whole \"investment\" company on Twitter and youtube from home as that's all she's doing lately.This amount of lay-off also tells another side of the story, all those people were basically earning their wages on the money people were pouring into crypto, they weren't doing anything else, just moving money from A to B and waiting for B to increase in price, I'm pretty sure that while telling people to hold on social media silently they were selling coins to have to pay their expenses. This model is flawed from the start and until you have a bull run and a huge inflow of cash everyone running the company like that will keep firing.Which reminds me of one on the list, Core Scientific:QuoteCore Scientific held 24 Bitcoins and approximately $26.6 million in cash as of Thursday. That’s compared with 1,051 Bitcoins and about $29.5 million in cash as of September, the company said in the filing.If one of the largest miners is liquidating bitcoins to survive, what about the others who don't produce a cent o their own?",

Thousands of workers have been fired and the service is still working. The reason for this is the excessive expansion in the number of workers over a period of time, for example, due to Covid-19, closures, and the increase in the price of Bitcoin.the labor shortage does not indicate anything if you compare it with the levels of employment before 2020.In lending services, the interest rate will play a larger role.",

They're more inclined to unsustainable practices and being Ponzis. Laying off employees, on the other hand, is probably part and parcel of managing a company. Company operations expand and contract. They experience bullish and bearish cycles. Depending on how bearish the market is, lay offs might be an option. With what the crypto market has gone through--from very bullish to severe winter in just months-- it is understandable if operational costs have to be trimmed down rather quickly after possible mass hiring and some expansion efforts.",
