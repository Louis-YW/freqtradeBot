It's not wrong, and sometimes it can even be good, from time to time to change the password.",

And where did he say he can't access his Bitcoin account, which account are you referring by the way? I can't see enough information in your claim. I don't think it was a hack, rather it's a normal password reset which everyone should do (change) once in month or a few months at least.",

You can only report an account whenever you noticed unusual activity like such user using it to scam people and posting a ponzi scheme and you confirmed it wasn't the original user then you may come up with your claims.",

I first noticed him in the knowledge quiz forum, where he tried to get merit twice because GazetaBitcoin created a very convenient topic for getting merit.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381367.msg61869752#msg61869752Today's topic is that he is looking for places where he can get a couple of merits and create a scandal. You can guess that he is not a beginner, since he so deftly grasps where you can get easy merit. The negative tag, I think, will only create a reason for the birth of a new profile of this liar.",
