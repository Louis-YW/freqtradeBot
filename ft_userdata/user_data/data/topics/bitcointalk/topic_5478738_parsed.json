People are expecting the approval to be in the first quarter of next year. But as for this year approval, I do not think that is going to happen, spot bitcoin ETF is not going to be approved this year.",

Maybe Joe Biden and some members of Congress might also have a glimpse of when it will be approved because the SEC reports to them. The first final deadline will be on 10th January 2024, which is the Ark Investment Management application. The SEC can choose to approve or deny this approval citing more concerns. Which means that we have to wait for the consideration of other applications. Currently, there are concerns that the SEC is insisting that these ETF providers should use cash to buy shares of the ETF instead of the preferred \"in-kind\" transactions. However, some ETF applicants are pressuring the SEC to allow them to offer both in-kind and cash redemption. There have been several meetings between the representatives of the SEC and these ETF applicants and several issues have been discussed which have necessitated most of these applicants to adjust the provisions of their applications. My advice is that you become less expectant because it can happen slower or faster than you expect.    Quote from: Nihal6443 on December 21, 2023, 06:04:47 AMMay be the will approve around halving for back to back positive news so that btc cross its Ath.If it happens at the same time, then the price of Bitcoin will skyrocket.

You have to think that if my thinking becomes true, what will happen with Bitcoin, will it be correct a lot because its current price reflects the market anticipation for Bitcoin Spot ETF approvals.I am not spreading fud here but it is one of scenarios, if it happens, don't feel bad about it if you already have plans, reserve money to catch Bitcoin dips. Halving will be in April 2024 and any dip in next four months will be great chances for you to get profit.",

The buy the rumour sell the news event will take place, this is my own believe, there will be some massive sell off and the price of Bitcoin will still dump, either ways dump is expected to happen.",

According to the the rumor that it will be on January 10th, but nobody knows if SEC will approve it on that day or still delay the approval. One thing that I know is that ETF approval will be next year but I cannot say when exactly. What I know is that whether ETF is approved or not bitcoin will be doing great next year since the bigger event is taking place which is the halving because it is the halving that will lead to the bull run. The approval of ETF will only make the price to skyrocket more than 100k to maybe 200k. The important thing now is dor us to keep on stashing our bitcoin portfolio for the next bull run and worry less about news in the market.",

That is at least the last updated news I read about the ETF. Mind you, it is still subject to approval or rejection as the case may be and not the view of only approval as you think. It will disappoint a lot of crypto dealers if they reject it and the crypto market will be so negatively affected. But if it is approved, it will continue to help the market to appreciate as we see now. However, the chance of approving it is so high judging by the appeal court's verdict about it. Yet, the SEC still have the final say and I believe that it would be reasonably approved this time.Come to think of it, if Crude oil, Gold and others could have the ETF, why not Bitcoin even if they will not approve other cryptocurrencies? I hope the SEC will consider it wiser this time and do the needful as this can't hurt in any form more than how it is already but is just a further advancement in the crypto space.",

I think accumulating bitcoin is more important than continuing to pay attention to this news that is still continuing whether or not it will be approved. I think it is still focused on buying before the price is high because it is influenced by the ETF or the Halving that is coming soon. Focus on that with bitcoin purchases.",

But you know what will happen next to it when it gets denied again? For sure we can see a price fall since this is usually what happen to bitcoin when ETF submission denied news will spread out so I guess we need to be careful on to much believing and just monitor how this case go so that we can do good actions if certain good or bad effect will happen if ETF will really get approve at that timeline or get denied.Really great if all officials will agree to accept it since I think we can see bitcoin reach to another level and might for this event we can see the demand rise up and it can help to get a huge bull run especially that year 2024 is possible a good year for bitcoin since many think about more positive to happen when halving season happens.",
