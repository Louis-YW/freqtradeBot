  "content": "It all started in 2008. Satoshi developed and released a paper that kick-started a much-needed evolution in the financial sector. In 2015, we saw the development of ethereum which resulted in the scaled adoption of smart contracts enabling the development of Altcoins and NFTs.We can cross reference the evolution of cryptocurrency and relatable technologies with the development of the WWW (World Wide Web).I want to take you back to the 1990s, the beginning of media & content on the Internet. Images were shared on the internet through email, clunky websites, and even FTP. The 2000s saw the rise of YouTube and Facebook, turning passive viewers into active content creators. Finally, in the 2010s we saw the rise of high-quality, professionally produced films and content digitally on-demand with Netflix and Prime.I believe WEB3 IP is following the same progression. It began with coins and tokens (BTC, ETH, ALTS), then evolved with an image layer on tokens, now known as NFTs, some inscribed on chain... most not. During 2021/2022, NFT projects began and continue to create short-form content, and today, feature films are being financed and produced by specific NFT projects.Examples:Bored Ape Yacht Club Documentary:Raised: $400,000Bored Apes Storm Hollywood:Raised: $300,000Calladita:Raised: 545 ETHNouns: A MovieRaised: $500,000 + 20 ETHNow we see the rise of WEB3 writer's rooms, entertainment projects, and more. All the while, Hollywood is burning up. The talent that is the core of everything that a film or series becomes is at their tethered edge with the current, (and incredibly outdated) system they work in.Combining the development of blockchain and applicable technologies, wealthy projects developing content, and writer's rooms popping up here, there, and everywhere in \"WEB3\" all the while Hollywood burns... I think makes an incredibly strong case that \"WEB3\" becomes the next digital standard of transmedia. Not to mention the use of smart contracts to streamline backend revenues and distribution deals.I've bet big on this theory and spent the past 2... almost 3 years with our team developing infrastructure and customer-facing projects to facilitate this new transmedia model. Our argument for our project is simple, if you want to watch this content, where do you go? It's not going to be on Netflix, Disney, Prime... And if you hold a digital collectible from this content, where's the utility? Youtube, X, and Vimeo don't have the necessary infrastructure, finally, how will blockchain-based projects and Filmmakers bring their content to market if no current companies are providing the required blockchain tools?One could argue, why don't indie filmmakers and projects just build infra to themselves... well, Today if projects and indie filmmakers want to achieve such, they need to navigate multiple infrastructures, increasing their already bootstrapped budgets by $50 to $60 thousand dollars in order to combine these necessary infrastructures under one domain such as a website, that has the necessary blockchain integration to activate a community in a WEB3 way.We aim to dominate the WEB3 market, when individuals think of watching a show or film based on WEB3 IP or from Indie filmmakers, we are their go-to option. From a content perspective, we are targeting, WEB3 IP projects with content-centric strategies, Independent filmmakers who want to build a home for their productions, and major movie studios who want to build digital communities around their brands and content. ALL in a decentralized way. (minus the content hosting - blockchain ain't that advanced yet)I'm here to test our theory on the development of blockchain to become the next evolution of transmedia and if a product such as what we have built, can provide such a pivotal turning point in the entertainment and blockchain industry.Thanks!",
