How good or bad is this plan? also, It looks like miners are staying stronger this period, I expect many to have left mining but difficulty still remains very high. A lot of things make sense or don't make sense based on your own personal situation.  Did you buy the rigs using BTC when the price was at $60K?  If so, selling the rigs off for more BTC now would be a smart move.  Are you having problems cooling those rigs during the summer?  Are you forced to sell at low prices to pay for electricity?  Do you have strong conviction in another asset you want to purchase and need to raise funds for it?There are always so many variables...  Consider everything and do what's best for your own situation.",

If you have already paid off your mining farms, then this is probably a good plan if you have expensive electricity and cannot compete with other miners. And if you bought your equipment expensively and have not paid back yet, then know that miners always paid off mining equipment if they continued mining.",

Depends.This plan can be different for anybody because everybody has different situations. Depending on your electricity bill, your personal expenses&life standards, your mining hardware (GPU or ASIC?), the country you live in, your warehouse/home, the size of your mining rig... anything can change.If 40/60 works for you, that's great. Keep doing it but don't expect this to work for everyone else.",
