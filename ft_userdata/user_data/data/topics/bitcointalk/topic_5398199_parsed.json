It's copied from another failed project (already have marked bad by cmc) MetaFarm DAO. https://coinmarketcap.com/sv/currencies/metafarm-dao/https://arabiancitybsc.com/whitepaper.htmlMetaFarm DAO thread can be found in here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381530.0Quote from: cryptokool001 on January 15, 2022, 04:53:53 PMThe MetaFarm is a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gamingexperiences in the BSC blockchain using $METAFARM, the platform’s utility token.Our vision is to offer a deeply immersive metaverse in which players will create virtual worldsand games collaboratively and without central authority. We are aiming to disrupt the existinggame makers like Minecraft and Roblox by providing creators true ownership of their creationsas non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and rewarding their participation with our utility token – $METAFARM.In the current game market, the centralized ownership and control of user-generated contentlimits creator rights and ownership. Central control over the trading of virtual goods created byplayers restricts them from generating fair value for their creations. Compounding this, it canbe difficult to prove creative ownership of works, especially as content is copied, altered, andbuilt upon.With The MetaFarm, we aim to overcome these limitations while accelerating blockchainadoption to grow the blockchain gaming market. We will do this by building a voxel gamingplatform where creators are able to craft, play, share, collect, and trade without central control,enjoying secure copyright ownership with the ability to earn cryptocurrency ($METAFARM). Thiscopyright ownership will be established and guaranteed through the use of NFTs, where everyin-game item will have a unique and immutable blockchain identifier.Quote from: cryptokool001 on January 15, 2022, 04:53:53 PMWhat is META and what is it used for?METAFARM is an essential part of The MetaFarm platform and The MetaFarm are working onestablishing key mechanics that makes it intrinsically tied to The MetaFarm platform and itsvalue. METAFARM is an BEP-20 utility token built on the BSC blockchain that serves as the basis fortransactions within The MetaFarm, and has the following uses:● Access The MetaFarm platform: Players spend METAFARM in order to play games, buy equipment,or customize their Avatar character—and can potentially collect METAFARM through gameplay.Creators spend METAFARM to acquire ASSETS, LANDS, and through Staking. METAFARM Sales drivedemand for METAFARM to purchase LANDS. Artists spend METAFARM to upload ASSETS to theMarketplace and buy Gems for defining Rarity and Scarcity.● Governance: METAFARM is a governance token that allows holders to participate in Governancedecisions of the platform, using a DAO structure. They can exercise voting rights on keyelements such as Foundation grant attributions to content and game creators and featureprioritisation on the platform Roadmap. METAFARM owners can vote themselves or delegatevoting rights to other players of their choice.",

This is as what I'm afraid of, I've has a feeling that they'll raise one or two red flag, like fake team or plagiarism. The source they plagiarized though, is another project by the OP that seems to be failed. I think I'll launch a deep look into the user --not the project-- once I get some free time at hand.",
