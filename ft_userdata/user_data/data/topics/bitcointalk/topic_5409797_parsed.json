      "body": "Yes, that is how data centers operate for the most part, massive and redundant air conditioners.Keep in mind:1) Running them will drive up your electric bill even more.2) Most non commercial units are not designed for 24/7 operation so you will shorten their life.3) It's better to cool the room then put the duct in front of the air intakes on the miners.4) Don't rely on them to keep your miners cool without a 2nd form of warning if the cooling fails. You don't want it to fail as you walk out the door one day and then come back 10 hours later to a bunch of possibly overheated / damaged by heat miners. Yes, they should stop mining above a certain temperature, but why take a risk.-Dave",

      "body": "It can cool down your miner a bit but without exhausting the heat from your room it will just be mixing both cool and heat and it will still end up overheating.You need to exhaust heat outside to make sure it won't mix or you can try to separate a room the other side is where your air conditioner is installed and the other side is for hot air where your miner exhaust is pointing on that side.This is what I'm talking about below posted by philipma1957.- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5271337.msg55066376#msg55066376",

      "body": "He can use this.https://www.koldwave.com/model-6kk21this will allow for 21,000 Btu's of cooling. it burns about 2400 watts at 240 volts.op says 5 asics.I don't know how much power he is burning for his 5 asics.but 5 s17's will use 10000 watts which is 38000 btuso this is only 21,000 btu  note photo shows two cold air and 1 hot air exhaust it must vent that hot air out of the room.  so if he has 5 s17's and set them on low he would be at maybe 5 x 1500 = 7500 watts = 28000 btuso maybe the ac linked does 5 s17's but he must vent that bigger heat vent  outside..  I dressed up the photo with a screen shotlastly there are temp monitors :https://www.amazon.com/SensorPush-G1-WiFi-Gateway-Anywhere/dp/B01N17RWWV?ref_=ast_sto_dphttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PKWPKM2?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsI use the above and set to 4 cellphones and an iPad we can shut stuff down if there is a heat issue",

Your idea is a cost effective long term solution, and it is brilliant, but plenty windows means you plan to keep them regularly open.

Yes, it is going to be a problem, PSUs are known to die when in high humidity, and ASICs while they don't break as easily they do end up dead if you are not careful, there are tens of stories here about how bad humidity is, remember that the boards are not sealed in.",

Then you can use compressed air to remove dust every month as your monthly maintenance without disassembling units.",

You must have really weird prices there, I get some really trusted and proven brand 99% iso for 6 euros a liter (if I would buy in 1l can) and the lacquer thinner is about 5 euros, so it makes little sense to use it. Maybe I'm not cleaning the board as others do and I'm on the cheap side but I'm not using one bottle per board at all. Probably the best thing I've ever done is putting an air filter before the intake fan, although I don't know for sure how effective it is as in how much goes through it (I know how much is captured, lol) and the fact that I have a ton of them around since we use those to prevent flour dust accumulation in the wheat mill.",
