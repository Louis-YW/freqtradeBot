This is exactly why cash or fiat is NOT money it is actually currency. Very few people know this distinction though. Basically ever since they decided to print fiat unstoppably they turned fiat into currency that can only be used as medium of exchange while it lost its store of value status.BTW this is why one of the characteristics of bitcoin is to be both a store of value and medium of exchange, or in other words bitcoin is the best candidate to be considered \"money\" not just a \"currency\".",

      "body": "You were right that paper money has a value, and it can be stored, we cannot argue with that, but the question is, does that amount you put in the bank still the same as the time comes? Let's put it simply this way, $1,000 is already enough in our family to survive whole month or even more, but do you think that figure will be enough in the future? Considering the constant rise of the prices in all the basic needs everyday do you think in the next 5-10 years that amount is significant? I don't think it is. That is the same situation even if you put that amount inside the bank, and guess what? for sure you'll earn percentage depends on how much you deposit by what method? Banks are going to play your money by example lending other people and giving them interest rates as their profit, and the duration? In my country it has minimum of 3 months, so let's just say they can lend it 4 times a year with 2% interest per loan, they have 8% APY just using your money and you get the 2% because that's what the bank promised when you put your money for time deposit. In short, they have 6% profit without lifting a finger and only using words and papers.That's just a basic breakdown for an individual putting money inside a bank, so how much money does the bank have if all of you guys put your money at the same time? 100% profit isn't impossible to make if we're talking about banks, but that's just them not the individual whose blood and sweat being poured just to make \"savings\" for their future plans.",

The management of the population is growing day by day, the needs are constantly changing, and there are hundreds of things that affect it, so management is not simple. What they can do is maintain it for as long as possible, and at some point, the current fiat system will collapse and be replaced by another. If I remember correctly, the history of money has collapsed 5 times, and the US has dominated since 1920, but the collapse will certainly happen, and a new system will be born.",

We concur that these slips of paper and gleaming coins possess value, but in truth, they're mere symbols representing our united faith in the economy. Mind-bending stuff, huh?But I get the picture - we require a method to shift purchasing power across time. That's where money as a store of value enters the scene. The snag is, considering inflation and all that hullabaloo, we can't ever be certain our money will retain its worth in the future. It's a never-ending \"will it or won't it\" gamble - will our cash maintain its value, or are we toast?But hey, perhaps that's part of the appeal. The unforeseeable, the ambiguity - it spices things up, doesn't it?",

If you held $1 million in the banks and don't touch it for 10 years, when you go to retrieve your money, you'll be given that $1 million you kept but it won't be having the same purchasing power it did 10 years back. Instead of using money as a store of value, use it as a means of exchange that it has been turned into. Use assets as store of value, assets appreciate over time and if you had $1 million invested in an asset and kept for 10 years when you sell that assets it'll be worth more than you invested in it.",

They trade something for something, and what they trade is valuable, which is why they could trade it. There are many other assets you could bring for another, you may store them as well depending on the longevity of that thing.",

So that currency emerged as a tools of payment, a store of value, and as a medium for pricing an item.Barter was the beginning of transactions. The first change from the barter system continued with coin or metal currency. Along with the times, the system again changed from coin or metal currency to paper money and applies to this day which is better known as fiat.Paper or fiat money cannot store value due to inflation and has been proven over the years. So with the progress of the world, it is time to enter a new change related to currency and the world is adjusting to digital and Bitcoin is one of the currencies that can store value.",

The currency is widely accepted and can be easily converted to other currencies or used to purchase products and services. It ensures that the value of an asset is protected and maintained over time. Stores of value can be created in many ways, including using physical assets such as gold, silver, or diamonds, or using financial assets such as currencies, stocks, or bonds.And money can bring justice to life because it provides everyone with the same means to exchange value and buy what they need. Money allows people to assess the value of a product or service objectively and easily compare prices between different products. This helps consumers have more choices and can choose to buy better products at a more reasonable price.",

What $1000 could buy today can be bought in few or more years to come due to inflation. So the inability of fiat not to hedge against inflation has made it not to be a store of value.

That is why they don't have that much options and choose to put it in bank instead. They'd usually think the bank is taking care of their money and it is secure enough to just let the bank manage their finances. With this simple breakdown you have, I'm sure a lot of people who are new to crypto would think twice into putting their money inside the banks.Based on my current experience there are some banks who are slowly introducing crypto to their users, so I guess it wont be long enough until new users will try to delve into crypto.",

The first function of money is as a medium of exchange, the second is as a unit of account and the third is as a means of storing value. Now, the derivative function of each money must also be known mate, where In its development, money is also used as a tool in the economic system so that it has other functions apart from what I have mentioned above.As a means of transferring wealthAs a driver of economic activityAs a means of paymentAs a means of hoarding wealthIn addition, each community must also know the types of money in circulation in their respective environments, such as types of money based on their material, namely coins and banknotes. As for the type of money based on the issuing institution, there are also two, namely, currency that is often used for payments by everyone and the other one is demand deposits, deposits or checks issued by the bank.One more thing, the type of money based on its value is also divided into full bodied money and token money. Full money is money whose value is equal to the material used in its manufacture. For example, money made of gold has the same value as the gold from which it is made. Meanwhile, sign money is money whose value is higher than the value of the material used to make it. Source: bmoney.id",
