For a long time, I have not seen a single case of someone being blocked signature.Signature bans were handed out for peculiar cases and was never really that common. AFAIR, only a handful of members were given such punishments and the threads for the appeal would draw out for a long period, giving the impression that it was a common practice.These days a permanent bans seems to suffice for most cases.Quote from: Ratimov on March 27, 2023, 10:04:15 AMAlthough the very idea to punish with a permanent ban for plagiarism was initially a failure. And the consequences of this idea came out much later, when the activity on the forum began to decline sharply.Firstly, I wouldn't say that bans caused a drop in activity, there are so many factors like Bitcoin price changes, introduction of ICOs, NFTs etc. I can't think of a logical reason for a well meaning forum member to plagiarize, so they would not be missed if they are banned, and some of them still evade the ban nonetheless.A drop in activity does not mean a failure of an idea. I would rather a less spam filled forum without lots of the activity we are getting now.",

In academic work, scholarly articles and any writing platform.Copying and pasting someone else's work with no reference whatsoever to the author is unethical and ignorance of any isolated rule does not excuse it.I am one who advocates for the newbie welcome message to be implemented to help new users familiarize with the rules and how the forum works, but you don't need to be informed not to plagiarize others content, only that it carries a heavy punishment.Quote from: Upgrade00 on March 27, 2023, 10:51:13 AMMost banned just the same for 1 post, that was enough. In some cases, for 1 line. If the warning system worked here, it would greatly reduce the wave of bans and people would understand their mistake, but at the same time they would continue to use the forum.How did you reach that conclusion? If one plagiarized post is discovered most would not bother to keep going through the post history.Quote from: Ratimov on March 27, 2023, 11:01:01 AMThe absurdity of this forum is that here you can endlessly lie, troll, cheat, organize scams and no one will do anything to you, will not restrict access, but if you copy someone else's text (even some of it) and you will be banned permanently.That's opening a whole new can of worms.",

The bottom line is that a permanent ban for plagiarism should not be such a strong punitive measure, especially for beginners and those who have done it just 1 time. A welcome post is good, just like the implementation of warnings for such violations.Quote from: Upgrade00 on March 27, 2023, 11:22:47 AMHow did you reach that conclusion?I myself have seen many such cases.I've noticed a lot since I first landed here that there will always be people who are too lazy to read the rules and would just immediately post what they have on mind such as one liner posts and also copy pasted from god knows who is the source without giving proper credits. I'm sure without strict rules this forum would be flooded by millions of accounts created with such freedom to do whatever they want to do. I also symphatize with the thought that there should be fair and right judgement whether someone would receive heavy punishment depending on how big their mistake is. After taking a break in a short period of time i've come to realized that way back years ago due to politics some high profiled members are given a chance to explain why they did such things while those who didn't have enough backers are hanging on the hopes that they wouldn't be banned. Lucky if only they'd receive a red tag but worse would be banned immediately. I've seen similar cases way back.",

I know a huge number of users who were banned for 1 plagiarized post, but they were never spammers. if you try to answer what is the exact reason for writing plagiarized posts, you will probably come to the conclusion that it is pure spam. an attempt to participate in the discussion through \"meaningful\" posts in order to reach activity, while not being interested in the purpose and result of the discussion, can certainly be interpreted as a form of spam.Building the forum profile through bounty posts turned out to be a weak solution if we look at the need to earn merits, so posting a few lines of text is always a better solution. If you are not really interested in discussion, copy/paste is always the fastest and simplest solution.if someone is banned and has only one plagiarized post, it's probably because he was banned very early and hasn't had time to leave enough spam yet.",

It can be true for most cases but we should not think all cases are the same. Some cases are different than the majority and because a permanent ban is a serious punishment, it will be handled case-by-case.Quote from: theymos on February 24, 2019, 12:06:19 PMEverything is case-by-case.Quote from: theymos on February 24, 2019, 03:57:17 PMThere's been no policy change. redsn0w wasn't permanently banned due to several factors which made me think that permabanning him would be a net negative for the forum. Nobody is banned strictly because of \"the rules\"; it's always handled case-by-case, but almost always, plagiarists deserve to be permabanned.If you think that a ban should be ended, make your case in a new topic from a \"good for the forum as a whole\" perspective.",
