  "content": "Bitcoin was designed for P2P transactions or P2P payments. The initial plan of the creator was to transfer funds without middlemen such as exchanges. Currently, there have been arguments by some users that exchanges have become an essential part of Bitcoin transactions because of their high liquidity. Some business owners have complained that they need to use exchanges because fiat is needed for them to restock their stores. So exchanges provide a fast means of changing their coins to fiat.For Bitcoiners to avoid these exchanges and use Bitcoin as designed, building a strong Bitcoin community will be a good option. This community should include trustworthy members that can engage in P2P transactions at will. These communities should be open to members that are trustworthy and committed to promoting the privacy and decentralization of Bitcoin. From my observation, three issues might arise, which are trust, liquidity, and privacy. Let me give my little view of how these challenges can be handled.Trust: Trust between the two parties involved in this P2P transaction might be an issue. I know trustworthy people are scarce but this doesn't dispute the fact that there are people that can be trusted. Using trusted individuals as escrow might be a good option. These trusted members can serve as the link between members if there is any form of distrust among members. But members that trust each other don't need escrow.Liquidity: As the members of the community keep growing its liquidity level will keep increasing. This suggestion might be complicated but it might not be a bad idea if the community has a fiat capital or fund that members can access if there is nobody wants to buy bitcoin at the particular time. Trustworthy Administrators or escrows can simply exchange members' Bitcoin with fiat from the community funds and their Bitcoin transferred to the community escrow wallet. But the amount is these funds shouldn't be too high because it can breed greed. Privacy: Members do not need to know each other physically to run this community. Members in large communities like Bitcointalk can decide to form smaller communities. The reason is that it will be easy to identify trustworthy members if you are aware of their reputation. There are some members in this forum that I will be willing to join the community where they serve as sectors or administrators because they are trustworthy.These are my thoughts, I might also be wrong.",

You have the choice of choosing centralized or decentralized exchange, although I recommend the latter because you are more in control on the latter than the former.",

They are not joining the train for reasons of the bitcoin concept, just joining the trend.In the end, you must serve flexibly as a last resort or you will lose your opportunity, but that does not mean ignoring security measures.",

People can change over time and from a good trade partner to a scam trade partner. Sometimes they don't change from good to scam trade partners but their accounts hacked and hackers make trades and scam other trade partners.Many reasons you can not perfectly avoid scam with a platform infrastructure. A person must be expertise in each trade type to reduce risk of being scammed.",

As you rightly said we can't one hundred percent surety of someone that he is trust worthy under an anonymous system. No matter the repute we may assume someone here has its still a risk we're taking putting them as escrow to a p2p transaction, the less risk or non at all exist with exchanges because whatever amount you might be transacting at the moment is not worth their establishment  and they wouldn't be so stupid enough to risk their license by running away with your meager fund compared to their reserve. Everyone has a price, and some people are said to be trustworthy because maybe their price have not been reached, and that puts them in a better position to be trusted than others that anything goes.",

I sometimes visit these sections and if you want to exchange x amount of bitcoin, it is rare that there is an offer that matches that exact amount. Most times you have to post an offer and see if someone will match it and exchange it for you. I actually used it once to exchange bitcoin for USDT, and that's what happened to me, I had a hard time finding someone to exchange it for me.But now let's move on to other reason the OP hasn't talked about, which is to exchange bitcoin for fiat above certain amounts. If you want to exchange $10,000 or more for bitcoin or vice versa, whether you use a DEX or the forum, you are not going to have privacy anyway.If you have to send, for example, $25,000 from the UK to Singapore or vice versa, your bank will ask you questions and block the operation until you can justify what you are doing. And the justification will not only be kept by your bank, it will be passed on to your country's tax authorities. Alarm bells are also ringing within the country itself. In Spain, for example, any transfer, even a domestic transfer, over €3,000 is automatically reported to the tax authorities.Using a DEX or the forum to exchange $400 from time to time if you are willing to wait for someone to match the offer while in a CEX you have it instantly is fine, but from certain amounts it is not practical.",

What is preventing scammers is because those exchanges are centralized and they are escrow in that sense. If there is not KYC but bank statement can be requested for during dispute, the centralized exchanges will know who wants to scam. Have you used decentralized exchange before? That is how it is too there, but using multisig.Quote from: dzungmobile on August 09, 2023, 09:05:42 AMIt is impossible to do this even you are trading with a trusted user.

      "body": "They are essentially OTC transactions, and they are fundamentally different from using an exchange and they serve a very different purpose. Other than the obvious lack of legitimacy, you have the difficulty of getting decent rates when you're doing such trades, where it is impossible for anyone to gain perfect information and execute trades efficiently. There is a good reason why most people would rather use an exchange for the best rates. If you were to give me an option between the two, I would choose the exchange any day and those challenges that you've listed isn't the main reason.Bitcoin is designed for small day-to-day transactions, and it has nothing to do with the user's desire to exchange their currency for another. Exchange will likely be the main way for people to exchange their crypto to fiat, and they do a lot of the heavy lifting specifically with regards to the government regulations for you.",

He is prominent member here that has many successful transactions in the part yet he still scam many people here due to his own personal problem because it's very easy to scam someone on trust basis since no one knows your identity. He can create new account and start again. Yogg is not only example because there's a lot of same instances even before that involves trusted member that turns into a big time scammer. We have no choice here than trust a centralized or decentralized middleman for every supposedly P2P transaction.",
