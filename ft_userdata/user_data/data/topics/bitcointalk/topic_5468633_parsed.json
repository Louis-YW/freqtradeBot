If you are using Electrum, you need to connect to Electrum servers, and if you do not manage any of these servers, you will need to connect to a server managed by a third party who will be able to know all the addresses in your wallet.(The risks can be reduced by requesting a trusted person manage the private Electrum server, and you will only need to trust them.)Open source wallets are considered SPV clients. They may differ slightly from Electrum, but you can assume that they collect all your addresses (even the ones you don't use) and your IP address (you can hide it via Tor).Closed source wallets may collect more data, including your personal data, or even if you obtain the appropriate permissions to collect more.",

Your question is too vague., it depends on what you mean by \"use\" and \"public node\". Nodes aren't categorized as \"public\" and \"private\". They either accept incoming connection or not.As for connection/usage, if you mean something like connecting to a single node and syncing that way, it is not only a privacy risk but also a security risk since that node may be either broken or malicious and end up feeding you false data. This is why SPV clients usually connect to multiple full nodes for syncing.In any case you should clarify your question for a more detailed answer.",

Another attack I can think of is if both the sender and the receiver connecting to the same SPV server, which in that case it gets complicated. One risk would be the double spend attack but it would require some hashrate. The attacker would send the user some bitcoins in a transaction they mine (they could receive cash or goods in return). That block could take a long time to mine too but it wouldn't matter since the receiver is not aware of the rest of the network (due to being connected to only one node, the attacker's). The attacker would also create another transaction double spending and sending the funds to their own address, which they would send to the network and get it mined in actual bitcoin blocks.If the receiver tries spending the received coins, they would still send the transaction spending those coins to the only node they are connected to which is the malicious one and would accept the tx as valid.",

Plus if you want your transactions to look like it's by a pleb/newbie that has nothing to hide, pay higher transactions fees.",
