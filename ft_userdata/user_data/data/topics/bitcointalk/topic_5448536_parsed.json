  "content": "In my own view, you can only buy bitcoin using P2P if you want decentralized system, almost others or all others are centralized.What is P2P? Read this thread about P2P exchanges: What is a P2P exchange?. There are only two P2P exchanges. They are: transfer of coin or fiat in exchange of fiat or crypto directly like buying something from someone the use of P2P exchangesThe main characteristic of P2P exchange is that it is not centralized in any way. Buying bitcoin from someone and give the person fiat is not centralized, also use of decentralized exchange like Bisq is not centralized.Use this link for decentralized exchanges: https://kycnot.me/, but use the score to grade it. Some are semi decentralized, while exchanges like Kucoin is centralized but does not require KYC. Try and differentiate between decentralized exchanges and exchanges that do not require KYC. No KYC needed for decentralized exchanges. But an exchange that requires KYC may not still be a decentralized exchange, like Kucoin that do not require KYC but can force you to provide KYC that requires identity verification.This is what I read today which is a mistake from Cointelegraph, even it is they are mistakes: How to buy or sell Bitcoin without using a centralized crypto exchange?https://cointelegraph.com/news/how-to-buy-or-sell-bitcoin-without-using-a-centralized-crypto-exchangeQuoteThe crypto industry already offers ways to exchange cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin BTC for fiat money without using a CEX like Binance. However, such a process is associated with certain pros and cons and may require additional research.QuoteBitcoin ATMsBitcoin-enabled automated teller machines (ATMs) are probably one of the easiest ways to exchange fiat money for crypto and vice versa. Like conventional ATMs, Bitcoin ATMs allow users to deposit and withdraw money using cash or a debit card. But instead of a bank account, a Bitcoin ATM requires users to have a BTC wallet address to deposit or withdraw money.What I know is that bitcoin ATM is getting regulated and they have operators, it requires verification for high amount and sim verification for low amount of coins. In my view, bitcoin ATM are centralized.QuotePeer-to-peer Bitcoin exchange platformsPeer-to-peer (P2P) Bitcoin exchange marketplaces are among the most common crypto exchange options alongside Bitcoin ATMs. Such platforms allow users to trade digital currency directly with each other without the need for a centralized third party to facilitate the transactions.While providing a more resilient option on the regulatory side, P2P services are often associated with security issues, according to Quantum Economics founder and CEO Mati Greenspan. P2P exchanges like Binance P2P or now-terminated Paxful and LocalBitcoins are “certainly a step in the right directionI thought they were getting what was P2P before, but they included that Binance P2P, including extinct Paxful and Localbitcoins are all P2P exchanges, but that is not correct, they are all centralized exchanges.QuoteCrypto on-ramp/off-ramp integrations on software or hardware walletsAnother common way to buy or sell crypto without a CEX is using an on-ramp or an off-ramp solution provided within a self-custodial wallet through a third-party payment provider.Software wallets like Exodus and hardware ones — like Ledger and Trezor — offer several methods to deposit or withdraw Bitcoin using default software through various payment integrations. Such wallets often allow users to buy crypto or cash out their coins using bank transfers, debit or credit card payments, Apple Pay and other options, depending on the country of the user’s bank location.Those integrated exchanges on noncustodial wallets are either instant exchanges or bank transfer exchanges. Their fee is very high and they are all centralized. I like Cointelegraph because they give some news that are good and worth people to know what is going on but sometimes I am always convinced that they are just given newbies wrong information. This is absolutely wrong information from Cointelegraph.",

While in centralized exchange, you're send your coin to the exchange and same with the other users.I believe the point that Op is trying to make is that centralized exchanges cannot fully run a P2P platform cause they operate as regulators and the seller has to send to the exchange and then they send to the buyer after the seller confirms the payment.It looks something like P2E2P not P2P.The thread could be worded better but the general idea is that the article by cointelegrapjh is misleading and could confuse newbies.",

You must do your own research to double check their review and grade on one service.Like there are differences between Coinmarketcap and Coingecko for Binance exchange. It is clearly when Binance had fud attack months ago, its rank on Coinmarketcap is always higher on Coingecko.

Bitcoin bus to assist the Fiat currency so if someone has Fiat and another has bitcoin, and the person who has bitcoin want to use Fiat to buy someone, he would meet the other who has Fiat and gives him the bitcoin unit that has equivalent with the fiat amount, then transaction would take place.

The sellers coins are put on hold by the exchange as the serve as the third party and should there be any problems they held on to your coins till it the issue is fixed.",

Promising right?lol.....As long as we're all using our local currencies in our daily lives - even if they were places that accept payments in BTC, it'll be limited - how are we supposed to run a P2P to get paid in our local currencies without the centralized exchange?? Is there a way to maneuver that?? Have you imagined how stressful it'll be to get linked with a trusted person without a third party? Secondly, Bitcoin trading isn't possible without FIAT which is what centralized exchanges have to offer.
