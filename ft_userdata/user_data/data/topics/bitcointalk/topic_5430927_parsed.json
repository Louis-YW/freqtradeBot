A gambling fortune can only be made in two ways:1) By getting lucky in games such as the lottery or games like slots with very high prizes.2) By betting professionally on games such as poker or sports betting, but it requires a lot of study, effort and dedication.Going to the casino and betting a few dollars on roulette, slots, etc. is not going to make you rich.

And since it's only for entertainment purposes, you should limit your deposit amount. I personally don't know about Bitsler and have never made a deposit there either, I only play on 2 sites ATM, they're Rollbit and Stake. Apart from that, I haven't played the original games either, except X-Roulette on Rollbit and Slide on Stake.About the gambling experience, my best experience was when I got max win at Gates of Olympus while playing at Rollbit.Quote from: MAAManda on August 14, 2022, 01:26:24 AMAfter some time playing Gates of Olympus on Rollbit, I finally got my first Max Win on Gates of Olympus on Rollbit. Still didn't expect to get this Max Win at the beginning of the game, usually I get Max Win after playing for a very long time. And as usual, withdrawals are very fast, Thanks Rollbit Replay: https://replay.pragmaticplay.net/w57gWFU8oc",

You question later has nothing to do with a betting site called Bitsler.Better to change your topic title to something like 'have you made good fortune from gambling'.Know that gambling is a way you can make profit or loss, but the probability of losing is far higher. Just gamble for fun and not a means of making money for you not to get addicted or using high amount of money because to lose is more centain than to win.",

To answer the other question, no, I'd only ever consider a \"fortune through betting\" to be something life-changing, anything less than that is just a pretty standard experience, probably enough to break even from all the bets you've made in your entire gambling experience. \"Losing everything\" may be something rare or something to be pitied, but when it comes to gambling it's actually somewhat of a normal occurrence, though may vary depending on what \"everything\" means but in this case it's mostly on your bankrolls per session anw.",

That's the worse way to lose in gambling playing a game that you don't know how to play, it's not good but hopefully, you enjoy learning while losing, $300 is a big amount next time if you encounter a new game, play the minimum like $10 to get acquainted with the game.Quote....

You're not the one, many gamblers avoid gambling the first time they lose but they always come back, because the memory of enjoying and the excitement of the game pulls them backQuoteWhat are your scenes. Have anyone made some fortune through betting. There are those who made fortunes but compared to the number of those losing big money you will be shocked by the number, the casinos are the ones winning compared to the number of gamblers who won against the casino.",

I think you're not the only one that made some mistake in the past by gambling it rather than holding the actual Ethereum but it's too late for regrets. We may never know if Ethereum will last but gambling it instead was the riskier thing you've done but it's always on you/us, if it's the other way around and you're winning that could have been a different story.",

There are some whales that still here but there profit can’t be considered as fortune since it’s just x2 or x3 of there normal huge bet which I believe not huge enough for them.Bitsler is well know in this forum since they are one of the biggest dice casino before that rival primedice and Bitsler. I remember I manage to win almost 2BTC in there but during Bitcoin price is 2K USD which will be worth a fortune if I didn’t sold.",

So after I also lost everything. That's why I try to avoid gambling. What are your scenes. Have anyone made some fortune through betting. Gambling is entertaining, the rewards are sometimes big, and it's not a lot of work. But if you are really trying to avoid gambling completely, I suggest you stay away from Gambling discussions as well. The more you are exposed to the idea of gambling, the more likely you are to start thinking about it. And it can be hard to stop once you've started. So if you're trying to avoid gambling completely, you need to stay away from any conversation that has anything to do with it.In the end, gambling is a risk. It might work out, it might not. There are some who can be successful with it, and there are others who can't. My belief is that moderation is the only way to play these types of games. Focus on what's important in your life instead of chasing an illusion.",
