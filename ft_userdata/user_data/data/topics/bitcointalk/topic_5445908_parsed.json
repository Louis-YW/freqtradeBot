  "content": "I was going through random videos on the internet and found this unique video which according to my understanding truly depicts the way any financial institution anywhere in the globe function. The video is from the epic show Three Stooges. I am not sure if anybody here has already shared it. In short, it is about lending fiat and how the fiat owed is repaid. Do let me know whether you believe that every financial institution is doing the same thing as shown in this video.",

      "body": "LOL! We all know that the banks always rotate money, and when they do not have a count of the money the lend they go after people like us. I was expecting Credit Suisse to collapse but in the end, UBS Group AG came to its rescue and bought it for a penny. In all these events every bank is rotating the money of its creditors who are people like us. Â It has now become common after 2008 but there is no end to such shit. I hope more and more people start investing in Bitcoin. I recently found an image that talks about the highest to a lowest market cap of brands in the world. Sharing it below.",

Some people may want to see to the end of the issues with those banks because they do not yet believe in Bitcoin, while others find more interest in other brands in your image than Bitcoin.But according to Zippia Statistics, there were only 3.16 million crypto wallets world-wide in 2015, but that number has grown by 96.2% in 2022, meaning there are now 84.02 million crypto wallets recorded in the whole world as of 2022. In the coming years, I know these numbers will keep increasing.QuoteI recently found an image that talks about the highest to a lowest market cap of brands in the world. Sharing it below.You should learn to add a source link to your image; the image is not clear, and I find it difficult to even identify the figures on those brands.",
