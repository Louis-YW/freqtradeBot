You haven't done any business with me to be able to say I'm scamming anyone, so let everyone make their own risks and decisions.Well just post proofs that it is truly not. You cannot blame most people because in general and for the common good, this kind of fix matches that will instruct you to contact them personally lead to scams. So showing proofs of probably your previous transactions would be beneficial also for your own legitimacy. In any case, this will remain high risk I would say.",

If the OP post anything, that is just also means to looking for someone to scam and nothing more than that. I have a friend which is like a junior brother to me, he told me about one in the past, I told him it is a scam but he did not listen but pay money and he was scammed. He was given some matches results and he lost them all. There can be match fixing but not in a way for people to make money because you can not know if the match is fixed or not and scammers are using that to scam just like what OP want to do. Also that there are laws that against match fixing.",

So many people have Fallen victim of this their lies And they have seen It as a means To extort money from innocent citizens.I Was watching a match last month in a beer Parlour And the game Was actually going on smoothly And suddenly the refree gave one of the players Red Card And the man sitting beside me told me that the match is fixed And I smilled And asked him how he came To know  about it or If he has any proof And  up till now he has not answered me.This idea of fixed matches, for me is one the ways scammers use To extort money from innocent Gamblers ,And they will not come up with any reasonable proof that confirms their Propositions .",
