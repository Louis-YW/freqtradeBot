  "content": "I'd like to raise awareness about a possible Romanian scammer, which is trying to fool people that he can offer money laundering check. I am not sure if he managed to scam anyone so far, but what is certain that he follows all patterns of a scammer.What happened: the scammer alleges that he has thousands of BTC, ETH and TRX addresses addresses which are marked for being used in illegal activities / unusual behavior. He asks money for checking if client's (BTC / ETH / TRX) funds were used in illegal activities.Scammer's Profile Link: saxydevReference Link: Anti money laundering service checksAmount Scammed: unknown.Payment Method: the scammer is willing to make deals only through PMs or Discord, not in plain sight.Proof of Payment: N/A so far.PM/Chat Logs: N/A.Additional Notes: saxydev appeared recently inside Romanian board, starting to say various ridiculous things inside the translated topic of 1miau's Why people should be using SegWit addresses. OP declared himself against SegWit, signaling that it has all sort of problems, but without specifying anything. He tried to act smart, like talking in riddles but, in fact, it was clear that he is a mere illiterate underclassman, probably barely able to spell his name. Although I, NeuroticFish and also PrivacyG tried to reason with him, explaining that, if you have something to say, make sure you say it clearly, he did not act accordingly at all.Later he joined another Romanian topic, defending the imbecility called Pi Network. He just writes idiotic stuff and, together with his level of very low education reminds me a lot of another Romanian imbecile, andulolika, which, among ban evasion and making death threats on the forum was also trying to scam forum users through various schemes (you can check the feedback I left him).Make sure you read OP's Trust feedbacks -- saxydev sells \"input analysis\", which besides being fundamentally pointless, is against Bitcoin, as he treats the currency as non-fungible. I don't say he's a liar or a scammer; just a neutral warning of what kind of person you're about to be dealing with. (from BlackHatCoiner)Excepting all of the above, I wrote this warning inside his thread, but my post was quickly deleted. Most likely, saxydev created his service topic with self-moderation to be able to delete any post incriminating him. My deleted post can be seen below.Although I have no clear evidence that he is a scammer, all these hints suggest me that it's better to avoid OP. If you are interested in dealing with him, approach him with very high caution!. Be it andulolika's alt or not, saxydev seems to run enough shenanigans for being safe to avoid him.Update (Jan 27th, 2023): the scammer exposed himself as being a scammer within this thread, after scamming user dkbit98 with 0.1 BTC representing a deal not honored by saxydev. As a consequence, I also updated topic title from \"Be careful with saxydev; he is a possible scammer\" to \"Be careful with saxydev; he is a scammer\".What happened: dkbit98 made him the offer to prove that saxydev is selling a service which is free for the Internet; the offer was to have dkbit98 post such a website and, in case he will do it, to have saxydev pay him 0.1 BTC; saxydev denied that such thing exists and accepted the deal, after trying twice to cancel it unilateral.Scammer's Profile Link: saxydevReference Link: Be careful with saxydev; he is a scammerAmount Scammed: 0.1 BTCPayment Method: BTCProof of Payment: N/A so far.PM/Chat Logs: the agreement was sealed at post #20 of this thread.",

      "body": "First, you are an idiot seeking attention when someone disagrees with him.I was not against segwit as technology, I am against the compromises arround implementing segwit.I did not defend PI, I just stated facts, they are traded and they have a blockchain, even said in my post that they are ponzi/pyramidal system.And you are the second after JollyJohnyBeGood who called me an alt of someone, from alt of eliale, now I am alt of andouluka. Well mr. NewsletterBitcoin fuck off.Giving a feedback as opinion instead of actually doing a trade, means you have some mental frustration, probably momi issuesYou are not incriminating me, you just don't know what you are talking about lolEdit 1:About pi:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5435710.msg61630339#msg61630339Translation using google cause I am lazy: QuoteIt's not like that, they changed the story. The coins in the phone, the mined ones, were never \"mined\". In fact they went on a testnet to constantly test the wow stuff that pi has been implementing and changing the world for 6 years now.Plus, they added a rule that shows the beauty of a pyramid system, when you transfer them to your wallet, they block them compared to what you selected. And they recommend that you block them for 3 years. Many received on main-net but are blocked.I get asked by pi at least once a day, I'm really aware of their changes lol.The real currency exists, and they have been transferring coins since then. A friend/acquaintance who has nothing to do with crypto took out about 4000 euros from pi through me. He did kyc, they gave him the coins and I sold them to him. But they canceled 3 quarters of the \"mined\" balance. To withdraw the mined money, your friends must also do kyc. Ponzi/pyramidal, scam, they made money only from advertisements, the good part is that they have not directly asked for donations until now to update to premium plans like Sweatshit does for example.QuoteWell.. : https://www.pi-blockexplorer.com/https://www.huobi.com/support/en-us/detail/84926622541921You don't need KYC to use the wallet, you need KYC for \"mined\" coins (bs).However, it seems that the story of the pi people is becoming real, they made a lot of money with this shitEdit2:About segwit:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5398988.msg61600878#msg61600878QuoteSegwit seems to solve a problem, but as an update after 8 years, after 2 years of debate, it was just a signal that it is possible to move in the direction of change through compromise. The compromise showed that all pools, miners, etc. have priority.Indeed, as a technology, it is an improvement to use compared to legacy, but not enough and not as significant as it is praised by topics like yours. That's what I wanted to say in my reply. The background of the change and the whole history is such a big story that I, a user of crypto for several years, cannot accept it and just go with the legacy. I'm not a fan of BCH, also on principle, although I enjoyed the airdrop quite a lot.I suspect that in the years to come, at some point, when the reward per block will change, we will again have a soft fork, which again will not be in our interest, ordinary mortals, but will solve the problems that segwit has them, has them and is creating them now.----If being against something in this forum is giving the right to someone to accuse, I will leave it.Same happened with the case of JollyJonnyBeGood: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4975753.msg61200521#msg61200521When you are against some popular opinions you are the mf'er. Well, dear NewsletterBitcoin fuck off",

And contradictory posts should be deleted by those who are scammers or likely to be a scammer.Obviously. Needless to say, AML checks are allowed only to institutions authorized by authorities. Nobody would authorize an underclassman for performing AML check. My warning to other users is this in fact: as long as someone is illiterate enough to not be able even to spell his name, be very cautious. If the person is an imbecile then certainly a deal can go bad, as he does not understand what he's doing. If he knows what he's doing then his very low intellect may lead to other problems. If he's just an underclassman but agile in shenanigans, then most likely he'll try to scam you.Quote from: saxydev on January 21, 2023, 07:01:18 PMI had to unignore you to quote your post ;( ! A sad moment for me!Oh no! Almost crying here. I'm sure shasan feels the same.Quote from: saxydev on January 21, 2023, 07:01:18 PMHe's post is a spam.Probably you wanted to type \"his post\" instead of \"he's post\". Then again: when you are an illiterate is difficult even to spell correctly \"a-ha\".Quote from: saxydev on January 21, 2023, 07:01:18 PMAccusing me in my thread of being the alt of someone else and saying that anti money laundering checks are scammy/illegal or dangerous is a SPAM.AML checks are illegal, as long as they are not authorized by the govern. AML checks are not scammy but you are scammy. Last, but not least, AML checks are not dangerous; dealing with you is dangerous.Quote from: saxydev on January 21, 2023, 07:01:18 PMHe did not made a constructive post to my thread and more I can delete any post in a self-moderated thread.For other users the post was constructive. Same as this topic is.Quote from: saxydev on January 21, 2023, 07:01:18 PMAlso he insulted me, so it's my right to delete his post.What is the insult?Quote from: saxydev on January 21, 2023, 07:01:18 PMUnfortunately NewsletterBitcoin dissapointed me ;(Now I'm really crying.",

I know lots of people from this domain and those for free or that offer a trial, 95% are scams or inacurate.Read again, I was not supporting Pi network, I was just stating facts. They have an exchange where to buy and sell crypto (huobi), they have main-net etc.And about their request of KYC, I know what means privacy and I am against useless kyc in crypto world, but they are not the first to require it. And I saw most of the old members when other coins requested it, people to recommend it.And again the shit pi network is one of the most used crypto out there, there are more pi in personal wallets as worldwide than btc's at the moment, even if it's shit and it is testnet. Pi has 50 mil downloads only on google play and Mycelium only 1 million, Metamask 10 mil only. Versus other scams, they did not ask yet for money from people.

If you can point me to a service which is up to date, that offers it for free, I will offer you as well for free a lifetime of BTC/ETH analyse which costs arround 200$ each.I don't care about your lifetime BTC/ETH analyse, whatever that is, fact is that you are 100% using some third party tool, and I could prove it easily but I don't want to waste time on that.Another fact is that you know nothing about Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency, and if you love pi network crap so much than use your ''analyse'' for pi newtork not for bitcoin.I doubt even a single person from forum ever paid a cent for your magical ''analyse'' of anything. Dude, there is not such a service for free anywhere. What are you even talking about? You can try a lifetime pointing me to a free service. There is none.",

His topics, not his posts! And, by looking at the topics he started, we can see names as:Information about cyprus banks -- here he was looking for advice on how to move 200.000 euro from a Moldavia bank to an Italian one. I wonder how could this pauper make 200.000 euro...Looking for information about ransom attacksLooking for a paper -- here he was looking for a paper (?!) -- \"I am looking for this paper: Discerning payment patterns in Bitcoin from ransomware attacks\"Interested in finding the real owner of a btc address - 40$ XMR -- \"Please don't make it public, sensitive matter (not personal).\"Looking for hacks on the TRX network, stolen funds on TRONAnd the list goes on. Furthermore, inside each topic he offered a shitty amount of money (5$ - 10$) for those giving him good information. For me, it seems like saxydevs tries to learn as much as he can from previous scams and then try to repeat them.Maybe the topic which shows the most his scammy character is this: Maybe some hacks should not be illegal.Quote from: saxydev on September 01, 2022, 05:49:59 PMWhy stealing btc from someone's private key is seen as malicious?Seriously? What honest person would ask this?Besides, one reply says things bluntly:Quote from: ryzaadit on September 01, 2022, 07:40:27 PMQuoteWhy stealing btc from someone's private key is seen as malicious?In this question, you question stealing right?What else can be thought about someone asking such questions?Quote from: saxydev on January 23, 2023, 05:04:37 AMDude, there is not such a service for free anywhere. What are you even talking about? You can try a lifetime pointing me to a free service.

You need this information in order to find ransomware attacks or when ransom money are being laundered, who is laundering, from where is the source of funds or if the ransomware was paid. Most of the organisations always pay but they deny paying it.I recommend bleepingcomputer as forum for this or https://www.vx-underground.org/ or my favourite https://id-ransomware.blogspot.com/ .-the paper - if you will try to read from time to time, you will see why it is important to learn more about certain topics. Read the paper, great read!.-real owner - when there is a hack or a scam, people are looking for details about who own's the address. NewsletterBitcoin is not the owner (I found out who he was).-stolen funds on trx - there is not much information about trx just available online, even tho 42% of usdt blackmail attacks are paid through trc20. But of course, NewsletterBitcoin is new to this, he needs to find out about usdt first.The discussion about keys is fun, not your keys, not your coins. If I have your key, are these my coins? That's interesting enough to debate, happened recently on this forum with yogg. Were those his coins if he had the keys? People will decide, not me.For me NewsletterBitcoin is bored and he wants reach his weekly post requirment for the signature campaign.",
