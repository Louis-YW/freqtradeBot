  "content": "The current owner/operator of the deadsea33 account created a thread trying to get a neutral tag (placed by hugeblack) removed hugeblack made false accusations against me.  but locked it.After the drama within the now-locked thread brought him unexpected inspection of his deadsea33 account, he has locked the thread without providing an explanation and without even defending himself against accusations as well as against the strong evidence. Of the 39 posts made in that thread deadsea33 only posted twice (#1 and #3) before locking it.The timeline speaks volumes:8th July 2023:- hugeblack leaves neutral trust: Looks like this account has been hacked/bought, deleted a lot of posts, suddenly starts distributing merits, and may have several alternatives in his trust history. - deadsea33 creates the hugeblack made false accusations against me. thread and makes two posts in that thread.12th July 2023:- deadsea33 locks the thread14th July 2023:- deadsea33 makes another post but in the SINBAD.io MIXER July Bitcoin Price Prediction Challenge by placing a guess to the value of Bitcoin in the hope of pocketing some BTC.16th July 2023:- still silence from deadsea33 even though he logs in to the forum account regularly including today.==========In the 8 days from 8th July 2023 when he started the thread against hugeblack until today, deadsea33 made just one post and it was an attempt to try to predict Bitcoin price and he locked his own complaint thread without explanation. It seems highly likely deadsea33 is not the only account under his control and he has probably accepted he cannot use it in the way he hoped with signature campaigns therefore is milking it for what he can by posting in the price prediction thread while trying to keep his other accounts unconnected. He created the thread hoping to get momentum from members behind him to pressure hugeblack in to removing his tag but it did not work therefore he locked the thread without challenging the alternative views. Looking at the manner in which deadsea33 has conducted himself it will be difficult (if not impossible) for any member here to defend his actions.Maybe the current owner/operator of the deadsea33 account will use this thread to give an explanation.",

This may be considered but haven not come to explain and show proof as the original owner has disqualified him of being the first holder of that account.I guess by now he is roaming the forum with his alt.But nottheless, what do you think would likely happened to account since he wasn't able to defend himself, should it be pama ban or give a tempo ban?",
