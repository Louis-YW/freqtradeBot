The only downside about these gambling sites is the games, both of them only have one game but the rest checks out.I saw this thread before I slept yesterday, I couldn't post to the thread because all the gambling sites that I know all require KYC. Even if there is any that do not require KYC, we should still know that they are not decentralized but centralized and can request for KYC at any anytime, making it mandatory.  But aside the KYC part, gamblings sites that have official thread on gambling board on this forum are recommended, especially those with active thread and active official account that can respond to anyone that come up with issue on this forum about the gambling site.",

Though there are some site that may consider you with little amount if withdrawing without going through such process but seeing that you have a very large volume deposit/withdrawal will such affect you to go through kyc.Keep in mind as a gambler who gambles online must be ready to expose himself or herself to KYC it's unavoidable requirements from casino site.",

Looking his wager, he's a whale gambler and his winnings seems to be high. However if his plans were for huge withdrawal then it is quite hard to find such platforms, if not most of the platforms provide support with limitations.",

If you google KYC free casino, you will see a lot of results. However, since gambling has become so regulated in many parts of the world, it is not as easy as it once was to find a site that allows you to sign up without having to complete the KYC process. It used to be pretty common for some crypto sites to accept people from all over the world without having to go through that process, but those days are gone.As Don Pedro Dinero already mentioned, there is a thread by Mahdirakib where you can find basic information about the KYC requirements of most of the casinos promoted here: Information of Crypto Casinos License and KYC requirements, but I would still confirm that information with customer support before depositing funds at any of the listed casinos.",

Yobit also provides few games and never requires any KYC. Peeps Place also quoted Betcoin and Playbetr on another thread but I'm not sure they don't require KYC for high rollers.Only fully decentralized casinos would be totally safe, but we are still waiting for their release.Quote from: Peeps Place on July 02, 2022, 12:37:12 AMNitrobetting, Betcoin, Playbetr, Freebitcoin are sites that never ask for KYC unless you use a VPN. @IndependentGambler When you open a thread in this section it's better to create it in self-moderated mode to avoid spam.",
