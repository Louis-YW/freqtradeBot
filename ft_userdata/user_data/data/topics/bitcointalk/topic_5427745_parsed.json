Using bitcoinqt I mean you're not supposed to reuse addresses but this makes it too complicated So from what I understand if people want to use multisig they can't not reuse address?Isn't the descriptor for that? So the descriptor works for one address only?[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

Using offline: Ubuntu 22.04 , bitcoincore 22.0 and ian colemanThe steps to \"workaround\" using iancoleman's BIP39 tool and Bitcoin Core will be long and technical, but it's possible.On the other hand, it's fairly easy in Electrum's GUI.Here are the steps if you really want to continue:In BIP39 tool:Type your mnemonic seed and BIP39 passphrase, select the correct coin.Scroll-down, go to \"BIP32\" Tab, select \"Custom derivation path\" in the client drop-down menu.Type the correct derivation path up to the \"script_type\" level of your wallet which has the standard BIP48 path of m/48'/0'/0'/1' for P2SH-P2WSH MultiSig;refer to BIP48 and BIP45 for the derivation path of other script types (BIP48 link & BIP45 link) and/or your wallet's derivation path to the extended master keys.After that, take note of the \"BIP32 Extended Private Key\" and \"BIP32 Extended Public Key\" below.Repeat all steps for other cosigner's keys.In Bitcoin Core:For example, I want a to restore an HD 2-of-2 Nested SegWit MultiSig (P2SH-P2WSH) [RegTest]:[1] Create 2 blank Cosigners wallets with \"Blank Wallet\" and \"Descriptor\" checkboxes ticked.[2] Create 1 Watching-only wallet with \"Disable Private Keys\", Blank Wallet\" and \"Descriptor\" checkboxes ticked.This is for unsigned raw transaction creation in the GUI since you've mentioned it in your other thread and you wont be able to create unsigned transacting using the Cosigner wallets (as of v24.0.0).[3] Now the hard part, create the descriptors based from the extended keys that you have.Sample Cosigner 1's Extended keystprv8j6Rs3aMoX1iGB9RVgYViW1JDyBrqNF2ZXEc5h8qYdMeJeP8RAZ2JyEBENC69RW8E7KnRS9TcdY ytCSwnBmHf5cDtM35UdphibSWFaVvunutpubDFnU1TcbwthP9eBDPLD67ufQnzhnzhRw8pqPNDB8xuA398du3ZNcVTr3QXNfDfGWLC2sB9PBqcb ycszg9P795mm1u56ksDbvs59JyDjPCSnSample Cosigner 2's Extended keystprv8iRCdgDxePisb7TXVSVQ4qceiphq9aXUNzabLsYSNz6PnWkhKAX3t5PcM134tZXkAX6jTxHDujq GDAyEzEdDoRztK3LA6srFcvwMJtMDzLctpubDF7En6GCnmQYUaVKP69zUFGmHrDmJuiNxJBNdPajoFtnd11TwZLe4a1UX8Pvkf2u6fU5EMjyr65 xyuDvq3TumNA8LwU8PtWRaicdzZ6EF2dThe \"sh(wsh\" multiSig descriptors from those extended keys will be (the keys' arrangement should be the same to your previous wallet):Cosigner 1 (Cosigner1's xprv, Cosigner2's xpub)sh(wsh(multi(2,tprv8j6Rs3aMoX1iGB9RVgYViW1JDyBrqNF2ZXEc5h8qYdMeJeP8RAZ2JyEBENC69RW8E7KnRS9TcdYytCSwnBmHf5cDtM35UdphibSWFaVvunu/0/*,tpubDF7En6GCnmQYUaVKP69zUFGmHrDmJuiNxJBNdPajoFtnd11TwZLe4a1UX8Pvkf2u6fU5EMjyr65xyuDvq3TumNA8LwU8PtWRaicdzZ6EF2d/0/*)))Cosigner 2 (Cosigner1's xpub, Cosigner2's xprv)sh(wsh(multi(2,tpubDFnU1TcbwthP9eBDPLD67ufQnzhnzhRw8pqPNDB8xuA398du3ZNcVTr3QXNfDfGWLC2sB9PBqcbycszg9P795mm1u56ksDbvs59JyDjPCSn/0/*,tprv8iRCdgDxePisb7TXVSVQ4qceiphq9aXUNzabLsYSNz6PnWkhKAX3t5PcM134tZXkAX6jTxHDujqGDAyEzEdDoRztK3LA6srFcvwMJtMDzLc/0/*)))For the Watching-only wallet (Cosigner1's xpub, Cosigner2's xpub)sh(wsh(multi(2,tpubDFnU1TcbwthP9eBDPLD67ufQnzhnzhRw8pqPNDB8xuA398du3ZNcVTr3QXNfDfGWLC2sB9PBqcbycszg9P795mm1u56ksDbvs59JyDjPCSn/0/*,tpubDF7En6GCnmQYUaVKP69zUFGmHrDmJuiNxJBNdPajoFtnd11TwZLe4a1UX8Pvkf2u6fU5EMjyr65xyuDvq3TumNA8LwU8PtWRaicdzZ6EF2d/0/*)))You'll also need descriptors for the change addresses which are basically the sameexcept for the trailing \"/0\" path after the master keys;

Then you can set up a watch only HD multi-sig Electrum wallet which is pointed exclusively at your own server. And then you can use airgapped Electrum wallets on your two airgapped laptops. You can then broadcast Electrum transactions via your own server via your own full node.Quote from: JohnyD1 on December 12, 2022, 03:58:25 PMIan coleman does use 15+1 words instead of 12+1 (extended word)...There is a drop down box on Ian Coleman which allows you to customize the number of words.Quote from: JohnyD1 on December 12, 2022, 03:58:25 PMyou would be ok would something like ian coleman that comes/uses out of python3 right o_e_l_e_o?You can certainly do much worse than Ian Coleman, but personally I would still prefer to use reputable wallet software such as Core or Electrum to generate my entropy over a website.",

      "body": "Ah so I would get a full node with bitcoin core plus electrum and simply point my electrum to my node (can they run on same device?), nice idea.Ok I'm probably sticking with this.The thing that annoys me is ubuntu 22.04 uses fuselib3 and it requires to install fuselib2. I'm going to make a guide for my friends and me amd everyone i onboard to bitcoin using strictly ubuntu + bitcoin core + electrum (now) and airgapped devices. Since it is easier to use electrum, i hope core can easily create multisigs sh(multi(x in future then i can drop electrum 😆.I mean there is a ton of laptops in secondary market 🤣.Thanks for all the help once again.Also removing WAN and bluetooth from the laptops (physically).",

The best airgapped devices are ones which physically can never connect to the internet again, not simply ones which could connect but hopefully don't.",

EPS require you to add xpub/address manually on configuration file and each time you add new xpub/address, EPS have to send rescan request to Bitcoin Core which take some time.",

If OP will simply be setting up a solitary multi-sig HD wallet, then it is quick and straightforward to import his xpubs to EPS, scan once, and then be good to go. And you can of course choose to only scan from a set height, so if it is a newly created wallet you do not need to rescan at all.",
