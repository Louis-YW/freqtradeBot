That’s why I don’t post as much anymore.I am public and have been around for a long time. My word is my bond and I will not lose my reputation in this forum over $1000.Otherwise, I don’t have much collateral to offer as all my altcoins are all very down.The lender will have to trust that I will do what I say.I hope this helps.",
