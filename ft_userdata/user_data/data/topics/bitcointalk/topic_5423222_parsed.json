There is usually pumping, and dumping involved with cryptocurrency, if you buy an Altcoin when it is pumping, if you have made your profit, it is best you trade it for a stable coin to secure your investment, rather than waiting for it to pump more. Waiting to make more profit after you have made a reasonable profit from an altcoin is greed and can make you lose your investment.",

      "body": "I am feeling sorry for the devaluation of your investment. But my goodness! Did someone convinced you to invest in those specific coins? Why did you invest $15,000 on projects that are not even in the top 50? Newly launched coins and small market cap coins are not the best for people that are new to crypto. And those coins are not for the long term due to their very high risks. They are often called lottery coins, your money might reach x200 but your investment value can also drop to x-200 folds if they fail. I am not against investing in lottery coins but the amount should be something you are willing to lose.",

But what you are saying is only true for your portfolio filled with altcoins, those altcoins will go up again or never will.

You can fix this in the future as long as you don't give up because of a fairly large loss. When we come into crypto investment we have to be prepared to experience something that will result in us losing. And also we have to be smart to take advantage when we get it. Don't let greed rule your mind.",

My portfolios were also decreasing so hard like you but im not even feeling worry as i never lose my money but i just my unrealized profit. The key must be the bullish sentiment that can bring back your money again. I do know how you do feel once you bought them at the top of price and then your portfolios were decreasing so hard like roller coaster.

In investing in crypto, when you have seen multiple profits, that's the right time to take your profits immediately before the opportunity is gone. You have had previous experience and must be able to learn from that experience so that you are not greedy and can take advantage at the right time. Hopefully, all your coins can increase again in the next altcoin season so that big profits can replace your losses. So, for now, you have to be patient and keep trying to invest in bitcoin.",

I think that there have been many people who faced the same problem like you. You must not disappointed yourself. You are still having another chance to make it back again.

Last but not the least is planning or future plans. We can just jump in without a plan because there is a tendency that we will sell early or sell late. In short, we are going to be confused if what we are going to do.It's not wrong to skip selling and keep on hodling for the long term but what is only wrong on your part is that you pick up the wrong set of coins. If only you have invested in btc, eth and other top coins, then there is still a big chance that they will recover and you can still earn more with them.",

I guess this is just a lesson, however, what you got is just a paper lost, you didn't sell anything so what you see it just in paper.In any case, then just hold on your portfolio, and just wait for the right time to sell them. It might take years as we are still in the beginning of the bear market and it could be worst in the next year. So just brace yourself, look at the bright future and continue to accumulate and increase your portfolio. This whole crypto investing is a journey so it's better that you have the patience.",

However saving in the banks too have turned to be unprofitable, as the interest provided were very low and we don't have control over our funds.",

I think that what you can do just be patience and waiting for some luck to come very soon. I don't think so, if your portfolio and OP's are bitcoins then I would say what you say is true because bitcoin will always bounce back after the end of a bear cycle. But if it's an altcoin and like the OP, I doubt it would be a real losing investment, because altcoins' resilience is slim. The 3 altcoins that OP holds are just low cap coins and just a temporary trend in the market, if that trend can't return to the market don't expect your asset to recover.",

However when you buy stuff like vulcan, ispolink and myid, none of which I have ever heard before let alone can say anything good or bad, then you kind of deserved to lose money.Buy things that are up there and could be known by most of the world, not stuff that are low cap, because if you do then losing is inevitable.
