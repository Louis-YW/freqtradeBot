In other words what do I mean, since this restrictions are being lifted from their users there is every tendency that any account that involves themselves with cryptocurrency trading there must be a specific fee or percentages to be withdrawn to keep milking her citizens and I know the person on seat as a task collector who doesn't do anything without attaching values to it.This is Africa so there's nothing to be over joy of since they can't simply acts straight without attaching value to it.",

You'll pay up to 37% tax on short-term capital gains and crypto income and between 0% to 20% tax on long-term capital gains - although NFTs deemed collectibles may be taxed at 28%",

I believe that this new government will not joke with CBN banned on crypto and BTC in the country  because the new president is a someone that has idea on decentralized business and he has use it to build Lagos when he was a governor. And during his campaign he made mention of cryptocurrency that made me to believe that crypto users will breath in this new government.",

Those brothers wey dey rely on P2P sells, the government unbanning of bank account linked with binance no go still worry them because their business go still dey go on. Those people wey dey trade with them before fit still dey continue if them don make Dem good customer or worse worse Dem fit reduce price and instead wey dem go want go through binance, dem fit still continue with them. In fact them fit even no go back to the account again unto say naija government no dey straight forward. However, the advise be say we no need to dey rely on one business, we need to dey also put hand for other source for income.",
