Maybe its even necessary to keep the wins to one's self whenever it is the case. I see no need to want to prove a point when you actually responsible for the outcome of whatever investment you have with your funds.",

What if you are asked to provide proof of your win or asked to show the money you won, what will be your reaction? Maybe they will fake slips or borrow money to cover up the lies and deception. However, if you know that people close to you are not comfortable with your gambling life, keep it secret or quit. But I also think that every responsible gambler shouldn't suffer from external pressure especially if you are mature and earn your own money.  You don't have to lie just to please people, that's a big sign of immaturity.",

They feel ashamed for such disappointment and they want to hype themselves to be part of those winning too so as to take away shame of being losers. It is shameful sometimes when you have not won a bet.Sometimes too gamblers do that saying they won their bet while they didn't because they have boosted on the prediction that they have made to be a sure winning. Sometimes when you are watching live match with fellow bettors on a viewing center, a bettor can keep boosting about the match making others to regret the line of their bet while the game was going on and if things turn around in the match against the booster, he might still lie that he took another option and not the one he was boosting about. All these happen because people don't want to be associated with failure.",

Other people are those influencers who promotes a gambling site using demo money that they gamble and claim they won, it's a marketing side of gambling and we should all be aware of that. What we can only do to minimize the risk in gambling is to be real or to be true with our experience, we don't need to lie just to impress people as it's normal that we lose since the winning percentage of a gambler in the long run is probably just 1%, so don't convince people that we are exceptional when we are not.",

That's why they imagine themselves and tell other people that they won the game even though the truth is that they lost.These are the types of people who will never believe that no matter how much you advise them to slow down the habit of gambling or even if you want to advise them to stop gambling because it is addictive, they will not believe you. In fact, they are the ones who brag that they won that game and the amount they won was big, and as the person who gives advice to that gambler really knows that he loses cause he/she did not show any evidence but have many excuses.  There's really nothing we can do about their mindset, but hopefully, as gamblers we should know our limit and what amount we can bet. When you lose gambling, it will be mixed with frustration, depression and worse, you might do bad things just to feed your gambling habit.",

I just think each case has to be analyzed in particular, without judging gamblers or casinos in advance, that is, without further evidences.

But this false statement won't last long, because the family will demand from the gamblers if he won money, why not spend on them but in fact they will see that the gambler is actually making use of the household money and the claim of win is just a false statement.For outside people and friends, other than those who live in the gambler's house, he may tell the falsely that he is a successful gambler and wins more than he loses. Those people may believe him because they do not live in his house and they never know how he lives and carry out his day to day expenses.",
