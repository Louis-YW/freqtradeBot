CZ considering its not a big deal but someone manage to get extra 2M BNB on his blockchain and 97M USD of it got escaped. This is very huge amount since the liquidity on exchange will suffer and it will not be paid by CZ using his own pocket. BNB holder should think twice and re-evaluate there position for investing with this such blockchain that viewing this kind of loss as contained. There is a possibility that this might happened again in the future so while people still blindly invest on this kind of blockchain by just looking at Binance exchange.",

There is a likelihood to see more hacks in the crypto environment, if not to BNB, maybe another. This attack on BNB should spur others to improve their security against hackers.",

While the markets are going smoothly, we do not face these hacking events. But whenever the markets go bad, we always face hacking incidents. In general, it always happens in these hacking events from the cz end to the coast. Let's see what is going to happen.The condition of the market doesn't have to do with the timing of the hack unless it is organized by the people inside.  Hacker attacks whenever they got access to the platform.  They have to do it quickly the moment they break in or else it will be too late for them to move funds if the exploit is discovered.",
