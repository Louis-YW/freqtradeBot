  "content": "Hello, I am offering a service where I am hiring people and first of all people are calling me out for being a scammer with absolutely no evidence or idea of what I am even offering as I am providing the details of the task to only people interested in doing the task/assignment. They have no idea what the service even entails or what I am even offering, but they somehow seem to have come to the conclusion that I’m a scammer and scamming people. These are completely fake accusations with no basis for the claims. There is a trusted user, yahoo62278, who has left me negative feedback with these fake accusations on my profile and that will affect my business I do on this forum in the future. His judgement, analyzation, and review of scammers is way off and incorrect as I am not scamming anyone and I am sure his judgements and accusations have been way off for other people as well. His feedback will affect the business I do on this forum, especially because he is a trusted member and it shows up very clear on my profile. There is absolutely zero evidence and they are baseless and incorrect claims.Here is the thread on the assignment I am hiring people to do - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5403151.msg60399496#msg60399496",

I do not feel like the feedback is unjust as you are asking users to be very vulnerable.Quote from: WalrusTusk on June 18, 2022, 08:14:49 PMHello, I am hiring four people to do an easy task. The task will take you approximately 10-15 minutes to do. This will require:1) Your own bank account2)$6.50 in your account you can spend3) An iPhone or Android phoneThis task requires up to a 30 day waiting period to receive your funds.You also refuse to escrowQuote from: WalrusTusk on June 18, 2022, 11:57:55 PMI wouldn’t be open to using escrow for this task as you are not risking any funds and also it would complicate the process of doing the task. The $6.50 also never leaves your ownership. If you are still interested shoot me a PM. Whether the funds leave someone's possession or not, I find it a bit shady. Then telling users they may wait up to 30 days to be paid??? I would assume this has something to do with an app and you likely have no access to their bank info(i could be wrong), but you are asking users to spend money with the promise of being paid and offering them literally 0 protection of you saying fuck off i'm not paying you.My tag is a warning to users, nothing more. They are free to still do business with you if they wish. I will let users discuss whether the tag is appropriate and see what they think is fair. I'm open to removing the tag if the community thinks its unfair. FYI His judgement, analyzation, and review of scammers is way off and incorrect as I am not scamming anyone and I am sure his judgements and accusations have been way off for other people as well. kudos to you for having the balls to claim something against me, whether it's valid or not. I wish others didn't hide behind alts when making accusations against users.",

I wish others didn't hide behind alts when making accusations against users. No problem on the PM. Well for this you are just way off I am not a scammer and am not running any scams. It is a full and legit deal I am offering. The assignment is fully legal and not breaking any laws as well or any site, company, or business policies. I am not offering escrow because of the nature of the trade. For the people who are hired it would complicate the process and slow things down when the assignment they have to do is short and simple. Also I do not see anything shady about being paid up to 30 days after the task is done. The people I hire for the task may be paid much earlier, but it’s just a timeline for the maximum wait for the pay. This is all part of the assignment I am hiring people for and the people who want to work it have no risk of losing out on anything.",

I read his thread and got the same impression from it.  Escrow and the $6.50 up front aside, the fact that he only gives details of the offer via PM is totally sketchy, and this comment from a member who apparently did get the details doesn't put my mind at ease that this isn't something illegal or dangerous to whoever goes along with it:Quote from: hZti on June 19, 2022, 07:13:01 AMI think this is some kind of a scam and can’t recommend to do it. You have to sign a contract, there is no escrow and in the app you are supposed to put in your private banking data. All details that can later be linked to your account here. And in the end there is not even a garantee  that you will get payed for all of this since he won’t use an escrow.So OP, it's no wonder you got tagged.  Unless you reveal what it is you're doing, the fact that people have to enter their bank info into some kind of app is going to make people suspicious.  Maybe if you get people who did whatever it is you're trying to get them to do to report back that they got paid and weren't at risk of identity theft or some such thing, your red trust could be removed--but that's up to yahoo62278 and whoever else decides to tag you.",

The bad thing about scammers is that they want to convince you that they are good people with no bad intentions, otherwise they wouldn't be able to scam anyone.In the unlikely event that what the OP proposes is legitimate, let him do what The Pharmacist says:Quote from: The Pharmacist on June 19, 2022, 10:11:23 PMMaybe if you get people who did whatever it is you're trying to get them to do to report back that they got paid and weren't at risk of identity theft or some such thing, your red trust could be removed--but that's up to yahoo62278 and whoever else decides to tag you.We would also have to see who is reporting and if it is a single person, etc, because a scammer could bring someone in cahoots with him here to try to convince us, but in general I agree with the idea.",

He sent me a couple pms while i was away earlierQuote from: WalrusTusk on June 19, 2022, 09:41:55 PMHow about I tell you the offer, you can see it is legit. Then if you want to you can post saying you’ve reviewed the assignment I am offering and it is a legit offer. I only want the assignment being told to the people who are hired, but since you are a trusted member I will tell it to you, so you can verify it is legit. Once you verify the assignment is legitimate though when I send it to you I would ask that you remove your negative feedback. thenQuote from: WalrusTusk on June 19, 2022, 10:18:27 PMActually sorry about this, but I do not want to reveal the work the people I am hiring will be doing unless the person is hired for the job I am offering. So retract the offer I sent you earlier about sending you the full assignment. I posted/shared what I am comfortable with sharing about it to anyone not participating. I may have agreed to look at his offer but since he changed his mind it makes it look even more like a scam.",

Just because my ratings, feedback, and dealings are not public to you doesn’t mean I am a fraud or scamming people. I also do not owe you an explanation for anything involving my business.If you don't owe anyone any explanation about your “business” then I don't see why you are bitchin' about people being suspicious of your business activity. We see scammers here every day with such business offers.If the dealings are private, then what's the point of announcing them here?Be transparent and prove that you are legitimate, or continue with your private dealings and quit bitchin'. Simple as that.",

I will let users discuss whether the tag is appropriate and see what they think is fair. I'm open to removing the tag if the community thinks its unfair. Your tag is fair and appropriate based on the community's standard there are legendary members that offer escrow and transparency on what they are offering what makes him different, I would question or suggest an escrow or transparency if the one offering is even a trusted member, it's not the personality it's the offer that will satisfy the community, we have so many similar offers like this in the past and many of them ended in the scam section.",
