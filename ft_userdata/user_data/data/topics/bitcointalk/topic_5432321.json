Wasn't this clipboard type used when the text was copied?This happened to me as well back then; after typing everything you have in mind, you will end up losing everything with a single back or refresh of the page mistake, which is hugely annoying.The keyboard clipboard I used can save text for up to an hour and can be pinned, but it must be copied before it can be saved.QuoteYou could use an app as well for this though I can't recommend any from my findings since I don't need it nor had used it before.

Â  Why don't you copy+paste your post somewhere before you post it? I think it is easy to apply to any phone/smartphone. It is a very basic way, no need for any application. Even if it seems old-fashioned, it is easy to do and applicable.",

Also this forum is using SMF model where it will be impossible if you want such kind feature, maybe an extension would work but it will harm your privacy and security.However there's a development of new forum called as Epochtalk, maybe this could be an improvement for Epochtalk.What if you're type your reply on Microsoft Word first before send to this forum? even your PC/Laptop is shutdown, it's still can recover the latest version.",

Unfortunately you can't recover the text when you hit the refresh or reload page in your browser by mistake so the only way is to retype everything is what you can do.As precaution whenever you're creating a thread with long descriptions,images and multiple contents added with it, you can use notebook like apps before posting it on bitcointalk so you won't lose the words even if you closed the app by mistake, you can recover it at anytime until you delete it on your own after the confirmation okay click.",

And I post sometimes from the phone too.You should keep in mind that the forum is not an advanced text editor, it's not Word or so (also making it so would most probably hurt the users who use Tor and stripped down browsers for the sake of their privacy).Plus, on internet, it's not that unusual to lose your posts due to various errors and problems, it's not specific to this forum.So it's you who has to learn and improve.All this being said, the conclusions are:* there's no need for the changes you proposed* if you want to write larger text, consider using a software made for that job and then copy-paste it here* whenever you post here, you should copy the whole post into clipboard before submitting/posting it, so you make sure all is safe. When your error ratio becomes very small, you can stop doing this.",

I doubt they'll have redo features. I'd take a look at applications on f-droid. Probably, advisable anyway if you consider your privacy high priority. Anyway, from the forum's stand point we've got the drafts page which has already been mentioned. Not sure how convenient that is to use on a phone, since I don't use a phone to post here. Otherwise, again use a word processor or a text editor on your phone, and utilize the redo/undo features on there. Markor is one open source text editor you can use. Obviously, take a look at the source yourself. I doubt this feature would be implemented, since we already have the preview feature.",
