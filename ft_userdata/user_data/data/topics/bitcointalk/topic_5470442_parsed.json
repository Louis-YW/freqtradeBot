Drake can afford to let go as his part of support to the casino if he had placed the bet online his loss is the casino's win reason why there is no sure bet,  even though he had all the statical support for his straight winning but then gambling results are unpredictable.",

This can be called double cross gambling  Seriously his curse is something else, could remember him betting on Barca to win last year’s el Classico and he ended losing. The other was him betting on Argentina to win the World Cup against France and the game went to penalties and Argentina won but Drake’s bet was for regular time",

But the fact that his series continues is very funny. By the way, is it really continuous or sometimes did his high roll bets bring profit? In general, when I read news like this, I have a desire to play against him, but one of my favorite things to do is bet against the continuation of streaks (wins or losses), so I have a feeling that as soon as I bet against Drake, he will win",

You know when you are rich and have a lot of money people cannot tell if you are addicted to gambling or not. In fact their judgement of you is lenience because of course you have the money and you can do whatever you want to do with it. It is his loss not ours. I know I wouldn't bet $850k on a game.",

I have done the same when I know the fighter is a good grappler with more than half of his win being by submission, I would likely be betting for Submission as well. Sadly, sometimes it just doesn't go our way.  Anyway, Drake is a millionaire and such an amount isn't big for him.",

Him losing a million isn’t much different than a random guy with $100k losing $1k. You should also consider that this might be an act… You know there is a possibility that he didn’t lose anything. Sometimes people lie to get them sweet clicks/interactions. People lie all the time. There are thousands of people on utub that act like retards because it attracts people. You already think this Drake guy is cursed and creating a story for him. He is not the first dude in history with a bad gambling record.",

I don’t consider this as terrible if it’s Drake since that kind of amount is just his one round total bet on a roulette table the last time I watch his live stream playing on Stake live games.Back on topic, I rarely experience this because I don’t bet on a special conditional bet type of games. I’m more on match winner or handicap matches since predicting the exact outcome is really hard to do that’s why it’s odds is very high as a clear implication on how to hit it accurately.",

I mean, Logan can definitely knock out Dillon(but there is still no guarantee about that) but who would have thought that Dillon would try to choke Logan during the fight and get himself disqualified. anyway, I have to say, that Dillon knew he wouldn't win and could possibly get knocked out, and that's why he decided to do what he did. In his eyes, it is better to get disqualified than to possibly get knocked out.",

This is the same thing that happens with rich people when they go to physical casinos, they go to have fun at the casino. but this does not happen with middle class and poor people, they play to be lucky enough to get rich and in the process they make the mistake of putting emotions into games and this leads to addiction, and in many cases middle class people and poor people play to forget the problems of the real world, in some cases they are financial problemssee that the rich spend a lot of money on drugs, they lose money in casinos and on drugs, sex and alcoholic beverages is part of their daily lives, a person like Drake, without a doubt, when he loses in a casino he will also spend more money in bars and with other things and the next day more money enters his bank account. Those rich guys have a lot of people taking care of their business so they don't end up in poverty, so it's unlikely they would lose everything gambling.",

Gambling is a zero sum game, you either win or you lose, there is no partial payments or return of money on any result. Anyone driven by greed like this deserves to have it taken from them. However I'm skeptical that he even placed the bet, because he was rather shady in his dealing and endorsements from Stake.com, promoting them early on but only announcing a partnership a few months later. Either way, barring the disqualification the fight was extremely close and could have gone to Danis if he did not pull such a foul move. However the boxing world, even this offshoot of it, is all rather murky and it wouldn't surprise me if the outcomes were rigged in advance.",
