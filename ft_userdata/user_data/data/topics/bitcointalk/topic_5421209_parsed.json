Since it has experienced a boom phase, will the upside potential for MiniFootball Token diminish? that's only a token that worthy enough for the gambling purpose. That's pretty much the same like meme token which doesn't have any value. I think that majority of people know about that. Since world cup will be coming very soon and these minifootball tokens was paying more attention from gamblers. That's only a token for gambling and i don't see any good thing from that token. I would never call meme token as an invesmtent along with this token too. Quote from: EmpowNetwork on November 16, 2022, 08:31:43 AMOr perhaps there might be harsh corrections for the price to pump? What do you say about this?  That's a pump and dump token. Any pump or correction for this kind of token was just a common thing. Harsh correction may come when there would be a huge pump",

What do you say about this?  The ball is in your court, most meme coins are nothing more than what they are -  a fun meme and will not be worthy of any long or mid-term investment.If you are already invested in this coin from the beginning before it was pumped, my advice to you will be.... take your profit or better yet, take your entire investment and move, this is not the type of project to keep, once the correction phase kicks in, i doubt there will be any value left. You can only expect something from a meme coin when there is actual utility behind it, but in this case, i highly doubt that. So, it is up to you to do what is right with your funds. Invest wisely.",

What do you say about this?  It was all fun and games until someone lost his money but seriously, how can you say that it is fun when you did not put any description about this coin or you can just include a link so that we are the ones that will check it out. And just because it has a football word in it and it is a meme coin, it will now attract football fans and those who invest in Dogecoin? No that's not easy as that.But, it's true that the coin had boom already? So meaning this wasn't a new coin. I really thought it was new but you might be right that the potential for this coin have diminished already because many investors will leave after a coin pump and then switch to another new one again.",

What do you say about this?  There is not even a single word about use case, uniqness, advantage over competitors, marketcap etc. Just \"meme coin\" \"doge copy\" shitshow. So is it a lucrative investment? NO! Its a gamble on an asset with 0 value that its price sooner or later will hit 0 and buying this coin worse than \"grater fool game\" because of insiders that will most likely do rug-pull.Thats how you should research your investment - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5208144.msg53299809#msg53299809 After my post coin pumped 40x in 1.5 years. Never invest based on interesting name.",

If you know what I mean, most meme coins are only good at the beginning and due to hype but not with actuality just like any other successful projects.Probably good for now because of the world cup, and I’ve seen many hype as well with other football token. This can be a good opportunity to play long for now but then again this hype might also be seasonal so better to be careful with this and buy only if you can take the risk. I don’t see any good reason to hold this for long term, just do it for trading. Meme token is all about the hype, the early you buy the better.",

This is all because of people like Elon Musk who had got good control over the cryptomarket. Sure he'll be having some plans and he executes well at the right market condition.It is true that we were able to see something new on every bull market.

Does anyone believe that this could be an investment for 4 or 5 years from now? because I don't believe in it. these kind of things are just like ICO which was fashionable for a while but then disappeared and many people lost a lot of moneyQuote from: EmpowNetwork on November 16, 2022, 08:31:43 AMOr perhaps there might be harsh corrections for the price to pump? What do you say about this?  even if the price goes up, this is not something with a future, in a few years it will disappear, and also because they are meme coins they look more like pump and dump schemes, I don't buy these meme things, I even stopped using them doge coin since it started with pump and dump whenever the owner of twitter says something about doge coin, now there are many meme altcoins. probably the market will be flooded with this, there is always something for scammers to profit from in this market and people keep putting money into these schemes and they are making scammers rich",

What do you say about this?  I am curious to no if this token is given to fans in form of reward for the fans or is it listed in any exchange or market place where both fans and none fan of the club can buy the coins for either asap trades or long term holding.But since football take, it may end them more reputation adoption by both long-term and short-term clients.",
