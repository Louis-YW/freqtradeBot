  "content": "I was surprised when I saw this on Twitter. Because the hype on Ethereum during the past few months is very high because of \"The Merge\" where a lot of upcoming updates about Ethereum 2.0.I am curious why the smart contracts that are being deployed on Ethereum are decreasing. Even last year we saw a massive spike in the price of Ethereum and even the GAS fees.What could be the possible reason/s why it is decreasing?",

Perhaps most of the contracts were empty or outdated and users simply destroyed them because they were no longer needed. Maybe users create fewer smart contracts due to expectations of Ethereum's transition to PoS.",

I think that the point in checking is that they are having ETH as something profiting and not as project creation or something like that. Maybe they are trying to HODL only and therefore less movements in the blockchain.",

      "body": "we are still in the recovery process and still in a bear market maybe that's the cause where the developers don't make many smart contracts for their projects considering that transactions on the ETH network look quiet and after 2 years I just saw the cost of GAS ETH yesterday around 4 Gwei and that also means that not too many people do transactions on ETH so that's also why developers don't make smart contracts, I still see spammers making NFT smart contracts and it's boring there",

Yeah, I've felt that myself. limitations in making transactions, waiting for gwei to drop or very large fees are the problems of this.",

POS isn't any more centralized then with POW mining. Miners are just panicking that their rigs might be worthless after POS. POS has pretty much solid game theory behind it and it makes way more sense then trying to grow bigger and bigger pools and farms that funny enough are making current eth already centralized.But your points on 1 and 2 are spot on.",

This is also what I think, because of competitors.If you take a look at the chart, the decline started at mid-year 2020, which that the start when the market recovered and a lot of Ethereum alternative smart contract platforms popped and their TVL grew too fast just like Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, etc.",
