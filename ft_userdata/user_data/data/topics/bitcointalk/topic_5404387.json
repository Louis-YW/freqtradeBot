Think KickassTraffic was one of the longest around, they actually only added Bitcoin as a payment method later on, they were around from the mid-2000s paying in PayPal or other. Google PTC Bitcoin and filter search to those years, see if you get any hits.I actually did that in the late 90s, back when they actually paid dollars and not cents, and sent you cheques to anywhere in the world.

It will surely not cover the internet bills, it's an obvious waste of time. Maybe it could cover internet bills if one does the tasks with multiple accounts. Does it worth the time, even at that  multiple devices consumes more data. Lolx...Those early faucets, were they actually paying in bitcoins? If yes, it means that many btc were lost in early stages of bitcoin because some of those rewards are never claimed but might be paid. How fast things changed, I wished I was in thus space earlier.",
