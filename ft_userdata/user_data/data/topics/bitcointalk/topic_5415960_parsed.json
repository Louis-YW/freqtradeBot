In what price zone do you expect this year to close?Hopefully it would be already green for the last quarter or few months of this year.If we do look on the technical aspect then it had already formed that descending triangle which we could really presumeout that this might be the bottom line for possible reversal or change trend but we cant really be always sure and do still have those doubts.Even myself doesnt really expect nor being that too hopefulwhen it comes to this because you cant really be able to tell if the price would be making out that breakout on that strong support.Expect the unexpected as always and the most important is placing up yourself on the bottom, if not then do DCA as always.",

      "body": "This whole year has been a revision of prior pricing from the very top top back to the lows.  The only thing to debate now is have we finished the lowest prices or does it need to explore all of the prices in the teens before we are done.      I do think we can end the year higher at green if not a large magnitude move but I wouldnt want to bet on it until I see this next move complete or fail.  This is the 50 day average, I just need to see us trade above it convincingly for some time then I believe the whole quarter will be green and that too will be a confirmation of price action.  Ultimately we benefit from BTC being more solid and sure of its own pricing under stress not just hype, buyers who leave etc.",

Im noy expert on technical analysis but basic graph shows that its on consolidation and there will come a time it needs to break those hard resistance that weve been seeing these past few months. Of course Im not sure but accumulating now is good while everything is down. Well Im hoping for a good time it could recover and if not this year maybe in the next 2 yrs prior to bitcoin halving.",

And I don't see any lower lows, so it's good at least because there is a prediction that we might feel to a new floor price. But the price seems to be stabilizing just above $20k and this might be the case up to the end of the year.",

With the end of the year, it could still be in the 20k range or maybe lower. It's not supposed to be a big deal to have consecutive quarters on the red since it happened with the green. It can occur in the red as well. It's optimistic to see it in the longer term, but it wouldn't be for a short time.",

The first three quarters, they could be expected as the macro conditions of the whole global economy are in bad form thanks to the pandemic and all the economic response of countries. It definitely doesn't help that Russia attacks Ukraine and causes instability to the whole of Europe and even the rest of the world. But things are getting better now. So I'd expect Bitcoin to get better as well. Also October and even December are good months for Bitcoin. We will see if they repeat this time.",

When I calculated the three volatility, not up to 50%, not up to those of the previous times, this still make me want to believe that we still have the best year of less volatility if compared to other years.Fourth quarter is much more in favour of the bulls, but the low volatility still make me to be confused. Where bitcoin price is for now, it is confusing if the market may fall or not, maybe the consolidation would be at lesser price around $10000 to $15000, or if the price will increase or not.But what I think about this is that the price of bitcoin may not increase above $30000 until next year. If not increase to that price till next year, that means we may begin next year with bull run that can increase bitcoin price up to half of all-time-high which is around $35000 or slightly more.Nonetheless, it is good to hold now.",

Still, Q3/2014,Q4/2014,Q1/2015 for example were also consecutive red and, if we look like that even 4 consecutive red quarters did happen.Plus, these 3 months were not as bad (in percent) like the 2018-2019 reds.Quote from: Ratimov on October 04, 2022, 10:06:13 PMWhat are your expectations for the end of this year? In what price zone do you expect this year to close?30-35k is a good range for the end of the year. Even maybe a bit optimistic.I expect the bear market end in this Q4 and the price start slowly rise. Depending on how early or late the reversal happens, the price may get to only 25-30k, or to a better 30-35k.Quote from: _act_ on October 05, 2022, 06:28:32 AMNonetheless, it is good to hold now.That's correct.

There is still negative sentiment going on.If there are still people who are waiting for the last dip should already buy some because the market could show the opposite action too. Right now it's a cozy and uncertain situation going on in the crypto space because of the fed interest hike and Russia Ukraine war.",

Huge resistances that were formed this year are concentrated in that zone, and this is a good psychological support for investor sentiment. This optimistic level of 30,000 has been around since last year. 25-30k by the end of the year is also very likely.Opinions are now actively spreading regarding the fact that the Fed may curtail the rate hike program and this may favorably affect the crypto market.All this is correct, but... with recession knocking at our door people may not be so much willing to invest in anything, including Bitcoin, no matter how appealing it may look.And this can affect the price in a bad way even if the bear market ends.",

What is positive is that, despite everything, the price (for now) has not tested any lower levels and that we see some very interesting headlines in various mainstream media where they start to wonder how Bitcoin manages to stay on the surface while everything else sinks into the red.The longer we keep the current position, the better chances we have of not touching a new bottom, and this also means a better starting position for a new big bull run. Therefore, I expect the price to remain in the range of $18k to maybe a maximum of $25k, but with a very small probability that it will remain stable at the highest level.",

When you can't find any positive sign about bitcoin you should just wait and hold as much as possible. Bitcoin bullish trends are not always understood. No one knows when it will be bullish and when it will be bearish. However, in this unpredictable situation, following DCA is considered as a good decision.There has been no major bull run since the beginning of this year till today. Hopefully, the market is likely to be bullish towards the end of the year.",

I think another red zone is probable for the Q4, what isn't too bad anyway, because it's preferable to have a red zone for each quadrimester of the year with a low negative fluctuation, than having a positive quadrimester on the middle, but followed by an insane loss of 40% in the last zone, like it happened in 2018. Let's hope bitcoin remains stable, so once this yearly cycle ends, the expectations of the market will be renewed.

In a situation where the price would crash by as much as 50% compared to now, there are many more people who would panic sell, than those who would see it as an opportunity, and we see that with every serious price change.Now the most we need is the stability that Bitcoin shows in relation to fiat currencies, and if it lasts long enough, maybe it will help to change the perception of the common man who still has a generally bad opinion about Bitcoin.",
