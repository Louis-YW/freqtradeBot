  "content": "Hi, I’m running an old T15 with solar, and was just wondering if exist any newer ASIC SHA256 with low consumption (no more than 1500-1600w) and better efficiency. In worst case, was planning to get a used S15 that use more chip at lower power so efficiency is slightly better, but are there some alternatives?",

      "body": "Yeah you could use a S15 on low power mode, Or a S19 with only 1 hashboard connected and running. You could buy a broken S19 online, you will find a lot of them available, they are not expensive. The last time I gave this suggestion on the forum, mikeywith rightly pointed out that you should be careful about noise, and ideally have the other dead (or not connected) hasboards in the ASIC to reduce noise.A L3++ will give you a great ratio kw/h / hashrate, they are not too noisy, and even if it is a Scrypt ASIC, you could always swap the LTC/Doge to BTC (or directly mine with Nicehash to be paid in BTC)",

      "body": "Or snatch used S19s with one or two damaged/missing hashboards. A single S19 hashboard is about 1000W, or even less with the appropriate firmware... How many TH? about 33 TH/s per board at normal power.For example one of my reports is listing the S19j Pro 104 doing 64TH/s 1343W at the wall with (estimated) chip temp 38C, next most efficient report is the S19j Pro 100 doing 68TH/s 1459W temp 60. Those are two extreme examples using the full 3 hashboard miner, it is way easier when you simply disable/remove one hashboard or two.Its even easier with the XP: 141T doing 104TH/S for 1929W at 60C. The current cost/benefit imo is the S19j Pro.",

      "body": "Does the external cooling lowers the power consumption of any ASIC that we use to mine. Like in theory if machine is getting older then there is high chance of Chips getting hotter, withdrawing more power, to keep up the hash rate demand as it is programmed. So does this mean it gets more hotter and thus fans start running with 100% capacity and withdrawing more energy along the way. Will that be impacting more electricity. Or any of the above doesn’t really make sense because ASIC do not work in that fashion? On the contrary all of the above suggestions are to buy old machines which could be running on reserve oxygens so what’s the point anyways.",

Immersion has this advantage or remaining clean if the tank remains closed.External air cooling has the advantage of more CFM and with less noise too, especially when you can control something like the 8\" AC Infinity directly from the control board using the njord adapter.",

If this can be merged with the old ASIC then I think there is higher chances they would outperform with less noise and high efficiency. I’m now clear on one fact that the older the units the more unprofitable they get due to reduced hardware capability. The only fact that remains is whether cooling them to lowest plateau could help them boost their processing activity or not. I’m seeing hundreds of videos where immersion based tech is evolving very fast and it’s even widely used in gaming industries with high GPU powered gaming stations. I think similar steps can be taken into old miner installation if they are resistant to liquid phases.",
