      "body": "I thought NoTOKYC is an actual online casino at first, anyways. The link consists of few online casinos that doesn't require KYC before anyone can start gambling, thanks for the information but the problem is this list will go down in few years maybe, and that's because many no kYC casinos have started to ask for KYC verification, there is no way to evade this unless the casino is not popular and well successful yet. Some times I am even thinking that No KYC is a marketing scheme to attract people, because people do love to gamble without any verification, but running the casino for long is going to be a problem when the regulators come for the casino, there will be nothing else the casino team can do than to proceed with verification or risk getting fined and charges. My advice to everyone reading this is that casinos are not very far from forcing KYC verification on customers some days, enjoy these while they last. It's not the casino's fault, it's just the way things are in this world, The government always wants a piece of every pie.",

Unless decentralised casinos get popular in the next few months or years, regulatory trend is to force KYC, so you are right: casinos that don't ask for it have their days counted.More concerning that the governments getting their share is the destination of the personal documents and data you provide in order to fulfill the KYC: no one guarantees that they won't be sold or leaked at any time, and the use eventually given to them is unsure too.",
