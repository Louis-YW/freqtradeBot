If you add btc time to time without thinking of selling then yes one day you will be owner of whole btc Quote from: Macoach link=topic=5467098.msg62859685#msg62859685Even though BTC is banned in my region, I've found a community of crypto enthusiasts on this forum, sharing and gathering information.

In my country, Bitcoin is not fully banned but we cannot buy/sell openly. If btc is fully banned then P2P is also not secured because your all data is recorded.",

Bitcoin can be acquired without any taxation but it isn't free from taxes and if the authorities found that you have enough Bitcoin then you may have to pay taxes. IRS has classified Bitcoin as a property and that's why it isn't free from taxes anymore in some regions.

I strongly believe that crypto will someday be accepted worldwide.I would recommend you to be careful with your investment in Bitcoin if it's banned in your region. I know that this forum is the best place where most Bitcoin lovers are present and you'll get a lot of information about Bitcoin from this forum but still you should be careful when investing in it because if something is banned in your country then it's a trouble taking job to hold that thing. I would recommend you to be very careful because if your government somehow gets information about your Bitcoin holdings then they can seize your coins and take legal action against you.Quote from: Macoach on September 17, 2023, 02:10:21 PMAs for my favorite reason for choosing Bitcoin over fiat currency, it's the sense of control and potential for growth that it offers. Plus, I'm in good company here, so feel free to share your thoughts too! 😊Well, almost everybody is interested in Bitcoin because of its decentralization and its potential to grow higher in value. The features that Bitcoin offers are unquie and the community that is backing up it is also huge. Fiat isn't anywhere close to Bitcoin when it comes to sense of control and that's why it's always better to choose Bitcoin and continue investing it in a secret way. Never ever tell anyone about your investment and again be careful because investing in it in a banned region may have some risks involved.",

Are you trying to say, that Cryptocurrency beats fiat at every point? If yes, then you should edit your title, and be careful next time while creating a new topic. You are most welcome to make new topics but please try not to make topics blindly and in a sense of hurry. Try to remain calm, make a topic, then read it again. Then post it. And you should write BTC instead of cryptocurrency. Because in cryptocurrency there are alts involved too but if we only write BTC then the statement becomes more valid. Other than that, I totally agree with all of your facts and I am a promoter of BTC as I also do DCA at the rate that I can.",

You are right about firmness. because doing DCA is not an easy task. It needs consistency, and dedication to accumulate BTC The OP seems to be so optimistic that he thinks accumulating 1 BTC is not impossible, and indeed it is not impossible, and one can really accumulate 1 BTC easily, but the journey is so hard for one to follow.  And it might take some time to get some good results to prove your skeptical friend wrong. But the point should not be that, as you mentioned. The point should be. To accumulate as much BTC as one can. Either by doing DCA, lump sum, or buying at dips. Whatever the method is, after accumulation, they go through the phase of holding it for an extended period of time to make a profit out of it.  Dear OP I hope you will reach the goal of 1 BTC soon and god will help you.",

Well bitcoin is free from taxation if you are using p2p but when you are using centralized exchange, you pay tax though not all but some. Most local exchanges ask customers to pay transaction fee but I have not seen that in international exchanges like Remitano and Binance but Busa pays transaction fees. Cryptocurrency {bitcoin} makes things easy for the new generational technology age. There is no physical verification and identification. Those countries that have ban cryptocurrency are just wasting themselves, because people are using p2p to bypass the ban.

Stable coins are cryptocurrencies that are pegged to the US dollar and have a more stable price value. It’s not advisable to store all your money in crypto. You need to have just enough fiat in the bank to cover your expenses and lifestyle.

I know bitcoin is taxed in the UK, and some bitcoin investors struggle with the calculation because it kind of tricky, do you pay tax based off your initial purchase or the ROI. It’s easier if you have a professional who handles your books on your behalf, tax evasion is a serious crime and bitcoin wasn’t created to help people cut taxes.",

Crypto is your leverage, it's what you use to make sure your fiat's never losing its value against inflation, with the added bonus of turning a profit at the end of it. Fiat is what you use to transact and remain alive in this planet.
