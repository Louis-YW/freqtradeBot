  "content": "Jedna z popularniejszych giełd z uwagi na brak KYC i mnogość altcoinów dziś została zamknięta:\"Dear Respected Hotbit Users, Because a former Hotbit management employee who left Hotbit in April this year was involved in a project last year that law enforcement authorities now think is suspected of violating criminal laws. So, a number of Hotbit senior managers have been subpoenaed by law enforcement since the end of July and are assisting in the investigation. Furthermore, law enforcement has frozen some funds of Hotbit, which has prevented Hotbit from running normally. Therefore, Hotbit has to suspend trading, deposit, withdrawal and funding functions. All user’s assets and data on Hotbit are secure and correct. Please wait for our further announcement about the specific recovery time of our service. Hotbit hereby declares: Hotbit and the rest employees of Hotbit's management are not involved in the project and have no knowledge of the illegal information involved in the project. And we are still actively cooperating with the law enforcement authorities in their investigations. All user’s assets are safe. For more details, please visit https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8074249353495\"Środki zamrożone do czasu odblokowania przez \"law enforcement authorities\". Czyli miesiące/lata. Na moje oko nie podniosą się nigdy, a cała ta akcja jest zmyślona by uspokoić tłum i nie mówić im, że \"robimy exit scam\". Da się sprawdzić, czy faktycznie jest przeciwko nim prowadzone jakieś postępowanie?",

      "body": "Z rok temu hotbit padł ofiarą ataku hakerskiego. Wtedy był offline przez 2 miesiące ale wrócili do działania. Może i tym razem im się uda, ale mam przeczucie, że to jednak zakończy się exit scamem. Ciekawostką dla mnie jest fakt, że w ramach prowadzenia jakieś sprawy można zamrozić środki klientów... nie hotbita prywatne konta, tylko środki klientów. Że co niby jak się okaże, że są powiązani z jakimś scamem to ze środków klientów będą pokrywane straty ludzi oszukanych? A z czyich środków pokrywane będą straty klientów? Dziwne to.Niemniej admini na telegramie ciągle aktywni:\"Please understand that it is not convenient to disclose the details as it is still under law enforcement arraignment.\"w odpowiedzi na 'Any evidence that an investigation is going on and that the funds are frozen?\"The matter is not complicated, and our attorney has made a preliminary assessment that although there is some justification for the police's suspicion of hotbit's management because of the relationship between Hotbit and the former employees, the police's allegations are legally untenable based on the evidence and information currently available.\"\"Because of the laws in mainland China, we are unable to disclose too many details of the case at this stage.

      "body": "Aktualizacja od giełdy hotbit. Ku mojemu zdziwieniu wygląda na to, jakby faktycznie mieli wrócić a obietnica odblokowania części środków (pewnie mniejszych altcoinów) w ciągu 2 tyg wydaje się aż nad optymistyczna. Przynajmniej ja spodziewałem się co najmniej rocznego śledztwa.\"Yesterday, all of Hotbit's employees involved in the investigation have returned home safely, so we have thereby obtained the full details of this case. The reason for this case: a former member of Hotbit's team joined a GameFi project in private in 2021 (this is a serious violation of Hotbit's internal regulations). After receiving case reports from users in certain country, law enforcement authorities started investigating the GameFi project. During the investigation, the law enforcement department found that: 1. A guy who played key role of the GameFi project, was working for Hotbit; 2. Hotbit was the first to list the project's token and the trading volume was quite high. So law enforcement authorities assumed that Hotbit might be the main backer behind this GameFi project and therefore launched an investigation against Hotbit. Hotbit team is “Decentralized” globally; however, four members, including one of Hotbit's major shareholders (we call him/her \"Sheep\" in the following), reside in the country where the case are reported. So law enforcement took them away at the end of July for investigation . At the same time, law enforcement froze various personal accounts of Sheep, including his/her private account on a large crypto exchange, which caused liquidity problems for Hotbit. The reason is: the account is not stored with Sheep's private assets, but with Hotbit's assets used for Market Making (hereinafter referred to as MM). In the early days of Hotbit, MM team have been using Sheep's private account with better rates, which could help MM provide Hotbit with better liquidity. Due to the considerable transaction volume of Hotbit, MM needs to store a large amount of assets in the account. The freezing of the account directly prevents the related crypto assets stored in it from being returned to Hotbit, so it cannot meet the withdrawal requests for all customers. In addition, with the absence of four key members, the exchange could not be run efficiently, so Hotbit had to suspend all platform services (More details: https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8074249353495).As law enforcement is not very familiar with blockchain technology, the whole investigation and evidence collection process of the case runs rather slow. Good news is that the law enforcement have basically determined that the Hotbit platform and the four members did not violate the law in this case, so all 4 persons were released. Theoretically, Hotbit can be rebooted. But the bad news is that according to the country's judicial process, the frozen assets cannot be released immediately, so Hotbit team have to keep talking with law enforcement about Sheep's account unfreeze (we are optimistic but the exact time is still uncertain). So right now, about 70 kinds of crypto assets associated with the case are frozen and could not be withdrawn 100% , but all other assets are good.We are currently working on the following :1. Hotbit team is currently looking for opportunities for mergers & acquisitions or loans. Our offer is: as long as the other party can ensure that 100% of all user funds could get redeemed, we are happy to discuss any other terms.2. We are making inventory of all assets on Hotbit and discussing several plans to reopen the platform. The most conservative estimation is that we can guarantee that users can start withdrawing unaffected assets within 2 weeks.3. We are conducting various internal reviews to eliminate hidden dangers as much as possible and avoid similar issues in the future.\"https://hotbit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8477769193239",
