It was conducted by YouGov and polled 1,000 adult PC, console and/or mobile gamers last month, with 34% of respondents indicating an interest in conducting crypto transactions in Metaverse.(Source: Cointelegraph)",

A small regional experiment doesn't mean much for the entire field and for what we've come to know about Metaverse, but I'm also very supportive of more and more relevant and quality new products.I also think that a lot of the traditional gamers are categorically denying anything that has to do with cryptocurrencies or metaverse being implemented in one of their favorite games and i can understand that. I am a gamer myself and that whole pay-2-win trend withing gaming is really bad for the whole industry and of course especially for the gamers itself. Therefore it makes totally sense that gamers don't want to have cryptocurrencies implemented in their games because that basically means that the game will also have microtransactions and i would guess that no gamers wants his game to have that kind of crap.",

It's interesting that you get paid to play and it's like what everyone is dreaming of.You enjoy and you're earning at the same time and that's the desire of the majority since everyone is into gadgets. There's a belief from the oldies that you can't earn and play at the same time before but times have changed.",

Any new games that announced they will start an NFT style got booed all the way from Twitter to gaming forums. In the gamer's view, NFTs are just a shameless cash grab instead of focusing on the gameplay. I only know a few examples similar to NFTs but found its success in the gaming space is CSGO's skin but it was quite different from how Vavle's implemented the mechanism and the background behind it.",

If the speculative trend does not change, then all these projects, even among those with a quality and original product, will become victims of market speculation. After all, users see these tokens as just a good way to get rich quickly, and this negatively affects the promotion of Metaverse and other trends in the crypto industry.",
