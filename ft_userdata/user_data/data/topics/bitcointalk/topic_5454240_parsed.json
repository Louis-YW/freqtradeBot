This doesn't mean only based on the knowledge one have got, the person gets rich or leads the regular life. Based on what you've mentioned what will you say a person who had won big jackpot and turned rich. Her doesn't have any knowledge, all that he did is just bought few tickets. So, knowledge is required to make life better, but that doesn't mean only with knowledge one can be rich.",

Also if you are in a good company of people it helps And there are also smart people who still continue to enjoy the wealth of their parents without any hard work to make money independently. And indeed knowledge is very important but it does not guarantee one's success if one does not have experience and hard workbecause in my opinion both of them will go hand in hand with one's knowledge to be successful, and can also increase one's income because of hard work and existing experience.experience and hard work teach someone to keep trying when they fall and get back up, and this will be a lesson and when repeated experiences they already know the solution and will not fall into the same hole.",

It is not an absolute truth, as each individual possesses a unique correlation between their knowledge, skills, and abilities to increase their financial earnings.It is essential to recognize that numerous factors significantly influence an individual's income, including market conditions, the demand for specific skills, the extent of personal effort, the surrounding environment, and personal circumstances.",

Since in a working industry there's a lot of work that needs specific knowledge it maybe too hard to study it may take years like doctoral or law. So when the job it's difficult then you would get paid higher than an average work where you won't need wide knowledge to get the work done. But actually you're wrong, it's true you may need knowledge to earn that much but people who risk their safety with physical work could also earn more. Let's say a cleaner of windows of a building, his salary was fixed monthly since you won't need to clean windows everyday so he might paid $1000 per month. I actually saw this where people shaming his work not knowing his monthly salary is much higher than them.",

      "body": "It's not just a matter of knowledge. Knowledge, experience, the ability to use knowledge in practice - this gives the result. Plus - the society in which you live has a high value. Let me explain.I know one man, a fine theoretical chemist.We went to school together, graduated from different universities. Since childhood, he was fond of chemistry, I was interested in technology.He graduated with honors from the university, winner of student olympiads, one of the best graduates of his class. It would seem that there is unique knowledge, go to work, all doors are open to you.But .... he could not just find a use for himself! Industrial enterprises needed chemists of a different level, relatively speaking \"more primitive\", and not his level. Pharmaceutics also looked \"crookedly\" at the graduate. In a word, \"smart uncles\" took him into circulation, who decided to use his knowledge to synthesize illegal drugs!Well, let's call him \"Eugene\", did not have much time to do anything, as the group was covered. He was supposed to get a short but very real term in prison ... Thanks to our help, he can be pulled out without a \"black mark\" in his biography. Then it took almost a year to find him the right job. And in 1997, he flew to the United States under a contract to work in a company where chemists are the basis of business (for obvious reasons, I do not indicate the names).\"Eugene\" continued his studies there, he has a high scientific degree, he has a favorite job and family. A person does what he loves, where it is possible to fully realize it, and among adequate people who give good to the world.Therefore, knowledge, and the presence of a field of application, and the society that surrounds and guides you - all 3 components are important for success.",

What you know will not at all times lead to an increase in your income. Some so many professors are knowledgeable in different fields, yet they are not wealthy. The ideal statement would have been the better financial knowledge you acquire and utilize, the greater your chances of becoming rich. To be rich is a product of putting your financial knowledge to work. If you have a profitable business idea and fail to put it to use, it will become obsolete. If you want to make more money, learn more about investment and business in diverse areas and take advantage of the opportunities they offer. Diversification of business is key to making more money.Most of the world's richest men might not know much about a particular business but they employ or partner with people that is knowledgeable to start and manage the business while they sponsor the venture. So riches might not only be a product of knowledge but maximizing opportunities.",
