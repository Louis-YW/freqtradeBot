The long one is geologic and it makes the argument just as absurd, but this captures a couple of centuries of human measurement and it is still absurd.by the way, that CO2 chart is almost a straight line showing a nice bit of cycling.  the only way it might have been produced is from ice cores and that may simply be a measure of outgassing.It makes sense that CO2 rose and the globe became developed and burned coal and oil particularly during the post war period.  Not so much before all that and trend line has to be suspect.Yet after saying all that we are a still a long way actual proof of anything.  Geologically, all that carbon came from somewhere in order to be converted into biological carbon.  Think about that when you worry about all that coal and oil and Natural gas....Climate change is a vehicle for stripping us of basic freedoms - rights such as working, travel, and public access. Ecological responsibility on the working man is leading us away from tradition and into the hands of corporate greed. The IPCC has set out environmental targets for 30 per cent biodiversity protection by 2030....",

Since much of the chemtrails are made up of salts of barium and aluminum, they are probably going for more Alzheimer's in people. They don't care. As long as people come to them for help from whatever ailments, they will keep on producing more and more ailments in people, one way or another.",
