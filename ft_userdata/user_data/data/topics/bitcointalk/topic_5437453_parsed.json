However, none of these posts are ANN thread as we know it. The previous thread was to update the community about our ongoing upgrades and things to expect from the incoming new version. While this thread is for the daily giveaways for the most active players. Before this thread was created, the previous one was duly closed since it has achieved its objectives.Quote from: CryptSafe on January 31, 2023, 12:50:59 PMHowever, what's up with the new wave of registration deposit bonus.

I see the competition is high amongst casinos for traffic and membership registration.That's how it should be. In every legitimate business niche, there is always competition and I think that's a good thing for customers because competition brings out the business in businesses. And you'll agree with me that it's always good to reward loyal customers, competition or not. Don't you think so?",

Thank you Fivestar4everMVP, I appreciate your comment and thanks for welcoming us to Bitcointalk. About the bonus, there is a wagering requirement of 2 times the deposit and bonus amount on a minimum of 2 events each before it's eligible for withdrawal. Other casinos requires 5 times but ours is 2 times only. Both deposit and bonus are withdrawable once you reach the wagering requirement which is very low and easy to meet.Quote from: goaldigger on January 31, 2023, 08:48:51 PMNo blocked accounts despite of the suspicious transactions?

The site looks good with their promotions and bonuses, just need to know more about details before trying it and not sure if its worth it to aim for the top 5 most active daily considering the wagering amount of some top gamblers. If this is KYC free and its good. We don't suspend or block account except in extreme situations where the user insist on consistently engaging in abusive behaviors. Our aim is to give our users the freedom to play without the fear of their funds being frozen based on flimsy excuses. This thread was created to announce the promotion and bonuses. Our main ANN thread will be in the near future when our ongoing upgrade is completed. We support 100% Anonymous players. I hope I am able to answers your questions to your satisfaction?",

It is only in extreme and continuous violations that we may consider that option after all other mediation attempts has failed. We warn repeatedly and provide needed assistance where necessary to help the violator/users correct their ways. It is only when all these failed to be complied to that we may consider account blocking as the last resort. So, feel free to game with us, knowing that your account is always safe.Quote from: Kakmakr on February 01, 2023, 06:46:01 AMOP, first of all.... welcome to the forum, hope to see good things coming from you guys in the future.

($150 000 per month are a large sum of money for new startup casinos) This presumably happens more with casinos ..where they have their own in-house games ....and not slots or games from third party game providers.  No brother, we do not participate in our own competitions. We do not engage is such practice as we consider that to be highly unethical. We want to (one day, hopefully soon) attain the highest level in the industry. No one gets to the top and stays there by being dubious from the beginning. At least, we don't want to get to the top through dubious means.Online casinos participating in their own competitions may have some disadvantages, including:    Lack of fairness: As the online casino is organizing the competition, there may be a perception of bias or manipulation in favor of the house.    Limited player pool: If the competition is only open to players of a single online casino, the pool of players may be limited, reducing the excitement and challenge of the competition.    Questionable Prize Distribution: There may be concerns about the transparency and fairness of the prize distribution, as the online casino has control over the outcome.    Trust issues: Online casinos may have a reputation for being untrustworthy, and participating in their own competitions may further damage that reputation.We don't want any of these and therefore will never create Alt accounts to participate in our own competitions. Be rest assured of the fairness of these games. Again, what we are giving out is $5,000 in total. That is 1,000 per day for 5 days for 5 persons. Sorry if the original language was not clear enough.Quote from: slapper on February 01, 2023, 09:33:44 AMThank you for joining the forum. This sounds fantastic then!

We sincerely apologize for the inconveniences that may have caused.To your first question, the correct reward is total of $5,000 for 5 people. One thousand daily for each person. I will add more context to the original post. And we are looking forward to seeing you at Fortune.st. https://fortune.st/",
