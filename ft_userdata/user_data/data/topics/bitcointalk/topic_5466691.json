If you want to buy Bitcoin from this forum then you must have to find a reputable and trusted members with a Legendary rank at least, and only then you should confirm the deal. I would also recommend you to have an escrow so you will be safe from any possible scammers.You can also purchase Bitcoin from decentralized as well as centralized exchanges. But, if your country has blocked centralized exchanges then you should consider buying from decentralized exchanges. While it's possible to buy Bitcoin from decentralized exchange but still you should be careful when buying from decentralized exchanges. Still, if you find a good and reputable one then you can purchase from them without any issue. When it comes to centralized exchanges then my experience with Binance has been good so far, but still I won't vouch for anyone. Do your own research and then purchase Bitcoin. I would also advice you to learn about Bitcoin wallets and when you purchased your Bitcoin then withdraw those to your own personal wallet instead of allowing them on those custodial wallets. You should learn about wallet software like Electrum in detail and once you are sure that you have learnt enough about it then create your wallet with that software and save your Private key and Pass phrase in a secure location.  I would also encourage you to make your wallet a cold wallet because if it is connected to internet then you may face problems from hackers.",

If you're for the long term, it isn't a big problem that you need to be thinking of. Since you're able to access to the web, just download the wallet like Electrum but make sure that you have the real and official link which is --> electrum.orgBe careful about searching that because some phishing and misspelled websites are copying it to fool people as they're trying to get some victims believing that they are the real one.",

And who can trap you to steal the funds.. haha not trying to scare you out but still need to be careful.Moving to the question most of the users already suggested the best solution but as a beginner, I would prefer you should use a Centralized exchange for the first time if you really care about KYC (Document verification) so you can go with \"Kucoin\" a pretty decent and reliable solution offer card buying and direct bank transaction in specific regions. Before proceeding please confirm whether that is Bitcoin Banned or just not accepted as there is a lot of difference between being banned or being not accepted yet.If it's Banned and still you want to proceed as it's illegal you have only a P2P buying option, If it's not Banned just not recognized or accepted then you can proceed freely until a clear statement from the officials.",

Direct fiat money deposit? In this case it depends on local financial services: some of them exchange crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto. In some countries local laws ban exchange hubs while crypto is not banned, so there are no possibilities to buy or sell crypto with fiat money. As for crypto to crypto exchange, I think there are plenty of online services: trading platforms, multicoin wallets etc...",

As for your badly written question, the answer is yes, there are many third-party sites and online exchange companies that help people buy and sell crypto, especially in places where it's not officially accepted. Some people use peer-to-peer platforms, while others choose to exchange money with people in other countries. They then use different ways to move their money. Again, though, this advice is pretty general since I don't know where you're from. Be more clear next time",

And if you already have a BTC and will want to sell it but you are looking for means to do it safely without breaking any law or getting caught by your country government then the best thing for you to also do is to make use of P2P exchanges either that of centralized exchange although it’s not the best recommended but it can get you a quick buyer from their which you can reach an agreement with, or better still you can also make use of F2F kind of transaction which will require you to make someone who you know need BTC and want to exchange his/her cash for BTC then you both can reach an agreement by using any of this means you can be rest assured that you can’t be caught by your countries restrictions.",

I think there are others like you who are into crypto from your country so there would definitely be an exchange that services from your country. Just like other members mentioned, Buying and selling of crypto is being carried out on Exchanges where you can deposit money directly into the exchange and trade it with Btc or make use of p2p services on the exchange where there are merchants readily available to buy or sell bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. So also there members of the forum that offers such services, they buy and sell crypto but you just need to be careful who you deal with so you don’t get scammed. Before you proceed with the trade make sure the person is a reputable member that is trusted. Ps: Never store your purchased crypto in an exchange - Not Your Keys Not Your Coin.",

There are varieties of Bitcoin wallets out there, you can use to store you Bitcoin but is all depends on your choice. Electrum will be the best suggestion for you op. You mentioned that cryptocurrencies like BTC are not accepted in your country, but that doesn't mean you can't use them. To buy and sell, it's best to use peer-to-peer exchanges that are available locally. Be sure to do your research when using these third-party platforms. Centralized exchanges offer more options, but always read their terms and conditions before using their platform. And as others have mentioned, never leave your funds on centralized exchanges this is due to reason which may include, security,control and they can change their polices if they so wish. To avoid stories its advisable to remove funds from cex exchanges.",

Currently some popular exchanges are facilitating P2P transactions, so I think P2P transactions are safer than third party transactions. If you want to convert money from fiat money to crypto then you can easily do it through P2P transaction, and if you want to convert your BTC to fiat money you can also convert your BTC to fiat through P2P with the help of a good quality exchange.If the exchange seems risky to you, then you can convert fiat money to BTC through the exchange and then deposit the BTC in any of your trusted wallets.",
