  "content": "While having a look at the forum Trust System this morning, this question just came into my mind that \"What happens if someone mistakenly gives you a negative trust and dies?\" Does the forum have plan B for that. Because we all know that life is as volatile just like Bitcoin, whereby today you may be sound and tomorrow you are either sick or gone, as nobody knows when he or she will ever die. So this is a very vital question everyone needs to know, as it can affect anyone on the the forum irrespective of your rank, and that's the reason why I decided to post it here on the \"Reputation\" board as this is the only place people having issues regarding \"Trust System\" and the rest come to lay complain and have there issues resolve. So what actually happens after a tagged has been proven to be innocent and the tagger is seen not to have come online after a period of 120days. Does the forum have a plan B for that? If Yes, please can you educate us more on this, because am sure there are people out there suffering from this, and those yet to suffer the same issue. Because there are certain reasons that may result to someone been tagged a \"negative trust\" on the forum, which could be weather the person has been noticed to be a scammer or a promoter of scam on the forum, and I was made to understand that accounts with negative trust are always restricted from many things on the forum. So please, what measure is one advisable to take after been tagged a negative trust and proven to be innocent and the tagger is seen not to ever come online again because probably he or she is dead or critically ill. Because your answer will be of great benefits not to just only me but to those facing the issue today and those yet to face it in the future.Or, 1. Is Negative Trust irreversible?2. At what rank can someone send a negative trust? (Newbie, member, Full, Sr, Hero or Legend)3. How many negative trust can one send in a week, month, year or lifetime)So thank you and God bless you as you help a brother or sister there out to resolve their issue. Thanks",

At what rank can someone send a negative trust? (Newbie, member, Full, Sr, Hero or Legend)At any rank, but it appears distinct on your profile page and in each post you make if a DT member tag your account. Trust system is more about DT members because they have more power to make the trust appear more to other forum users. Quote from: CryptoHeadlineNews on June 30, 2022, 11:03:50 AM3.

Usually some DT usually counters it by neutral feedback to negate the negative feedback that already given since it unmoderated. There’s a lot of case like this especially on casino accounts that previously has an issue and resolved later but the problem was the person give that negative feedback already gone or not using the forum anymore. You will notice a more positive feedback is given to counter it since trust score what’s matter most and not the single neg feedback that goven in the past.

He value uses' collective understanding of a system. For it, he does not enforce anything. We don't even have any official rules per se. Theymos discouraged retaliatory feedback. Counter seems a form of retaliatory. If you think anyone is not using their feedback properly or if you feel their judgement is controversy or they make wrong calls then \"~\" them. Leaving a counter against a red feedback or a counter against a green feedback does not change anything.Again it all depends. I am speaking my mind and how I understand the system that most are comfortable to use. Ignore the part where there are personal interest and financial motivation for many users.",

Once you verify the list of trusted members, you will find among them members who have been absent and others who have not been active for a long time. Rather, there are already untrusted members among them, as evidenced by many facts against them.About the topic rised by Op, the only solution from my point of view is to add ratings from other members about the rating left by the deceased member, since the forum system prevents the administration from changing or canceling these ratings.",
