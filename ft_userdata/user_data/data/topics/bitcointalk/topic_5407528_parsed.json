How about airbitrium do you have an idea it will be airdrop or not?I just saw a video today on youtube about Arbitrum airdrop and I am thinking to get some more information to complete the tasks. This will be my first airdrop of this kind and the guy who made the video was quite optimistic about this airdrop.Have you completed your tasks to be eligible for the airdrop?",

I have never heard of them and I doubt you need to download their wallet to participate in the zkSync airdrop.There's no need to download the wallet. Use zksync mainnet was enough for you to be eligible for airdrop (possible thing).It's better if you are reading it here https://airdrops.io/zksync/I will not believe any other source the force the participant to download the wallet, that has a very high possibility to be a scam website. Zksync was a protocol and downloading wallet from unknown party is a very high risk decision by anyone who wanna participate in the airdrop. It's a scam.",
