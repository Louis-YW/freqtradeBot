That could be done more easily without an event. So, it makes me wonder what your purpose is.The last time we saw something like this, it was some fly-by-night company trying to get some free marketing. I expect that you are doing the same thing.",

If you understand bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto will never identify himself to the world. I think in this year, this is the second thread on Satoshi Nakamoto presuppose identification thread. But as for now we can't say anything about it but as you said, you are part of the event which can even sponsor people to the area, you can bring the live updates to the forum since most of us can't attend. If Satoshi Nakamoto identity is known or revealed, many things will spoil. Government will hunt him down and it will affect bitcoin. The Matt the decentrality of bitcoin is, Satoshi Nakamoto can still do something that will affect bitcoin so to avoid that, he will not identify himself in any way. And such event has nothing to do with Satoshi Nakamoto. We are still waiting for your update tomorrow.",

I hope this Stephan Mollah can provide some substantial proofs to establish his claim to be real Satoshi! A man who has the capability to create a whole new technology called Blockchain and a decentralized currency system, will provide real and unrefutable proof. Didn't happen this time though. I am sure it's not going to be the last time someone claims to be Satoshi.",

You don't need a lot of people, just enough so you can make some money and then go on to your next scam.Oh and everyone who want's to take a minute don't forget to ~ Master Ledger in your trust settings and leave some negative feedback.
