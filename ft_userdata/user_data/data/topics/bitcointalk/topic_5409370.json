  "content": "SENTINEL BITCOINSales post*Updated pictures plus new website!Sentinelbitcoin.comHello, I would like to announce a project that I have been working on for quite some time now called Sentinel Bitcoin. I have been a long time user and collector in this forum. As a result of certain pieces that I never had the ability to obtain, I have decided to design my own collectible physical wallet. I wanted a nice piece that would stand out and make a statement. I wanted it to feel luxurious and be a show piece when discussing bitcoin with friends. Lastly, I wanted it to be a functioning wallet. Taking all these ideas into account, I came up with my design for Sentinel Bitcoin. Materials include aluminum, glass, nuts, bolts, tamper proof hologram, and a QR code for the public address (written public address will also be included).This initial design (combination of surface finish and inner design ring) will be limited to 100 pieces.If interested you can comment on this post, PM, or email me at Support@sentinelbitcoin.com . I will not be contacting you outside of any of these options so please beware of scammers. Payment Address:bc1qa3q240thcwky99rjk4rdaawjvt0jv5pq8rzfmjI will confirm order and then you can pay/send me shipping address + TX IDThanks for taking a look!",

There really should be no need to have makers generating keys unless they are a known and well trusted community member. A private key should not just be accepted as safe when you have no idea who is generating the keys.",

Edit: I see they are sold unfunded right, so wouldnâ€™t that make these DIY?Hello ChiBitCTy, Thanks for the comment. I created a new account for this because I wanted it to be solely for the business side of this and the name to be that of the company so it would be easy to find and recognize. My regular account is Snowlynx which was created in February of 2021. I have done deals with that account in the collectibles section. As for the key generation, I purchased a brand new computer that I run open source code on locally (not connected to internet and will not be) and then that computer is plugged directly into a new printer with no WiFi or Bluetooth capability. The keys are printed only once and the private key is placed under the tamper proof hologram immediately. There are no other instances of the private key anywhere. Also, for the diy aspect yes you fund it yourself if you want too but no it is not diy in the sense you generate your own keys.",

What paper did you use to print the PK? Any particular weight?",

I know my intentions are good and I took the right precautions but I also understand the concerns from a buyers point of view.I wanted to offer a solution and determine if this is something people would be interested in so please reply back to let me know.I can modify these to sell as a DIY. This would entail me removing the back piece of glass, removing the tamper proof hologram/private key, and removing the public address QR code. I would then sell it like that but include a piece of glass for the back as well as a fresh hologram sticker. The buyer would then be able to generate their own keys and attach the glass.Again, please let me know if this is something that would be of better interest. Thanks",
