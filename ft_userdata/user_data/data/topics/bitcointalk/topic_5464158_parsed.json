Is there? Doesn't even one of those who try?",

I hope I placed this in the right category.Relying on trading bots alone is one of the worst things that you can do as an aspiring trader. I mean you want to be a successful trader, but you don't want  to learn what you need to learn, and instead you will just rely on trading bots? I'm not using trading bots, but I can already see that trading bots can't give you guaranteed profits.As for signal channels, I tried joining in one of them already, and I had a bad experience. What I will only say is that, they will try to milk your money so they can earn more. I don't know if it's only me who experienced this, but these wannabe traders who are giving signal to their followers have at least 3 levels of channels or even more. You are in the lowest level, you will receive the signal a few minutes late, and when you receive the signal, it pumped already. I've seen it first-hand, and I don't want to ever rely on both the signals from these stupid scammers, and trading bots. Still, the best thing is to learn it yourself. Having knowledge will be your power that will make you a successful trader. It will take time, and money for sure, but it will be worth it.",

I hope I placed this in the right category.Of course, you posted it in the right section.However, my candid advice to you is to shun trading bots, they don't worth it. I didn't just condemn them but advise you with the experience I have in trading for almost 2 decades. I can start furnishing you with tens of them now, but to what gain? I've tried virtually anything you could think of regarding trading during my quest for success, those includes wasting money on a lot of programs and projects, but in the end, they don't work. Precisely bots, they are of many categories, and I can only summarize their performance to those that will regularly ruin your account, those that will initially earn well for you and would have raised your hope before they will ruin the account, and lastly those that will have almost the same winning and losses for eternity. This means that in the last category, you will not lose so significantly or gain so significantly, so your money is almost the same in your account.Why then waste your time and make the brokers/exchanges richer through fees?",

I hope I placed this in the right category.I checked the Elite Signals platform there mentioned that they have more than 45k members but the users of the websites are only near to 15k maximum which might be not new. Well, that's just assumption using a tool to overview the domain name. But from what I have seen the site is mostly about forex, stock etc. And they are also into crypto who knows what types of knowledge they are providing excluding you and from where they are getting and on what factors these platforms are making decisions. The point is, if you are new or not you should not completely depend on such tools or groups which provide premium signals. Because in the current market situation no one was expecting such dump but still if the above mentioned platform have some potential then the market has made or I should say created such situation in which almost every bots might lose you. This topic although discussed here a lot of time even I have also started a topic about it you can check it in my profile. Well the point is from my experience no bots are 100% accurate instead you could and should use them only for taking idea not for fully relying on them.",

Most of them are scams. Learn how to trade first instead of looking for the best bots and signals. Absolutely. Using trading bots are like increasing the risk to lose your money because you dare to trust a robot more than yourself who lacks the real human intuition. Trading needs more experience and expertise when it comes to analyzing the market trends, assessing the factors that would trigger the market next, and I think using trading bots do not have the real capabilities and are not worthy enough of your money and time. While trading bots may be helpful for some beginners, but always remember that when you aim for a successful trading outcome, it’s only your own knowledge and skills that you can always rely and not some other trading bots or signals even if they’re given for free.",

There was a time I used one of them because a friend of mine was using it and he lost a big amount of money and he told me that he lost it because he was greedy and impatient. Greedy in the sense that, in the process of trading he made amount 100$ and Instead of him to cash out the money, he was planning to hit big amount before cashing out but luck fall on him and within a second, the market just run down to penetrate the stop loss and everything just wiped out. So if you are looking for a good trading site or app, there is non but you skills and experience on trading will give you the profit you want and not the best bot to trade.",
