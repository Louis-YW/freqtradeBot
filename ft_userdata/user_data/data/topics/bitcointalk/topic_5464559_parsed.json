  "content": "Brief background: in 2017 my friend created a new BTC wallet for me and made a USB backup copy for me. Sadly I didn't take part in the process of creating the wallet and I don't know on what platform was it created. Currently, I am trying to get access to my funds, but I absolutely don't understand how do I do it with USB backup copy.To sum up: I have an address for my wallet, password, file called enc without file extension (pem, dat, text, etc.){\"iv\":\"XN1dZ58sSk2dwREfoU1h7Q==\",\"v\":1,\"iter\":1000,\"ks\":128,\"ts\":64,\"mode\":\"ccm\",\"adata\":\"\",\"cipher\":\"aes\",\"salt\":\"nCO3uQAT4cc=\",\"ct\":\"eDzExQ5tCoHUwf4v2aifbqYNU6VVLBOJYzGwWPKQF2qMLZPwhmbn/6dpKdd1woleoKgLZY7l5qhJr7gP75FKg16u9xd1m5rQzFhq2QuZRMXHjeu81YK6HE6fp1FTrTS9qf/nktD/QpO5mw/LV1e+hhVsJBE5sbE=\"}I opened this file using password that I used when creating the wallet in the http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/demo/ service and got this content. -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----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-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----And then I absolutely don't understand what to do with this file.In this thread  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5309706.0 people say that you can extract PRIVATE KEY BTC out of such a file, but I don't understand if this is my case. In other posts I've seen people mention similar file for the BitGo wallet, but there iter\":10000,\"ks\":256 + to recover BitGo wallet you not only need User Key but also ( Backup Key+BitGo Public Key ).I would be grateful for any help!P.S - Files in the examples are changed.",

I read, that servers like BitGo use JS when creating the new wallet and generate files in similar format.Although, i don't really know much in programming to say that.Thanks!",
