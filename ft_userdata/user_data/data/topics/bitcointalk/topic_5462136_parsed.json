What evidence do you need to believe that a proven scammer may have something installed on the device to steal crypto? Well I'm not really much informed about whether Ledger can be tracked in such way or not; there's nothing wrong to be secure.

      "body": "Quote from: SeriouslyGiveaway on August 05, 2023, 02:37:56 AM[...]Is there a backdoor in Ledger hardware wallets?[...]The article in reference is about Ledger's latest feature to opt-in for a pass-phrase recovery through a joint custody service and claimed that there isn't any actual back door to the hardware wallet itself from the said new feature. Given the keyword here is \"joint custody\" --where the process can only be done through three different custodians, to be precise-- I don't think it's a matter to be concerned about, as not even one entities on that service has the actuall pass-phrase.So suppose Betnomi --without naming any individual from Betnomi that's hypothetically will try to pull this stunt-- tried to remotely \"recover\" and gain access to those ledger by utilizing the feature on that article, they'll need all three fragments from all three of the custodian companies to give their part [with Ledger themselves as the final party].Quote from: https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/9579368109597?docs=trueIn short, only you can access your wallet. When you subscribe to Ledger Recover, a pre-BIP39 version of your private key is encrypted, duplicated and divided into three fragments, with each fragment secured by a separate companyâ€”Coincover, Ledger and EscrowTech. Each of these encrypted fragments is useless on its own. When you want to get access to your wallet, 2 of the 3 parties will send fragments back to your Ledger device, reassembling them to build your private key.And I don't think the two appointed entities are likely to willingly give the passphrase to Ledger [as the third and final custodian] to complete the pieces as Betnomi is not the one whose ID authenticate and opt-in for the said feature, suppose the winner of the ledger opt-in for that feature. And suppose they're not even subscribing for the service, then their pass-phare were not even split and partially-shared to those three entities, so the concern of Betnomi taking a backdoor is even less possible.",

Yes, \"customized\" means that you get a Ledger device with an engraved custom logo or some other text/graphics on the device. Anyone can order such a customized device from the official Ledger shop, although there are minimum order quantities, making this service more suitable for businesses. However, the device is still ultimately packaged in tamper-evident packaging by Ledger before reaching the end user.",

I remember taking a good look at the package and not noticing any signs that someone had opened it before me. But again, I wouldn't guarantee that it didn't happen.There is only the Betnomi logo on the metal part of the housing and I didn't notice anything else. I don't use that wallet at all, only for a couple of tests, so I didn't even try to determine if there were any unofficial changes. Originally it was supposed to be a gift, but after the \"Ledger recovery drama\", it ended up in a drawer.As far as I remember, apart from these raffles that the OP mentioned, another amount of Betnomi wallets were distributed to the winners of the Bitcointalk Community Awards, so the list is bigger than 8 raffle rounds.",

They have prepared in advance to succeed in their activities, so every thing they have done must now be brought under our suspicions. I know how Ledger wallet works. I mean if Betnomi unofficially makes some kind of change in that wallet then think how dangerous it can be. We must not forget that the Betonmi site admin mentioned hacking as a skill, we can argue here again that a hacker can be both good and bad, but his activities do not look like a good hacker. I feel suspicious about their gifted Ledger, not only me but many members find it suspicious. Nothing happened yet so we couldn't go into it, if something unexpected happened to some users it wouldn't be good at all. So is it not better to be careful in advance?",

You can buy a seal packager for less than $10. Does this sound too costly to you. To alter an embedded device you can pay a programmer and they will do it for you. It's not impossible. If anyone wants to reach bitcoin users then the best place is this forum. It does not if matter you are targeting random users or not. Those who were winner for bitcointalk award are not random people at all.It all sounds impossible, unlikely but I suggest not to take a little risk if you have the amount of crypto that is life changing.

Two, no one can participate on the free-raffle/giveaway anymore as it's been done months ago, the events are no longer exist.
