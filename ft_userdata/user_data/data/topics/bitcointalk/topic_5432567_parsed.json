      "body": "Ok i still like nfts but am hating twitter because of Elon now so i am dropping price to 300$ + escrow fees. Also i am annoyed how @nftcollector gets tagged to tons of posts out there, and i don't have to use that account for bounties and i dislike doing any influental promotions with it. So buy it if you think twitter is only going up and NFTs are here to stay.",
