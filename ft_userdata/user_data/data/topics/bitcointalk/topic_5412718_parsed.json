However you can ask the support of your platform to be sure.",

If you see anything like this: TP/SL (take profit/ stop loss). In a way you can check ✔️ it. You will be able to include the stop loss and take profit.Another is after you have opened the order, you can see the stop loss and take profit.Or click on close order of the position opened, but select 'limit', (not 'market'). Limit order would let you to select the price you want the order to close. You can set as many as possible closing limit orders to favour both stop lose and take profit, but on some exchanges, you can only open one which can be either favoring stop lose or take profit.",

Some platform when you click on close order it pops with different options below it depending on what they have in the platform, so you could see close order, modify order, new order, charts etc. It depends on what platform.Quote from: Oshosondy on September 07, 2022, 11:09:33 AMYou can set as many as possible closing limit orders to favour both stop lose and take profit, but on some exchanges, This is surely a way of losing.

If talking about stop loss and if it is bidgate exchange then I would say see if you find TP/SL text while trading there if not then maybe there is no stop loss system. And if you want to trade professionally then there are many better exchanges like Binance and you will find many options there and you can easily use stop loss.If you don't understand other exchanges, you can directly start trading on Binance and you can easily set stop loss there and you will have profit even if you are offline.And if you can't use Binance Stop Loss, then you can directly watch videos on YouTube to use Binance Stop Loss.

I think people here have never used this exchange, so it is difficult to give you an answer. All exchanges have online and telegram support teams to answer questions for their users. You can ask them directly on the telegram group or you can chat directly with the support staff on their homepage to get the most accurate answer.This is the futures trading group:https://t.me/+mgmQzMqM3cg0YmJl",

Many orders or clustered kinds of options leads to confusion and op looks like a newbie may not be able to handle it. Staying with few understandable options is better.You do not understand what I meant. That it could be the only option to set TP/SL. On some exchanges, ones you set one (either TP or SL), you may not be able to set the other using the a certain limit price, just like on OKX. But that on some platform like Binance, that you can use it to create both stop loss and take profit order because you can set the limit price to any value, be it positive (profit) or negative (loss) to set the take profit or stop loss. So if used for take profit, it can also still be used differently to set stop loss after take profit has been set.",

Maybe that kind of complaint or whatever it is must be sent to their support system for verification as certainly they would answer it as long as they legally operated or that something they need to change on their platform. Perhaps, it was a lesson for you to do thorough research before using this platform. It is a must to be more familiar with it or else, you will just realize that you fall into the wrong platform.

That aside, limit orders are for intending orders that you want to enter for buy or for sell. They are good but their disadvantage is that they can trigger an order for you and price will continue the direction against you and you start losing your trade. Anyway it is used especially when you won't be able to monitor the trigger.",

Spot and futures has so many differences, the stop loss and take profit feature that futures has is because to avoid too much risk of liquidation, which is spot doesn't have.",

Because stop loss and take profit feature is for futures trading that requires open position to activate this kind of feature. There’s an alternative feature for spot trading that works like this which is the conditional order like like trailing stop buy and sell.You need to buy first on spot before you can set limit buy and sell order that works like stop loss and take profit but trailing order is what you can use to have a range buy and sell on spot.",
