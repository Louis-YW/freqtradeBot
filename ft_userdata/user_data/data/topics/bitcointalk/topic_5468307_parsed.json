  "content": "I recently came across this article that talks about how much gambling is basically becoming a 'global health crisis' I found this very interesting because i've always known it was an addiction for some people, but I guess covid really sparked the gambling itch for so many people, and people in the industry have been able to manpulate the government in what would be seen as a conflict of interest to have more influence in law and government to help right the wrongs that they created and help bypass a lot of corporate responsibility. Here is the article: https://www.vice.com/en/article/88xvw3/gambling-industry-is-using-big-tobaccos-playbook-health-experts-warn?utm_campaign=later-linkinbio-motherboardvice&utm_content=later-38076005&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkin.bioHere are a few clips from the article that stood out to me: \"The experts, who work at universities in Australia, the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Tanzania, together published an editorial in the peer-reviewed journal Health Promotion International this month arguing that the gambling industry has become “one of the most innovative health-harming industries of recent times,” in part by operating “from a similar playbook” to the tobacco and alcohol industries. The experts say the development poses “widespread threats to global public health.” \"\"In the U.S., the popularity of online gambling has grown rapidly in recent years, fueled in large part by an aggressive lobbying campaign by the sports betting industry to legalize the practice across the country. As of 2023, sports betting is legal in more than 30 states around the country. The rise of online gambling in the U.S. and abroad has led to a rise in the number of young men grappling with gambling addiction, which can cause financial and psychological issues for both the gamblers and those around them.  As many as half of people with a gambling addiction suffer with suicidal ideation, according to the Nevada Council on Problem Gambling. The “omnipresent” and loosely regulated barrage of gambling advertisements online and on television—often featuring a celebrity endorsement— have only helped to further normalize the industry to children at a young age, the authors state, adding that educational programs and treatment programs for children to learn about responsible gambling have even begun to be sponsored by the industry itself.\"If anyone on here is suffering from a gambling addiction and you are experiencing signs of self harm and feel that you cannot stop DO NOT BE SILENT! Seek the help of your family and friends, no matter how embarrassing you may feel. It could honestly save your life and save your well being. I just thought that this was really important to share. Good luck and be safe out there guys!TREAD",

Australians may gamble conveniently from home thanks to the internet gaming sector.  Mate Casino is one such website https://casinomate3.com/ that is a prime example of superior support. Many Australian gamblers are increasingly choosing online gambling platforms as their preferred means of gaming as a result of the growing trend in technology.",

This is not just the problem of gambling, it is majorly the effect of ICT. The internet has made the accessibility of almost every activity easy. With a mobile phone, you can place a bet in any casino or sports bet platform. Due to the internet here is also a rise in drug, pornography, and alcohol addiction which has led to an increase in depression and suicide. QuoteThe “omnipresent” and loosely regulated barrage of gambling advertisements online and on television—often featuring a celebrity endorsement— have only helped to further normalize the industry to children at a young age, the authors state, adding that educational programs and treatment programs for children to learn about responsible gambling have even begun to be sponsored by the industry itself.\"Most children see these celebrities as their role models, so there is a need to make policies that will protect children from underage gambling. The use of sports stars, musicians, and other celebrities for promotion should be limited to some websites with fewer children's views and erring gambling firms should be sanctioned accordingly.

Good luck and be safe out there guys!TREADSome people keep their gambling life secret from family members and friends so they might be scared of speaking to anyone. One good thing about the internet is that it can also help you to seek help from any part of the world. You can access or contact an online gambling therapist and get the needed help. Most gamblers who became depressed and started having suicidal thoughts failed to seek help. There is no shame in seeking help, after all, everybody has personal problems.",

Biggest example that I could think of is a vlogger in the Philippines who died from second-hand smoking in casinos. He frequented these gambling spaces to unwind after a long shoot and from there, he was able to huff large amounts of toxic fumes which lead to him developing a terminal case of lung cancer that led to his death in 2014. It was a big thing here back then cause they were really famous. In any case I can definitely see the connection between the two, mentally and physically speaking. Gambling's just as addicting as any other abusable substance out there, if you don't control yourself it's going to control you and your life.",

Like I can't stop smoking/vaping and can't stop drinking coffee, but stop gambling is just easy... extremely easy. Therefore \"Global Health Crisis\" is such an incredible exaggeration from my perspective, like how come? Anyway, I guess it varies across people and most people are prone to gambling addiction but it's unbelievable to me.",

Meanwhile, gambling is legalized in several countries, and online casinos have become a comfortable place to gamble for many people. And since COVID-19, people who can't go anywhere have started to use online casinos to entertain themselves because many have felt the frustration of being unable to leave the house freely.Unfortunately, this is not accompanied by providing clear information about the dangers or impacts people can experience when they gamble too often, so many of them start to experience gambling addiction. This requires serious attention from the government to try to help people who are addicted to gambling so that they can start undergoing the healing process. But this also requires the desire of the gambling addict to open up and be willing to undergo therapy sessions.",

The only thing we should breath is oxygen and no other substances.If it is with smoking, vices are just part of it; it is most of the gamblers’ way to overcome the tention in gambling but will never be a good decision if there are things which matters the most. Gambling industry may use any field such as tobacco and other companies as long as funds are secured and every problem can be resolved.Best way right now is to let ourselves out fron our confort zone given that the market price of Bitcoin won’t increase in a serious and consistent manner.",

It's something more like a medium of sorts that pushes people towards doing these two kinds of things. Even if you consider gambling addiction, it's simply a sickness where the person themselves try to gamble more and more money away, regardless of its source, and if they don't have any, they experience psychological problems that push them to other vices. And really, by that logic, depression and the like can be a major cause as well and you haven't seen them combating the sources of that right? While I do know it may vary (such as family problems, stress due to financial issues, etc), gambling itself could be considered as a specific type of depression like those that I listed. And besides, even if you consider it as an issue, it's going to be the same thing as how they tackled cigarettes and alcohol. They posted warnings but that's it, they still allow its circulation. Why? It's a damn profitable business after all.",

Gambling isn't a bad engagement when the person who's gambling is absolutely in control of his gambling activities but when the person becomes addicted in gambling, it becomes a big problem to not just himself but to the society he finds himself because he's likely to engage in other criminal activities in other to quickly recover the money he loses in gambling. Smoking creates big health issues for the lungs as it damages the lungs but when someone loses money in gambling and is provided with were he can smoke, he'll likely get involved in excessive smoking just to try and get out of depression.",

Many people are frustrated because by staying at home, they cannot meet their neighbors and can only chat via telephone or video call.

In this significant development of the gambling industry, it is important to create regulations so that this negative impact does not become more massive and cause even worse damage.Prohibiting people from gambling is not a solution, because after all it is people's right to gamble, but more comprehensive regulations are needed which regulate the gambling industry so that it does not grow massively and reaches people who should not be exposed to it, such as children, the poor, etc.",
