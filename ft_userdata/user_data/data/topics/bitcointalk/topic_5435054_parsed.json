In my country, it's max 14 days to return, and that's only if you buy online.Do you have any backstory to this in terms of the timeframes that they were returned?",

I might be wrong but I recall seeing some posts/news about some stores refusing to accept returns/refund for GPUs. Can't find it anymore though. It is not really impossible if a store implements them though, especially if the buyer is suspicious.",

Plus the COVID situation that saw people buying even at sky-high prices. A lengthy two years. Give them a few more years. Just like their CPU, Ryzen was finally a breakthrough.

But there was some buyers remorse law passed and you are allowed to pretty much return anything. Only things you can’t return are stuff from the dollar store and a car, but everything in between you can.It’s a good policy but some people just take advantage. People used to return 10 year old TVs to Costco for a full refund and they had to change their policy on electronics.",

I remember back in the day a friend worked at a large department store that offered satisfaction guaranteed. He was amazedhow many dresses bought on Friday were returned Monday with sweat stains by \"dissatisfied\" customers. Buyer's remorse laws ususally only apply to high pressure sales practices like telemarketing and door to door sales. It can also apply to real estate and cars (lemon laws) in some cases.",
