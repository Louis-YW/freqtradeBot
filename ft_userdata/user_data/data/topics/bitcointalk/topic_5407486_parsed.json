This page should show you how much to pay for it. It will not be much expensive.Being a copper member does have many benefits for a newbie to have an account similar to a junior member or member rank, buying it does not still give privilege to use an avatar.But your advice is good, especially being a copper member will make posting of images possible.Only full member and ranks above full members are able to use avatar. Even for copper member accounts, they have to rank up to full member before the can use avatar.",

I am putting this out there for users who may be confused with how the ranking system works.To have avatar you will need to be full member of the forum and to become a full members you will require minimum 120 activity and minimum 100 merit. Don't get confused with the post number when you are counting activities.Quoteyou can only get 14 activity points every two week periodhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2766177.0In other words, no matter how many posts you make each day or week, only 14 posts will be added to your activity in every two weeks period. If you do not enjoy spending time on the forum then it is hard to rank up.",
