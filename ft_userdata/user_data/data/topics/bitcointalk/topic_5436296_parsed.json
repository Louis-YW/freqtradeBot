  "content": "After all, we know how valuable Bitcoin is, so we need to protect and possibly even increase our holdings but when doing so, many traps should be avoided. One of those traps is to fall for the misconception to increase Bitcoin profits from trading reliably. Trade vs. HODLBitcoin's fundamentals make it very suited to HODL because Bitcoin’s supply is limited to 21M units itself. By HODLing, Bitcoin should increase likely in value long-term and HODLing is our safest way to make a profit. Low risk – likely to succeed. But we need to be patient and favor safer long-term gains instead of quick but more insecure profits. Technical analysis is riskySome people have claimed, that trading by technical analysis is a reliable way of making money – it’s not true because it's very risky, especially for short terms (daytrading). If technical analysis would be predictable, it would be easy to take a credit, give it to a \"professional\" trader and he would make a profit. Be careful and don’t fall for such offers, it’s a scam! Because if technical analysis would be a reliable way to generate profits, everyone would be a millionaire. A coder would have coded these \"technical analysis patterns\" and trade according to them. Such a program does not exist because it doesn’t work. Technical analysis is not predictable and doesn’t generate reliable returns. Like xkcd explained it: technical analysis is more like a pseudo science: https://xkcd.com/2101/HODL instead! When we are HODLing, we are taking advantage from Bitcoin’s scarcity. Bitcoin is limited to 21 M BTC. And every 210,000 blocks, block rewards (for miners) will be halved, decreasing newly issued units of Bitcoin aproximately every 4 years. By HODLing, we are simply taking advantage from Bitcoin's scarcity because Bitcoin is a good asset for saving. It might be volatile in terms of Bitcoin price now but as more people will hold Bitcoin, we could see Bitcoin's price getting more stable – increasing demand for Bitcoin as a store of value even more. It could take some years until we see some decent profits as Bitcoin's price has been moving in cycles of around 4 years but so far HODLing has proven to be reliable (and will also make Bitcoin less volatile).

Bitcoin just doesn't follow the technical analysis terms like the forex or it is me who is failed to give my 100% effort on learning and implementing those into bitcoin trading. It's because \"technical analysis\" doesn't work. Or why are there so many people trying to sell their \"trading courses based on TA\"?  They could just trade themself and make big profits as it's always advertised by them. But they don't do this. Wonder why?  Because it's not a reliable way to make a profit.  Maybe, we could analyze economic events and try to predict the market (often by insider knowledge). That's hard as well and also very risky but simply by drawing some lines into the BTC chart, and hoping that we are right, won't get us far. Or it wuld be very risky and only based on luck if we get far.

      "body": "Holy crap! This thread is spot on from what I experienced when I attempted day trading back then. I don't even know what most of those terminologies meant in the \"trading\" image. I took some time to learn day trading through Youtube (I believe it was Cryptojack channel that taught me not sure if the channel is still active though), since I was not fan of just reading books and not being able to see the demonstration of how signals are used. Binance was the first exchange I tried since it's the most mentioned one at that time.I only knew some instruments like Bollinger Bands and RSI and I thought that just by simply following the tutorial would somehow give me a satisfying results/profits, but nah. It all ended up in a loss and just by learning and watching throughout the whole tutorial I was already exhausted considering I also have my 9-5 and I was only trading in hopes of having some side hustle. I just went on and go full hodling and call it there. Best decision of my life.There might be some people really earning a lot from trading, but I won't go through those hoops of mental exhaustion ever again. Trading is not meant everybody.Love the tl;dr by the way, sums up what should I had done instead. I could have invested it more in learning programming instead.",

I tried trading once when I had free time when I don't have a small business outside but now, I can't focus too much on crypto just like trading which is time-consuming, or else, it's a wasting time.  Technical analysis won't work, it might I believe in fundamental analysis that's based on news than this technical analysis.  It's always the price is unpredictable.I learned to HODL in the long-term and aim for profit than trading.But, if you want to gamble your money and have a short-term of waiting profit, trading is good for you.  It's a high risk if you're lucky enough, there will be a quick profit too.",

Trading is not meant everybody.I totally agree here. The mental exhaustion part is a very important point. It's part of the game for trading and can also result in big losses if traders are making rushed decisions. As you've said, it's much more efficient to dedicate the time for other things.

This is because bitcoin is not like other foreign exchanges or stocks that can be manipulated easily.

The best advice I always get from most bitcoin supporters is just keep hodling because the gain of keeping your coins is far greater than the little profit you make from trading. Although the price currently looks attractive to trade, I have decided to keep my coin because it is my long-time investment.",

I mean you don't have to go through a tedious task of technical analysis on a daily basis; instead, you can look for buying and selling on a much longer timeframe. This way, you can maximize a good return but it will take a lot of patience and a bit of mental strain. Even if you don't sell at peak, there is still a good probability that the price will retrace for buying opportunity.I don't know, it feels like some people do this trick in accumumulating sats in the long run.",

If you know something is a shitcoin and it is going to die, then there is absolutely no justification for buying it in first place let alone bagholding it for such a long time as 6+ months! The only time buying a shitcoin could be acceptable is if you are seeing an ongoing pump and want to jump on board and most importantly if you get out very quickly like after gaining 20% profit or a couple of hours whichever came first.That's one of the rare cases that trading is OK with me.",

For example, one who held through the last bull run, cause they have not reached their target profit has the exact same amount of bitcoin as they did during the bear market, but another who sold at the peak or some percentage off it and bought back at the bottom or some percentage off it, would have a much higher amount of bitcoin in their portfolio.The downside here is you have to be constantly checking the price as well as holding some stable coins which you exchanged for bitcoin, while waiting for the retrace.- Jay -",
