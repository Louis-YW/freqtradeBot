  "content": "Hi!I repaired a s17Pro hashboard but now I get this error message in the kernel log. \"autodetection failed, no hashboard eeproms`s have been parsed\"Failed to detect miner type from eeproms\"Error: cannot detect mining hardwareI have the universal black antminer test fixture. I have tried to add another eeprom file from another s17Pro board with my code editor. But no progress.What can be wrong?Thanks in advance!/Magnus",

I have started to repair my own hashingboards. After many hours of testing and learning, I start to see some results.I now have 3 s17PRO hashboards that find all the chips. I use the chinese universal antminer test fixture. You have different files on sd card`s that you need to put in the test fixture depending on the hashboard model. I use Braiins and have put in one card at the time in the miner to see if the card works.But with all repaired boards I get this eeprom message in the kernel log.I read something that the test fixture overwrite the eeprom or maybe it was the pic file on the board, and you need to restore it again after repaired the board.Is that right. I have pickit 3.5 and the antminer code editor. What do I need to do so the miner recognize and start to hash with the repaired boards.For example, I see that I dont know the different between the eeprom and pic file.Thanks in advance!/Magnus",

ZeusBTC is selling pic files in a package, not by piece.However, I don't think the issue is the pic firmware the error is pointing to EEPROM so maybe the file you read from another hashboard might also have corrupted EEPROM you need to find a known working hashboard to read the EEPROM and flash it to these hashboard.- https://www.zeusbtc.com/articles/asic-miner-troubleshooting/3591-how-many-types-of-chips-are-on-the-antminer-s17-pro-hash-board",
