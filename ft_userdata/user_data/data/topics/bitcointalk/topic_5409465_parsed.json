  "content": "Hello I would like to request assistance with the following:I have been unsuccessful in the process of looking for / obtaining the Avalon a1246 firmware and openwrt os files on the site. I looked at the manual for any references to where else I can look. I went to your download page and was unable to find the firmware. I have attempted to make contact with their support team and still no response.On another note is there a way to enable ssh for openwrt on the avalon a1246 as I want to attempt to do a few commands via console for cgminer. Or does anyone know a way to properly use the \"privilaged\" mode.Is there anyway I can request these files?",

      "body": "Before they have firmware on their download page of this unit but they remove it last year I don't know why but I noticed the difference between their stock firmware and the firmware from their download page.Anyway, have you tried to use their new tool called \"Avalon Miner Upgrading Tool #Beta\" it can automatically detect your unit and able to upgrade automatically the the latest version. About sending commands, use the FMS app/tool that you can download at https://canaan.io/service/447You can send API commands under diagnose.",

      "body": "Good evening. I have been looking for simple information for a few days, but I cannot find the answer anywhere on the internet. Unfortunately this is very sad, as this information and much more should be found easily by users. I run the command \" [{ \"command\":\"ascset\", \"parameter\":\"0,hashpower,1295\"}] \" in the program you provided, the FMS tool, so far everything is perfect. The problem is that when the Avalon 1066 Pro is turned off and turned on or restarted, it loses this configuration. I tried to add several commands through cgminer in the additional commands option, but without success. My problem is simple: how do I insert this command permanently on the equipment? or any command that has the same function in the mining letters. thank you.",
