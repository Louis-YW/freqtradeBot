  "content": "Web3 gambling project recently launched in August 2022DISCLAIMER: This project has been posted before in the Gambling section before having the topic getting moved for dubious motives listed below so please advise.1. Accepting BTC: clearly written below how we support BTC2. Promoting an Altcoin: the in-house casino token is NOT the focus of this post as clearly stated belownice2win.comThe project?nice2win is a gambling platform running on smart contracts that allows to bet ETH, MATIC or BNB (very soon BTC) on games like:Coin FlipRoll a DiceTwo DiceEtherollRouletteNo signup required so you can stay anonymous. All you need is a web3 wallet. House edge is 1%. Non-custodial gambling ensuring no KYC or frozen funds.Why play?First of all, playing on nice2win guarantees a verifiable fair experience. In contrast to what is done on web2 platforms (99% of sites advertising on this forum), it is impossible for nice2win to cheat its users or alter results because the backend part of the platform is visible to the world. Moreover, centralized casinos have the potential to rig the odds (you are bluepilled if you don’t think this happens already, no matter how reputable a casino is). Players are entering bets with probabilities of winning that are lower than publicly displayed; this is reality.Gambling is actually one of the best use case for Dapps (web3 apps) because all the algorithms behind your favorite games are verifiableAdditionally, players receive $N2W on every bet, whether you win or lose. The token will be spendable on the platform and will eventually be tradeable on DEXes like Uniswap for example. The token is not the focus of this post and we do not expect users to care about $N2W unless they are serious gamblers on nice2win.Lastly, avoid custodial gambling platforms like the plague (see the FTX debacle) — NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINSOur specs?nice2win is deployed on the following blockchain networks:PolygonBinance Smart ChainOptimismArbitrumWith the help of smart contracts, we redefine the meaning of the expression provably fair commonly used in the community, with the following attributes:All bets are processed by hundreds of validators instead of one centralized database like the ones used on all popular web2 casinosVerify in real-time the code logic that processes your bet very unlike trusting a traditional black box casinoHave access to all-time history results for all bets ever processed by nice2win on; do not rely on the good faith of the \"house\" to store your precious data and coinsThe site is now available on mobile, tablet and computer. Currently working on the Stacks solution — they enable smart contracts for Bitcoin!The proofs?Medium : https://medium.com/@nice2winDune Analytics (for Optimism): https://dune.com/nice2win/nice2win-web3-casinoTwitter : https://twitter.com/nice2winDappDiscord : https://discord.gg/GwuDax5RRWGithub: https://github.com/nice2win",

Only casinos that are accepting currently Bitcoins, are allowed to have a thread here. Nevertheless the site’s features are truly impressive. No KYC, and no sign up tension. This is what all the gamblers wanted. Moreover we need to connect the Web3 wallet everytime from all devices, when we need to access our account.

      "body": "Thank you so much for the interest and questions! Let me answer to all of you @DaltonikBTC is actually integrated on our Beta platform right now with the Stacks solution! Just need a few more tweaks to be ready for widespread public use. I can post a screenshot of the Beta space?@joeperryLike I said above, can I post a screenshot of the BTC Beta space to avoid being moved for the next couple days until official launch?@piebeybYou don't need to register your email address to play on nice2win. As for the testnet version, we have supported it in the past and there was not enough activity for it to make sense long-term as there is a cost to run the nodes on all blockchain including testnets. You can always try very low bets (1$ worth of crypto).@NrcewkerSee above for the BTC integration. I'll post a screenshot later today. Thank you for the kind words and looking forward for the review.@coinererCompletely understand your hesitation. Being a web3 platform comes with its perks like you described. However, connecting your wallet to nice2win poses no risk to your funds being \"hacked\" because we do not ask the permission to have access to the crypto used to bet. Below is a screenshot as an example of a contract that would be able to use your funds if you do not trust the issuer after you used the platform.Token permission from 1inch:Moreover, you can check out the audit that was done on the smart contract we are using: https://medium.com/@nice2win/archived-nice2win-proxy-audit-analysis-ba48dedcd743.Basically, you will never be charged more than what you agreed to spend on your current bet.@HamphserYou are correct in your assumptions. To be more precise, giving the permission to a smart contract to have unlimited access to a token actually is a backdoor to \"hack\" funds from a web3 wallet, which we do not do of course. MATIC is one of the option to bet on the platform, you can click on the top right section on nice2win to swap between blockchains. It is definitely not the only payment method!@passwordnowThank you for the kind words and vouch. Looking forward to see you make a bet or two @bitcampaignTry it out and let us know what you think! Excited to read your enthusiasm btw!@HispoHello again friend. Definitely had to change a few things to get accepted in this community but I believe we will be able to solidify our place. Thank you and have a great day/night wherever you are As a closing note, we are definitely surprised by the amount of replies here in such a short amount of time so wanted to give a big shoutout to bitcointalk.org, you guys definitely have a serious yet welcoming community with many active users. Will make sure to spend more time here from now on!",

      "body": "@noorman0The technology behind decentralized applications is evolving, even for Bitcoin, which is usually left behind when we think about web3. Actually, per our own superficial knowledge on Bitcoin 3 months ago, we assumed the same as you; the Bitcoin blockchain does not support smart contracts and therefore interacting with BTC using smart contracts must be done with a wrapped version of BTC on EVM-compatible blockchains like Ethereum. After some research, we stumbled upon the novel solution called Stacks (https://www.stacks.co/). In short, Stacks uses the Bitcoin blockchain to store all Stacks blocks then the smart contract part is executed on the Stacks blockchain. Sounds like a sidechain, right? It is definitely not because of their use of the mining protocol called proof-of-transfer (PoX) which runs in parallel to the Bitcoin blockchain through their block headers. More information on their blog: https://stacks.org/stacks-blockchainIt definitely is a pretty new solution and is gaining more traction lately so I know it must be new to some of you.To conclude and reply to your question: Yes, you will be able to send your BTC on an address and the Stacks smart contract will receive them, record it on the Bitcoin blockchain, execute the smart contract code, record the result on the Bitcoin blockchain and send back to Bitcoin to your address if the smart contract determined you've won.This is definitely not the same process as WBTC on Ethereum because there is a centralized 3rd party whose job is to certify the WTBC:BTC ratio is 1:1. With Stacks, you do not need a 3rd party middleman because the verification is done synchronously with the Bitcoin blockchain and Stacks.",

That's great because they can get more customers that way, as there are gamblers who only use bitcoin no matter what.This casino have its own native token which is also normal for a web3 casino.

If I may ask how swift is your customer care service to responding to urgent attention.I see you give $2 to members wether they win or not. If I may ask from where do you make such budget from. Is it possible that such policy be sustainable for a long term. If yes how do you go about it. I w am curious about This particular aspect because you can not tell us that if it happens that you have a million number of registered members onboard your casino you would give them all $2 from where do you get that funds from.

As for your questions, let me answer:1.The minimum bet fee is different for each network. It is always around close to 1$ around worth of crypto. 2.The concept of withdrawal does not exist within a web3 casino like ours. You always keep custody of your coins.3.The customer support is fast depending if the team members are awake or not.4.We do not reward 2$ to members whether they win or not. We do reward them with the in-house currency $N2W which does not have any dollar value right now.@bitcampaignYes, you can try definitely try as little as your comfortable with. Just so you know, the biggest winner so far won 2000 MATIC in 2 bets, verifiable on the Polygon blockchain at any moment.
