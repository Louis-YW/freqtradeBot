There are bound to be more just like Ben McKenzie coming into these proceedings and voice their thoughts about crypto economy.",

They can use tulip bulbs, stocks (Enron), Internet (e-commerce 20 years ago), cryptocurrency in the last 10 years.Some scammers can try to compromise the advance and attraction of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to run their Ponzi scam. Like Onecoin which does not have its blockchain. It is actually not a cryptocurrency but many victims believed in Onecoin and believed that it is built on a blockchain.Ponzi will exist in society and if a scam team like Sam Bankman-Fried team did not use cryptocurrency, FTT and FTX, Alameda to scam others, they will use other tools which can be stocks, real estates or whatever.Cryptocurrency can not be stopped! according to Senator Toomey and I agree with him.Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Charges Against Leaders Of “OneCoin,” A Multibillion-Dollar Pyramid Scheme Involving The Sale Of A Fraudulent CryptocurrencySenate FTX hearing: calls for regulation and crypto criticisms aplentyQuote“The 2008 financial crisis involved obvious misuse of products related to mortgages — did we decide to ban mortgages?” said Toomey. “With FTX, the product is not the instruments that were used, the problem was the misuse of customer funds, gross mismanagement, and likely illegal behavior.”The senator added:“Some of my colleagues have suggested somehow pausing cryptocurrency before we pass legislation. This is a profoundly misguided not to mention impossible idea. Short of enacting draconian authoritarian policies, cryptocurrency cannot be stopped.”",

Of course, but these people are in a committee meeting on regulation of the entire industry. That would be much different then a rebuttal between a teacher and politician because that is just casual conversation and not where they can put laws into place where it shapes where things go from here for anyone who even touches a satoshi when it comes to taxes and your finances.This actor even says he is in an industry where he is paid to lie for a living.So take that as you will.",

FTX has given critics the floor to dance. Even people that do not know anything about the crypto industry would become instant Professors in the field. Ben McKenzie's statement is a baseless fallacy and this clown shouldn't be taken seriously.Although I felt that the use of celebrities by exchanges and other crypto firms to advertise their services helps in bitcoin awareness and promotion. But one of the biggest challenges of using these celebrities is that the can also be used by anti-government forces to discredit the sector. All these investigations and hearings are just pointing in one direction: Regulation.",

One thing I do feel, though, these hearings at least get the popular opinion out there and provide the grounds for myth-busting and disproving, which is what Bitcoin (unfortunately or not) has been steadily doing.Once you win people over, the converts are more useful than those who bought in from the start (I'm a convert, so I have no qualms in saying this).",
