Well, there are still traders that are moving the markets of it and that's why many are continuing on trading it.We have an idea of what has happened to it but people still not stopping completely on it because they still see a lot of people buying and selling it. Well, a time will come that it'll completely be down or if I'm wrong and these folks earn then that's all good for them.",

When you hear about a 15% reward for staking on a non-custodial wallet like trust wallet it sounds tempting which will trigger lots of people to go and buy large amounts of Luna classic in other to stake and get staking reward, the greedy will pump in thousands of $ so that they will make huge reward out of the staking, why they are busy rushing and buying the demand for for Luna classic will increase which will also impact on price positively.. that's to say their will be possibility of price increase. When you will be busy buying and price is going up why the entity  who are behind the staking reward idea will be watching to see their target ones that is reached they will sell off their holding which will eventually bring down the market back to where it was before the staking started or even worst. Since Binance is still with their holding they can implement any means necessary which will sound convincing in other to get something out of nothing which their holding is worth now.. The staking is just a game which I believe won't end well for those who want to acquire Luna and stake.",

The only problem is that the price of LUNC will probably go much lower since it's much easier to earn more LUNC by staking which has a negative impact on those who bought for a higher price.",

Maybe the action they do lately is just to hype this back but I doubt they get success since it might provably take time before they accumulate many holders back again. Also maybe this is just part of Trustwallet promotion but let see if they can convince people to join this staking promotion.",

Terra luna and terra luna classic are being traded in Binance. And why wouldn't they as long as they bring money to binance? Someone could ask that is it moral thing to do not delist it but there's money to be made by shorting and longing and they won't be turning that revenue down.",
