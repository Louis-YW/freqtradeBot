Check they're information, website before entering address or something else related to your important detailsthankyou for reminding this issue OP <3Oh that's actually relatable, I've also NFT era mostly of the projects get whitelist from twitter with certain events and mechanics. Not only the project itself has a fake account but also the mods and team itself. They copied their information sending you got \"you got whitelist you have only 24 hours to follow the instructions\" newbies wouldn't even double check it as they rush to follow the instruction since its hard to get whitelist that way in the twitter. Also the mint date where there's a lot of fake website even their social media account could get hacked and post fake links for minting.",

Like you said, it's easier to identify scams on Telegram than on Twitter but both are headquarters of fraud. Yes,scammers are often in a haste on Telegram, so their impatience will make them private chat their targets and that's a red flag. On Twitter, scammers just drop links and then wait for their traps to catch their preys. They don't rush. For me, I don't take anything crypto investment or giveaway on Twitter seriously any more.",

As far as I know, if I am right Twitter has implemented measures to detect and remove fake accounts, and has also rolled out a verification process for high-profile accounts to help users identify right or legit sources of information --and also Twitter has partnered with the various organizations to promote digital literacy and raise awareness about scams and other forms of fraudulent activity. Better to stay away from those airdrops and bounties that lead to this scam attempt.",

In the past they were able to hack accounts of celebrities. A lot needs to be changed by the new owner. The biggest issue on Twitter is fake news. We might have seen this happening for a DEX but it is quite common on that platform. A lot fake news was trended during the time of pandemic. Some of you might remember those incidents.",

Honestly, this is quite new to me despite all of the FUD that I'm seeing, I mean the strategy of how they can spread the false news like wildfire. That's why in every news that we're seeing whether it's from a reputable publisher or not, we all need to validate and verify if the details are correct and accurate. Especially that we're about to enter in the bull run, culprits might just do this trick for the projects that they think as a competitor to the project that they're working on or just want to fail.",
