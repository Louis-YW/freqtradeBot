  "content": "Finally, after all the speculations, the price of Bitcoin has touched the milestone of $100k. Something new has been created for Bitcoin. We have been waiting for such a moment, which has come true. The expectation that the price of Bitcoin will go further shortly can undoubtedly be fulfilled. Our wait was over, and we reached a new milestone. From here, we will touch more new lines shortly. What are your feelings about the price of Bitcoin reaching $100k?",

The states haven't started buying yet, and neither have the majors, other than MSTR. When they do we are going to see legs of tens of thousands of dollars in a day.Quote from: non fungible anxiety on December 05, 2024, 03:35:50 AMlol it finally broke 100k and went straight to 104, it's probably going to hit 110k this week.It is only 5%. You can do that in a day. But despite the joy we shouldn't get too excited because it's not going to be a straight line up. There will be dips where minnows will get desperate and sell at a loss.

I had expected that Bitcoin might not be very bullish in December and it might be a bit difficult to reach six figures this month, but Bitcoin has managed to cross $100k and reach $104k in the beginning of December, which is much more than I expected.It is really fascinating to see my holding portfolio during such a pump. I have not been looking at Bitcoin charts for the last 2-3 days, suddenly today when I observed my portfolio, I was really surprised. Two things surprised me a lot, one is the price of Bitcoin and the second is the growth of the portfolio. Today I am doubly happy.Happy BTCitcoin $100k Day!",

People needed someone like Trump to take over, the market was in complete fear and after he won the confidence was back, are you seeing what I am seeing? If trump failed to win it is possible that this 100k will be slowed down, it will eventually happen but probably not this period of time.This is a big victory to all strong believers who held their Bitcoin all this time, congratulations.",

Just like magic, $100k was reached in less than 24 hours of consistent price pump. With this price movement of bitcoin, i can strongly believe that bitcoin can achieve any ATH at anytime now. I like the joy am feeling right now and i will want this joy not to end too soon if a massive correction do not happen because since a lot of investors has marked $100k as their selling target, no one knows what will happen after now but even if a price correction occurs, January will be another time to experience a great surge in the price.

The more Bitcoin increases in price, the more it will create new records, and I am more confident that Bitcoin will reach the milestone of $200k in the future. However, even if it is not possible in this current season, it is most likely to be possible in the next 2025, because the impact of the 2025 bull run will be long-lasting, so of course the price of Bitcoin will be at its highest point at that time.
