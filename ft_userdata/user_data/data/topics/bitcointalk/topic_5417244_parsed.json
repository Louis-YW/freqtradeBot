You need to have a good understanding of the market and be able to react quickly when opportunities arise. You need to have a deep understanding of technical analysis and market psychology, and you need to be able to predict short-term price movements. Even if you do, it can take years to master the art of trading successfully. If you're looking for an easier way to make money with cryptocurrencies, then you should probably focus on earning them in the same way that most people do: by offering services and products that people need or want. Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that can be used as payment for goods and services like any other currency. If you want to earn cryptocurrencies, then you should probably focus on becoming an expert in a niche area of interest. Once you've become well known for providing value through your expertise, people will be more willing to pay for what you have to offer with their hard earned cryptos.",

You can sell your services or products for crypto currencies and this will allow you to earn crypto. This is the whole point of crypto currencies. The fact that not everyone is ready to pay for goods or services in foreign cryptocurrency, but such buyers still exist and their number is gradually growing. As a last resort, you can exchange the traditional money for crypto currencies, that in some way it will be possible to consider that you have earned crypto currencies (except for the intermediate stage with the conversion).",

I visited your post history and understood that you are deeply involved in bounty activities, maybe it is no longer giving you the results you want financially that is why you decided to look for other means to earn crypto.

If nothing else, after allegedly being hacked once, it makes sense to take all the security measures to prevent it from happening again. Using someone else's wallet is the complete opposite of that.
