  "content": "So... I dont see a lotta people talking about this other than a few handful on youtube and reddit.About the M2 Pro miner that they're selling on matchx.io.I ended up buying one even though their customer support for answering any kind of questions is a pile of horse crap.I have been mining for over a week.Now with everything i am about to say i am assuming that you already know a bit about how mxc mining works.If you would like to know more about this heres a video that explains it well : https://youtu.be/r67ZV77U-TQTheres been a few changes since that video was released but it explains the just of it.Keeping all that in mind. After a bit of hands on experience with this whole thing, even though i was a bit skeptical about this from the start, things started to become a little fishy.1. When i first bought the miner they claimed that they’ve shipped hundreds of miners to my country and shipped them using DHL. When it arrived in my country, MXC foundation had no idea about the document requirements for customs clearance so i had to manually contact them to get the documents specifically made for me to clear them.2. When you withdraw your MXC, lets say all of it, the fuel goes back to 0. Once its 0 any new tokens you mine (now at lower efficiency) continue to increase the size of your fuel tank. So the algorithm is FuelTank = x + new mined mxc EVEN if its less than 100% full. This makes it mathematically impossible to recover 100% of your tokens by mining alone forcing you to buy mxc or top it up manually. This violates the promises they made and things they explained on discord.3. Why not make it so your MXC wallet tokens, staked or not, work as fuel instead of a separate wallet if the whole point of this algorithm is to make people hold onto their mxc for longer periods of time?4. I accidentally bought europe version of the m2 pro and i am in asia, there is absolutely no difference in the amount of mxc i earn.5. They recently added BTC “mining”. While all you’re doing is, locking your MXC and getting rewarded in BTC. Thats not “mining” as they claim or is it?On top of all this, i see almost nobody asking any questions along these lines even though these are quite obvious questions to ask when getting into a new project.My personal opinions on this are not very good and i am leaning more towards of it being a scam. I will most likely keep the miner running and take what i can get.What are your thoughts?",
