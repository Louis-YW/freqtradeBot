AFAIK the token only trade in their scam exchange e.g. yobit, so if you think you want to make money on that's forum, you wouldn't make anything.In this forum you can join signature campaign if there's a spot, but there's no guarantee if the campaign will run forever, so just think it as a bonus.IMO learning a program skill might better since you could make more money if you've mastered it.",

You are a moving billboard that being paid to give exposure the company.The quality of your post is the one that will attract customer and keep your post stay since moderator will delete any spam post that you made. This is the reason why you need both criteria that you mention if you want to get paid in a signature campaign.",

Without wearing signature no compaign will give you any cent.Regarding the bolded part, that was maybe the case years ago but situation now is completely different. There's way more spots in signature campaigns than there are quality members and that happened due combination of increased amount of campaigns and decreased number of active members. Result of that is that even shitposters can get into one and earn decent amount of bitcoin.",

These are more like hiring influencers in the campaign to get more possible views and drive to the campaign/service that is advertised.",

But they prefer and accept (that's actually their manager's job) only high-quality bitcointalk posters. Because, obviously normal and regular users read and pay more attention to the posts which are better in quality, have good value, and contribute to the forum in some way. So, their signature ads gets more impressions from members when the posts are good and constructive which means a reward for quality and also serves the purpose of advertising.",

QuoteI want to ask whether we are paid because we are very good quality post maker and they like our post so they gave us reward  or primary purpose of the compaign is to advertise the project through signature banner? You get selected if the manager thinks you are a good quality poster, so that first point gets ruled out right at the beginning of joining. So the primary purpose of the campaign is the advertisement of the project. If you will remain in bitcoin paying signature campaigns which are the \"cream layer\" then you will feel as if the purpose of the campaign is to pay you. Try visiting the altcoin bounty campaigns and get the information from their participants and your view will change, the participants are treated like shit there.",

The majority of us use crypto, and a large portion of the forum also gambles; this is an ideal world for both.It's perfectly understandable that advertisers are after quality users who put some thought and time into their posts, since they are more likely to be read and interacted with by other users. For instance, I often tend to skip posts made from 1xbit's signature campaign since the majority of them post gibberish and spam. With that being said, campaign managers place several requirements and are careful in picking their participants. You're being paid to \"represent\" the company being advertised in some way; thus, you need to meet certain requirements.",
