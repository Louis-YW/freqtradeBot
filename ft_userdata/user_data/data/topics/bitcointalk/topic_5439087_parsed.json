You can however search around the ample amounts of information there is on a given topic, and ask whatever you wish, and people will normally chip-in. In general terms though, it may prove to be better to perform the said exercise of searching around first, not only to avoid duplicity, but to enable you to build-up a better context through which to better contribute or ask around the forum.",

You can also use the PM option to ask questions, but I would not advice it, since you're new and members either cannot receive PMs from you or you could abuse the PM rules and get banned.Quote from: Maestro75 on February 09, 2023, 10:24:02 AMBut there is an evil fee paid upon registration as a penalty for an alleged IP crime.

Well everything has been made pretty easy, all you need do is search and research and you will find whatsoever you are looking for, then you can read it and garner knowledge. In any aspect you need clarification on, you basically make a new post about it, and users will help you out, there is absolutely no need for any individual mentor or coach.Having said that, you've brought yourself out as a noob, so be careful of PM's from anybody offering to be your mentor, it might just be a scam, remember you have a responsibility to learn how to protect yourself/your funds.",

How come people share the same IP even when they are very far apart? I have noticed that my IP used to change sometimes when I get mails from some websites am subscribed to. It is slight change and if you do not look deeply you can miss the change. That means this distortion in IP is what makes new users share the same IP with banned accounts or any other reason?Quote from: Upgrade00 on February 09, 2023, 01:03:27 PMYou should not look at it that way.If the admins were looking for ways to make money, they would not disale donations on the forum.Maybe the donations have not been coming for sometime and the best thing will be to stop it publicly.

There are no such positions as mentors here stead we have moderators that help keep the forum sections in check against unhealthy and poor posts. The only mentor you can have here are the forum rules which will guide you on the dos and don't of the forum so I'll advise you spend quality time to read through carefully as some forum user's have giving you links to the rules of the forum and others articles that could groom your crypto trading skills, cause from your post the money to start isn't your issue but rather it's the lack of the skills to trade that's your major concern right now. You can see more post about trading from trading discussion and market place.to help you out gradually.",
