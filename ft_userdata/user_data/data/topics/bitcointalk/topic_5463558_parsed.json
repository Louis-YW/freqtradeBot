Confidence is not enough for this game to go your way, you can lose everything.I think there is more to this desire of yours, you asked for escrow but you want that person to contact you via Telegram? Isn't that a Red Flag? The website is Stake right? Why not find somehow living close to you and tell them to open an account on Stake? You can split the money and place the bet differently, or find another online casino and place another bet on the casino.Sorry if I sound harsh but asking someone to text you off this forum is not cool, you can get scammed or you might even be the scammer, sorry to say, but it's true, there are stories like this in the past.",

I have seen some of OP's weird bets that he usually posts in the forum. He is a high-risk bettor with so much confidence. He has won big and also lost big based on his past post-history.

If asking someone like me to help you out, that won't be possible when I knew that you can do that alone without needing anybody's help.This is valid advice for OP. Let him register on more than one gambling site in his country. This will enable him to divide his bets to different gambling sites making him achieve his targeted stake. There are many reputable gambling sites and OP can even register in as much as he can. This looks like a risky deal to accept, so any member willing to accept this offer should be careful. I don't know how you intend to handle the escrow arrangement but we have many reputable members offering quality service. An example is Gazeta's Escrow Service",

I have seen some of OP's weird bets that he usually posts in the forum. He is a high-risk bettor with so much confidence. He has won big and also lost big based on his past post-history. To begin with, he must have a lot of money to bet with those amounts. But what he is asking for seems to me to border on gambling addiction. Having to ask strangers on the forum to bet $250K for you because your limit is \"only\" $45K. It's not even for bets anymore. For a business for example, I would be much more careful and take much more time to analyze whether to send $250K to someone and how to do it, apart from studying the guarantees you would have, surely sign a contract or something. Besides, he says he plans to use an escrow, but I don't know how he will act, because at the end of the day the member who bets will have to receive the $25OK to deposit and bet it, and if he is going to ask for collateral I don't know if many members will have it or will want to leave it for that amount. Besides, if he wins the bet, keeping the money will be very tempting for some people.",

Well I still don't believe what he is trying to achieve on this. He wants to extend the limit of his bet and escrow it. As you rightly suggested, he can bet that in his neighbourhood and every of his friends would know he is a pundit if he wins. Why not leave out the forum or he can forget telegram and go public here. I think Op is even yet to respond to the enquiries here.",

I’ve been chasing the $1,000,000 dream for years. I don't know OP's business or job it seems he can maintain this huge betting unless you are printing money you cannot keep up betting huge amounts of money even if you're good, even if you win your $1 million you will keep extending your luck and keep satisfying and fulfilling your dopamine level. I hope he finds someone and they made a good deal since he mention escrow I hope he can find a highly reputable escrow, we're talking a huge amount of money here.",

He will only experience deception from that person, who will not contact him anymore because it is big money. And even though @OP uses an escrow agent to handle his money, he may run into scams.Why didn't he place the bet himself instead of entrusting others to place the bet? Does he have a problem with Stake? But that could happen because if he has no problems with the Stake, he can immediately place his bet without asking anyone else for help.

Please contact me via telegram @ syn_stakeI will of course need proof of limits so I’ll need to see some previous betslips etc. I was only able to place $45,000 on the match and $5,000 on another site but I want to do $300,000 in total. Do not message me if you don’t have the limits. The bet must be placed in crypto and I must be paid out winnings immediately after it wins, and it will win. Would be more time consuming and risky on doing such thing. It's not quite clear; are you being limited by your account in particular with the amount you can bet? Also, you may consider just creating another one than to make this concern a bigger matter. Asking in this forum will already give you a delay, finding that gambler you are looking for. Much better if you would ask your friends to create an account if you are too confident with this one. But if you would ask me if I will do the same thing then no. No matter how sure you are, things may still happen during the game. Whether you are confident or not, better manage the risk to be prepared for the possible outcome. There's no such thing as assured, why would it be even called gambling if that's so?",
