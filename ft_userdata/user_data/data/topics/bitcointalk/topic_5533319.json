They are building one of the largest bitcoin reserves because they probably know how it works and do not want to lose their market share because they didn't take action many years ago. In some years to come, this will be what investors may decide to check for before they invest in your organization.",

Bitcoin fall a little is an encouragement for some people and institutions to buy bitcoin.They have been accumulating before now and wishes to get more before the end of this year, this shows their first impressive moves towards getting there before the year runs out, am very much impressed seing a number of organizations taking this very opportunity in place for their own investment strategy, I also sensed something big coming sooner before the end of this year.Quote from: hugeblack on February 25, 2025, 12:28:52 PMQuote from: Doan9269 on February 25, 2025, 11:43:38 AMWhat are you waiting for when others are buying and keeping onto Bitcoin investment upon any entry opportunity, before we could go far in discussion, let's take a look at the awesome decision taken by Metaplanet in buying $135,000 worth of bitcoin in their local currency.I think you mean 135 bitcoin.Oh my bad, thanks for pointing this out, it has been corrected on the OP.",

      "body": "@Just Say, turns out they’ve been solid in buying Bitcoin since 2024, and what I like is that they’re not selling. If that total balance is correct, 2,100 BTC at the current price is nearly $187 million, but the value just dropped a bit since Bitcoin is now trading below $90K.Maybe the timing is good as prices dipped, so it’s a great opportunity for long-term holders to accumulate more.i think their main purpose of buying bitcoin is hedging against currency fluctuations since Japanese yen is volatile.. and another reason is to fight inflation as well.",

Then what about the future, I'm curious whether you are happy or not if they continue the accumulation they are doing for the next 20 years?Source:1. https://bitcointreasuries.net- Ammar M. A.",

But still having this amount for now is an advantage because they already have allocated funds for it.There are still hundreds of countries today that doesn't have any plans in BTC investment. If they let years pass from now without allocating for BTC reserves, they'd be buying them for more than its current price.",
