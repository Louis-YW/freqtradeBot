But the way you portray it, it's something exceptional, from my perspective individual person doesn't have the audacity to print a currency but you have the authority of having your token. That's the difference between token which is digital and decentralized currency and centralised currency",

So let's say you have a lot of fiat and we go into a hyperinflation crisis, you can expect something like in Venezuela, where you can spend a million bolivars which is a few notes and you won't even spend 2 USD. You have a wallet so full that you won't be able to close it, but all you'll be able to buy with that full wallet is a meal restaurant and some groceries. Having money is not going to save you in a crisis. You'll be in a better situation than people with no money, but you'll be quickly approach a moment when you have money and can't buy anything.",

Physical assets like cars, big screen tvs and electronic devices will also usually depreciate at a slower rate than currency under high inflation. Stablecoins are great but to be effective they must usually be pegged to some type of intrinsic backing. The value of physical assets and goods could rise. While non backed, less tangible, assets could trend towards reduced demand.",

That the price of a cup of coffee doubles is not really what the people consider as the problem, the problem in fact is that despite this massive increase their salaries remain the same. And the solution is not money because money itself is the problem. You continue printing and printing money, the prices of goods and services will also rise and rise, and your money will also fast lose its value. You're running around in circles. The solution is to create a stable economy.",

How lovely would that world be  But also, it would mean that the financial system is broken and that money is valueless, but for some reason a lot of people is still inclined to accept it even though it's really worth shit. Everything else failed, hence why the creation of money by other entities is permitted and that it is somehow working.No matter how much we turn the world upside down, the continuous printing of money to solve rising prices of goods will always end up in a disaster.",

In any case, someone who has a surplus, who with his income more than covers his expenses and the rest he uses for savings and perhaps investment, has not been so affected by inflation.Moreover, if he invests because he has a business or some other type of investment, he ends up, with the returns on those investments, beating inflation.As for the stable coins nonsense, you have already been well answered before.",

But so far, many people keep trying to collect a lot of money in many ways; some of them can earn a lot of money. Only people who are willing to put in the effort can raise a lot of money to spend on whatever things they want.We already have the opportunity to invest in crypto; if your coin choice is right, you can have a lot of money to its advantage.

However, what you said makes no sense; you obviously don't understand economics; stable coins are no different from fiat, only that they are digital money utilized in cryptocurrencies. When you print more money out of nowhere and due to the obvious power invested in some sector, they just want to forcefully give it value and you expect it to be balanced with life expectations, inflation is unavoidable when you go brrr, this is what fiat has been struggling with for decades, and 2022 was the rollercoaster of all, you see the FEDs making adjustments every month just to balance everything.",
