      "body": "Yes we do work with changenow. They are a great service and liquidity provider as well. I myself have never triggered a KYC on any of my swaps. Surely if you are in a sanctioned country such as North Korea or similar then yes this may lead to KYC. It is up to the exchanges discretion but you also do not have to go through with the transaction and your coins would not be \"locked or held\". Ultimately if your transaction is not considered high risk or fraud there is nothing to worry about.",
