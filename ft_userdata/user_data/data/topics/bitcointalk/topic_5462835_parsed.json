Besides we should be more resourceful and focused our efforts on informative updates that would enhance our ability and development towards our locals than crying over here.

Pardon me if I have offended anyone with my words, I just wish to bring these to your notice so you can advise. @OP, Yeah, we know that people make mistakes at times, but if the person is more observant, he or she can reduce their mistakes. I acknowledge the fact that there are high-ranking reputable members here like Igebotz, Charles-Tim, CryptopreneurBrainboss, scamvirus, CryptoHeadlineNews, Agbe, Nwada001, Obari, etc.; name them; these are people on this board who are contributing positively to the board and to the forum generally, so for a newbie who lacks orientation on how to go about the forum, why not look into the profile of any other of the mentioned users and get them as your role models? Learn from them immensely, that way, you will even be more conscious not to make mistakes.You don't have to blame any member here, whether high or low rank, for critisising a post. Sometimes, while replying to a post, I don't usually look at the poster, maybe until I have dropped my comment, and if my comment is not in any way wrong, I don't bother to delete it despite who the poster is. I believe that's also what most members do; they don't look up the name of a poster before they drop any comments. Although sometimes, if you are in a good frame of mind, you can reply calmly to an annoying thread, but when you see the member making the same mistake over and over again, then you might not really give the person a welcoming reply. As far as this forum is concerned, criticism is inevitable; if you don't like to be criticized, then the forum is not really your place. If you receive any criticism that you don't like, you can skip it and move on because it wouldn't cause any harm to you, or you can just defend yourself if you feel the person's criticism is wrong. Criticisms are not meant to kill you or anyone else, but they are still another way to correct you.",

Dem dey attack me dis days well well but no shaking I dey gedigba. Na so I take grow and I still dey on it. This your comment is not necessary at all. Yes, you grow from criticism shouldn't give you a free hand and make it a habit to be criticizing everybody just because you pass through the same thing. To me, this sounds like a vengeance which is not suppose to come from someone like you. As a leader, you absorb the pains to make it easy for people behind you and not that you make them pass through the same pain. That's how we'll attain development.Criticism is not totally wrong but one should use his sense while criticizing and make it constructive. When you criticize constructively, believe me the person you criticize will appreciate you and make ammendment but some criticism comes in the form of direct attack, hatred and sound more like insult without anything to derive in it. We grow by showing others how to do things the best way and not by criticizing. The reason you feel attacked is maybe due to your attitude of criticizing since you made your mind to make others pass through the same way as you. You know some people will definitely fire back directly or in disguise.OP, remember that you can not do without criticism here unless you have no intention of going far. Criticism is part of development and you should be ready to face. It's left for you to learn from them and ignore the ones that are out of line. Don't feel attacked when you are criticize constructively but rather pick point of it. You shouldn't also allow the trolls to discourage you by their criticism. No one is absolutely perfect and you should face your fears else you might become a red carpet in the forum where everybody will walk on.",

I will never want my younger ones to suffer the way I suffered, and di only thing for dem to do is to obey di local board rules, ask questions. Forum is very easy to navigate, there are only two things you are needed to do. You learn from others and you contribute to others from what you have learned. But when you have known this, there is another thing that affect we the 9ja guys, which is English language. Which is resolved as time goes by individual users.And I am not trying to make him scare or he must suffer but I am trying to make him to understand that attacks and criticism is part and parcel in the forum wether u r a naija or not but as a Nigerian e get limit 2 do dat but di correction must make. And again what I will advise the op is that he should have a thick skin to over come them. What we do here is for you good and not for your goods. I always help good post in the local board with Merits and contributions. Local board is not to pamper you but to train you. Now after the creation of the local board, rules has been created to guide everyone in the local board but the newbies that are coming disregard it and do things the way they want. Create threads anyhow. And because of this attacks and criticisms day matter is some good. Those who know me know me. I am not making di op to scare and I only tell my life history in di forum and dat does not not mean dat I'm going criticize but if it is necessary.",

If I can remember very well, members like Wiwo, letteredhub, CryptoHeadlineNews, Agbe, Adbitco, DaNNy001, and Merit.s, our now-banned brother, myself, and others carefully debated issues concerning how members are being treated here on our local board and on the forum at large.So in this situation, if I am to address you based on my experience, I will tell you to grow a thick skin, just like either our princess or Loyce have said. It's better for you to be addressed and corrected by the people in your locality than for the people in your locality to be defending you when the person in question does not really care about what will come afterward. I will advise you to just ignore whatever criticism you may be getting from members of this board and outside the board, pick some motivating words wherever you can, and move on. See them as words of encouragement, as no one was ever free from that. I was also criticized on the forum by some of our locals when I had not yet identified myself here, and I have also received some hate speech from others aside from this local.My brother eh all depends on how u carry reason the matter, anyone way u see as advice u take am carry work on ur self, anyone way also fall as insult u by pass am nah watin them mean by the thick skin.",

Pardon me if I have offended anyone with my words, I just wish to bring these to your notice so you can advise. There is a proverb that say \"Spare the rod and spoil the child\" which means when you see a child doing bad or something wrong & you fail to correct him or her at that moment, you end up contributing to spoiling that child, which is why when we Senior members on this forum see a newbie member going astray, we always try to make sure such Newbie follow according to the laid down rules that govern this forum, which though our approaches may differ from one person to another, but that doesn't mean we hate or dislike anyone here. Because just you @ \"O.P mentioned about someone accuse you of using A.I for post-generation, we all know that that is highly prohibited here, and as such should be the last option anybody should ever think of using on this forum, as in one way or the other, you must surely be caught. So please, when someone correct you, don't take it personal, because most times we do that for the best interest of the Nigerian local board.",
