I'd like to highlight the basic accumulation when you start getting involved in bitcoin, one year with little capital it's nearly impossible to make big profits, unless you try to take a regular approach through DCA to accumulate incremental purchases. You've executed an excellent approach by ignoring altcoins, but there aren't many sources to point me to your initial purchase of bitcoins.At least when you explain the basic pattern, strategy and purchase amount then many people will probably take the same opportunity as you and that's good for beginners in implementing how to invest in bitcoin, because they have a handle like your strategy and they will make the right decision.Quote from: Ojima-ojo on April 19, 2023, 05:48:36 PMNow even though I am at profit and have gained financial knowledge through the help of the bitcointalk forum, I will still buy more bitcoin even at the current price because of my personal belief in bitcoin's ability to cash up with the current market situation to always place me at less risk.If it's true that you're taking more buying opportunities, I think now is a good time to raise and if the halving happens next year then you're in for a big hit. Your current buying period will probably be much shorter for large returns, as the cycle will repeat itself and bitcoins will return at a higher price.",

Bitcoin is one of the most recommended for you to own and whoever they are in the portfolio regardless of your investment time frame. It is a very wise decision if you also accumulate it when you have income to invest. And if you can afford to hold for long-term, then I think you'll definitely get a worth it return.But I don't think your thread matters because basically you are just presenting your enthusiasm for bitcoin investment instead of coming up with some interesting ideas for discussion.",

If yes, didn't you sell and pick up the profit? Accumulating is fine with me, but when doing so, I always have a selling target. I also sometimes know when to stop losing, but that's not my case with Bitcoin. It's also a safer move for you that you avoided all shitcoins. Even though the gains are tempting some times, I do trade the shitcoins, pick up the gains, and move (they are just temporary tokens to buy and sell, not to hodl).I wish you success with regard to your passion buying. I'm also still accumulating, but not as much. I accumulate more irrespective of different events. Every stakeholder has a different buying strategy. Use a method that works for you.",

It was a nice approach because when there's blood on the streets and people say that the asset has died and there's no more interest of anybody in it, that's when it begins test the patience of real hodlers who don't give a damn about the price of BTC but keep buying it and gain more and more possession. This is a very good way of being a good hodler and also get into profits in a matter of years if you're a long term hodler. However, congratulations to you and we hope that you excel in your journey ahead.",

It's your love for Bitcoin that made you to stick with it. I believe that's the best decision of your life.QuoteI give zero attention to shit coins even though other may have different opinions about altcoins but as for me for the past one year, I have been bullish in my Bitcoin approach and for the first time my asset have gain amazed profits. Your opinion regarding altcoins is not correct and calling them shit-coins is not fair. I know that some of those altcoins can be called shit-coins because they have nothing good to offer and are made of pumping and dumping. But, on the other hand there are some really good and valuable altcoins that have made many traders prosperous. QuoteI am buying more bitcoinNow even though I am at profit and have gained financial knowledge through the help of the bitcointalk forum, I will still buy more bitcoin even at the current price because of my personal belief in bitcoin's ability to cash up with the current market situation to always place me at less risk.That's sounds good because accumulating more bitcoin in current market will increase your profits. Many things are in favor of Bitcoin these days and in coming months the expected price of Bitcoin will surpass $35k, and after that the bull run will start. And, if you are lucky enough then you might get chance to earn 1.5x - 2x return from your investment.",

My crypto journey was really more of a bad experience; I have invested in a few altcoins that are just worthless today. Although we can't tell what will happen in the future, we only speculate on Bitcoin. But looking into the history of Bitcoin, it has really come a long way. Even when the Bitcoin price fell by 99% in 2011, some people think that was even when Bitcoin would have crashed if it was supposed to, but it did not, and that is really the date I look back to when I hear people talk ill of Bitcoin. Your decision to invest in Bitcoin is really good OP; even if I go into buying a few altcoins now, I don't keep them, I just pick up my little profit after some weeks or a month and move on. holding altcoins is just a waste of time, apart from a few (one or two), I am just using them to add to my portfolio.",
