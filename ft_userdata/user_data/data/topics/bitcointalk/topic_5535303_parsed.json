  "content": "It's very interesting seeing the movement of this Vega Hub project construction coming to completion. I read that the site will provide 205 megawatts of power supply, although it's also a good and massive development for the Texas state in time of crypto, and there will be more opportunities for management to host miners to increase the Hub8 energy capacity and also a massive boost to the Bitcoin network because there will be an increase in the decentralization of the network and high security also; however, it's good seeing Bitcoin winning.What's your thoughts about this Vega Hub mining project?https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miner-hut-8-secures-205-mw-power-agreement-in-texas/",

All are controlled by a CEO and executive team, all had an ICO, etc. That is the definition of centralization. They are no different than any company listed on the NY stock exchange in how they function and were created.Ethereum's 'Censorship' Problem Is Getting WorseFour of the five biggest \"block builders\" on Ethereum are excluding transactions sanctioned by the U.S. government, data shows. By Sam Kessler, CoinDeskFor many believers in blockchain, the technology's allure lies in its open, uncontrolled nature â€“ where decentralized networks are unfettered by the constraints and biases that shape today's internet.But some researchers and users of Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, are increasingly troubled by data showing a marked increase in censorship â€“ what appears to be a concerted effort by block builders to exclude transactions linked to entities sanctioned by the U.S. government....This information is not surprising when crap like ethereum and XRP make no secret about their goal to become thenetwork providers for running government CBDCs (central bank digital dollars, euros, yen, yuan, etc.)",

      "body": "Quote from: headingnorth on March 17, 2025, 08:49:33 AMCan you name one transaction that has ever been censored by the bitcoin network?Due to the transparent nature of Bitcoin, transactions donâ€™t even need to be censored at the mining level, as they are on some OFAC-compliant mining facilities, but can instead be placed on a sanctioned blacklist.These bitcoins will be forever tainted, and whoever touches them will have trouble with law enforcement.If you still believe Bitcoin is censorship-resistant and fungible, I dare you to trade your bitcoins for those originating from a major theft - you can post your offer on a DNM.You simply canâ€™t have censorship resistance without proper privacy, as in Monero.Remember Canadaâ€™s Truckers Protest (2022) ? QuoteOn February 14, 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau invoked the Emergencies Act, giving the government power to freeze financial assets, including crypto.The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the Ontario Superior Court ordered crypto exchanges and wallet providers to block transactions linked to specific Bitcoin addresses.Major Canadian exchanges like Bitbuy and Newton complied with the order.Despite the crackdown, a portion of the Bitcoin donations was successfully distributed to protestors using paper wallets and QR codes.However, some BTC was seized when authorities raided protest organizers.A court later ruled that around $1 million in Bitcoin and other assets must be returned to the government.You see, you might get away with your Bitcoin, but if the government knows how much you have - and they do, because itâ€™s transparent - they will force you to give it back or put you in jail. Â Simple as that.If the truckers had used Monero directly, the government would never have known how much they received from supporters, as itâ€™s all encrypted - just as it should be.The outcome is the same as if the transactions were censored at the protocol level, and you can bet that soon all mining facilities will be forced to comply with OFAC regulations.QuoteAs of August 2024, Foundry USA and AntPool collectively controlled approximately 57% of Bitcoin's total network hashrate. Both of these mining pools implement Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures to comply with regulatory standards, including those set by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This means that over half of Bitcoin's hashrate is managed by mining facilities adhering to OFAC compliance. Â Monero grows stronger with each new regulation like this, with every delisting, it becomes more decentralized and more resistant to control as users switch to non-custodial wallets and P2P trading.And because Monero is truly decentralized, the government canâ€™t force miners to comply with any regulations.Remember: Only with Monero can you truly have a boating accident. What is really annoying is people who know all of this but knowingly turn a blind eye and push their false narrative just because they want their bags to get heavier.",

Monero is delisted from every exchange in the US where I am from, so asking people to use monero where it is banned is not possible, At least not without a lot of technical knowledge of the dark web and resorting to some legally risky or questionable activities. Monero is delisted from Coinbase and even Binance (both US and international versions), which is a pretty huge blow for its viability. Being delisted is even worse then being censored. If you can't even use it then what is the point? There is no point of using monero as an investment as people do for bitcoin. Monero is used for privacy or hiding transactions, while Bitcoin is seen as a long-term investment. These are two very different things and you are comparing apples and oranges. Monero might be a better choice for certain uses, but trying to turn bitcoin into monero will likely result in bitcoin being widely banned or delisted like monero has been.",
