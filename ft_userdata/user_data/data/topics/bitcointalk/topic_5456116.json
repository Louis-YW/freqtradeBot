Was it the April fool stuff that scared you from the forum PR you have been busy reading and not posting...WhateverLet me also add more to what you said above,bitcoin is highly volatile and is limited in supply of only 21million. It is the most valuable assets presently in both physical and digital assets. All other cryptocurrency was duplicated from it and depends on bitcoin price for their own price. It use P2P payment method and goes far beyond boarders without a third party. The halving makes it more unique and seen as a store of value because it is inflation resistance and has no censorship. Bitcoin as they say is the future gold.",

Manipulative media is there to spread fear to those that can't take the market.

Bitcoin was the first successful cryptocurency to be created and has keep its integrity of been decentralized, the new guys coming into the market are just full of flaws and it's disappointing because you would had thought they'll be better than the first since they should learn from its shortcomings and better their creations but that's totally opposite of what's happening.
