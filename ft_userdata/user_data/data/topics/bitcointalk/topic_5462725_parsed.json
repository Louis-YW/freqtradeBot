It will be helpful to your case if you can give more information as to why the company refused to approve your withdrawal. I hope you have contacted customer support and tried to resolve the issue before coming here to accuse or threaten the casino.",

Possibly, they might be conducting a review on your account or doing anything in line with their laid down procedures to have you access to your token and come to talk of it, the volume of your withdrawal warrants them to do the needful if truly they are doing any review of such on your account. You should give them a little time and another thing is that your claims lack proof and evidence to validate. Lastly, I think this is the wrong board for this post as Nwada001 has already directed you, you can move this thread there for other necessary actions to be taken if truly you want the desired attention you are seek for.",

So the Op is confused nothing more.You just cleared the air, as I was also as lost as the OP. What someone does not know is actually bigger than the person. Which means these tokens can just be considered testnet tokens as they have no real users aside from the BG game platform, and no value can be added to them.And users using the BG token could also be considered to be on a DEMO account as it's specifically set out for testing for the platform and nothing more attached to real other than having an experience on how things works.",

So the Op is confused nothing more.You just cleared it perfectly. And that's why new users sometime make false accusations on a reputated platform because of little knowledge or lack of DYOR.As already mentioned that this token currently doesn't contain any value and in future this may be converted to the rewards. So I think @Apolinario you should withdraw your accusation and don't make this thread longer because new replies will be worthless. So you just lock this thread to avoid spamming and edit your title with [Solved] . And think twice before you make an accusation and always provide proper detailed information in your thread to verify by us or to support you.",

So the Op is confused nothing more.Now I see a clearer picture of what is going on. OP possibly did not ask question or maybe OP failed to understand the system of operation from their end as the picture as uploaded from the conversation here says it all. That is why one needs to do their own research before coming here to complain or raise a scam accusations against anybody or organisation.From the whole scenario now I think OP is doing this just to get at the casino even though they have lots of accusations and pending cases to handle which is awful and I believe OP has seen this now and would know what to do rather than chasing shadows.",
