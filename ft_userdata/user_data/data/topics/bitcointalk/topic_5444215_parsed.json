Bitcoin has bad reputation by lot of fud and I don't say Bitcoin is bad but think of your business. If you apply for a grant, you must consider what is that philanthropic organization accepts. Do they accept cryptocurrency?This question is for your own research because you don't have to convince that organization to accept Bitcoin or cryptocurrency and if they have yet accept it, you won't be able to convince them.Hence if you apply for a grant with Bitcoin as a payment option, you likely will create bad impression.",

The type of information a person will think about including to maximize the likelihood that his request will be accepted depends on what he is applying for. You don't appear to include anything that is unrelated to the application you are making in the first place.Instead of adding bitcoin when he already doesn't know the criteria the philanthropist is seeking out for giving out loans, the OP could just be on the lookout for something that would boost his chances of being granted a loan than adding bitcoin.",

Would you wait for the prices to surge so you can get equivalent amount for your business or use the remaining amount? You need to consider it before dealing in volatile currencies like bitcoin when you are into serious things so make sure you are comfortable with it but it would be best to settle down in your legal currency at the moment and later on get involved into this.",

But if you think it's not too big a problem, you can put it. It is up to you. But my advice is that if you really need this loan, you should not put Bitcoin payments on your business, in case one of the stakeholders is not pro-crypto and refuses your loan. You know nowadays there are quite a lot of people who are not pro-crypto and their reasons are unreasonable in rejecting crypto, even if your business is not directly related to crypto but they don't like it.",

Do a background check on them. Read up on the top executives in the organization. You could do this by looking them up on social media. If they seem like a progressive organization, or the executives have made one or two comments on social media that look like they are open to new ideas, then I would say you should go for it. If not, you may choose to risk it, but do not place too much emphasis on the bitcoin payment option. Just say it in passing. That's the best I can give to you for now.",

I will advice you not to try it because since they didn't put it in their method of payment. So many people believe bitcoin is for rich people, seeing your name in the list of member of an association of small business owners they will like to reject you because they will think that you already have money.If you need bitcoin you can buy it when you have money so just aspect any method of payment they bring. After receiving the money then you can proceed to buy the bitcoin. But if you can take the risk it okay, who knows it may be it turns round good for you. It is good to take risk but genuine risk.",

A firm or NGO dedicated to helping by means of grants would very much be the once to put out these options that might come easy for them and not you putting out what you think would be easy and hope they go with it. Good enough you acknowledge the fact that, they might not be pro-bitcoin and buy the idea, in fact, they might get the wrong idea about cryptocurrency apparently and go into a scare to oblige to your quest.Don't forget, it doesn’t end in them just paying out this money but, keeping a ledger to track how there funds have been utilised. You might he as well asking them to open an account which they don't have and that doesn't look good.Let them be the onces to put out this options and you get to concur.",
