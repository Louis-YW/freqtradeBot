  "content": "Okay well .... if someone has any time, i would appreciate some help with the following..- if you have a move on a wallet, and it has recorded this so 1btc from A to B .. how are you able to take B and send it to C externally...   Do i just sign it with B? it being internal? - I have a txn which comes back with a stack error, its not the privkey missing  but the sigscript inst there when i decode it ..  So how can i add this into the createraw process? so it builds in the sigraw result?   yes there is a output with asm and sigscriptJust to add onto this i thought a move to another address would resolve it, .. (no its not in the same dat hehe) and relates to the question above.  so 4 days of driving myself nuts  if anyone wants to be nice and has some time for telegram, id appreciate the hand holding, and will send you a holiday card.i really dont like txns.. its either been that or the flag type .. the signrawwithwallet was a nice add ...... anyways .. yes the wallets are unlocked and bal keypoolsize unlocked until paytxfee privkeys true etc are all good. besides some other misc question .. is it best to use bitcoind as opposed to the client .. i feel so newbie lol or it could be the headache ....  @mikejnpc...",

Every address and private key are generated in a unique manner so they are harder to identify.",
