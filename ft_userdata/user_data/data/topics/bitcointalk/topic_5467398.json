  "content": "If you remember, in 2021, this was one of the reasons why BTC rallied when Tesla accepted Bitcoin for payment. But this is also the reason why the price of Bitcoin fell in the market when they also removed it as a payment method. And the reason for Tesla at that time was that Bitcoin mining was not environmentally friendly.But now, because of this article from 5 days ago, over 50% of the energy used for Bitcoin mining now comes from renewable sources. Because Elon Musk mentioned in 2021 that they will only accept bitcoin for payment again \"once miners were using roughly 50% energy sources\" with a positive future trend.That said, Bloomberg analyst Jamie Coutts, CMT,QuoteOver 50% is said to be the energy source used in Bitcoin mining, which means this is positive news for bitcoin. Because if Elon Musk fulfills his promise that Tesla will accept Bitcoin again for payment, there is a very high chance that the price value of Bitcoin will rally due to the strength of Elon Musk's influence in an industry like this. Is that the type of tweet that is positive for Bitcoin? Even if it's just a short post, it has a big impact on the market, and he has seen and proven that in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu before.So let's just watch out for Elon's tweets so we can track the trend.",

And thats how market works on which into those people who do have that reputation and popularity could really do whatever they want. Like it or not which it would really be making out some effects on the entire market specially if those sentiments would really be attached on Bitcoin or with some crypto related news or events which its not really new anymore.Somewhat not all happenings or events would really be having that significant effect towards the price because there are really moments on which you would really be able to see that it didnt really make a dent or effect. It would really be entirely be depending on the community or people around because if people would really be finding out that Elon did say such thing but turns out to be a bluff then it wont really be hurting that much. If he would go true into his words then there would be some pumpbut i dont expect that it would be much which as been said that once it pumped and people around get hyped then dumping do starts once again.It is really just that a simple cycle where it would really be that so normal that people would really be taking out actions basing on what they are seeing and basing on what the people around beenhearing in regarding sentiments or market news.",

You couldn't have analyzed it better! I'm fed up with the way Elon Musk just has to manipulate the market at will just because he can. Well who cares if he will keeps his promises or not? He's a businessman and if conditions are not favorable for him, he'd break them and put up some lame excuse that the media and the public would eat up.",

Although somehow it will still have an impact on raising the value of Bitcoin, Even if we say that there is another community in crypto who is annoyed with him, But for sure, Elon is not able to raise the value of Bitcoin by 50%; maybe that's not the case.Then the question is also there: maybe the only thing that will happen is a temporary increase in the price of BTC in the market, but it will not continue. Maybe what happens there is just a pump and dump, but if that's the case, it doesn't matter what happens.Rather than expecting that, I'll just continue what I'm doing to accumulate in other cryptocurrencies while we're still bearish for now.",

It might appear that he does that more often, but there are also some executives who should also support his decision before they can take any of his words into consideration. Looking at what happened back in 2021 after he sold out their bitcoin holdings, using the mining energy is just an excuse he wants to give to the public to justify their reason for selling off their bitcoin holdings. This time it appears that the high energy that bitcoin is consuming has been reduced to the minimum, and I can bet it that he won't make any move to grab back their sold bitcoin in a hurry. Even if he wants to buy back those bitcoins or start accepting bitcoin again, it won't be in this hurry. This guy is just after what can make him and his company richer and not what can benefit bitcoin or make the public feel better. He says whatever he likes and does whatever will favour him. He is a real businessman and a corny one for that matter, so let's just expect the least from him and move on.",

Despite this, Tesla held bitcoin but sold it to the market later on. This news will have a positive impact throughout the industry, and companies like Tesla are likely to come to the market again as, as Elon previously mentioned, Tesla will accept bitcoin when miners reach the 50% clean energy mark. This will be a major boost for the bitcoin industry.Like I always said, we do not need Elon Musk. Bitcoin need people, not a single person. After bitcoin decreased in price at the time when Tesla no more accept bitcoin for payment, the price of bitcoin later increased to all-time-high.",

I feel he is again trying to manipulate the Bitcoin price, which means he is trying to manipulate the market. If he starts accepting Bitcoin then we can expect a Bull run of some sort before the halving. If he is bluffing then the market will remain the same till halving and then we could see Bitcoin price going in upward direction.

The price dumped hard when China banned bitcoin, it was probably nothing to do with Elon. So in essence who cares what TESLA do, how many people bought a TESLA with bitcoin any way, probably less than 100.",

Being one of the major car manufacturers, their involvement in the bitcoin marketplace is a significant event. They can introduce many possible utilities of bitcoin into their platform as their major concern about bitcoin has been resolved and all the major players are coming to the market, so they don't want to fall behind, I think.Elon should be in jail for manipulating the price. Because of his dirty game, another shit project shiba inu, and pepe occupay raised millions of dollars from the market, which should have gone to bitcoin and other major markets that have real value.",
