  "content": "There are some confusion that might make me a little doubtful about the development of Bitcoin prices and adoption in 2024, which we all know that we will face Halving Bitcoin as well as the ETF agreement which is the most powerful indicator in encouraging Bitcoin prices, so that many people are speculating and accused The nominal is quite fantastic in Bitcoin in the last 2 years of the current cycle.There is a dilemma that disturbs my mind, about the wider potential of war in the region of Palestine, we witness the reactions of various countries at the end of this week in the area, and show the great power of the eastern and western blocs, which we know that America and Friends said firmly that they became a strong supporter of Israel's annexation to the Palestinian region. Conversely Russia, North Korea and neighboring Palestinians, Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran and others support Palestinian independence and are ready to be behind Palestinian troops, which all makes conflict and political tension of the power of the world's major blocks that might trigger a big war to occur if did not find a meeting point in this conflict.From various sequences of problems and many aspects that can be associated, I become doubtful with the price development of Bitcoin which in the event of this war is enlarged, so as usual Bitcoin will experience a price decline, even though we know it is not just bitcoin that will be a victim of this conflict happen.I do not mean to frighten or make FUD, I just want to discuss to share thoughts, but for an bitcoin intelligent investor, how do you respond to conflicts that have probability to suppress Bitcoin prices?",

In bitcoin perspective, the first challenge will be the energy crisis that will follow it, we all know how much of an energy needed by miners to able to mining and run there business if it becomes scarce and probably costly we might see an either see an upsurge in price of bitcoin or the reduction of miners (most especially solo miners). The other thing is in the face of war many will actually be concerned about the currency of each nation, because economic crises like inflation and recession will be face whenever there is war and these are things that actually affect the value of fiat and as such many will be looking to take away there funds away from any fiat currency and pursuing assets that have a great store of value and I think many will push towards bitcoin as they seek solution to devaluation of fiat. In the meantime the only plausible solution is to hold and accumulate more bitcoin, should the crisis causes any kind of price fall to bitcoin, you continue to hold.",

The war between Russia and Ukraine even affected the price of Bitcoin or the crypto market, everything decreased. But gradually it rose again because Bitcoin was also used as a transaction during the war. Those who have great wealth in Bitcoin will be greatly impacted and it will be a tipping point when prices begin to fall as the war continues. We all hope of course that the war will end soon and there will be peace.",

If today you can afford to invest only $100k, then don't put more money into it just because you have it. The risk of falling prices due to politics, economics and war cannot be avoided, but the best strategy to grow from this situation is to accumulate for a long-term investment plan.Have a good risk tolerance and plan things well and thoughtfully. Halving can help the demand and price of bitcoin grow, but FUD can prevent the market from becoming bullish. Even if you don't really want to spread FUD, but discussions like this are just concerns that can likely be considered very bearish.",

That's what I usually notice when the market is in the consolidation stage, meaning the market is undecided. Those disasters, can give a negative impression to people that will help us to decide into something like crypto, and it's also true in forex. However, these are not new events so there is not much change in the market. But if this war continues, it is possible that the price of Bitcoin will fall. But for me, I'm very positive that what will happen to Bitcoin is a minor dump, and it won't be the same as before it was volatile so I'm not worried.",

So that is already a big test that we passed with flying colours. And then we have the Ukrainian war in the beginning of this year and yet the effects are minimal. So it's ok to be paranoid on the geo-political happenings in the world like war, but I don't think that bitcoin will be affected in general.",

For relevant and common reasons why they come in and buy Bitcoin one of them is when they see the price increase.If the price of Bitcoin goes down or doesn't experience significant changes after the halving, this could potentially result in losses, but if the price is still reasonable and still worth maintaining, I think this is no problem and there's no need to worry, especially for BTC. For other coins, I think it might be beyond my expectations.Yes. I also see that this leads as you said above, causing many investors and traders to be very reactive to the halving event, but usually prices rise as demand increases.",

It has been declared \"dead\" many times, yet it keeps rising. If it does experience a dip, it's often due to manipulation, and its price will eventually return to stability.

So it's hard to be sure that everything will stay the same and nothing will change. Bitcoin is getting bigger and more popular, so to say that it is not tied to the economy is not entirely true. The current war has not caused too much instability, but with the supporting parties also being strongly divided, I fear the war will spread and become more serious.
