  "content": "It's funny, worrisome, and mind-boggling how a centralized platform could have all kinds of reasons for freezing funds. Crypto exchange Hotbit suddenly froze its users' funds as well as the deposit, withdrawal, and trading functions of the platform. The reason? One of their former employees was suspected by law enforcement authorities of being involved in a questionable project. As a result, some senior managers were asked to cooperate in the investigation. Some funds of the exchange was also ordered frozen. But why include all of the users' funds? Why the sudden freeze of the rest of the users' trading and withdrawal functions? Moreover, orders were all canceled. And, worse, \"all leveraged exchange-traded fund positions will be liquidated.\" Finally, there's \"no timeframe for resumption\" of all activities.All that's happening with centralized platforms recently makes me cringe. It chills me to the bone! If others are still trusting centralized platforms until now, it's time to rethink seriously. 1. https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-exchange-hotbit-says-it-froze-customer-funds-due-to-alleged-criminal-ties-of-formal-employee",

And now the consequences for customers with that convenience befall, when their insiders are involved in criminal activities then anyone becomes the target of investigation by legal authorities, including normal customers.",

If a single employee being accused of insider trading or some other financial crime is enough to result in an exchange having a majority of their assets frozen and therefore forcing them to suspend all activities for their users, then every customer of every exchange is taking an even bigger risk than previously thought by leaving any coins on those platforms. Not only do you have all the usual risks of scams, thefts, hacks, insolvency, etc, etc., but now you also have to trust every single one of their employees not to do something risky or stupid which could end up in your funds being inaccessible.",

OR it cuts checks to the people who had money in the bank.HOWEVER, there have been times when what should have been a couple of days took a couple of weeks.No different then here, but back before BTC and \"not your keys not your coins\" people were discussing \"cash not in hand is not your cash\"Yes this is supposedly a criminal investigation but in the end if you don't have it, it's not yours.....-Dave",

The authorities seem to know what they are doing. There's an investigation going on, yes, but the freezing of all of the users' funds is not the order of the authorities. The order to put a halt to all of the exchange's activities including deposits and withdrawals is not coming from the authorities. The cancelation of all unfilled orders and the forcible liquidation of all leveraged positions is not done in compliance with the investigating authorities' decision. They're all decisions of Hotbit. The authorities only ordered a freeze to some of the exchange's suspicious funds. Furthermore, they're only inviting a number of senior managers for assistance. They didn't issue a blanket order. And what now if a former employee is under investigation? Does that justify the freezing of all users' funds? I don't think so. A former Coinbase employee was also investigated for possible criminal violations, Coinbase didn't freeze all of its users' funds. Coinbase's CEO itself was also under investigation, Coinbase didn't halt all of its services. The same goes with Binance, BitMEX, and other exchanges that are also investigated for various violations. But they didn't stop operating. Which led me to think that NeuroticFish's suspicion is right.Quote from: NeuroticFish on August 11, 2022, 07:56:40 AMI have a feeling that this is just a cover.
