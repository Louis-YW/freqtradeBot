  "content": "I am offering personalized cybersecurity and privacy consultations for those who would like to fortify their digital-selves and/or have concerns about their current security/privacy level.How is the service provided:We first have a general consultation using the Matrix protocol, to ensure the information that you share with me is both encrypted and delete-able. You do not have to provide information that you are not comfortable sharing during the consultation, however the more information that you provide with me, the more I can accurately help you. I will not entertain clients who are using my knowledge for blackhat purposes, the consultation will immediately end if it takes this direction. Information we discuss during the consultation:- Your systems ability and experience level. - General hardware & system capability information.- Operating system and (in some cases) some configuration information. - Browser configuration and general usage information. - Software that you use (for compatibility reasons in the event of recommending an OS change).- Current protection measures.After the consultation, I will use the provided information to:- Create a framework based on the information provided during the consultation.- Conduct any necessary additional research to create a tailored report. - Write the report based with your level of technical understanding in mind. - Include my opinion of your current security/privacy score out of 10, with reasoning. - Describe potential vulnerabilities and rooms for improvement in your current system - Provide suggested solutions that your ability and experience level should be able to implement.I will never ask for sensitive information at any stage, and I will never charge more or less than $42 per report for this service.How is the service priced and what is the turnaround time?Fairly. $42 per report. The turnaround time is up to 2 weeks to cater for demand and unforeseen circumstances/commitments. Generally, it will not take this long. Ideally, I'd say 1 - 3 days depending on demand for the service. Price Breakdown:It will take up to 2.5 hours worth of work per report (equating to $16.8 per hour). Time will be spent as follows:- 30 minutes to have a consultation with you to get all of the necessary information for me to build the foundations and structure of the report.- 2 hours for necessary additional research based on your information and to write and tailor the report for you. I've tried to make both the price and the turnaround time as reasonable as possible.The service also comes with 30 minutes of troubleshooting assistance for clients who need additional help applying their solutions. Following which, costs a flat-rate of $15 per 30 minutes (I will make exceptions if the reason for troubleshooting is an issue with the report, which will be rare). Why am I running the service and what qualifies me to do so?I think that people could use the information that would help them to improve the security and privacy of their system, which is not only vital in this age of the internet, but vital to the safety of your Bitcoins. It's been over 7 months and the board has not been added, so I thought - why not offer this service to the community and fill the need until the board is added (if ever).I am an advocate and somewhat of a specialist in the field of cybersecurity and privacy. I have displayed my knowledge in this field countless times on the forum and have lots more to offer outside of my posting, and am offering to distribute general knowledge for free via a Cybersecurity and Privacy board for which I have discussed with the community in depth with little objection (90.5% approval rate), and am now campaigning for this community (100% approval rate). How to get started?Please PM me if you are interested and we will organize a time to talk, or post your inquiries below. We will use Matrix.org protocol for the consultation, which I'll provide instructions on how to use if you do not have a client for Matrix already.",

Specify which cryptocurrency and payment method you accept.2. When offering service, i expect they either offering few free vouch or showing proof of their past work which is relevant with service they offer.Hey, thank you for the feedback 1. bitcoin, and some altcoins upon request and review 2. I am happy to provide one free vouch copy for any member who is genuinely interested, and a mock copy for a fellow specialist to verify the extensiveness of the service (they be a mock client, have a mock conversation, and get a mock report) scenario for the sake of example and verification.These reports will usually take 1hr+ of time and thought as every case is different, so 2 free hours of my time is the most I'll dedicate to free vouches, and it will be when I have this free time as I am usually very busy. Though in the future, paying clients will get my time prioritized.",
