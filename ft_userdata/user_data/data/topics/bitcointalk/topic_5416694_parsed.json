  "content": "Hello world,  It’s been over 2 years since we updated our Crash algorithm with salting (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5256606). In our endeavor to constantly improve seed safety and provable fairness of our games, we will shortly be updating our Crash game with a new salted hash. The purpose of this post is for full transparency of this process.  CRASH GAME RESULT FORMULACode:   const gameResult = (seed, salt) => {    const nBits = 52; // number of most significant bits to use     // 1. HMAC_SHA256(message=seed, key=salt)      const hmac = CryptoJS.HmacSHA256(CryptoJS.enc.Hex.parse(seed), salt);    seed = hmac.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Hex);     // 2. r = 52 most significant bits    seed = seed.slice(0, nBits / 4);    const r = parseInt(seed, 16);     // 3. X = r / 2^52    let X = r / Math.pow(2, nBits); // uniformly distributed in [0; 1)    X = parseFloat(X.toPrecision(9));     // 4.

This block has not been mined yet as of this post, proving that we have not deliberately selected a mined block with a hash that could be favorable to the house. Once block 758,160 has been mined, the results will be posted to this thread as a reply. The game this post is referencing is at https://bc.game/game/crash",

Got a completely different question.Will you consider in the future to have a betting exchange like Betfair? Seems like no major gambling site has gone in this direction. Is this something you might consider for the very long run?",
