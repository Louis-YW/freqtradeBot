Users who have assets on Binance with this maintenance time feel relieved because the maintenance time is not long.Don't ignore concerns about losing funds. Reading the OP sharing the information that Binance will carry out maintenance, my mind is reminded of whether the CEO will take user funds to the SAFU fund.",

This is only bitcoin wallet maintenance. To my mind, this is a reminder of not your keys - not your coins. Actually, what we trade on exchanges are nothing but numbers and nothing more, this is exactly how centralized exchanges work under the hood. Tbe customers do the numbers and they are been recorded in their server and all trades are settled by numbers, only when you initiated a withdrawal they send out coins from their wallet to the destination wallet; observed most withdrawals when you initiated one, it's always from exchange account to another wallet address, if it was from wallet  then it will show that the coin is from your wallet address. These are evidence that we trade nothing but numbers.QuoteCZ always tweets \"your funds are safu\" every time something bad happens because he doesn't want people to withdraw coins because this will create a terrible situation for them.

CZ activates himself on social media to interact with his followers. This is not the good or bad of CZ, there are many other reasons why we want users who don't know much about the risks of holding assets to not be trapped by the guarantee fund statements provided by them when an incident occurs.In my opinion, when all users withdraw all funds on the exchange, then that is one of their fears. Just like banks, when all customers withdraw their savings, they will go bankrupt.",

Currently alot of investors are still depending on the projects he launches through his exchange launchpad for investment and I guess he buys a bag  of the coin and dump it on new buyers there by generating more profits for his exchange to keep on operating. They're also getting revenue through project listing so his bank account is getting fat regularly which make it not possible at the moment to get exposed but it'll surely happen when his time is up.

Cz is active in recovering stolen or hacked funds on the BNB network, his exchange or other associated projects and he advertise every operation that gets successful on twitter there by winning more people trust. He knows what he's doing and so far it's working in his favor but one day his tricks will fail him and he can't come out of the situation his exchange will find itself and then people will realize what has been said from the very beginning of not trusting any centralized service providers.",

It is mentioned in their tokenomics structure that Binance smartchain burns BNB every quarter to make the token more deflationary and to reduce maximum supply to 100 million BNB tokens.Crypto exchange Binance said on Monday that it has burned over $450 million worth of BNB tokens as part of a planned token burn.Just over 2.1 million BNB tokens were burned by Binance.BNB uses an auto-burn system to reduce its total supply to 100 million BNB. The auto-burn mechanism adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter.Source https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2023/10/16/binance-burns-450m-bnb-in-quarterly-move/",
