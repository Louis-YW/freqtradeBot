You can also buy a domain that they are selling and it’s definitely going to get you points for the airdrop. So there are some props if you are actually using the website daily.",

Anyway the badges Ive posted are free and depends on wallet activity might also worth checking old wallets that are eligible for this.",

There's no way for regular people like us to get that much followers on Debank  Quote from: cryptoaddictchie on July 27, 2023, 02:31:29 AMIm not sure why debadge has something like this, do you think this can be a criteria for some sort of retroactive airdrop?It's probably just a good way to get users engagement. The airdrop chance is very slim in my opinion. I don't see the reason for them to create a token. Unless they're going to expand their services that could justify a token in the future.",

I only get the early drops like uni, 1inch, dydx and some unknown drops too. But lately I didnt active on doing airdrop so I missed OP. Its amazing that you are actively doing this retro thing on defi while being an admin staff herr on forum.Quote from: dbshck on July 28, 2023, 06:27:05 AMIt's probably just a good way to get users engagement.

Yeah you are right. But who knows since doing an airdrop without much services wont be useful at all but we all knew these guys are unpredictable when it comes to something like this.",

There are different category to claim badges like the badge of uni airdrop. If you have receive it before on your wallet you are able to mint this badge and there is no transaction fee for this but only a confirmation on your metamask. There are others too like 1000days old wallet on eth, or gas fee spent on eth and etc.",

But who knows since doing an airdrop without much services wont be useful at all but we all knew these guys are unpredictable when it comes to something like this.Yesterday DeBank announced they are launching the DeBank chain, currently in testnet. https://twitter.com/DeBankDeFi/status/1689963919614611457. It's another L2 built on Optimism stack, like Base and opBNB. To try the Debank chain testnet you have to request the gas token from the faucet which is only available on Rabby wallet. It all makes sense now. Up until this point I didn't know Rabby and DeBank were built by the same team. This is a very clever user acquisition efforts by them. I've heard good things about Rabby wallet before but couldn't be bothered to move from MetaMask. With this DeBank chain testnet, I finally try the Rabby wallet and I really love it. It's way better than MetaMask in terms of user experience. So yeah, Rabby x DeBank chain is a direct competitor to MetaMask x Linea, in a way. I think the launch of the DeBank chain 99% confirms there will be an airdrop for DeBank chain in the future, most likely in 2024 when they launch the mainnet.",

But it said that it is a criteria option not mentioning an airdrop so we shouldnt have our high hopes. But what I feared about this tvf is being expose to much since its a web3 wallet with your socials. So a bit hesitant to expose my activity on different chains. You know feels like someone watching you, not bad for influencers since they are transparent and can have others a copy trade. But for simple shrimps like me 😂 not sure though.",

But probably something will be useful for that kind of webID for sure. Anyway lets hope for more incoming airdrop funds surely aside from debank there are tons of upcoming drops that would be worth a lot and if werr lucky could bag some really juicy profits.",
