Yes, and it is stupid. The fact that the service does not have any negative reviews is an additional reason to raise doubts, especially if it is new. I am surprised how it will erase data such as the topics in this forum. The best thing to do is to show negative results late, but the service that searches for such things is often a fraud.Given the user's lack of response and UX details, I think it's a scam and the user doesn't know what he's saying.",

I'll reply to everyone now.digaran, thank you for the clarification; I've moved this branch.coin-investor, previously we attempted to implement SSL, but it caused issues on the Cloudflare side, resulting in improper website display. Since we don't accept any payments on our site and don't request any data, except for email and name in the case of using the contact form, you can even use temporary email if needed. So, it was decided to leave everything as is. Our website serves as a kind of business card.Yamane_Keto, we don't delete negative reviews; they remain. However, we assist in resolving online negativity when someone made a mistake and received many reviews about it. But once the mistake is corrected, it's challenging to start over, and that's where we help smooth out past negativity and communicate that it's in the past. Everyone makes mistakes, and some deserve a second chance.examplens, when we selected the website name, only this domain was available for our idea. But does it matter significantly for a business card?SamReomo, yes, we have experience with HYIP projects. However, we don't claim them to be risk-free. We help disseminate information about the project and inform if it's currently making payments. If the project stops paying, we take action. Many people are interested in such projects, despite understanding that they are not permanent.robelneo, our website recently stopped working for a few days. Perhaps you are referring to that. It was related to our website's use of Cloudflare. The hosting changed IP, and this had to be updated on Cloudflare, which we didn't notice right away. Indeed, our website has been up for 7 years, and I can't fathom how any trick could have been involved. Previously, our website had a different appearance; it was just a contact page. Later, the site expanded.Yamane_Keto, we haven't received many reviews, so there haven't been many negative ones. Most of our clients are satisfied. There were a few clients who had higher expectations from our services, but we didn't work with them for long because we couldn't provide what they were asking for. We informed them right away, but they didn't want to hear it, so we terminated the collaboration. Some of these were HYIP projects, and I'm glad they didn't leave a review because it wouldn't have reflected the truth.wallet4bitcoin, no one wanted us to include them in our portfolio. There are a few minor cases of our work, but they are outdated, and you won't be able to verify their authenticity.moneystery, you're correct. We understand that, and many have pointed that out. But wouldn't it be deceptive? On one hand, we haven't created an online reputation for ourselves, but we claim to do it for others. On the other hand, when we do create that reputation, we'll be accused of deceiving by making a false reputation. However, after considering all pros and cons, we've decided that starting to create a reputation for ourselves will bring more benefits than drawbacks. We've seen some companies create fake case studies, advertise well, but provide poor services. With us, it's the opposite ‚Äì we deliver good work but haven't created a fancy image of ourselves.I'll write a few more words about what everyone is asking.Yes, our social media presence is limited. At some point, we considered using them but later found some of them to be irrelevant or not to our liking. Currently, we've decided not to maintain social media profiles as it's not a priority for us. We're also considering a website design update. If we do that, we'll keep only those social media accounts that are actively used and update the list of our services. If we keep the current design, we'll still remove the inactive social media profiles. We'll also optimize the website for mobile viewing.Most of our clients come through recommendations. We're a small company and can't take on many clients simultaneously. At most, we've had up to 4 clients at once.We're based in Ukraine, and the war in our country has had some impact on us and our clients. Due to the war, we lost some clients, and our business is not doing as well as before.If you need our services but have doubts about us, we suggest starting small, gradually delegating some tasks to us and seeing how we work.Our most extensive experience is with Forex brokers, mining services, exchanges, and wallets. Overall, our experience mostly revolves around financial projects. However, we have experience in other areas too. Just ask us, tell us what interests you, and we'll respond whether we can help.Just give us a chance to be useful to you and prove our competence.I thank everyone for their advice! We'll take it into consideration!",

In other words, the negative review will still be available for viewing but will no longer be at the top; it will be pushed far down. By doing so, it effectively disappears from the top results (gets deleted).Sometimes, a website may not allow us to overshadow a negative review with positive content. In such cases, we work to at least lower the website's ranking, ideally pushing it down to the next page of search results.Physically removing the negativity is financially costly and not worth the effort and expenses. Although we have had some experience with physically removing negative reviews in our practice. To achieve this, we invested a lot of effort and engaged in lengthy negotiations. It is a significant achievement if it can be done with minimal expenses. We managed to do it, but we cannot promise the same success for others.",
