I signed up on 26th July 2013 and I'm here for a decade. I never imagined I'd be here this long. This forum has been an important part of my life, just like Bitcoin.Glad I decided to sign-up here 10 years ago. Here I met very good people from all nationalities, made good friends and had job opportunities. Even though sometimes I took a break from writing to the forum due to dramas and tiredness, I never stopped moderating the forum. I tried my best to make the forum work as intended.I hope to be here longer. I think I'll stay here until Theymos decides to close the forum. I would like to see at least new forum software.",
