      "body": "Are you trying to scam others by posting a story about a financial scam and recover lost money? I don't know, but the person would be stupid if they believed your story or tried to use the site because they didn't learn anything from the first scam.Tracking the scammers and trying to get your money back is a difficult task and requires the intervention of the authorities because the easiest way to return that money if scammers send it to central platforms and then you can, by order of the court, request to freeze their accounts and return the money to you.Therefore, prevention is better than cure, and do not try to believe or invest according to the advice of unknown people on the Internet.",

Another indication that there is something deceitful, using a redirect to creating an email.The former part of the story is in line with things we’ve read here and there, which people fall for for some gullable reason. The latter is not trustworthy in any way.Archive:https://web.archive.org/web/20220520090746/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5399423.0",

Giving people freedom to do what they want is great, but not when their actions can cause harm to others. If you spread malware links on Bitcointalk, you will get banned. If you advertise and post links to fake crypto recovery services that will take your money and disappear, that's OK, you are allowed to do that because of freedom of speech .",
