The hype is within the country and if you are a business person then it’s better to think entering Dubai while the hype is still there. We know some countries in Europe already experiencing a decline but of course if you have a good business in mind, you can still execute it anywhere but if you want a good exposure, Dubai is a good choice.",

It can be considered an incubator for companies operating specifically in the services sector, but it is not suitable for other types of investments such as agriculture or industry. The service sector alone cannot build a strong economy, and therefore opening a company there carries a degree of risk that cannot be overlooked. On this same basis, Dubai or Abu Dhabi grants facilities to companies to invest in them, including emerging companies in the field of crypto, given that these companies provide their services on the Internet and target the global market and not just the local one.Quote from: CryptopreneurBrainboss on June 20, 2024, 09:45:01 PMQuoteIt has a very biased and heavily religious influenced legal system which is not acceptable for most mega scale business dealings.

Are they expecting you to get into more debts by borrowing just to pay them and when you get out you begin to struggle since you are in debt. These laws were enacted with the intention of deterrence, meaning that any person will think carefully before borrowing whether he is able to pay the debt or not. Those most affected by these laws are those who deal with late-paid checks.This is a legal dilemma that many countries suffer from, and they are still unable to find an appropriate solution that guarantees the rights of the creditor and the chances of repayment for the borrowers.",

Are they expecting you to get into more debts by borrowing just to pay them and when you get out you begin to struggle since you are in debt. As I have lived for quite sometime in Dubai, you can already pay your debt by giving up yourself in prison. They will deduct certain amount from your debt everyday you are staying in prison. And the good thing is, some people are making it as a business. They will incur a lot of credit card debts and they will just let themselves to be put in jail. Some people that I knew of stayed about a month or longer in prison and afterwards, his debt-free. This is what I know about debt cases. And that was about 10 years ago that I've been there and that was the practice. I don't know if you are facing other serious criminal charges. And from what they described, their prison was not bad at all to stay. I believe their prison is nice and so these people don't have qualms to be there. Staying there and when you get out, your debt-free. That I can say is a treat and people for sure are abusing this system.",

Same with fiat currencies even if it is your own local fiat.That means investing in real estate, buying gold, investing in companies (stocks), etc.There are a lot of conflicts going on and we are on the brink of things escalating suddenly. For example as we speak the Zionist terrorists are planning to invade Lebanon and if they do (they may not since this could be propaganda) that war has a high potential of growing rapidly and take place in the entire West Asia that includes UAE (housing US military bases that will definitely participate in that war and become legitimate targets).And we all know how fragile such small artificial countries like UAE are in terms of economy. So for example if you are holding Dirham it may drop down to zero in a matter of days.",

I can't compare Dubai with the likes of Singapore or even Hong Kong. Also, the Middle Eastern Region's peace and stability is something you might want to reconsider if you're looking long term. As far as the Russian ruble is concerned, at least versus the USD, it has since recovered since its bottom in the middle of 2022, but its performance today is back to the same level a year ago. It's not doing good, in other words, at least within a year.",

The government of the Gulf Nation has a very strong relationship with the US. I suggest you consider doing business in another country that the US has less influence over. The UAE and the US has a very strong extradition treaty that immediately the US thinks you are engaging in any criminal financial dealings, you can be extradited to the US within a twinkling of an eye. Do I need to go to Dubai to keep my money in Bitcoin? I don't also see any reason to keep my money in a fiat when I have a better option. For, Dubai is just a tourist nation for people who have so much to spend and who can abide by thier strict cultural beliefs. QuoteDubai Dirham now it's like bitcoin year 2009 it Will go up a lot ... The russian ruble Are good Also becouse non Western countries buying oil from russia and russia currency have some decent value.The Russian ruble has performed far above the expectations of most economists. They had predicted that Western sanctions would crumble the Russian economy and make the currency worthless. And the effect of these sanctions was immediately felt at the beginning of the war. Many banks refused to exchange the ruble because it was losing its value every day. I was in the bank one day when a Russian expatriate came in with buddles of the ruble but the manager instructed the tellers not to accept it as deposit. Russia has unexpectedly devised viable means of invading these sanctions and the ruble is currently one of the best-performing currencies against the dollar. However, I will not consider keeping my money in Fiat, it's just risky for me.",

The law there does not burden you, if you don't want to go to prison then pay off the debt, if it is due then you must be ready to go to prison. I think the rules there make sense as long as the intentions are good, but if the intentions are contradictory then don't stay in Dubai and in any country the law like this will be the same. Each country implements its own system, it may not be suitable for people outside Dubai but for its citizens it is not a problem. Just like tourists who visit our country, do the rules have to adjust to routine rules or vice versa, tourists have to continue to obey our rules. So basically wherever you build a business, being in debt and so on depends on how we respond and are able to pay it off. People who complain about the rules in a region/country sometimes have no intention of obeying them from the start.",

You are still correct that there are only differences in between their supplies. BTC has a maximum supply of 21 million but fiats seem to be unspecified.

The reason why I like Arabic big Arabic countries is because they don't ask for task and this help new business to prosper as they don't need to think a the time about paying tax but Dubai system is more than you think. You can't just move in even though you are granted their visa, you need some money to be paid before you can start a business there, it's one time I think before you can move down there.Another thing about Dubai is that they don't employ foreigners like the UK and the Canada,  these two European countries are among the biggest states that provides job opportunities to foreigners even though they are discriminating sometimes and ask for high tax, you don't see such privileges in Dubai for foreigners and this why you see people don't go there despite been tax fee country.",
