All other websites appears in google search will not give you real key or crack. you will download files more than 300 mb and it will give error but Gentintopc provide 100% real software. This is the biggest reason when you search any free Software, you will find Getintopc on the topIf you install these softwares and cracked, it will change your registry and at first your keyboard will be hacked. whenever you make any transactions, it will show same address that you input but you will realize it change from original one when Metamask approved prompt appear Its not end here but these softwares contain malicious virus which will completely reveal your data to hacker. Hacker will have full access to your Gmails, telegram, twitter etc. in short your full system will be hacked. How i discover it?unfortunately i have been hacked two times and lost 1k$. i used this website for free screen recording and video editing software like premier pro. one day suddenly All Ethereum,bnb has been sent from all my Wallets to unknown address at one time.

I didn't know at the time how it happened and again was using Laptop and same free softwares. After 3 months again my all wallets hacked because i have saved all phrases in my personal Gmail (Damn). Hacker deleted all phrases from draft. This time my telegram, twitter also compromised. I thought it was caused by the mobile so I changed the mobile. after some days same situation happened with my cousin and he was also using free Software from Getintopc. after that my 3 friend and 2 more cousin faced same situation and now u can say 100% sure that Getintopc owner is big scammer but I don't know how we can report it .The purpose of telling here was that all people should be aware of it and no one should download any software from it. If you  need to download any software, then you should choose such a laptop for that which is extra and have no personal data, account information.",

No, as far as we talk about providing software files and crack files then this website is on top because its providing real Software+ cracks but its contain also malware which is big issue Quote from: Rikafip on February 27, 2023, 08:10:53 AMDid you all download the same program, or different ones?

Even though I am using Windows 10 and Windows 8 for a long time and every time whatever-related software I need to download which is paid or even free I prefer downloading it from this website and everything is still ok..Yes I know Pirated Software can't be trusted and patches are very harmful to sensitive data and you should never use pirated software in a personal PC but the dude still there are many applications that I can't afford to buy every time because I need one or twice a month so why should I pay for such application as I can't afford them. I better do one thing never place my sensitive data on my personal computer even with all paid software as well sometimes some pop-ups lead us into a major hack as we always stay connected to the internet and its not safe at all of the places such important documents with the Hot body (Internet connected devices). We are always at risk because sometimes unintentionally a small mistake leads to a major hack.So advised way is to note down your phrases on paper or notebook and keep them in hard form in actual secure means. I feel sad for your loss but it seems that the problem is on your end not on the website end I am not sure how is it possible because getintopc is one of the most trusted web 2.0 file downloading sites, but still there is an exception for it.",

You should have a separate system for your wallets (if you do not have hardware wallet).Quote from: AnonBitCoiner on February 27, 2023, 05:17:49 AMi have saved all phrases in my personal Gmail This is an even bigger biggger mistake on your part. We should never store our private key phrases online. Many people store keys phrases on gmail or on cloud based services thinking they are secure. Think for a moment that these cloud based services are centralized and someone from the cloud storage provide team can see any file store on these servers.Keep your phrases offline and never store them online.",

Yes, I guess there will be reputable sources for cracked software but you’ll never know when will money be tight for them so… essentially, it's a gamble.

Still, I am almost certain that most of the sites that offer cracks and keys to break the protection of the program illegally are scam sites that offer cracks that contain malware. The mistake that you did that you installed these programs and cracks from Getintopc on your main computer connected to the Internet, which includes your accounts, wallets, information, etc., I am sorry for your loss, but now you have learned the lesson. Once again, you do not download any programs from any site except their official websites and do not download cracks. You can use the trial period for the program or buy it. Otherwise, you are exposing your device to be hacked by scammers. I also advise you not to save your recovery phrases for wallets on Gmail or any other mail, Telegram, Twitter..etc. Because if the hacker accesses your account, he will be able to use these phrases to steal your wallet but keep the recovery phrases in a note or paper away from anything.",

I have used the activator and nothing happened. The program worked just fine, I could convert images without a watermark or anything. But recently when I have copy-pasted my Binance BTC address to receive payment from a friend, I found the money was not reached to my Binance account. Then I talked with Binance support and they told me about this Copy-Paste ransomware/malware that changes the copied BTC address tho their's BTC address silently. If you do not check and reconfirm your BTC address then the sender will send the money to the creator of this ransomware. So always check and re-check and confirm your Crypto address when you send it to someone. I have lost 250$.Date of experience: May 24, 2022 Quotegot my amazon acount hacked they bought multiple prepaid cards as playstation ones, and im sure its from theyr download they silently inject malware but the program is working fine, dont use these software on your personnal pc, just on a second pc that isnt connected to any google acount or anything else , they inject something that will give em all access to your acounts and keyboard typing (password etc) and they added facebook adds on my acount too and google ads tooDate of experience: November 17, 2022",
