My prediction is that we might see it hard for it to come back at $30k for this year.

No regrets, no reasons when we miss the buying opportunity because if we miss it, it's all our fault for not buying when it's low.",

Well, you have to watch the price trend maybe good news will come in right before the year end, and that could be enough to boost the price of Bitcoin again, but without any good news this is too impossible to happen.",

The price of bitcoin is well connected to the demand to the supply availability. Right now there is Whale accumulation and not much of buying from the common people.From the price around $20k it needs to gain resistance to cross several price barriers withstand support and reaching $45k won't happen within this year. Same time the market is different from the traditional market, so things can change in no time. Lets prepare for the worse and only then it is possible to benefit if unexpected bullish/bearish move happens.",

I will keep holding my coins until it reaches that amount.yeah that is my selling point 50k and above because I happen to buy back when the price is at 17k and that value is much 200% profit for me.",

But 45k in this year is not a big lip for Bitcoin as we have seen from Bitcoin's track record of past growth after each deadly deep such as this one right now.",

There is a no question about the bitcoin price will hit the 45k . But I don't think it could be possible this year. If you notice recently the cryptomarket has been in a good decline.  Since then, there has not been any positive from the entire market, rather the market's trade volume has decreased.  So I think Bitcoin will not reach 45k by the end of this year if the market conditions are good, hopefully the market will pump again in late 2023 or 24.",

The question I'm really wondering is, have we seen the bottom in Bitcoin or will we still see one last bottom?If you follow the 4 year pattern then the next bull should come in the year of 2025. We almost cleared out the first year so another 3 years is going to be the next. That's going to be a long wait but that shouldn't discourage us because like you said, there might still be surprises that can occur so it's always better to be prepared by having some coins on your side.You can still buy now if you don't have anything yet since the price was dipped again by some percent. This is a better buying opportunity than last week where the price of btc is above 21k. For the bottom part. I think we already have one before but there might be another new one later on.",
