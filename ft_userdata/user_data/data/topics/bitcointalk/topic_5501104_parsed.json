Just be patient and keep investing.Well maybe if you are a early adopter of Bitcoin and at least a lot of stash back then that you didn't sell, then maybe by this time, you are a millionaire already. But obviously, since we don't have the numbers as Bitcoin address has no names attach to it, we really don't know if they indeed become a self made millionaire or have sold their Bitcoin as early as they can if they doubled their profits already.So only those who have millions already can invest right now and make more money. For average joe like the rest of us, it could be very difficult to accumulate even .5 BTC to 1 BTC.  You can look at this link:https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html",

Just be patient and keep investing.You sound like, most of the people who earn billions are not rich, as rich are only earning in millions. I don't think it's a good motivational speech or words to motivate one to invest in BTC. As a newbie (or an old user) we should see the stats, like where BTC was 10 years ago and where it is now. If a person wants to do the comparison of BTC with real estate then its there own decision and analysis. The comparison of Real estate with BTC was a good one. As it also gives people a clear idea of which investment would have made them more money.I think real estate has its own perks but no doubt BTC is highly portable, it can be sold to anyone in the whole world. There is no repairment, taxes, mortgages, etc. BTC is clean unless you are living in a country where it is banned then you might find it hard to deal in BTC.",

I know there is money in real estate business, but you need to have big money before you can start such business in my country because you need to register your real estate with government before you will begin to see people who will be coming to you before you can start earning profits from the real estate.If I succeed today from BTC  business I will surely add real estate to my business because it make someone to improve financially, and you will be comfortable with your Profits.",

Just be patient and keep investing.Bitcoin is a highly profitable investment so it’s not surprising that those who have been accumulating good amount of bitcoin since its early years and hold them until at the present, clearly they’ll turn into millionaires if they end up selling all their coins. The bigger the amount of bitcoin you’ve been holding, the higher the amount of expected returns. However, for those who are just keeping a minimal amount, I don’t think becoming a millionaire is their goal, but most probably just to prepare a good and secured retirement in the future, something that can already sustain their necessities without getting them into debt.",

It’s just the people’s choice where they want to invest and how flexible they are with their investments. If you ask me, then I have seen the growth of Bitcoins and their exciting returns in a shorter period of time. For this reason, I will prefer Bitcoin investments over any other types of investments. On the other hand, real estate is a more stable investment and it is legalized by the government. So yes, motivation for Bitcoins can really be generated by seeing the returns in every bull season.",

Yes real estate is a think for sure but they usually earn most of their returns from investing in start up companies who have robust idea and a great execution plan. In times, such investments fetches way more return than bitcoin. Bitcoin investment can be tricky and a lot depends on the timing of getting into the market.

We can't compare investments that billionaires make with Bitcoin investments because when you are investing in real estate, you need a lot of money to start because you can't buy a property with $50 or $100 or something, but when you are making an investment in Bitcoin, all you need to start is $10 because you can buy $10 worth of Bitcoin without a problem.Billionaires won't need to invest money in Bitcoin for profits because they already have enough active companies and investments, even if they think about it, they wouldn't need to wait a long time because they can invest large amounts and sell as soon as they are getting some profit and repeat the process.",

That's how you're going to diversify your money and make other investments. While the others, haven't made any money yet but then, they're diversifying to every asset that they have found and think that they'll able to make that much money from doing so. They're right with that but most of the rich people focus first on one asset and then moves later on when they're able to see that focus booms.",
