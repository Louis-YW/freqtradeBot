If you know someone who can create an impressive signature, let me know.Do you need someone to manage your new campaign in forum or just design for signature?Maybe you can hire someone to make you whole package with better price instead of purchasing everything separately.I would recommend contacting manager Hhampuz and he can help you with everything you need with campaign: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=881377I think he is working with Jayce for creating signatures: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1142066.0",
