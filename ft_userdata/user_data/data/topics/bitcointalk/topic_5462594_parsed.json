Making all your post bold does not increase its visibility even if you leave them in their normal form everyone will still be able to read them.Second, learn how to format your post properly. I'm not sure if your think moving your sub-title with spacebar will make it more readable. But if you want to indent your sub-title and put it at the center then you should learn the correct tag for it. Code:[Center][/center]And here's an example of a well formatted thread.",

However, you should start by learning from others, not only about creating good posts but also about formatting them well. I'm not saying I'm perfect, as I'm still learning too.¬†The issue is how you spaced your post. it seems like you were trying to make it longer, but maybe you could have added more points instead. Another thing is that I thought the idea was originally yours until I saw the source link below. Usually, people share guidelines based on their experience and knowledge, so I'm not sure why you're creating a guide without learning from it. Just take your time to review your mistakes, and maybe you'll do better next time with your posts. Nice guide again, and good luck!",

It seems that you who is writing \"understanding the concept of post writing\" has not fully grasped the concept. The method of bolding your words to me doesn't do anything for highlights, rather it can be quite irritating.Something you should take into consideration is that we have different readers who have their pattern at which they read and instead of targeting a particular audience in terms of making a post, why not make a generally comprehensive post? I see you got this part highlighted somewhere. You have made your point but I think if this was meant to serve as a guide to the average beginner, it is to vague to offer any help.",
