When I gave a positive idea about the present and future of Bitcoin, the friend showed great interest in Bitcoin and expressed interest that he would invest a certain part of his salary in Bitcoin at the end of the month.But when the friend's father found out about this, he forbade him to invest in bitcoins and later predicted that he would be banned by the government and that he would have problems with his job. Yes but it is true that there is a possibility of loss if the government staff comes to know about this investment during government office.But my friend is not listening and instead he will invest on Bitcoin. I don't know what kind of suggestion I should make to my friend in such a situation. Should I ask my friend to invest in Bitcoin? Or ask to pay more attention to his job?",

BTC is permissionless and your friend can probably use it secretly, but i don't think the risk would be worth it if he is caught, it is up to your friend to decide if he is up for the risk; but he has to avoid any centralized crypto service and buy only through p2p exchanges or in-person trades.",

Or ask to pay more attention to his job?Bitcoin does not take attention away from his job, it's just the potential issues of handling a banned asset especially while working in the government that banned it.You don't bear the investment risk so you cannot ask your friend to invest or not, you can only give your opinion; Mine is that if the risk surpasses the potential return, then it's not worth it. It's very possible for someone to hold Bitcoin while maintaining their pseudoanonymity, but your friend might not be that experienced.",

But we must take into account that he violates the law and if he is caught, then he will probably lose his job, allowances and suffer punishment. While it is not certain that the money he invests in bitcoin will bring more money in the future. He can become a rich man, or he can lose everything. If this activity is prohibited in your country, then no one should have known about it, including his father or anyone else. Very high price. Good work should be valued. It's still not clear what you mean by \"severe penalties\"",

In fact, it will just consume a few minutes and it was done, and even if he's been trading, still okay how much more if he is just buying Bitcoin and holding it. But this gonna have to say to your friend, told him to do more research and analyzed his situation before investing.",

The situation is a sensitive one and unless you want to end up being blamed for any outcome you need to be careful and at this time refrain and stop giving your friend any further advice on this situation. Since your friend works in the government and earns well, there are other kinds of Investments that he can engage in, and you should let him know. If among the many options of investment he still chooses bitcoins and chooses the option of going against the wish of his father then that's his choice but let him do it out of his own free will and not under pressure from your advice.",

Or ask to pay more attention to his job?From the information you gave Bitcoin is banned in your country. Which means owning it or using it for any transaction is a criminal offense. You have to obey the law of your country and abstain from owning Bitcoin. Owning Bitcoin might not affect his job because he might just be a holder and not a trader but you identified that it might lead to the loss of a well-paying job which is his major source of income. I will advise that he focuses on his job and search for other viable sectors where he can invest his money. This is because he might be unlucky to be caught by the police or other agencies which might lead to severe sanctions. Maybe in a few years, your government might change its stance on bitcoin which will make Bitcoin a legal currency and investment.",
