  "content": "ADVFN, also referred to as \"Investorshub\" or \"IHub\", experienced a security breach involving their cryptocurrency, PlusOneCoin (https://plusonecoin.org).The coin was subjected to an uncommon 51% attack for an entire week. An unidentified individual or group overloaded the PlusOneCoin network servers and significantly increased the hash rate to almost 20 times its average value (around 3-4.5TH/s) to mine the HMQ1725 algo coin. They managed to mine the coin from nearly .06 cents down to .004 before departing, all while drastically reducing the difficulty level.The culprits seem to have exited after depleting all mining possibilities when the coin hit \"no bid\" and restored the difficulty level back to its original state. This can be verified at https://blockchain.plusonecoin.org.A discussion about this incident can be found in this link.. However, it appears that the administrators don't want to discuss it.https://investorshub.advfn.com/PlusOneCoin-PLUS1USD-32755https://pasteboard.co/CUMKbWwAELmU.pnghttps://pasteboard.co/HJlAPIcTsysY.png",
