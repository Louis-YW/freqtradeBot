      "body": "You already made a similar thread about that here:  What about privacy coin?. What's wrong with it, does that thread doesn't satisfy your question huh?Anyway, as it stands, here is my thought regarding the subject.Quote from: vv181 on April 27, 2022, 07:55:23 PMBroadly looking at how cryptocurrenices work today, most people are busy with NFT, DEFI, and established meme coins like Doge. But that doesn't indicate privacy coin lose its purpose and usefulness. It's just how the majority of the regular user is more into those things, currently.But the fact that Monero has been long established and battle-tested, which makes it unbreakable[1], the usefulness is still there. And I don't see why would Monero doesn't have any future.[1] https://decrypt.co/41411/the-irs-is-offering-you-625000-to-crack-moneroQuote from: vv181 on April 29, 2022, 03:50:39 PMQuote from: kryptocanon on April 27, 2022, 08:05:43 PMQuote from: vv181 on April 27, 2022, 07:55:23 PMBroadly looking at how cryptocurrenices work today, most people are busy with NFT, DEFI, and established meme coins like Doge This however is basically nothing but the crystal truth. What the vast majority these days are longing for are projects that could get them rich like GetRichQuickScheme as we do call it. These memes and NFT fit into that category. And that is the ground idea of what most developers built those projects. People have a narrow point of view that they didn't consider how many people lost their funds playing around with NFT, and meme Coin. It fits most people that haven't been unaware of cryptocurrencies before. For example, this thread[1] shows Shiba's popularity compared to others. People will use cryptocurrencies that spark their curiosity and interest them the most.But technically, the privacy coin won't lose it meaning, there is valuable concept within it.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5396585.0",

Another reason is few exchanges delist Monero because they don't want to have any trouble with anonymous coin and lead their exchanges a problem due to high illicit sources.",

Or it's the world that doesn't need the idea.I don't think it's going to be a big hit in this space, as each passing stage is different and the hype about its applicability remains one of my personal questions. The issue of supply and demand is only on a small scale, and it's hard to think it will bring the same prominence or success as the top altcoins are dealing with in a time-gone landscape. Also, I'm not too negative about anonymous coins, but I'm clearly seeing some issues related to money laundering and confusing the concept of user security. However, I also acknowledge some of the core issues they're addressing, but it still takes time to see how they really benefit this market.",

Privacy coins were garbage coins. People didn't need bunch of privacy coins. One with good tech is more than enough like monero. People are putting their main concern into the utility rather than privacy coin. If you wanna trade with cex easily and you need to complete KYC verification. In this case privacy coin is actually useless. We didn't need privacy coin anymore. Privacy coin was coming to its end. People need utility rather than privacy coin.",

People choose convenience and sacrifice privacy, or they may just simply don't care about privacy at all. The coin in question is Monero, which is still unbreakable noting the NSA still offers a prize to break it[1]. While we can assume they may already break it but still keep silent, but that is another technical debate that I'm not aware of. But the thing I want to say is it's up to the user in regard to how they manage their own privacy, so if they throughout maintain a good privacy habit, they will hardly be traced.[1] https://decrypt.co/41411/the-irs-is-offering-you-625000-to-crack-monero",

Or it's the world that doesn't need the idea.IMO, I think the price is not that bad, for Monero but compared to other privacy-centric coins I don't know what was happening in them as I observe most of them are not moving in terms of prices, but it doesn't mean that the industry is not needed them, because the truth is we still need a privacy coin. Anyway, I suspect that the reason maybe was the government crackdown on privacy coins because they are giving them headaches coz until now, no one has been able to crack the Monero code. just my opinion!",

The fight against anonymous coins has been going on for a long time, as far as I remember, back in 2018 many large exchanges, like Bittrex, delisted anonymous coins, thus narrowing their popularity and liquidity.Most countries have long advocated legal and tax regulation of cryptocurrencies, and various states have promoted the idea of de-anonymizing wallets over a certain limit, with major exchanges cooperating with states.

There are some niche situations going on and there are some type of people who would like to use it, and that is why there is still some volume there, but it is not as great as it used to be.Remember that bitcoin used to be something that people used for buying drugs in darknet, so it is not really that much of a shock that there were ton of people who used crypto that wanted to hide their identity.

Or it's the world that doesn't need the idea.People are not interested in privacy coins because they have nothing to hide. Governments are also requiring exchanges to comply with KYC/AML, so anything that cannot be traced (like privacy coins) will be rejected for good. There are a lot of bad actors (eg: governments and central banks) who don't want people to use privacy coins because it would give them true financial freedom. With the number of crypto regulations increasing by the day, it's possible privacy coins will no longer be traded on traditional centralized exchanges. That would mean a lower price per coin in terms of Fiat, due to reduced exposure on mainstream markets. I'm fine with that as long as privacy coins continue to work as intended. Just my thoughts",
