Not because I put on their avatar and signature, you can do the review yourself.Also I do not see many others like Rollbit.We will definitely look at livecasino. We started off listing the casinos that we think are the best in each category. We've taken a look at a lot more but kept it to top 9 maximum in each category. Rollbit and all suggested casinos here will be looked at and we will add to the list.Quote from: acroman08 on November 07, 2022, 11:14:53 AMjust want to add that duelbits is also a sportsbook(you can check the site to verify). I am just saying it since I don't see duelbits on the list of sportsbook casinos on your site. also, do you plan on increasing the list on your website? there are several casinos that are active here in the forum that I don't see on your website.Now that you mention it, we will expand the list. If a casino should be listed in multiple categories, then they will be added. Then each category will be ranked in a different order.Quote from: Baofeng on November 07, 2022, 11:55:52 AMIt took some time for me for the image to load though, perhaps you need to adjust the site of your image.Anyhow, it seems that you have reviewed those old and OG websites like Stake and Primedice.

There are no plans to delete any posts since praise and complaints do help us in the ratings. We've had professional gamblers review the sportsbooks and feel a lot more confident in those ratings than the ratings in other categories. We value input from everyone here and nothing is in concrete. There is a contact form where you can contact us so we can read about any issues that may arise.",

As this article has been written before the squads have been announced we don’t know if that will affect any scores, so we have written the article as if it were a ‘normal’ weekend of fixtures. We think this round sees pretty routine victories for Manchester City and Arsenal who will have to resume their battle for top spot after Christmas, whilst we also think there are some intriguing battles amongst closely matched teams at the bottom end of the tablewith the sides coming out on top being able to relax a little until after the World Cup arrives .",
