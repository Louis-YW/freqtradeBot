      "body": "You need to read this: Bitcoin open source wallets that support replace-by-fee (RBF)You can be making use of any of those wallets for making transaction so that if the transaction is stuck, you will be able to pump the fee. If you are sending the transaction to yourself, the only option you can go for now is CPFP just as nakamura12 commented. Quote from: nakamura12 on March 30, 2023, 05:28:53 PMNo one can accelerate your transaction even if you use an accelerator found online except you. It would have been possible if the transaction meets ViaBTC criteria for pumping fee, but it does not meet it, the fee is not up to 10 sat/byte. Also that the transaction must be less than 500 bytes.Quote from: Eternad on March 30, 2023, 05:54:52 PMhttps://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ Offers a legit accelerator in free submission or paid service.

That would have been possible just like I did before when the transaction I did is up to the fee that is mostly included in the block to be mined but as of now, the fee that OP used does not meet the fee rate used at this moment which is at 20 sat/byte when OP's fee rate is at 5sat/byte.Quote from: Eternad on March 30, 2023, 05:54:52 PMhttps://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ Offers a legit accelerator in free submission or paid service.

You are both describing the free service of Viabtc and neglecting the paid service which is same method that you are suggesting. My comment is based on the full feature of the Viabtc accelerator feature to satisfy that there’s an online accelerator that will work on this case(not free ofc).Quote from: nakamura12 on March 30, 2023, 05:28:53 PMNo one can accelerate your transaction even if you use an accelerator found online except you.",

My comment is based on the full feature of the Viabtc accelerator feature to satisfy that there’s an online accelerator that will work on this case(not free ofc).My bad. What I mean about my post that you have quoted is that using free transaction accelerators that are free won't help at all. You know what I mean since it's been explained about the fee that is currently or most likely to get confirmed unlike the transactions with a fee rate of 5 sat/byte (didn't include the point something as what Charles-Tim explained). For me, CPFP is the best solution since you can manually put fee rate and of course the fee rate would be much higher than what OP used before (obviously it's the reason why it would be confirmed which its purpose is to incentivize the miners to confirm the transaction instead of waiting for the fee rate to decrease to 5 sat/byte. I answer that way since OP just ask if someone can accelerate the stuck transaction and also OP did not say anything about paying something to accelerate it or wanted to pay someone to accelerate it.",
