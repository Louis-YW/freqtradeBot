Officially, Moscow does not admit guilt in the downing of the plane, despite fairly strong evidence (1), and does not extradite Strelkov to Dutch justice. But, surprisingly, instead of the Hague prison, Strelkov ends up in a Moscow prison. The Russian dictator seems fed up with the incessant accusations against the generals and the Minister of Defense, and he finally decided to put the obstinate accuser behind bars, despite some circumstances linking these two war criminals. The fact is that Strelkov is dangerous for Putin by admitting his guilt in the crash of the Malaysian airliner, which can shame Putin in a lie before the entire world community. Undoubtedly, Putin had the opportunity to physically eliminate Strelkov, but I have no doubt that in this case, all the circumstances of the death of the passengers of flight MH-17 would become public knowledge. (2) It is unlikely that Putin's bloodhounds managed to immediately block all channels of the possibility of Strelkov's confession getting into the media. On the other hand, who knows, because they had enough time, given that Putin did not yesterday instruct them to deal with this secret matter. Or maybe everything is much simpler, namely, Putin does not give a damn about the opinion of the world community, especially since he has been convicted of lying more than once, and even issued an arrest warrant for kidnapping Ukrainian children. So, the fate of Strelkov-Girkin is unenviable and identical to the fate of Navalny, both of them are destined to spend the rest of their days in a prison cell, if before that what happened to Muammar Gaddafi does not happen to the dictator.1. MH-17, or Russia in a lie. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/30277.html2. Why are they alive. https://alikbahshi.livejournal.com/98063.html     07/22/2023",
