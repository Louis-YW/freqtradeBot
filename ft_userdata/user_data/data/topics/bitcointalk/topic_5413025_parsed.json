  "content": "It appears that everything that the bitcoin antagonizers have speculated is becoming a reality. We cannot ignore this anymore. Also, we have already witnessed that the government does not stop with regulations as a way to regulate. They might also use their positions of power in creating laws as a weapon to attack bitcoin. I speculate another policy that the American government can create is a ban on all Asic imports.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and other federal agencies should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies. These should include standards for very low energy intensities, low water usage, low noise generation, clean energy usage by operators, and standards that strengthen over time for additional carbon-free generation to match or exceed the additional electricity load of these facilities. Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining. DOE and EPA should provide technical assistance to state public utility commissions, environmental protection agencies, and the crypto- asset industry to build capacity to minimize emissions, noise, water impacts, and negative economic impacts of crypto-asset mining; and to mitigate environmental injustices to overburdened communities.Read in full https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf",

Why not ban gaming? why not allow minesweeper and solitaire only as the most eco-friendly games?\"Based on our very rough estimates, we found that the worldwide electricity consumption of people playing video games is 46% higher than the total consumption of Bitcoin mining as of November 2019.\"https://braiins.com/blog/bitcoin-mining-vs-gamingWhat about warm baths? We can all take cold baths. Its even healthier for us. I bet that warm baths worldwide consume more energy than bitcoin.I'm just kidding with all this, but I want to show only how much hypocrisy we live in that elites can ban/limit everything they want only because it does not fit their narrative. I don't understand why bitcoin is treated differently from others. Its only a customer of companies producing and selling electricity. It's their fault that energy they produce is dirty. Just like gamers are customers only, just like every single one of us is. No one check what percentage of your gaming PC energy consumption is made from renewables.

You have a good finding.  In addition, I don't think they have solid reasons to ban Proof of Work mining industry or in particular Bitcoin mining industry, because the percent of sustainable energy used in the industry is just a mildly smaller than other industries or at national or global scale. So if they go with a ban, that is simply not based on any valid evidence. People will look at it and say, it is biased by government's benefit, a kind of emotional decision.",

It sure leaned more into how much energy Bitcoin mining consumes and comparing it disproportionately to familiar things would pass a wrong message to some readers who do no research. Bitcoin mining is already going green to an extent and can do so more in the coming years. I feel this should be highlighted more and also the need for PoW, which is far more secure than other means of validating blocks.I was drawn to the part about a consensus on mining algorithm by the crypto-asset community:QuoteThe crypto-asset community has not reached an agreement on what constitutes “best practices” for consensus mechanisms, and other consensus mechanisms with different strengths and weaknesses may emerge.There is an obvious consensus mechanism which is superior to others in PoW. But there is no crypto asset community to decide on which is best and altcoin devs experiment with different simulations.- Jay -",

      "body": "There are some interesting snippets in the report which show that the government does at least recognize that bitcoin can help in the transition to 100% renewable energy. For example:QuoteCrypto-asset mining operations can quickly decrease the amount of electricity used by scaling back or switching off mining rigs. Bitcoin miners can participate in utility and grid operator programs that pay major electricity users to decrease consumptions during times of peak grid stress, or to balance supply and demand — a process called demand response.This is vital to a 100% renewable energy infrastructure. You can choose how much coal or gas to burn to meet response, but you can't choose how much sunlight there is how much wind there is. When there is an excess of energy being produced, bitcoin miners can utilize this and therefore the energy company makes money on electricity which would otherwise be completely wasted, and when there is an excess in demand bitcoin miners can temporarily scale back to allow supply and demand to balance. This mining usage will also subsidize the development of new renewable infrastructure which would otherwise be unprofitable due to a significant proportion of its production being wasted.QuoteWhile the EPA and the Department of the Interior have proposed new rules to reduce methane for oil and natural gas operations, crypto-asset mining operations that capture vented methane to produce electricity can yield positive results for the climate, by converting the potent methane to CO2 during combustion.Methane is often vented to the atmosphere because the cost of doing something useful with it, such as building a huge pipeline to transport it, is too high. Methane is 80 times as potent as carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Bitcoin miners, by virtue of being completely mobile, can utilize this methane at source and reduce its emission in to the atmosphere.I don't see this report as bad for bitcoin. They are simply saying that it is going to have to play by the same rules as every other industry in the country and start moving towards net zero emissions, and even pointing out areas where bitcoin mining will accelerate that movement.",

If required they can control these measures by periodic load shadings, maintenance day off, spreading the facilities across different regions of localities and what not.

In fact this is applicable to all industries irrespective of their field of work. If they are that much worries, then can have following schemes for the mining industries;If you install 1 miner then plant and grow 10 treesIf you have 100 miners then plant 1000 plants and grow.

So, Let's not be negative minded when we hear regulations. I know some states in the US who would be affected and would revolte if the game is seriously going against PoW and bitcoin.
