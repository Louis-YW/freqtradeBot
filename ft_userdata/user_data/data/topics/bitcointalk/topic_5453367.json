I somehow came across these guys and their products a few weeks ago. I think it was on either instagram or YouTube and the algorithm had it pop up for me. What I had noticed was they used a lot of those basic 1oz fine silver bitcoin coins, so that caught my eye. Then this post popped up on my timeline yesterday. I agree with you guys, very cool but pricey, not sure I can justify it. Would love to have one though.",

I imagine a fine silver version would be incredibly expensive. I don’t have any, but I’ve certainly used legit silver silverware before, know what they make it out of and how it typically doesn’t tarnish too badly? Probably not pure silver I’m assuming. Or perhaps it can be coated in something? Quote from: owlcatz on May 21, 2023, 12:10:04 AMDamn.. I really want one of these coins now... I like how the design is mjb monetary metals etc...

Out of my price range, but would love to have one. Certainly not a great “safe” as you said, it’s quite clearly something someone would steal first.

But I think for most people that aren’t physical crypto collectors, and know what we know and all that, it’s not as big a deal. Also, whether we like it or not, this is by far the #1 most used / recognizable bitcoin coin design. So it’s something most people are familiar with.",
