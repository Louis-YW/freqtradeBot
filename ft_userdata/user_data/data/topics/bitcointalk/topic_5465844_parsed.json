      "body": "Agreed with your point that India is in the process of becoming a leader in Fintech. The faster a country improves in financial infrastructure the faster it will grow. What were are seeing is not only an eye opener for progressed global economy, it is also a lesson for them to not underestimate Indian financial infrastructure. I do have a feeling.like UPI the CBDC project would be a successful project after all India has abundance of brain that understands and foresee the technology of the future. I can also bet that all of this innovation happened because India realized that they cannot escape Bitcoin. The vide link that you shared is from zeenews with all those shity was of promotion. I found a reddit video which is all about how to withdraw cash from a UPI ATM. You can check the video here.",

      "body": "Yes just saw a video on how to operate UPI ATM. This is amazing and indeed India is going to become the leader in Fintech in next couple of years. UPI itself is a revolutionary initiative. Now almost 6 countries are in process of implementing this UPI infrastructure in their country including Japan which was considered the most technologically advanced nation once upon a time. Cardless cash withdrawal was there but it needed to have the ATM of the same bank. UPI ATM will not have such requirements.",

Seems very good, and I think we may no longer debit cards either that is mostly used to withdraw cash from ATM not at any POS as far as I observed. Surely, India is taking the cashless economy to the next level.I still remember vloggers from many countries stunned by UPI on every shop even at the road side vendors because they always thought India is nothing but slum, but they failed to realize India is growing rapidly in various sectors while the developed countries are struggling to maintain especially post COVID-19.I just have one question, this feature will be implemented in all the existing ATMs or only ATMs called UPI ATM?",

      "body": "I am amazed to see how India has been progressing in the Fintech sector. After this launch, I do not think we will require debit cards in the future. This innovation of UPI-based ATMs might become the most secure way of withdrawing cash. The only issue would be to make our older generation learn how to use such ATMs. Already they are struggling to use UPI for day-to-day transactions. Still, I would say it is a huge achievement and such innovation would help India to become a global economic giant in the future.",

Click here to check the video.Yes I saw the video as well probably was from the Jio world drive event in Mumbai where all the fintechs startups have been displaying their products for last 3 days. It's really a great Innovation and a big relief from the unnecessary charges that the bank levy when you go to withdraw from other bank ATMs. I even saw tap to pay configuration using UPI there. So you can get you tap and pay small device created which you can keep alongside your phone, whenever someone has to pay you through tap and pay they just tap that very small device, enter amount and done. No need to even scan QR codes anymore.",

I stopped using most of their services when UPI came into existence. Prior to UPI if you withdraw cash from a different bank ATM after you finish your quota they would charge INR 25. Those charges would come as bulk posting and would reduce your bank account balance in one go. Globally all banks use such hidden charges or normal charges to exploit their customer.   I admire Bitcoin because it does not have any hidden charges. It was one of the main reasons why I wanted a part of it.

KVB isn't a nationalized bank as far as I know, but it's a private bank with 100+ years successful track record.Every bank has charges even SBI too, but private sector literally charges for everything and RBI allows it this is unacceptable when government want all our transaction to happen via digital mode.Talking about SBI, I had bitter experience using their account and approaching the branch, so it's been years since I touched my SBI account so it forces us to use these private sector banks such as ICICI, Axis, HDFC, and others for better user experience.Quote from: pawanjain on September 14, 2023, 01:31:45 PMGood to know that.

This is how they run their business.If banks could follow what they preach to every customer then they would have never survived. When you go to a branch you will find a lot of marketing displays that promote only one thing for the customer. Which is asking their own customer to save money in a savings account, invest money in FD, use recurring deposits, and a lot more. If they follow their own principle they won't be making such huge returns on our money. This is quite normal for us now. They have been scamming us on our own money but we cannot say that it is a scam as we get penny returns from them in the disguise of good returns.",
