  "content": "4th of May 2023 Update: Hey guys! Happy to announce that we entered the third phase of our project, and are on the right way of becoming a community driven crypto casino. In November 2022 we re-launched the brand under new management, where we focused on a more secure, robust and licensed gambling experience. Our goal was to establish our name within the crypto community, partner up with several well-known affiliates, and overall close the gap between unregulated and fully licensed online crypto gambling. Our friends at BTCGosu.com helped us a lot here, there were one of our first contacts here on BitcoinTalk, and I truly believe that we wouldn't be here without their help   In January 2023 we introduced our brand to you guys, the BitcoinTalk.org community. We launched several projects, including a crypto casino review thread, design competitions and the first version of this ANN thread, that today gets a fresh new look thanks to Jayce! With this approach, we let our players voice their opinion about our brand publicly, and work towards improving whatever is in our power to do so.In February 2023 we reached our first Affiliate milestones – with 100 closed affiliate deals promoting Coinslotty around the online crypto landscape. Through a gifting campaign, we celebrated that achievement with various leaders from the industry, including BTCGosu, Cryptorunner, Bitcoinist and many more. 5,000 hand-made golden chocolate coins were distributed to each of our partners, together with custom-branded gadgets  And today, on May the 4th, we launched the third iteration of the product, a rebranded and improved experience that now flies new colours, features a new font, higher bonuses and an attractive VIP program. Added to this, we also increased our offerings and partnered up with even more online casino software providers.I hope you guys will have fun, and if you want to learn more about our brand I left a few links below  #1. November Re-Launch Announcement on Yahoo Finance#2. Coinslotty.com Review on BTCGosu.com#3. February Affiliate Milestone Announcement on  CryptoNews.com #4.

Players who wish to recover funds held in a closed, locked or excluded account, are advised to contact Customer SupportAlthough 1btc is still big enough for recreational gambler, but it is a big difference with what they claim here that KYC will start at 2btc.

It's nice to see an online casino that is not overloaded with additional requirements for players, such as blocking when using a VPN, this will save many from sudden blockages and misunderstandings, and I think the mandatory KYC when exceeding the 1BTC limit will be attractive for small players.",

To further build your reputation and presence amongst members and prospective participants of your platform, I will also suggest just as it has already been suggested earlier before now that you seek a good signature campaign manager to run a signature campaign for your casino which would help boast your presence here. It would also build your reputation as well since you already have partners with good reputation here. All these added together will give you a good edge to showcase what you offer.",

So which one is the valid information? Or maybe 2btc limit is like a special condition for bitcointalk members only? If it is, how they will know that someone come from bitcointalk? Ah, no, it's 2 BTC! Sorry about that  I have updated the terms in the backend before the launch, but seems like the devs are still pushing it out on the front end. Holiday season got the best out of us - but I'll make sure to have the terms of use reflect this by the end of the week  How does the KYC 2 BTC limit work? There's no KYC if your personal account has had winnings or deposits below 2 BTC (or any other currency equivalent), as soon as your account reaches that lifetime 2 BTC threshold (be it by your deposits or with winnings) a KYC is triggered. Since we are a licensed casino, we have to have this in place for the regulations, but luckily we managed to bump it up from 0.5 BTC to 2 BTC  Quote from: Coin_trader on January 04, 2023, 08:55:30 AMFor starter, You should rescale your image to a more visible size and also make the separated text smaller because your announcement image needs to be zoom in order to read the content since you over size the additional text above and below.

It's been a while since I was an active forum member, so help is appreciated  I've requested an updated infographic, if you have any more ideas let me know  How do the RCP tokens work? With each bet of 20 USDT or equivalent you get 1 RCP token, the same points are accumulating in your account. Once you have enough, you can redeem any of the subscriptions or devices",

Although there are still shortcomings regarding delivery, especially in dropping ANN threads which are relatively rudimentary. But we understand that and you can fix it or hire someone who is professional to do it.I'll focus on the simple things about this casino:1. The initial display for registering is clearly very dark and I think it should be a little considered to provide several colored (shapes) that separate between sub emails, sub passwords, etc. Look at the screenshot below.2. Sub, after entering what type of crypto will be deposited, there is an empty column that really doesn't need to be added. Moreover, there is no information on what should I fill in.3. In the promotion section I quite like it because there are so many bonus points such as Cashback and the unique daily promotion bonus. Although I need more to know, maybe the VIP members must be in for a lot of surprises.4. There are quite a lot of games available and I think you can say they have been fulfilled.5. Maybe I need a deposit to know more about the extent of this casino because I need something different from the others. Even if you tell me what are the advantages if you play at Coinslotty.",

The is indeed prepared for the casino launch because he spend time here in the forum to read and discuss with other members about gambling to gather data that will benefit there casino. I read many thread of OP and most of them is for gathering data purposes. I would say that this casino invested time and effort for this launch based on OP activity here in the forum. I never thought that they will deliver an impressive casino during the launch.Cheers!",
