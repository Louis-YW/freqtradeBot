  "content": "Im interested about nft creations.I have few ideas so we could attract a lot buyers Im looking for someone who knows how to make nft. I belive in the future of nft -s and i think its a great way to use even as crowd funding way to collect funds and support the funding flow regards with the NFT asset.The way i look at is that i can create nft and people want this all around the world i think the whole idea is genius and price of the asset not limited becouse you can buy just little as fraction of the total asset.Im new in crypto but im ready to learn and i see a lot potential in nft i want to focus on mainly nft. I think let's create portfolio of the most expensive assets and to sell it The good NFT should have value the good real estate is good one hard assets such us metals are also the good ones Im thinking to create kind of safe heaven platue of the assets with nft.",
