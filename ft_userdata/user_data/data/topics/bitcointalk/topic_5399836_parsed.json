Bunch of new tokens in the market more scalable compared with litecoin. We didn't even need litecoin anymore. That's only speculators who are still believing if the litecoin has a chance to become another silver again. I see no reason to buy this coin rather than speculating about the pump that can comeanytime. I personally think  if litecoin is not a silver again and this will never reach top 5 again. The era for the old coin already ended. You need to open with the new tokens that came to the market.",

Cryptocurrencies are always innovating and elimination is harsh, new projects will always perform better and grow than old ones.While we will no longer see hype around them, they are still being traded and used. If bitcoin is seen as a safe haven during a bear market then I think older coins like LTC can also be seen as a haven during this bear season.",

Any price above $0 is overvalued for things like Litecoin, Dogecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV and every other fork or copy of bitcoin. Not that I'm disagreed with hard forking, but whoever began all of those coins had no intention to promote censorship-resistance and financial sovereignty whatsoever. Presumably, he did it for fun, or to make a quick buck in a smart way.Fortunately, we've escaped from this \"digital silver\" gibberish, please don't bring it back. If only the problem with scaling could be resolved with solving blocks more frequently, that is in litecoin.",

For at least two years I have not seen any development going on around this project. It seems the community is also shrinking every month and week. Sometimes I still use Litecoin to make cheap transfers, but it seems that the low fee is becoming the only usefulness of this coin. It is unlikely to be enough to bring the coin back to the top 5 on Coinmarketcap.",

Even if I think that LTC has potential, it does not matter to the public who are putting bets on shitcoins and NFTs. For them quick and easy gains are more important that the legacy or technology behind something.The only old trusted coin you need to buy is bitcoin. Rest of them have mostly gone down in the last few years. Still if you have some LTC left lingering in your wallets, keep those for a last stand selloff.Beyond that I dont see anything big happening with LTC unless something big in terms of development happens in their labs. For trading, it is good for pumping and dumping by investors, most of whom are found in the r/LTCmarkets channel, makes it look like a group of wankers.",

Depending how it's going to be received by the market and how useful it's going to be for real, MimbleWimble can be indeed a booster for litecoin adoption.QuoteWith Mimblewimble Extension Block, users of the network can opt-in to confidential transactions. The end goal is to enhance the viability of Litecoin as a fungible currency that can be used for real-world transactions by lowering fees and adding privacy, throughput, and scalability.Although there are controversies:QuoteThe OG cypherpunk Adam Back was, however, not impressed by MWEB. While responding to a tweet that speculated many Bitcoiners believe that Bitcoin may soon activate the protocol, Back said that he does not think MWEB enhances much privacy:“IMO Mimble Wimble is not much of a privacy improvement as the transaction history will be recorded even if later elided, and the scaling gains only start to win at large size as transactions are bigger. also, receiver online is inconvenient. Confidential Transactions I like ofc.”Litecoin Activates MimbleWimble Extension Blocks (MWEB)",
