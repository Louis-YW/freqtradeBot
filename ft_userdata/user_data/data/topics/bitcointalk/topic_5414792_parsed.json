  "content": "I know nothing about what would go into creating something like that…. -Having users/ creating accounts -User-created and moderated communities -People being able to create a post that can be commented on w/ an upvote/downvote type rating system-Is this a huge undertaking and if so what would I be looking at financially if I were to hire someone? -Where would I look to find that person or persons? Is this something I could learn to do myself with professional website design templates?Sorry, if I haven’t provided enough info for what I am asking about. I’m not well versed in this area, but I think I have a really good idea for a community-type website and I would like to try and create it.I am reluctant to be too specific because I’m kind of surprised it doesn’t exist already. Or it could be a stupid idea and I’m being ridiculous thinking someone would steal the idea.Also- Is there a more appropriate sub to post this on?Thanks in advance for anyone who takes the time to answer this!",
