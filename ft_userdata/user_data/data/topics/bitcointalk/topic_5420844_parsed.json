MLM running as networking is not reliable.Yeah, it was a thing, even before the pandemic and a lot of people learned the hard way. Some even came with a strategy of being the pioneer investors and quickly make withdrawals within the second phase of there investments and are never seen again.They know these sort of investments don't last long and have learnt where to draw the line. Some never invest at all, some invest only at the beginner phase why a few dumb forks let's greed have a hold on them and think it would last a whole longer but the result is always a crash.Are there really those that likes to work or enjoys working? Not so many persons likes to work but, its just one of those things you've just got to do. You need to work to earn and worst for these people still is that, There are no jobs and so, they try to take there chances with what they are presented with. Most end up poorer and in debt than they once were but, the are learning for sure.",

As well as global supply chain disruptions.Organizations like MLMs are definitely a good prospect as they are one method of local communities organizing and forming mutual support groups. To cite one historical example, communists in cuba organized communal gardens to feed the country when food imports were sanctioned. In times of crisis, it is probably better to have community support. Mutual cooperation for growing food, producing oil and leveraging alternatives to oil is a good strategy. MLMs are one method. of organizing and coordinating these types of movements.But of course there are others. People could organize around community gathering places like churches or schools. Perhaps crypto can find itself a niche role in these areas, if inflation continues to become an issue. Local communities might go so far as to organize and produce their own local altcoin in an effort to escape inflation. As some communities have done in past eras. Aurora coin in iceland is one example that comes to mind.",
