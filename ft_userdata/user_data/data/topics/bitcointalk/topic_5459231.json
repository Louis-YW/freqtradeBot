After opening the site, it turns out that it is a dangerous site, and the following message appears:QuoteDeceptive site aheadAttackers on arsowallet.org may trick you into doing something dangerous like installing software or revealing your personal information (for example, passwords, phone numbers, or credit cards). This is not all; after visiting this site and skipping the warning notice, and after registering an account, it becomes clear that you have obtained a bonus, but you can never withdraw it or make a stake except by depositing your crypto via the deposit address of this scammer.-----------------------Scammers Profile Link:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3564370 | FLAGReference Link:  * [AIRDROP][REFERRAL CAMPAIGNS] Topics: 1- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459064.0 | Archived2- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5459149.0 | Archived* Site: https://arsowallet.org/ | Archived-----------------------Information about the ARSO WALLET domain:QuoteDomain Name: arsowallet.orgRegistrar: Namecheap, Inc.

After opening the site, it turns out that it is a dangerous site This users was continuesly making new thread every day about Hooked airdrop. I turned on bounty section notification and this user was spamming with his referel link. I was busy in personal life and didn't check but thanks for investigating and revealing the scam of this site. I am supporting flag and this kind of users should be punished to make forum clean. This scammer is aware that bounty hunter are using this section and most of them don't know much about scam because they are just promoting project and most of hunters feeling no fear while connecting wallet. This flag maybe some sort of message for them to not trust this user and site he shared.",
