      "body": "Thanks!! Having a blast over here!  I think I have a custom bar somewhere with some on it  . If I can locate it, I'll post pics. I get request to make a lot of different alt pieces because there isn't really a market for physical alt suppliers. My custom alts are usually hand stamped into 999 silver bars.",

      "body": "Brass -are mass produced for trade. Price isn't in stone yet, but i'm aiming for 10 for $250 in a coin pouch. Singles would be $35 ea.All will be funded. The first 100 are hand stamped 1-100 PR . The rest will only be stamped with the location they are being purchased from. If you live in Missouri, for example , they will be hand stamped \"MO\".Copper Bars - will be $135 fully funded + shipping $10.20 = equivalent in Bitcoin price. If a few people want some for \"DIY\" i can get you them at a better price, but you have to buy a full tube of 20. Only 3 tubes available for DIYSilver - I won't have numbers for a few more weeks. Aiming for under $30 funded.",
