Maybe they provided more access to Polish regulators for catching Polish Tax avoiding citizens to get to be \"fully\" compliant. Taking credit of not being an illegal operation these days however is just weird PR amd tells a lot about how things used to be. I know that working with regulators goes still against for many crypto libertarian ethos but it's the only way forward (and to avoid jail).",

This authorization to operate in Poland would make more people use the currency in that country. They are not authorizing Binance operations because they love or want to support the crypto Industry. But the government's target is to regulate the crypto space, invade privacy and collect taxes. Regulations negate the sole purpose of bitcoin, but for now, I think exchanges are doing more publicity but in the nearest future they might end up having lesser influence. It would be good if other nations that have ban bitcoin changed their stance and maybe embrace regulations instead of an outright ban.",

      "body": "Remember in years past when the majority said legalizing and taxing marijuana was the no brainer, common sense, stance on cannabis?It seems crypto is emerging within a similar precedent where governments of the world seek to legalize and tax it to boost economies and tax revenues. We've seen it with spain and other european nations offering \"digital nomad\" travel visas which would allow crypto whales to reside in country. Tax cuts and other incentives have been offered by other nations in an effort to attract crypto whales.Its difficult to say how far crypto has penetrated into public consciousness and the degree to which younger generations might have chosen to embrace it. So called \"bitcoin maximalists\" appear to be taking flak at the moment on social media platforms. With many not being outspoken as to which direction they lean in. Poland appears to be the latest to hop on the crypto bandwagon in an effort to boost tax revenues and economic stats. Given current conditions and plans to fund resistance against russia. Nations like poland could currently be scrambling to generate revenues as high as possible. Knowing their defense budgets are defined as a percentage of GDP, incentivizes them to devise methods to boost GDP. To increase funds which can be devoted towards defense purposes. In which case, embracing crypto could become a legitimate means of funding resistance against russian expansionism.",

It is a very wise choice for Binance to actively respond to the supervision of governments around the world. This has fully established the status of the world's largest digital currency exchange. What remains to be maintained is that the exchange should not take the initiative to do evil, and not become a tool of capital and politics to ensure the safety of exchange users' funds. This is what I am most concerned about and looking forward to.",

It's the same with bookmakers, if you have a bookmaker and you want to operate in EU territory, you have to apply and if you are granted a licence you have to pay for a licence in practically every country, instead of just one licence for the whole of the European Union.This means an excessive multiplication of bureaucracy and fees, in addition to compartmentalising the market, which is certainly not going to put the EU at the forefront of innovation in the crypto world.",
