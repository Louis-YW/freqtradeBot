Seems like you got  beef with Lafu, not this board, so why bother? BTW, your trust is absolute shit. So  why would anyone believe you anyhow? Dumbass...",

I haven't checked though. I was following the cryptopia discussion for a while but have never seen any claim of such self hacking drama. I think you should visualize more info on what you have claimed.",
