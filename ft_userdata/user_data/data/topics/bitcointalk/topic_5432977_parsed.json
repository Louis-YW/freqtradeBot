      "body": "Many of us didn't take Bitcoin seriously at the time of its inception. But the fact that you once did not grab fortune by the tail does not mean that another one will be created for you. At least until there was nothing like it, many projects are created, and even more are ruined or turn out to be frauds, so don't be dumb a second time. Learn about bitcoin and hope to get lucky with it. It may be worth hoping that someday you will meet a truck with gifts, but today you don’t need to sit around waiting for a miracle. Learning is useful at any age.",

That being said, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances of identifying and getting involved in revolutionary ideas:Stay informed about emerging technologies and trends in your field of interest. Reading industry news, attending conferences, and networking with others in your field can help you stay up-to-date on new developments.Be open to new ideas, even if they seem unconventional or outside of your comfort zone. Some of the most successful innovations were initially met with skepticism or disbelief.Consider investing in startups or small companies that are working on innovative projects. While there is always a risk involved in investing, supporting a company in its early stages can give you the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a potentially revolutionary idea.Look for opportunities to collaborate with others who are working on innovative projects. This can give you the chance to contribute your own ideas and expertise, and to learn from others who are tackling similar challenges.Ultimately, there is no surefire way to identify revolutionary ideas, and it is often the case that these ideas come from unexpected sources. The key is to stay open to new possibilities and be willing to take risks in order to pursue your passions and interests.",

Bitcoin initialize the cryptocurrencies ecosystem and note that Bitcoin was created after a historical similar-system creation attempt and research, dated back from 1980.It is extremely hard to find what is the next big thing, especially in an ecosystem that is currently filled with worthless or scam coins/tokens. The idea that we could separate the wheat from the chaff seems very unlikely. Nevertheless, I suggest you should trace back to what bitcoin is all about and how big its current potency is, I believe there is still opportunity left to get.",

Eth wasn't another bitcoin even if it's considered a cryptocurrency. Facebook didn't try to next next anything, Mark Zuckerberg just build facebook because there was demand for it.

These days people are looking for profit an mostly of them were gambling their money into the new tokens. i don't even think that you shall aware about people didn't identifying the revolutonary idea that introduced by a project but people were purely gambling on it.

They've bought at the lowest possible price and when it's about to get launched, the price will start to increase which will result in many dumping it as soon as possible. That's where they're focusing and forgetting the essence of having these projects in existence.
