Anyway, good catch OP!It doesn't look like that person who started their bounty thread is their team member and instead was probably just hired, but he should have known better and check it out before publishing as this isn't his first bounty campaign. Anyway, I left him negative feedback (and sent him a PM to answer these allegations) so hopefully that makes him to lock all these threads that he opened it for them.",

It's clear that there are serious red flags with this operation, as I also discovered that all members of the team are using fake profiles and stock photos. This is highly suspect and it seems clear to me that this is a scam. And the fact that they went through the trouble of creating all these fake profiles just adds to their credibility. I'm sure this is a totally legitimate and trustworthy operation.Â  Great work, OP. The account has been tagged.",

I have managed only a few bounty campaigns so far, have paid reward for campaigns already. For the other one, I can't contact with project owner for the last few weeks, don't know why suddenly he got inactive but I'm pretty much sure that he will pay the hunters. But hunters can't have the patience. Threaten me to create thread in reputation. They will participate in every campaign but they can't do a little home work even.",

Nice attempt lol.You'll be surprised to know that many so-called community managers will take it, I've seen how people apply to be their community managers on telegram in exchange for the project's token, people will do this in the hope that the token they are going to receive will have value in the market, these community managers are dime a dozen now there are very few new projects and there are so many bounty hunters and managers, the community of bounty hunters is overcrowded.",

They have no zeal for what they claimed to be their own originality. Nice investigation OP. Their first goal is to somehow create and launch a project, and run away with money from crypto investors. It is not right to expect anything original from them where their intentions are towards evil. As they want to prepare everything quickly and launch the project, they don't have much time. And they don't have the talent to create original content. OP did a good job exposing this project which saved many investors.",

My guess is that he decided that money he got for promoting them on bitcointalk is worth more than his Member account so he decided to just continue with it.Regarding those who joined their signature bounty campaign, last night I contacted all of them, and from what I can see only 3 still have their sig on but as expected those who are doing social media part of the campaign keep joining in, not caring about flag & tags.",
