I have come across the word genesis block, which I know was the beginning of the whole thing, and all other blocks followed after that, but the date and knowing that today marks approximately 15 years is something I don't know about.The fact that the news headline of that day was actually used and added as a note on the block to mark the very fact that it was mined, \"Chancellor on the brink of a second bailout for banks,\" I guess this was how the exact date of the genesis block was being noted and recorded up to this day.",

Although this needs no celebration events as these is not some big things of the current era but they should be considered as one. We have a pizza day, satoshi's last day at BTT, and now we have the first block made on 3rd January. I think Satoshie was also waiting for the new year to launch its product.I have seen the same strategy in many other crypto-related projects like airdrop projects and platforms launching there mainnet in January or in the first quarter of 2024. This has to be some market strategy to launch new projects at the earl time of the new year. Or I am just imagining. Binance shares a lot of news, like the one shared in which China took action against there citizens using USDT for trading purposes while they took the example of Binance as to create fear among the traders of crypto, and Binance shared it by itself. They are just covering new topics and news to gain more traffic that's it.",

On the other hand this would surely bring an upsurge of users into the network which would mean more money in circulation. Honestly at this point I just wish we get what we want regarding bitcoin's still hard to deal with transaction speed and time, we need it now and we would it need it more in the future soon as bitcoin becomes receives a more mainstream appeal. 15 years from now the first bitcoin genesis block is mined, if we don't play our cards right by 2029 we might not even have miners who would be interested to mine bitcoins anymore no matter how \"profitable\" it may be cause it's just not worth it when you're going to spend stupendous amounts of money for fees and wait for days on end to have your transaction taken care of.",

I am indeed wowed by those who have made replies how during those early years, they bought bitcoin as a joke, never thinking that it would get to $100, $1000, or even cross $10,000. Some of them joined their collage friends to buy after they had read the bitcoin whitepaper. Actually, some of them didn't hodl at first. They bought, sold, and bought again. From then on, they started to DCA until this very moment.  What would be your own bitcoin story in the next 15 years.",

Sadly that most of the early adopters sold their bitcoins for small amount when the price was nothing compared to now and some of them lost their seed phrase to access their wallets where they’ve stored those bitcoins. Happy 15 year’s anniversary to the first genesis block of bitcoin, I was far from knowing about bitcoin at that time.

However as Bitcoin grew and became more stable it began to become more of an asset than a p2P currency.Bitcoin has transgressed from the basic use of it into an asset for investment. This is because of how its value continue to grow amidst all rallies surrounding it. Bitcoin now serves more purpose as an asset than what it was originally designed for to be p2p currency and most of the people in the space are coming in as investors rather than coming to use the currency for p2p.",

Even some of the recent donations sent there have been large. I understand you want to piece of history but will anyone actually check all those transactions? Probably not.Coinbase also tweeted the hash of the first block and many had no idea what it means. It’s also crazy seeing how low the difficulty was back then compared to now and how we need these ASICS all around the world to solve the next block. I remember my first Antminer S1.",
