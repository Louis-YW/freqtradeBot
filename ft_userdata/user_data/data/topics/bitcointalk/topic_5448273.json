  "content": "Andreas Antonopoulos is a very educated source about Bitcoin. I’ve heard about his book “Mastering Bitcoin” and have a question if it’s also suited for average people like me (who aren’t coders / computer scientists)? Has someone read it completely and can tell? I like Andres Antonopoulos but I just want to ask because it would be sad if I might don’t understand most parts of his book because it might be directed at coders or computer scientists, mostly. Is “Mastering Bitcoin” also a good read for people who don’t have any coder knowledge? I’m happy to hear your reply and plz add if your are a coder or not + have read his book “Mastering Bitcoin” or not. Greetings Phu",

Even so I think at least parts of the other chapters can be worthwhile to an interested person, even with limited understanding of computer science.",

      "body": "Yeah absolutely, anyone can go to github and start reading this book, no problem in theory. Of course, if you have some basic knowledge of at least one programming language, some parts will seem more \"straight forward\" but if you are a complete beginner, the first chapters are accessible to absolutely everyone who has some knowledge of technology.Here is a quote from the author which is self-explanatory:QuoteMastering Bitcoin is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover bitcoin at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of bitcoin.Personally, I had a little difficulty with chapter 7. I only had a few basics in python and C++, at the time some things seemed a bit complex.But the goal of this kind of reading is to give you as much knowledges as possible, so you have nothing to lose by trying to read it",

Greetings PhuWhile the book is written in a clear and accessible style, it is still quite technical and may be challenging for those without a background in computer science or cryptography. It is best suited for readers who are already familiar with the basics of Bitcoin and blockchain technology and are looking to deepen their understanding of these topics.",

I am not a coder but I see that book is very helpful to enlighten me about basics of Bitcoin. It is more helpful if you know how to code then you can practice with code and understand about Bitcoin blockchain better.You can read his another book like \"The Internet of Money\"https://aantonop.com/books/iom/You can learn from another source like \"Learn me a Bitcoin\"https://learnmeabitcoin.com/beginners/",

Also at least to me reading a physical copy usually provides me with a clearer mind because I get less easily distracted and am in a different context than while reading something on a laptop or phone.That being said, I feel like it's almost underappreciated that Andreas Antonopoulos is providing his book online, for free. That alone makes him support-worthy in my book (heh).",

      "body": "Yes, Mastering Bitcoin is absolutely one of the best bitcoin books available for bitcoiners of any age. I use it as a reference all the time whenever I want a more technical explanation of things.For example, I was recently doing a bunch of research on how seed phrases work and Mastering Bitcoin proved to an excellent resource for truly understanding all of the steps that are involved in converting entropy like coin flips into seed words and then adding a BIP 39 passphrase as a \"25th word\" and then how to generate your xPub key from there. I could have learned all of the same things online but it's nice to be able to just open a book to learn what I need in a clear and concise format. I have the physical book because I like to underline all of the parts that stand out to me and make notes in the margin etc. but I believe it's available for free online under a creative commons license. I would strongly suggest it to anyone who want's a deeper understanding of bitcoin.",

In fact, don't be surprised when you see a Non-techy person understand that book than the person that has been a computer literate for long time but the problem I found with that book is that level of comprehension differs from people, so while learning the book, they should expand their learning to other materials like learnmeabitcoin, this forum and other popular Bitcoin materials out there, don't rely on one book and think you will capture everythin about bitcoin.",

So if the local language is able to download, that possible for people unless the background technology will understand it for sure. I enough understand with computer knowledge, but I try hard to understand that book if already explained math calculations. So I think, people who are interested to read this book, beside have good English and computer, they must interesting also with Math.",
