Please go back to some of your earliest posts and try to update them. Please let me know if you were able to update any of them successfully.Cheers,",

The error does not come up.I also did the same and even try editing much earlier post in 2018 on January 21 but no error come up too. My guess is there's a range or time range where you can only edit. 2017 on December to much earlier date come up with this error and January 21, 2018 doesn't have this error when editing a post which means my guess is that the posts that can be edited without errors is 6 years from the present.",

Ah, you're right, i didn't read and missed your updated post.

The archival section is better to do this kind of test. But editing a 2016 post from the 61st page, it's unlikely to be noticed.",
