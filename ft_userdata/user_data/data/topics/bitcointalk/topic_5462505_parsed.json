After writing too long, it comes to the end about earnings through signature campaigns. You can join signature campaigns only if you are a good quality poster and can contribute good posts to advertise those companies with your posts that carry their signatures.If you have yet been quality poster and have enough contributions, you will not be competitive enough and your application will not be accepted. If you want to join such campaigns in future, you must start your learning now and building up your account.",

You're being a bit disingenuous, OP. Your job offer as a bounty manager says very clearly that you are primarily interested in making money.But in no way am I blaming you. It is true that, thanks to the forum, many users can support their lives by earning, which the forum offers as a privilege. And this is very important for those countries in which there is a high level of unemployment and, as the latest news says, a difficult international situation.However, everything can be done together. By learning and reading on the forum, you can also participate in subscription companies. There is nothing reprehensible in this; something else is important so that your interest in material terms, after all, is not so frank but more than outweighs the interest in knowing the field of crypto.",

And that for me is a privilege gained through the forum. We can't rule out the fact that participating in signature campaigns brings some stipends to forum members but for you to be eligibleÂ  to the ranks of participation you must have in one way somehow, at different points impacted knowledge to others, gave information or resource solution to someone's questions by way of discussion threads. The forum is an enviable community to be a part of but that doesn't mean that without it people wouldn't survive.In life when one door closes, a much better one opens replacing the closed one (innovation is discovered everyday).OP no offense please, but when next, try to differentiate the place of NO from KNOW, the mistake is repeatedly found in the post.",
