That will the language for human being but so far so good, as the long run of bitcoin in the 14th anniversary in the ecosystem of the blockchain. And the crash of bitcoin and s not practical expected as you put it. It is only you the user of bitcoin can crash out and not bitcoin. Whenever you are tire of the system you are liable to leave and that is you crash out and whenever you have money you can come back again.",

Joke apart. But in as much as we all believe in Bitcoin, the reason is that it has gained our trust more than all other digital currencies because of its true decentralization, and it's also being addressed as the father of all crypto currencies. If Bitcoin breaks down now, like you have said, there is a lot of possibility that every other crypto will fall. This is because a lot of people will lose faith in Bitcoin, and you know what will happen to the entire crypto market: it will be enough to break down the entire market system.But to some point, I still think most cryptos will struggle to survive because their prices are not really backed by Bitcoin, and the price of Bitcoin only influences it a little. So such coins will try so hard to stand out and take the place of Bitcoin, but trust will never be there; a trust broken is hard to rebuild.Those are just mere assumptions, which might definitely not come to reality, even if not this century.",

History always repeats itself and they always do that because they know there are lots of newbie investors waiting to invest in new projects. If only there will be no investors who buy such altcoins before they prove themselves to be legit, the number of newly created altcoins will be greatly subsided but in reality that's not the case right now.",

A 1000% chance of growth is something pretty unrealistic that we'd probably never get to see again in the Bitcoin market, but it isn't exactly impossible with alts, with how some meme coins are even able to get said numbers.

If you really want to hedge, buy gold. It will not give you a huge amount of return but it will surely protect your capital.
