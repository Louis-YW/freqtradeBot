  "content": "Join me and celebrate my bitcoin journey[\\b] cryptocurrency or should I say bitcoin in particular is not something that is strange anymore in my locality. Although its still not allowed to transact bitcoin with the local fiat bank in my place but the use of bitcoin is still spreading and i am happy to say it has helped alot of people especially when it comes to payment for things online, especially in this particular period of time that my country is facing so much financial restructuring @changing of our local currency @turning the system into a cashless economy@ scarcity of the new and even the old naira note and the holding back of individuals funds restricting them from using their funds in the fiat banks.        So am glad that i was finally able to purchase my first bitcoin and am also planning on buying more, also i will hodl my coins till the speculuted time of the bitcoin halving due to stats gathered in the crypto space, which is supposed to take place next year but prior to the fact I have gathered on my own, i feel no one truly fully understand the movement of the price of bitcoin so i will holding till whenever bitcoin fully reaches another all time.      It wasn't easy for me to fully learn and understand the whole concept of bitcoin volatility but due to the curiosity i had to learn, i now know that bitcoin isnt any investments where one can make millions overnight after investing which is normally the basic view most people in my place have towards bitcoin investment. I missed out when the price was still 16k last year but i had to make my move now that the price is ok to buy, before it goes up again so i sold somethings in my place that are not of value to me again and started my own bitcoin investment journey. The key to a successful bitcoin investment is holding and that's what i intend doing",

Make sure that you are storing the btc in a wallet that you own and have the private key. Then backup the seed of the wallet and store it in a secure location. Then sit back and relax and watch your investment grow over the years.",

Trading requires knowledge on how the economy works which is a degree level subject that most of us do not have the knowledge to understand. Not everyone should be trading it is risky if you do not know how the market works and when you do know something about economics it is still risky because bitcoin is not like the normal investments you can make.",

It is not impossible that someone can get richer overnight via investment in bitcoins. It is not just a common thing and something happens everyday so people are advised not to have that mindset when they are about to invest in bitcoins. Think about this, imagine someone who invested a huge amount amounting to the value of one bitcoin or more, If there is a very positive movement in the market just like after some hours after they invested, they will be richer. This is not something that can always happen and not to everyone because it is not everybody that has the money to invest heavily in bitcoins, and there is no way to exactly know when the price of bitcoins will jump positively to a new profit price.",

Take the time to get ready and for now HODLing will be the plan. Congratulations on your first purchase and I wish you could continually increase the number as time flies by. I understand that the economy is at it's worst point but investing is still a good idea even for just small amounts. Hoping to see this one day turn into 1 Bitcoin as you keep on adding more.",

And it is not a spectacular amount that could be considered an investment, that amount can be collected even with faucet claims.I'm glad that you became a Bitcoin holder, but imagine how absurd it is that after the first small purchase of bitcoins, you share advice and talk about what is key in this investment. advice is usually given when you have some quality experience, while one small transaction is certainly not.",

You should HODL it until you learn all about many more ways to make your asset grow. For the time being, you should keep adding to your purchase in the future and keep hodling. When the time is right, you can trade and earn more. But don't listen to me. Do your own research and keep learning. And congratulation. One more thing, read the previous reply above mine.

My advice also is that send your Coins even though it is not much to a decentralized open source wallet and not in the centralized wallet. But if you want to use it within the short period of time you can keep it because moving them will cost you transaction fees so you can keep it there and sell it off whenever you want if it is a short time investment but if if is for a long time investment then move them out to a wallet that is more secured.",
