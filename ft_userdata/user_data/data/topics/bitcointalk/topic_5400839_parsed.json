I don't think so. Ryan is going to beat Fortuna. Right now Ryan is more hungry. His new trainer Joe Goossen is one of the best veteran boxing trainer. He's got a good game plan. I doubt if we will see a fight between Ryan Garcia and Tank Davis this year.",

I doubt if we will see a fight between Ryan Garcia and Tank Davis this year.GBP just want to go to the motions of having this fight, as mentioned it was postponed so it make sense that they will have to continue it despite Javier losing to Jojo Diaz.So yeah, the odds is on the side of Ryan to beat Javier and then move on to more lucrative target in this stack division. The most awaited is the Davis vs Garcia, but we will see. As mentioned by Leonard Ellerbe during the post fight interview from Davis win against Romero, GBP is reluctant to have their cash cow be pitted against Tank, although Garcia was in the ringside and even beat against Davis, him and Spence had a gentleman's bet of $10K. And so obviously, Garcia lost the bet here.",

Having had over 40 bouts and won 37 is an impressive record compared to Garcia's over all 22 bouts. I've watched some of Fortuna's fight which nearly ended in death encounter for his opponents. He still has that fight and am hoping he will bring it on against the more flexible ring dancing Garcia. This bout will be a thing of joy to watch. Whoever wins will be deserving it.

They are selective to their opponents. But with record of Fortuna, he has the chance to defeat Garcia. But in case, Garcia won this match. Their camp should not be very picky as it will indeed affect the reputation and status of Garcia in the boxing world. They need to face who wants to challenge him. This will show his true caliber inside the ring. But sometimes it does depend on the promoter. If they will not let him go outside his shell, he won't progress with his boxing career.",

Yes, Ryan shouldn't underestimate Fortuna, we don't like his performance against Tagoe in his last fight. So he better give us fans our money's worth when we watch this one. I watch Fortuna's highlight, he sure can bang and maybe he will caught Ryan just like Campbell did. I'm seeing that this is another busy fight for Ryan before a big fight maybe at the end of this year, probably December, I reckon. It could be Davis, or another champion in this division.",

They should give them the spotlight by letting him handle a good match. However, I'm not underestimating Fortuna, he's also a promising boxer but the management should also allow Ryan to face harder matches which could mark so people would really see his full potential. Yes, Ryan shouldn't underestimate Fortuna, we don't like his performance against Tagoe in his last fight. So he better give us fans our money's worth when we watch this one. I watch Fortuna's highlight, he sure can bang and maybe he will caught Ryan just like Campbell did. I'm seeing that this is another busy fight for Ryan before a big fight maybe at the end of this year, probably December, I reckon. It could be Davis, or another champion in this division.Some do say that Garcia did well on that recent Tagoe fight but even myself was disappointed on that one if you do really knows or see on how Garcia fights into those years where he hadnt a long break.Footwork wasnt that good, aggressiveness wasnt good on that too.. Too much confidence but the speed is still there but the sharpness and precision of jabs arent something just like before.He shouldnt underestimate Fortuna if he dont like for tables to be turned.",
