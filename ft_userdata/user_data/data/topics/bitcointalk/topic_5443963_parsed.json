  "content": "I use advanced trade on Coinbase but up till this morning had only been on those I could see that are available through GBP (which isn’t many compared to USDT). I just came across a tip online which said in order to pay less fees you should convert GBP to USDT and then you can buy almost all crypto through advance trade that way. Having just done this I only paid £0.15 fee for a £25.00 purchase when usually it had always been £1.50 which is a massive difference. Not sure if this is common knowledge to most but thought I would post just incase as I am sure there are many newbies out there like myself paying way more on fee’s then they need to.",

In the past, Using XRP pair greatly reduced trading fees and withdrawal fees, but I see that they decided to delisted it[1], and therefore USDT may be the appropriate option to avoid price fluctuations and ease of liquidation for all currency pairs, but it is certainly not the cheapest.Personally, I see that the trading and withdrawal fees are not large, especially for those who want to trade and win a lot, and paying part of the money as a fee is better than losing it due to hacking or the bankruptcy of the platform.[1] https://exchange.coinbase.com/assets",

      "body": "Dunno what fees you're referring to here, if you mean trading fees then I think cheaper fee offers won't consider user region if the exchange caters to global customers. It may only be offered during special events and only a few times.CEX usually offer discounted maker and taker fees if you set it to their native coin, such as Binance and Kucoin.",
