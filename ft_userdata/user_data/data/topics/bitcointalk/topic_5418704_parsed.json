I've received two withdrawals after submitting KYC for 0.2 and 0.8 btc.Was mostly betting live MLB in the summer, win some lose some, nothing spectacular and took a break and had a roughly 1.8 btc in the account, things were fine.

That night I noticed before the games even started, I couldn't login. Since then, live chat has told me to converse via email only, and two emails to their contact address have gone ghosted.I really just want some kind of reasonable explanation, resolution, or support to my case as I did nothing wrong except attempt to bet profitably and steam chase a couple games. I would understand cutting limits as this is an undesirable activity but to suspend my account, potentially steal the balance, and provide zero response is extremely heavy-handed behavior and not one I would have expected from what I presumed to be a somewhat large name in crypto gambling.",

A group of bettor tries to take the benefit of sudden odds change on an event. Some sportsbooks are slow to update the betting odds on a sudden change of the betting market situation. Usually a betting syndicate creates such situation by placing good amount of bets on a single side. Check this article to know about it clearly: Chasing SteamBetting site doesn't consider chasing steam as a good thing. It has been mentioned in the article tooQuote from: https://www.cleatstreetcapital.com/csu/chasing-steamDrawbacks of Chasing SteamThe biggest drawback of chasing steam is that it could lead to your sports betting account being limited or banned. It’s no secret that sportsbooks hate when people chase steam. They (fairly or unfairly) feel that you are taking advantage of their slow movements and have little tolerance for someone whose sole action is chasing steam.OP is aware of the result of Steam betting. Still, he has done it to gain profits by placing bets. Anyway, Betcoin.ag representative has taken their steps to resolve the accusation. I hope OP will share the final decision of Betcoin.ag here.",

What I noticed is that they rarely come back to update on whether the problem was resolved or not. So we may never know whether OP got punished for going against the terms or they gave him a second chance.I think some just post here in the scam accusation with hope that they can get support from members to pressurize a casino to pay them back.",

      "body": "Hi all, here for an update. I should also note that the were indeed responsive to my second follow-up support email, but it went unnoticed in my Spam folder.I wanted to wait until Betcoin acted, which they did yesterday by sending my deposit back which was 1.5 BTC. I believe my account had ~1.8 BTC in there before I made my steam chasing bets.I definitely don't think it's right that they kept the margin between my balance and my deposits, in my opinion this is highly unethical.Mahdirakib, when you say betting sites don't consider steam chasing a good thing, that should be clarified by saying they don't consider winning players a good thing. Every sports bettor makes a bet with the intention of making a profit. If I continued winning regardless of the methods, I expect at some point to be limited or banned. I do not expect to have my balance stolen. It should also be noted that no reputable site confiscates funds for this, but I would expect to be limited and and at the worst case account closed and funds returned and would take no issue with that.I had been betting live in-play up to this point with some system on momentum in games and had a small profit seemingly without issue. I decided one day to track market movement (steam chasing) and made bets on betcoin based on that logic. It should be noted that steam chasing is not a guaranteed method to make profit, the line is still dynamic and can move back, the game still needs to be played.  In this case my account seemed to be suspended and voided before any of those bets started, and Betcoin only returned my deposits, not my account balance. I did not realize any gain from my bets which I believe won, and instead had my account closed without notice.Bitcoin_arena, I definitely didn't get a \"second chance\" and in fact the end result is that I had some balance that was confiscated that was profit made before any steam chasing bets were made. I don't agree with this, and I don't think the wider community should either.Betcoin.ag, can I have my entire balance returned instead of just my deposits?",
