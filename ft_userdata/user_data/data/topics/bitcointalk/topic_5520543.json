I do not own any Bitcoin and I plan to work hard to earn each and every invaluable infinitely divisible satoshi, yet I am very lost as it presently stands. these days guides are no longer complete and in one location. they are vague and spread outbitcoin development is heavily funded by the like of the wall street institutions and they love barriers of entrythese days they act like a hierarchy where they wont even go into depths unless you first learn their latest created buzzword of the monththere used to be many complete, uptodate guides, but it has become apparent that those higher on the hierarchy dont want to engage and offer uptodate guides to normal peopleits getting to the point where the guides are hidden and soon people can only learn via college curriculum(income for institutions)however if you put the effort in to learn bitcoin using multiple sources, you could find a niche where you then translate the jargon back to basic speak and become the resource you feel is missingfeel free to ask questions, but usually you will find it best to use the search functions of forum and google to see if question has already been asked and answered",

Now for the club, I have never came across a learning club that is dedicated to bitcoin apart from here. So far, this forum has been the largest forum that talks about Bitcoin and it development more than anything other platform and it's dedicated to bitcoin progression and development.",

That means your problem isn't about to learn Bitcoin, you're commit to invest as much as you can in Bitcoin.If you think learning Bitcoin will make you make a lot of money, I don't think so. The jobs for Bitcoin is really limited, while in altcoins, there are a lot of jobs as long as you fill the requirement.",

Understand that those feelings are part of the learning curve which can especially be difficult when you are trying to do so without a guide. You can first start by reading the Bitcoin White paper to understand what Bitcoin is and then if you have any intended questions first try out the search option on this forum and if you do not see any topic related to your question you can ask your question and I'm very sure you will get answers from people in a very good position to help you understand and clear any confusions that you will have. Beat the frustration and de-motivation, and you will do well.",

IMO learn me a bitcoin definitely have some flow/structure, while some of O'Reilly Bitcoin books are well written (such as Mastering Bitcoin).Quote from: sorrowforasking on November 25, 2024, 02:48:09 AMHas anyone else experienced this? Is there truly no learning clubSerious technical learning group definitely exist, but it's limited in many ways. For example, Brink offers paid fellowship but expect some open-source contribution[1].[1] https://brink.dev/programs",

I actually did not join any learners club(that's silly to me having a club for just learners who then would constantly be giving them knowledge and sharing experiences). Information to what you need are everywhere you just need to show interest and source them out. As a newcomer into bitcoin you can start learning by reading there aren't any shortage of articles, videos, audios that teaches Bitcoin. This forum is a gathering more of a Crypto-currency community where lots of people are here for different reasons, no one is here to spoon feed you but still lots of people are willing to answer your questions and put you through but first you should do your research.

It's a short 3 months class, you will learn some essential stuff like building a wallet, understanding P2P system, and they also encourage you to contribute to some open-source Bitocin projects if you want. When I was joining the first month session, my only coding experience is with Java, only know very few of C++ and Rust (which both programming language is the ones that will be used) but I still can learn and enjoy the material.",

Are you learning Bitcoin development because of others? I thought it was supposed to be a personal dedicated aspect of our life that we choose, and we don't need to think if the entire community that you can derive source from is thriving or not. If you visit reddit.com, you can still see other communities that are fully active. In the meantime, get your ass up and start learning. You never can tell your fate on this and don't forget that no knowledge is a waste.

Rant over, thank you for taking the time to read.One thing you need to under is that don't expect all your plans to simply go the way you planned them. There can be obstacles and challenges around the corner. The other communities who are contributing to the community face their personal challenges, but they don't let it affects what they do in the technology. You have a unique skill to offer when you join, if you have not figured it out now you will later. When I joined the forum I thought there was nothing left for me to say here that I've never heard but along the line. I know one or another I have impacted members directly or indirectly and am a big fan of the lightning network.",
