I was eager to take on the content creation job, but alas it was not to be.The hiring fellow, who I met on Reddit wanted me to create \"fake news articles for some crypto projects\". I was like \"\"what?\". Yeah, I heard well...create fake news and make them look real enough for some crypto projects and earn thousands of USD in BTC. I told him that's not ethical and people would lose money. He said no, that folks will rather make money. That's how I let a lot of money slip through my fingers. This conscience of mine. I'm sure someone somewhere has taken the job.I'm sure some folks somewhere will lose their money as a result.",

That person was right when he said some people would make money from the hype as a result of the fake review or write up but more people would lose. Quote from: OddJobsForBitcoin on March 12, 2022, 10:16:25 PMHow do I even post a screenshot?You can use apps like imgur to post a screenshot but wait until you reach junior member rank or buy a copper membership. You need to have an activity count of 30 and at least 1 merit to become jr. member. You already fulfilled one so you just need to increase your activity count.Editing post to add links explaining rank requirements and copper memberships,Ranking and activity - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2818350.0Copper membership - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385104.0",

Our online lives are filled with misinformation and fake news, with social media providing the perfect platform for it to spread. So many people will gladly accept such a position because they are not conscious of the damage they are doing, and do not see any harm in pushing a misleading agenda.That is why it is important to make sure you are not falling for it. When you see information that you believe to be fact, you need to start looking at it with a critical eye. Always look for other sources to corroborate the story.
