  "content": "The essence of my idea:🦾 fleefa (available domain) is a social platform similar to TikTok where people will upload their videos and earn on the investment funds distribution system (at the stage of thinking through the entire investment system)EST: Bob downloaded and installed the fleefa app, after which he recorded a video and uploaded it in Shorts format, then another person Stephen, after seeing this video at an earlier stage, realizes that the video will potentially go viral and makes an investment in his profile. In order for Bob to receive investments, he will need to undergo KYC verification, while Stephen does not need to undergo verification to invest.An example of how investments work: Stephen invested 300 USDT in Bob's profile, after which the automatic fund allocation system performs its functions - 300 USDT goes immediately to conclusions in recommendations to random people, which raises the chance that the video will go viral or be viewed many times. (here you need to fully think over the operation of the algorithm and calculate the % of income)As a result, if Stephen really guessed right with his choice, then in the future both Bob and Stephen will receive rewards every month, depending on the percentage of funds deposited.UPD: 7:58 PM 12/11/23Disadvantages of crypto investors:1. Not safe, obviously2. It's difficult even for a nerdy cryptophanat, not to mention beginners3. If you come across a shit project, then there are scammers.4. Basically, to make a profit, you need to expect from a year and above, in rare cases, you can multiply in days, weeks, months.The advantages of investing in fleefa:1. Secure storage of funds in the internal wallet as well as access to the investment panel (as clear as possible)2. It's easy, you made a deposit and then you invest (of course there will be ToS)3. You can invest only in verified users who have passed KYC and only you can decide who to invest in.4. Profit payments every day, week or month, depending on the choice.5. User-friendly interface (of course, so far on the layout that I will show you soon)6. The ability to communicate with 24/7 support, which will always help you figure out your problem instantly7. Copy-paste videos will be immediately unsubscribed in the first minutes, that is, all content must be exclusively original. (anti-plagiarism)8.....9.....After the project is released in beta and people will be able to test the product and become a fleefa shareholder, that is, buy part of the shares or $fleet coin, which will be integrated in the future.Continuation........This is only 5% of the whole idea, there are many things that need to be carefully considered in implementation, I will add as much as possible.",

Personally, I consider this a disadvantage rather than an advantage. I don't think that having KYC required will appeal to many people.About kyc:Do you want to withdraw money and earn a native token without investing? No problem, we will not require KYC. But if you want people to be able to invest money in you (in your content) for security purposes, only the content maker will undergo KYC, while investors do not need it.About funds:A cryptocurrency with a wide selection (this is for deposit) same for WD. In fact, the wallet can be made separately, but it is better if it is centralized so that we can control everything at the legal level. The whole point is that you don't need to store your HODL funds in our wallets. In general, it was invented only to display the balance and withdraw/deposit funds.",

As I said above, this is just an idea. Do you want me to implement it? Let's proceed KYC for me, after give me 500k USDT and 1 year of time. There will be an office, a team and a activity. But all this is just a concept, if someone really likes the idea, I give it to them for free. lolAnd...Quote from: ~DefaultTrust on December 08, 2021, 08:10:29 AMCaмaя гeниaльнaя идeя - ничeгo нe cтoит бeз гeниaльнoй peaлизaции.

And the most annoying thing is that with a probability of over 146%, none of your idea is brilliant......I don't fly in the clouds and I do it so that I don't get discouraged mentally, not for \"investments\"",
