Try visit Russian board here in the forum and see if there's someone who is willing to sell some bitcoin.This is probably the best thing to do given that there's a sanction looming, banks is probably not a really great option if you want a seamless transaction that doesn't have the government intervention, also can you confirm with your friend if he's going to be investigated by the bank in a sudden cash transfer from another account? If that's the case, best thing that your friend can do isn't to buy all at once but never do it consistently too so there's suspicions that will arise when you do the P2P transaction, @nakamura12's suggestions are good start for your friend OP, at the least when the recommendations don't you're good to go.",

Stated on the article below that president Vladimir Putin is in favor of crypto transactions. It is not banned on your country so you are safe. QuoteThe Bank of Russia has repeatedly warned investors that cryptocurrency markets are extremely volatile, and digital currencies are not allowed to be used as a method of payment domestically.Despite this, Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown acceptance of alternative currencies saying in an 2021 interview that cryptocurrency, “has the right to exist and can be used as a means of payment”.Source: https://www.bitrawr.com/russiaI am not sure if this is an old or outdated article but yeah maybe dex will be your next choice if things goes wrong with cex.",

So rather than recommending a CEX to such a person, I believe recommending a DEX would be a lot more appropriate and less risky for them.",

I think on that board there might be those members also who might want to sell out their Bitcoin for Rubble, and in that case the user doesn't need to go anywhere else to find for the service because he might get a local guy from that board who may agree to sell him and his friend Bitcoin in exchange of Rubble.",

I like the fact that crypto is on a decentralized network that one can easily get without having to go through any financial institution like the banks to purchase. Even with the limited nature of using BTC or cryptocurrencies in Russia, the Binance P2p sure delivers as well and is an efficient and less stressful way to own some without even the government knowing about it.",

Banned due to verification. But any way you can go there and ask him in his native language, he will guide you. Beside that, if you have problems with or any restrictions on centralized exchange then it will be better for you to use DEX, i.e., decentralized exchange.",

And removing RUB from P2P trading is not a big deal, people can use the RUB/USDT pair and then BTC/USDT to buy bitcoin.If I were a newbie like the OP, I would consider using a centralized exchange instead of direct P2P, because there are a lot of scams and it is difficult to differentiate between real and scam. As a newbie, I can't make a profit yet so I don't want to lose money. Choosing top centralized exchanges is still safer.",

Everyone always talks about KYC, centralization...but has anyone been arrested or sent to jail by the police? Especially a country that does not ban bitcoin like Russia. One more thing, for people like us with an investment of only a few thousand dollars, is that amount of money too big for the government to pay attention to us?",
