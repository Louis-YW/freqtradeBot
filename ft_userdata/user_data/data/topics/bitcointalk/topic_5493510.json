That's great and just enjoy this halving because it will be historical not just for the entire Bitcoin community but also for yourself.

Good for you, 9 blocks away, prices is $64,100 so everything is good, unlike the last time that we have the pandemic in the background, the lockdown and all that uncertainty. But as compare to this time, there is war but hopefully it wouldn't affect the market.So basically just sit back and relax and experience your first Bitcoin Halving.And see how everything will transpired in the next couple of months. It will not be instant effect as others might thought and the price will not suddenly jump to $100,000. It might take sometime. Good gauge is too see the price at the end of the year.",

Don't say that fiat is a scam though if you're still in some form, still relying on it for your daily needs, you don't want to be saying that if you're still using fiat because that would sound like a hypocrite to those that aren't on your wavelength though, you're definitely going to tone down the hate. You're not into bitcoin investment to be a hater of fiat, you're here to gain your financial freedom and share that knowledge with other people that you'll meet in real life.",

Seriously can we say that fiat is a total scam, I dont think so because aside from the over control and inflation that have eaten deep interest the centralised bank system has, this is what make it sound as if the system is a total scam but all the same we have to point out the most relevant and important connection between the digital currency and the centralised financial currency like fiat.To some of us we may have not witnessed any bitcoin halving cycle before but also we have read alot about it and we have good understanding of what to expect at the end of the day with the coming halving and how it will react with the price of bitcoin.",

Be careful on what you are saying, its not that fiat money is a scam, you still need fiat money for your daily lives, simply put that bitcoin is more efficient and more powerful than any fiat money, anyway congrats on your first jalving even, this is my second time witnessing it and I'm also excited on what's gonna happen during and after the halving event, well like we all want we want that bitcoin would increase more in coming days so that we could or bitcoin could set another ATH or record and it will ring a bell to a large number of citizen and might be attracted to invest in bitcoin too, if that happens then we can expect that bitcoin will be more powerfel and set another step towards its adaptation or accept more in more countries. And I hope that happens. Bitcoin being more widely used or adopted means eventually it will be used worldwide in mainstream.",

We get to used fiat money for our needs and there's something out of it but the ones that produces it and makes value out of it is the government. Because with the continuous printing of them, the value of it gets lower and they're the ones that creates and influences the inflation rate of it. However, government or fiat money, they're all centralized and things that are happening to the economies have been centralized and they have control over it. And one thing that they can't, Bitcoin and its continuous growth of it, they have no authority over it.",

This means that public awareness has started and is growing, but don't be too excited, OP everything is still in the process of traveling because prices can change quickly, especially if bad news enters the market again so that it gives birth to negative market sentiment, what needs to be done is to buy Bitcoin before the halving.Quote from: kalagangs on April 19, 2024, 09:37:06 PMand I'm so fucking happy that I learned about BTC and how FIAT money is basically a fucking scam in the past year.

Seeing as this bitcoin halving happens in the first halving of your life, I also say this bitcoin halving is the first halving of my life. But we are celebrating this bitcoin halving very nicely but the most important thing here is that the mempool has increased exponentially with the bitcoin halving. Here I think one of the reasons for mempool growth is the high growth of buying bitcoins in the market. Because the mempool will not grow much if the transactions are not high. But at the moment I am not buying bitcoins because I have already bought some bitcoins and use DCA technology to continuously increase my investment. I hope to enjoy the bull market very nicely.
