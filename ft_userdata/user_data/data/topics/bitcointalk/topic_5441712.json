      "body": "Growing your money and wanting to become rich are very similar. Investments are made with an eye on profits, or returns. So, in essence, Bitcoin holders want to see the fiat value of their Bitcoins grow overtime, when this happens, the amount of investors grow and when the fiat value drops, so does the number of investors.Quote from: Y3shot on March 01, 2023, 02:08:23 PMThe reason in investing bitcoin should be just to level up financially, grow your money and get a better return of it. Beginners should not mistake bitcoin as to grow money and for making money(becoming rich).Your reason for investing may not be mine.I want freedom from the fiat inflation trap and want to be my own bank, independent of any third party.

If you ask most beginners what is their reason they choose to invest bitcoin all what you will understand from their reason is just want to make in different versions. Beginners should learn to know bitcoin is not a reason or a way to become rich .Most of the reasons for beginners and those who jump in to make investments give the same reasons even though the words are different. But basically having the principle of getting the target you want is like targeting buying a dream car, a house that is planned for the future of course this is the next action that of course needs to be done, even though it is targeting investment, and the real aspects we need to understand when starting and this according to my perspective, of course we need to be successful in analyzing all areas of Bitcoin Investment, especially the basic keys to investment and also success in investing, even if it starts with a relatively low nominal.Quote from: Y3shot on March 01, 2023, 02:08:23 PMThe reason in investing bitcoin should be just to level up financially, grow your money and get a better return of it.

This tends to be more about the profits and success that we get from investing while we are in the world of Crypto Investment (Bitcoin), and apart from that I think a lot of knowledge is obtained when we invest, one of which is the advantages and thoughts that tend to be positive from Bitcoin, so because it has a good target in investing in Bitcoin, because everyone has different principles and their own goals, but it is too early to expect to get rich in a short time is an inappropriate perspective for beginners and other investments.",

I try to understand you quite okay but there is one thing we must not forget, people have priorities, needs and wants. Some people came in with the mindset to make money and enriched their profile status and to some extent is working for them but as you said reason for bitcoin is to level up your financial, to help grow your money so people believe to have stream of income that can afford them some luxury lifestyle but of a truth going into bitcoin with such mind as beginner may ends you failed the real nature of bitcoin money.

It has nothing wrong.After that, most of them fail to control themselves as investors to become traders, they have to make transactions to exchanges, deposit, withdrawal and they have to use Bitcoin wallets more. Being exposed with news, fuds, they will take care more of their bitcoins by considering to use self custody wallets.I think those steps are very natural and organic so it's good in general.",

Basically, the idea is that you buy some Bitcoin and hold onto it for a while, hoping that its value will increase and you can sell it for a profit. However, it's important to remember that its value can go up and down quickly, and there's no guarantee that it will continue to go up in the future. Overall, while some people have made money by investing in Bitcoin, it's not a guaranteed way to grow your money. So, if you're interested in investing, it's a good idea to do your research, understand the risks involved, and to consider other options as well.",

Then a couple of lines later you contradict yourself. I have no problem with people investing in bitcoin solely for the profits. Making money can be a good motivation, it depends on how one goes about it. The disadvantage of having that mentality is those people tend to move towards shitty projects and scams. But as long as you are consistently building your bitcoin portfolio, there is no way you can be at the short end of the stick. From my observation, many people are more concerned about hodling their bitcoins long term than actually using bitcoins as a payment option for regular stuff.",
