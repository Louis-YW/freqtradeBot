What did you do or will you do in order to ensure your finanical stability despite all unfavorable circumstances ? Well, it is not easy to get financial stability, especially during the current economic crisis caused by the pandemic and war. I have never felt financially stable even though my income is increasing year by year. Currently, I have just worked 2 jobs and added investment, but to be honest, I have never found myself having a stable income before.",

It's always a good thing to have a side job considering the bleak global economy especially in IT industries which had been experiencing massive job cut, alternatively trading crypto or forex is a good side hustling to compliment a full time job, however combining the two will take a lot of time, investing in cryptos especially during bearish run is also a good alternative though it is better for a long term perspective which can guarantee a reasonable profit, setting up a business also requires a lot of time to monitor and flourish it, thus it is advisable to also have a plan B when working full time.",

Those poor country only pay for $50/month for a job that need to work from 8AM to 5PM.Side job or business do make money, make money = improve financial.

A side job or business seems like more necessary than ever, which can minimize the risks of losing your current job, ending up pennyless. A side job is also a job and in economic instability it will also face the same problems that your main job faced. Now the problem here is that humans love to remain in a status quo and not get out of that safety pocket. In times of bad things, newer opportunities come up, we might be foolish enough to brush them aside and not start getting involved in them. This is where we go wrong and end up collapsing with our original hustle.QuoteHowever, a side job/business also takes time and efforts and can never be attained whenever we need it.

Business and cut all your expenses to the minimum level is my long time strategy when I’m preparing for recession. I never rely on my main job because there’s always a possibility that my company will be close in the future. I’m currently have a bond contract to my company which locks from resigning because they need me but still I’m thinking to never rely solely on my job which is why I start my own business using my knowledge that I’m using to my current company. To make it short. I’m still working and managing my own business at the same time with the help of my wife. We have already a stable income which is x2 to x4 of my salary. My target is to save money as much as possible that can withstand a recession for 4 years or more. We are now have an organic backyard that is good source of vegetables and fruits to cover some of our meals for free. Changing the way we leave and not relying on other people business will give you self confidence since you are the one in control to your life fate.",

What did you do or will you do in order to ensure your finanical stability despite all unfavorable circumstances ? It comes down to the individual really and how much work they are willing to tolerate. Some people are happiest to go through life just doing 40 hours a week or lower, they pay their bills and accumulate a pension. Hopefully paying off the mortgage by the time they retire and managing their money frugally from that point. Other people try to hustle up extra income every day to make themselves better off financially, hopefully putting that extra money to work instead of leaving it to languish. However there is a fine line to walk when it comes to health, if you're doing 12 hour days for 6 days a week then you can burn yourself out which might be more detrimental to your health in the long run.",

      "body": "I know that there are different assessments and situations. Case 1: a person has 1 stable job, the source of income. This is considered healthy, standard, and secure, but I don't ever see myself doing that because I feel like there's too much dependence on one particular workspace and employer and because that limits the activities you're doing, unless this one job is very creative, or you have one major area in life in which you want to succeed. Case 2: a person has several jobs / does freelance, there are multiple sources of income and no central one. I know that sociologists are studying this as a negative phenomenon because allegedly not having a stable job, a fixed long-term employment contract, makes a person's life precarious, worrisome. To me, however, this seems to be a normal and stable situation, as it means that you'll be okay to lose one of the sources and look for another one because it's not everything, you don't depend on any particular employer, you get to do a variety of things in different settings, and you're not likely to lose all your income at once because it's diversified. Case 3: you have a stable job and a side job. If the stable one is full-time, I think it's too big of a load for one person. Also, having a side job does give you more flexibility, but losing the main source of income is still highly undesirable in this scenario. I think this case likely means that a person isn't making enough money with one job and is forced by circumstances to supplement it with something else. Or has a small thing that the person really likes but which isn't bringing enough money and a proper job to make ends meet. Both situations aren't ideal.",

Don't understimate the effect of side hustles and businesses. When your side hustle makes more than your stable job then you're doing good and a day might come that you'll be able to decide to just quit your job and focus on your side hustle and make it full time because the potential is higher.
