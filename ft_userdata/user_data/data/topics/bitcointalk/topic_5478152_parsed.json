I also think POS is far less secure than POW, and POS greatly weakens decentralization, which is the core feature of the blockchain. And I don’t think energy consumption and carbon emissions will be a big problem. But what I care about is actually the network maintenance costs caused by energy consumption. In other words, the purpose of reducing energy consumption is not to protect the environment, but to reduce network maintenance costs.Because in the long run, energy costs will account for the majority of mining costs, and only when the benefits are greater than the costs will the miners work and the network will be safe. As the block reward is halved, if the price remains unchanged, the miners' income will also be halved. At this time, some mining machines may have to shut down. Bitcoin is unlikely to experience a price surge after every halving. Once the block reward reaches a certain level, it may pose a threat to the security of the entire network. To avoid this, we might have to set a minimum block reward for miners, like Monero does, but I don't think that solves the problem.What I want to ask is, is there a way for us to continue to use POW and reduce energy consumption without reducing the hash rate ?",

In fact, just like you, I don’t think the energy consumption and carbon emissions of mining itself will be a problem.But we cannot ignore the cost of energy consumption, and this cost needs to be paid by every Bitcoin holder.Of course, we can think of mining as an investment behavior that requires income and returns. Considering the risks brought by price fluctuations and the increase in the hash rate of the entire network, the annualized return of mining should be higher than other lower-risk activities. invest.The cost of miners mainly includes equipment and electricity costs. Equipment investment, electricity costs, and miner profits are ultimately paid by Bitcoin holders and potential holders. There is no doubt that electricity bills will eventually become the most significant cost of running the entire network. If we can reduce this cost, fewer miners will shut down after the block reward is halved, and the entire network will be more secure.",

The very definition of electric current, without which mining is impossible, implies the release of thermal energy. From own example, we know that we have gone from miniature USB block eruptors and VGA to “monstrous” ASICs. First there was scaling (increasing the number of transaction processing devices), and then combining the set into one device and reducing its size. Of course, we are faced with an increase in electrical energy and an increase in heat generation.If we change the BTC algorithm, we can process transactions even on calculators and smart watches, but then we will face a threat to the existence of the blockchain itself. What is important is the speed of transaction processing (and of course decentralization), and not just the fact that such processing is possible.",

Such as storage devices?Why do you think the matter consumption is a lesser problem than the energy consumption, afraid of Universe's thermal death?The problem is not the energy consumption itself, but rather the higher cost of maintaining the hash rate that comes with energy consumption. Based on the principles of mining competition and economics, the cost of acquiring mining machines cannot be reduced. In fact, it will be affected by the mining returns.The question is how much it costs to maintain the hash rate, which ultimately counts towards the cost of maintaining the blockchain network. For an efficient blockchain network, this cost should be reduced as much as possible.If we can reduce energy consumption, we can reduce the cost of maintaining the hash rate, which reduces the cost of running the blockchain. Although purchasing storage equipment may be as expensive as purchasing ASIC miner, the cost of keeping the storage equipment running is much lower than the cost of keeping the ASIC miner powered on. Due to the decrease in energy costs, mining machines will not have to shut down due to a drop in coin prices. And this could prevent the hash rate from declining.",

Having this kind of technology, it would decrease the power consumption hence lessening the cost of operation for maintaining the hash rate. This is one way that I could think of to reduce the energy consumption of devices. Adding renewable energy resources could help as well. Are there hybrid talks with PoW with PoS already?

I get that it might be using some, but it is something that can be turned into solar in a single day, you can literally put solar panels into every mining company and just fix it all together, all self sufficient. Go check out aviation, how are you going to fix that? Tell me about that, are you going to make electric planes? Cause that's possible and yet nobody is ever even attempting it. Hell the whole electric vehicle god Elon still uses fire, like a caveman.I think it is quite obvious that there are much larger issues with energy consumption, specifically about oil and gas, those need to get down a lot, and if not then looking at bitcoin for a solution is not it, we are not going to have that at all, we are not going to just get rid of bitcoin miners and suddenly the world has enough energy, it is just not true at all.",

The most unfortunate problem that POW mining has, is that the mining equipment is based on electrical components that have relatively high electrical resistance. The good news is that we discover new technologies and new science everyday. Superconductor technologies are being heavily researched right now and that means we might see efficient, very low energy miners soon. Unfortunately that scientific progress takes time, as it is a gradual but rather slow process.If you were to look at old computers for example, you would see that not even a few years ago, the electricity they required was absurdly high, compared to modern computers. Modern desktop computers use less than half the wattage of a computer from the year 2000. And I cannot even imagine the costs of mining on an old computer with outdated technology.",
