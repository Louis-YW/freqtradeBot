Because if you are talking about the current situation of this project, I was not sure where you get that price instead you will be wondering as well why it goes like this. Well, XRP is quite popular yes and in fact, there is a time that it become the #2 standing in the market but guess what, it never has the chance to get bullish compared to other projects like meme coins. Instead, you will still see it low despite the popularity they have.",

      "body": "XRP is considered a promising cryptocurrency. In my opinion, its supply doesn't matter as much as the project itself. The strength of a coin's growth is attributed to its community, and XRP has a very robust supporting community. There are several projects with high supplies that still have a good value. During the previous bull market, XRP showed strong performance. However, since then, we've entered a bear market, and most altcoins have hit their lowest points. Additionally, XRP is dealing with ongoing issues with the SEC, although it has received some relief. I'm hopeful that XRP will perform well in the next bull market. Currently, the value of XRP stands at approximately 50 cents per coin, and it's worth mentioning its all-time high (ATH) price in your post.",

But in terms of price,  Ripple have not don so well in recent time,  and the coin have been unable to make a good recovery since its last dump so for that at the moment I don't consider Ripple as a good project to invest but in terms of popularity,  ripe is popular.",

There were very few coins when Ripple came to existence and being a centralized coin, it's transactions were fast and it's promises were high. A large number of supply means cheaper in price which made it accessible to large number of people. Some just compared its price with the like of bitcoin and Ethereum without knowing the technicalities. Overall, Ripple had a benefits of being one of the earlier coin and a lot of people are invested in it. So, even though it comes with large obstacles and hindrances, it's demise is not that quick.",

You see Ripple Company partner with financial institutions so that tells you they have the capacity.I think it was also during these times that people started to move on from the basic metrics in choosing a coin to invest like scarcity and decentralization. If you need a more recent proof of this then you can also check what happened to Shiba Inu.Just to add that coins with no supply cap like ETH and Doge also pumped.",

In general, the way it creates its current position as well as its potential over time, if this market gets stronger, it will gain strength again, after all, it is one of the coins with many support issues support and oppose.For me right now, it is no longer a priority for holding, although I still acknowledge its potential in the field.

I don't know what makes it special but still, many people keep holding and waiting for its bullish prices. I'm not sure but for me, I'd never see XRP as a profitable investment because I've tried accumulating some, but unfortunately, never see huge changes on my wallet as it was almost the same at the time I bought it.

Its protocol can settle transactions in seconds, and its way more energy-efficient than Bitcoin. The financial industry noticed, and that drove demand through the roof.The question isnt how did Ripple achieve such a price with its supply; the question is, why wouldnt it? When you're tackling multi-trillion dollar problems like cross-border transactions, even a high supply can be dwarfed by higher demand. So, its not about the supply numbers you're hung up on; its about the scale of the problems Ripple is solving. Forget the surface-level supply stats; focus on whats driving the demand.",

It had quite low marketcap, and it grew like with few old coins during the altcoin season.But why would a coin like this have as big of a marketcap? I remember the ico of xrp, i had even set up an account to buy it, but that was way before i understood how marketcap works and i was talked out of it because of the \"big supply\". Also it didn't seem to fit in the cryptocurrency ethos. It was more like a corporate coin, centralized and frown upon.However people who saw regulators coming, saw institutional investors coming were betting on possible regulatory friendly coins with a simple purpose.And at the time, that purpose was that it was very liquid with cheaper transactions then other coins. And those features were needed when people send high amount of money between exchanges. Litecoin was cheap too and liquid too, but it wasn't fast and sending money fast was very much in need. These days i am not even sure what's the point of it. But it has huge userbase so it doesn't even need other reason to exist. I am sure they have still something in their roadmap worth investing into. But i still won't put my money into it.",
