The highest price you see now might be the least you experience in the next 6 months so buying now is the best answer to your question, even at the bull run buying and accumulating more will never make you regret as long as you give your investment some time arrive at its destination.",

But if you're longing to ETH then it sure is the right time to buy it. Consider how long you are going to hold on it. If that's going to be until 2025 then there is a bigger chance that the price might be higher from the current. I am not giving that guarantee and it is not a financial advice. You invest based on what you think about Ethereum but it's known that it's the 2nd top choice of the majority of the investors and with the news about BlackRock applying for an Ethereum ETF, so the chances are there.",

The answer is a big YES but it would have been better if you inquired on that  month ago but don't despair since this is still open for you...who knows by 2024 ETH can go beyond its last ATH which was $4,878.26 that happened on Nov 10, 2021. See...the opportunity is right now smiling all upon us that BlackRock has already filed ETH for Ethereum. But then again, crypto means high rewards and high risks so be careful in navigating the water so you won't drowned.",

What is your opinion?There are really many factors to consider before deciding, and there are also many factors that can influence its course in the market. I know the feeling when attention is given to a coin that we are interested in, and we closely monitor it, especially when significant growth is being discussed. However, let's not forget that it is still volatile, and it can fluctuate in no time. If you are going to decide, it should be based on your own research and how you assess it, not because of someone else's prediction, as that is just their analysis or opinion about the current trend.In my personal view, I also consider ETH for the long term. Aside from being the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and having a strong network of developers and users, it is also the platform of choice for DApps in traditional industries such as finance and gaming, which is why I see its potential. There's also a major upgrade called Merge that could further increase adoption and prices. However, the risk of potential setbacks remains, such as a major crash due to the competition it faces from Solana and Polkadot.",

The right time to buy any coin is not when is getting its hype. Rather, is best to get a token when is still neutral.This means you want to FOMO and when you do that, you might end up buying the high and you will be the person getting liquidated in the long run. Well for me, what I did when I saw this news was to set eth to the price range I will be selling it at with my dual investment because I know there will be much volatility",

I think I provided valid points and still stand by them, the switch from PoW to PoS and increasing the staking amount doesn't look good for the future of Ethereum itself so we never know how the future of Ethereum will turn out to be, and why we can't compare the Ethereum with Bitcoin and other coin is because there are a lot of competitors for Ethereum whereas for bitcoin there is none and there will never be so personally I feel the future of Ethereum is uncertain but investing always comes with risk so its everyone's choice to decide what they choose to invest.",

If you are looking for some quick profit then i think you are late and there can be a correction in the market because there isn't any strong reason for this rally. This is just a hyped-out rally by the market due to blackrock ETF news. But if you are a long term holder and targeting the next bull run then i can say you are later here too but there is still time. ETH was below 1600$ for a long time and I think ETH below 1600$ is a good deal. I brought few ETH below that level and wanted another possible correction to buy more on the line.",

Just because there is another application from Blackrock doesn't mean that it's not going to fall a bit. Remember that whenever we see some skyrocket, what's next? The dumping scene and that's very likely after all of these moments that we've seen on the market.The dump is about to come or more likely that it's going to be a correction. So before you buy, make sure that you're already decided and DCA as well. Buy with a few for now if you think that $2k is quite high for its price and just be ready when it dumps or it pumps.As long as you've got some budget ready to purchase, that's what you should think of. If you're discouraged then just watch it grow or correct.",
