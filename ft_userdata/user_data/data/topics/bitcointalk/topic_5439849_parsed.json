      "body": "Tron token transcation fee requires Energy and Bandwidth Points. Energy consumption depends on the smart contract of the token itself, if it is widely used, the required energy increases. On other hand, Bandwidth Points are given free daily for some amount and might increase if you stake TRXs. If your current Bandwidth Points daily are fully consumed, another TRX requires to be spent for the transaction, though it will be burned. So, it seems you have already emptied out your current BP, thus it requires more TRX for transactions.For further detailed explanation of how the TRX fee works, refer to below links:https://developers.tron.network/docs/resource-model#bandwidthhttps://developers.tron.network/docs/resource-model#energy",

Yes Tron could be the cheapest for people who are long on Tron but most likely not ideal for one-time or not so frequent users. It's probably cheaper to send via centralized platforms than using a non-custodial wallet.Maybe just eat that $1 - $2 fee if you are just moving funds and not planning to hold TRX for long-term.",

Just one solution maybe leave with all Tron network because they have increasing up fees withdrawal and actually will adopt by all cex decentralize exchange market, long time not use tron network and usually I deposit on each trustwallet transaction fees until cheap under $0.1 and different with transaction fees right now.",

Use TronLink, block some TRX and then commissions will be much cheaper for you.",
