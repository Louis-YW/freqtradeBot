I recently finished my first NFT collection its all new my twitter account has just 20 followers, but since i started listing my NFTs to opensea and added a post with explains about the added value of my NFT collection i instantly start getting rows of promo offers from diffrent Twitter NFT influencers. I checked the profiles but they seem more like professional promoters than scammers, but still i dont know what to think about it. they have between 100k and 1 million followers and the accounts are from 2009-2019 so they are doing this for quite a while. Since these people follow me, my impressions rised from 6 to 80 in more ore less 2 days so...what am i dealing with here right now? should i take them serious ore better just ignore them ?",

      "body": "The internet is full of business people these days, especially on social media platforms, and everyone wants to earn from whatever they can grab their hands on. These days, we never really can tell who is who on social media. There are lots of influencers in different fields, and it's not just on Twitter. Once you post any art work on Instagram, you will get almost an immediate reply from some kind of promoter who will want to offer you an effort to promote your art work on their page, which has more subscribers than you do. Now that both subscribers and followers can be bought from some online traffic and follower sellers, we just can't trust anyone.My advice is to do your own proper research on those offering you help. If I may ask, what kind of offer are they making to you? Is it to promote your NFT for you to get quick buyers, or is it for you to hand it over to them for them to help you sell it? Depending on the approach at which they write you, sometimes it might be easier to identify their real intention.No matter what offer they make to you, please don't grant anyone on the internet access to your NFT, which means either sending it to them or sharing the key with them. Don't ever make such a mistake.",

Professional promoters and influencers don't go desperately lurking in people's DMsMost of those huge accounts with huge followings just have bots as followers. The trick they use is to make fake giveaways, but in order for one to be eligible for the giveaway, they must follow the account and retweet the posts. So over time the following grows to 100K, with some people using their alt accounts to follow in hope of winning the giveaways.Save your money.",

There are accounts with a huge number of followers, but this does not guarantee influence.The only ones who have real influence are public figures but I think they are too expensive for needs like yours.you should actually activate all social media channels, not just Twitter. I think that YouTube and Tiktok currently have a slightly stronger influence than Twitter.",

You see them as being legit and professional at what they do. But be rest assured that no legit person will ask you of your wallet balance, Private keys or recovery phrases before dealing with you. Once the conversation is heading that way, that makes the person a scammer. Scammers also look professional at what they claim to do. That why they keep having victims to scam.",

I used to think this way until I saw an advert in this forum where a member promised to raise the followers of any social account if they pay a certain amount. Which means followership can be manipulated. How long the influencer has been in business can be a good indicator but you should also be careful because his account might be hacked or cloned to carry out a fraudulent act. Also, the influencer might have compromised his integrity. There are genuine and reliable influencers that can help your business to grow but you just have to be careful in you dealing with these social media business people. And don't give them money or your product without verifying every bit of the business proposal and transactions.",

Also, you can utilize SEO to drive organic traffic to your website or your Opensea Profile. I'm wondering why don't you want to use social media. Using it doesn't mean that you should hire influencers. You can do it for free. However, that'll be a slow process of getting potential buyers. I believe the crux of the matter is whether you would prefer to invest more money in marketing your products (NFT Collections) or handle all the marketing efforts yourself.",
