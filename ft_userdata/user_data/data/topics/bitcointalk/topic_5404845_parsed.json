Maybe that's simply an unviable idea.",

Why do you needÂ  a new one for that? have you used the bitcoin lightning network before? i meant if you must also aware about the reality if it myst be gone through BIP and it's not any BIP can pass the vote to be implemented to the bitcoin network. Try to use lightning network and you will think if bitcoin is also in another level as well. The fees was also cheap and so fast like what already done by altcoins.",

But then again, did they succeed or not? Right no one did, BSV, BCH are all dead and it shows that bitcoin will stood the test of time no matter what argument they have against it. As for the fees, way back in 2017 it was really high, but then there was Segwit and then LN.",

LN improves transaction speed and fees, and that is great. However it doesn't not solve the core issue of scalability, only diminishes it. The causes are all still there.",

Lightning network have been founded 4-5 years ago and now there's many service already want to use it, LN is the way to solve the scalability in Bitcoin.Now you want to run Bitcoin on different chain? that's a fork and not the real Bitcoin, similar like Bitcoin BEP20 who run in Binance chain.",

Haven't heard any of it spreading around at the bitcoin technical support or the development discussion board. Not even on the mailing list or Github as far as I am concerned.If you really think it is viable and give the Bitcoin community and network a greater good, as a start, why don't you give it a shot rather than babbling right here?",

I didn't read the entire article as I don't have much time right now but at the first lines it seemed to suggest that Open Source means free work. It doesn't. Anyway scalability is already so discussed that this seems just another thread about it. If people have ideas, knowledge and skills, just put up a BIP to review! That's all.",
