Listed casinos can be seen on this page [1].Well, about the actual reviews and score system, i wonder if there is a transparency chart that can be seen, example of why you gave a 7 \"score\" for the \"trust level\" to a certain casino, why not 8 or 9? And to other criteria too.Edit: Okay I just found out the rating/score system[2]. [1] https://cryptogamble.tips/casino/[2] https://cryptogamble.tips/how-we-rate/",

      "body": "Thank you guys for your feedback, for me, it's very important. I will have a look at how we can make that easier to understand when it comes to finding all the crypto casinos reviewed. We are constantly looking for new crypto casinos to review. However, you might not find all of them as some get rejected because either is too much of a copy of other casinos (I agree a lot on the post here about copycats) or else because we think they won't bring any advantage or innovation for the players. Thank you @PX-Z for pointing that out. When I started the website I thought the same thing as you... how can a casino get x amount of stars or why a certain rating? Therefore the team came up with an easy and transparent way that we use to rate casinos. That rating system is public and anyone can check. However, we are still updating all the ratings as some casino reviews still need an update.Â  @Hunnyfinance we are still working on a sister brand, we will start advertising it when we finish. and thank you for joining the streams. My schedule for the stream is from Monday to Friday at 12.30 pm Italian Time feel free to join. I do random giveaways during the stream (today for example we are giving away 50$)",

The style and font of CryptoGamble logo is as same as GTA vice city logo.@theroyalgambler, I just checked the different pages and reviews of different casinos on your site. You have reviewed a lot of casinos, the website is well furnished as well. There is also a dedicated page for Blacklisted Casinos, but it contains only 3 casinos name. I liked one thing on the review page, you have given 'Recommended' tag on reputable casinos and 'New Casino' tag on some casinos. But you should update the 'New Casino' tag for some casinos as those have become old now.BTW, why the review of LuckyFish.io is still available on Cryptogamble.tips? LuckyFish has discontinued their services almost one year ago.",

      "body": "1. First of all, thank you, seoincorporation, Mahdirakib, and Slow death, for taking the time to check out the website and asking valuable questions. All of the questions asked of these mentioned are the same ones we ask ourselves.2. If you want us to review any casino, please mention it in the thread - we look for new ones to add, plus we receive requests from casinos themselves.3. Regarding the Tags (new casinos and recommended), we are having an ongoing revamp of all the casino reviews, which will help us remove and update the tags, depending on the needs. Luckyfish is still there, as we kept the review for some time and then changed the tag to ''casino closed''. We kept it all this time because there was a possibility of them returning, but that never happened. 4. And, yes, you are right! The team was inspired by the GTA vice city. We wanted to differentiate ourselves by having a unique design, and GTA Vice City was a way to go since we are fans of the game. Also, it helped us get more recognition and brand awareness.5. All the casinos reviewed were analyzed by me. I have taken a look at the scam accusation and kept that in consideration when checking and doing an objective review. Ultimately, we serve the players and will continue to point out both flaws and the virtues of the crypto casinos we review. Additionally, to further prove the authenticity of the casino service checking, we have started a Twitch account, where the players get to participate in the casino's experience through our stream. The information we gather there ends up on the said casino's review page.6. At the moment, we are not looking to create something we cannot offer and that includes the dispute section. When we will have a bigger team we will reconsider this option.",

Just like on what you are seeing on guide or review sites which they are giving out their affiliate links or site url directly.This one do really just maintain or focus on bonus which is really great but majority of gamblers in the market that when it comes to bonuses and promotions, then its not something that you could really be that interested because of its terms and conditions.This is why its not really that much an interesting thing for most but its not really that a bad thing to have that kind of listing because there are some who are really thattoo lazy on activating bonuses because you do still need to search for it.Some do even think that it was automatic.",

The designs are fine for me and in case you did not know, there is an option to change the theme in to dark. Just click on the orange circle button beside the search bar. I know its colour pink and will look girly to some guys but if you have played vice city game before, you will easily know that this site was inspired by it.There is no sign up button because this wasn't a casino but it was a review site. If you mean sign up button for the sites that they showcase, just click on the claim bonus and you will be redirected to that site. Before I forgot, id also like to welcome the OP. There were not many review sites in the forum so you can still be known here as long your reviews are honest.",

I cannot say if I have known another review site that has another service on their site like tips, list of strategy or something related to gambling.",
