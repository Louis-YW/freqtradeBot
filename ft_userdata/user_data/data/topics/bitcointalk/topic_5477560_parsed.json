  "content": "I believe in the power of Jesus Christ, the Son of God to save and help people in all their circumstances. I also have an eye on the reward that He gives to those who believe in Him. Now assume that you've been promised $1 million for every hour of prayer. How many hours will you pray? Jesus, our God has promised a reward far more that $1 million for every hour of prayer that we His followers pray, so my eyes are on that reward when I die. This is why I'll pray for everyone that makes a request...tonight.Unfortunately, I've not been praying enough in recent times and would love to boost my commitment to pray by praying for any member irrespective of their needs and conditions. I belive that God can send His angels to help everyone through the power of prayer. I believe because I know it is true. The situation is simple: you help me pray more by stating your prayer request, I draw nearer to God, our needs are met.Do you believe in the supernatural? State your prayer request. If you're a Christian, be sure that you have told God about that need on a personal level before posting it here. If you're not a Christian, you may post your request, however, I'll also be praying for you that you see the glorious light of the gospel of Jesus Christ and follow the 'drum.'Without much ado, let's start. All requests will be attended to.Note: NEVER send me money for prayer. All the money on earth can't even buy it. As a preventive measure, Ive deleted my addresses on this forum.",

If you already want to do good deeds, then you can pray for all those who suffer in any way, and they are all over the world.It is even better if you start doing good deeds along with prayers, because words are just words and will not feed the hungry or heal the sick.",
