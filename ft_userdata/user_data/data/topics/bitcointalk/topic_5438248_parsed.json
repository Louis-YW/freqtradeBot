      "body": "Right information dissemination is the key and not promoting other crappy cryptocurrencies or altcoins.  If you talk about Bitcoin and mention an altcoin and give emphasis on it, isn't it misleading?  You are defrauding people who are interested on Bitcoin but instead of explaining and giving links to information about Bitcoin, you give a hint that directs people to an altcoin.  That is bad playing IMO.Quote from: mk4 on February 05, 2023, 05:12:01 PMSo.. what \"tools\" did that person actually gave you?I wouldn't suggest Googling \"evergreen crypto information\" though, because it led me to some links towards some shitcoin called \"Evergreen token\".I also tried googling it but it gives an Evergreencoin that claims to be a descendant of Bitcoin and now is running with POE, Proof of Environment.  I don't know how it works though and I have no intention of discussing it here.",
