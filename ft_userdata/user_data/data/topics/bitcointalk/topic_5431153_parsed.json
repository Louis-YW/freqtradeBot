      "body": "Try pyypl virtual MasterCard (pyypl.com). It seems to be available to non-EU residents, as there is a list of various countries when one is registering. The service is not yet popular, so am not vouching for them, I am just sharing what I experienced with them, DYOR.I managed to top up the account using Binance pay. Registration and KYC (very basic) was all done online. Though it was just a small amount for testing if the service works. I was able to purchase a few small items on AliExpress using the virtual card.I don't think they support Samsung Pay yet but if you are into crypto, the Binance pay should be good",

I have used their card to top up my google play account, and I have purchased a google play console with this card too. Very easy process for registering and loading the card, also I recharge the card with binance pay, but there are other ways to load the card with crypto, and also there is a way to reload via bank too.",

Even here things that work in the US will not work in Canada.Some cards are just so local that they are not discussed here much. A great option may be specific to say New Zealand, which although good if you happen to live there means absolutely nothing for the rest of the world, other then the oh, what a good option for people who live there.-Dave",

      "body": "Hey!Try the FCF  Pay prepaid virtual cards. We offer Visa and Mastercard. https://fcfpay.com/prepaid-crypto-debit-cards/Our fees are 6 USD + 3.5% to issue the cards. The payment is made through our own payment gateway and can be done in ~20 stable coins on different chains + SHIB.To refill the cards, the fees are 3 USD + 3.5%.Monthly fee is 1.75 USD taken from the card at the end of the month. If the card falls below 1.75 USD balance at that time, it will be deactivated.But if you create or refill the cards from your FCF Pay balance, you will get a discount (at the moment it's 0.75%, but we may increase it to 1%).The cards are virtual USD cards, similar to prepaid gift cards, but they are tokenizable (they can be added to Apple/Google/Samsung Pay) by using a US/Canada number. YOu could get a virtual number on https://sms4sats.com/ . It may take 10-15 minutes to receive the SMS.",

      "body": "Virtual debit cards are becoming more popular and can be used online or over the phone. Then, also have some great security benefits too, which is always a plus.I think, as for banking services through online registration, it's definitely possible. With the rise of online banking, many banks now offer online registration for their services. It's a great way to manage your finances from the comfort of your own home.I suggest reaching out to some online forums or communities to see if anyone has had experience with a reputable service for non-EEA residents. And of course, always be cautious when sharing personal information online. Unfortunately, I don't have any personal experience with this service, so I can't vouch for its reliability. In terms of banking services through online registration only, there are some options for online-only banks that offer virtual debit cards, but again, I don't have any personal experience with them.",

      "body": "Probably, one of the reasons why crypto loadable cards are available only for EU residents is due to the strict regulations and compliance requirements in different regions. However, it's worth checking out some alternatives such as prepaid debit card providers that offer virtual cards for non-EEA residents.Generally, online banking services have made it easier to open bank accounts and access financial services without physically visiting a bank. So, possible to avail banking services through online registration only, but this would depend on the specific requirements of the bank or financial institution.",
