  "content": "Discussing with other merit sources, I came to the conclusion I had to modify a little bit the way I deplete my merit source allocation: I need to help more newbies grow in rank to make more valuable contributors stay longer in the forum. Act more responsibly with my merit allocation, distributing it more efficiently and effectivelyFind a new contributor where I can learn something new. I then decided to open this thread, where any user, respecting the following rules, can submit an undermerited post.Rules of the thread:Rules for applying to get a post merited:Any rank that has less than 1000 merits.I consider both original topics and individual posts that you leave in various forum topics. Don‚Äôt submit posts that have already gotten more than two merits. If a post has already gotten 2 merits or more, I would simply skip it.Each user can submit 5 posts at a maximum per entry.Each user can submit one entry every two weeks.You cannot submit a new entry until I have reviewed your last one. Each user can submit up to 7 entries.No third party submitting. The author must report every post.I consider posts that are a maximum of 120 days old. No dead horse beating. Do not repost the application you had already previously submitted.I accept topics in any language and from any local board. Local boards are actually fundamental for the growth of the forum. Send me posts where you share some knowledge. Sharing a piece of news is not sharing knowledge. Commenting on the news you just shared is. I want to see original content. No translation of posts in this thread. Again, original content only. Excluded Boards: Meta, Reputation, Altcoin (local boards included), Archival, Games and Rounds, Investor Based Games, Micro Earnings, Politics and Society, Gambling and Off-topic will not count. Posts in Ivory Tower and Serious discussion don't count as well.All applications that will violate the rules of this topic will be deleted and the author will be put on ignore. If someone is ignored, the post will be automatically deleted. I reserve to change the rules to improve the quality of the thread. New rules will be enacted upon publishing on the thread.No translation of posts in this thread.What you get applying to get a post merited:I commit to reading all your submitted posts.I commit to assessing the quality of all the posts and deciding if they are worthy or not. What you don't get applying to get a post merited:The certainty of a merit for your submission.The timely assessment of the quality of your merit submission.The right to discuss my meriting choices. My meriting habits aren't under scrutiny here.Format for applying:For the good order of the thread, to facilitate the readability and to facilitate my merit assessment, please use the following syntax to submit your merit assessment request.Quote from: ETFbitcoin on January 05, 2019, 06:26:41 AMCode:Round: Cumulative number of post batches submitted for review (up to 7).[b][url=https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1234.msg1234#1234]TITLE[/url][/b]Description : <optional, but either description or category must exist>Category: <optional> {guide, opinion, news, question, technical question, technical answer, share technical improvement/upgrade, etc.}Board ¬† ¬† : {board where the post appeared}(quote edited a bit)For example, from the thread, a user had already submitted 5 posts reviewed a few weeks earlier and decided to fill in only the category field.

Some of them might seem to strict, but they worked. From what I have seen in the past, these types of merit sharing threads were usually moved to the off-topic section by the mods. But as you can see, my thread survived in B&H after all these years. I am sure the rules had something do with that. There is a screenshot there from a PM from theymos. It's no longer visible on the forum probably because the image host is no longer supported, but you can still take a look at it here > https://i.vgy.me/OdLfXf.png.One of the rules that I had was that you couldn't submit posts that were written after I started my tread. The deadlines were then moved several times as time passed. Since everything that is good eventually gets taken advantage of, cheaters might see this initiative of yours as a great way to create some new accounts, make a few decent/good posts, and submit those in your thread. The accounts could then be sold or used for other purposes.",
