I am thinking about the publicity and users bitcoin will get from that bank. All of them won't use their custody service when they realize the risk associated with it. Many of them will turn their faces towards non-custodial wallets. More users means money inflow into the bitcoin market. This will increase the bitcoin market cap as well. These big institutions can provoke regulators for clearer regulation as well.",

Banks will earn the interest on that money they will also earn interest by giving away the loans at higher interest rates. They will definitely Back up the stability with fiat money itself. This is going to be encircling economy where no one but the banks will benefit a lot. I hope nobody use their services. Let us keep the money in bitcoin form preferably in our own custody. In the cold wallet or paper wallet. :-)I am not sure what others to think about it but this is should be the way.",

Drawing a parallel with stocks, there are custody services that cannot provide your shares and others that can. Obviously, the latter are cheaper in terms of fees than the former, but bank brokers or brokers linked to banks usually offer the former (simply custody, without being able to lend, and charging a fee).Quote from: so98nn on September 15, 2023, 03:12:11 PMThat’s called as good face and bad face at the same time.

Yes, not us on the forum, but many people who are now afraid of Bitcoin would buy it if they can do it through their bank and deposit it there.

I can not blame my friend for not trusting bitcoin. It is my fault that I didn't try to spread awareness among my friends about Bitcoin or they fear to believe my word. But when they see that a large bank that they often use provides services for bitcoin they will trust it more than my word. A few of us don't trust the banking system and want to revolutionize the system, most of the people out there still have trust in banks. They will use it.",

No doubt, this does not directly put impact on the BTC's reputation but indirectly it does. Like, for the mass adoption of the BTC first digital currency must be accepted by the traditionally minded peoples. Who still sticks to traditional finance? Steps like these will promote the digital currency and people will get to know about them. Then trust will be built in their minds. And at last, they will get to know more about BTC. And I hope once they know more about BTC they will definitely accept its decentralization factor and ignore the services being provided by the centralized authorities like these banks. Because there are basically 2 types of people. One who, doesn't want to use any centralized platform along with a decentralized one means they don't want to link their personal life with the crypto finance life. And then there are 2nd type of people who don't care about it. They openly used CEXs and DEXs and openly performed KYC and connected their personal life with the crypto sphere. Besides all that, this news is still good news and it will definitely bring more audience and acceptance in BTC (digital currency) and it will ultimately increase its demand.",

Just like the typical investor that are not confident of their own skill but invests into asset management that has their own asset manager where they're responsible to keep their portfolios up and invests and spreads their clients money based on the decision of the manager. On the case of this custody service, even if we worry about those people that don't know much or don't like to setup their own wallets and bitcoin investments, that's their choice to choose services from banks like the Deustche Bank.",

Some people are so stubborn that you cannot convince them against anything they think is right. Actually, the whole point is bringing more people onboard. Let people decide how they want to manage their funds, but at first let them use bitcoin.

Another benefit of this service is that these customers' crypto deposits will be insured or protected by a deposit insurance company which means clients can get back their crypto deposits if Deutsche Bank goes through bankruptcy.

What is the benefit for the customer to use the custodian service instead of just using a cold wallet then? I mean would prefer just using a cold/hardware/offline wallet.",
