Or what will happen if I does that. Remember I am not doing it but just asking to know. Just like this subjectI am not even planning to do that. No Knowledge is wasted so I just want to know. So if in case such happened I will also have basic knowledge to contribute.If you have tried it or you know it just drop you comments so that those who do not know it can also learn from it.",

Just like this subjectYes you will be able to reply and it will only change the subject of your reply and not the entire thread subject. So if you feel the subject matter isn’t put out well then just advise the OP to change it because it’s only his changes that can actually have a general impact. For the future if you trying out a different posting way or you adding some of the features of icons on the posting board then make use of the preview button first once you’re done, this will give you a view of how your post will be displayed on the forum. With this preview you can make changes to suit you before posting",

Or what will happen if I does that.The thread will allow for doing that but the change on the topic will only appear on your own personal reply being made ad not the entire thread title that will change, but the question to ask yourself is why should you or anyone engage doing that, especially on another person's thread, it's a welcome idea if you're the OP in this case but going against the wish of the creator by changing the title to your own comment under his thread is as if you're talking off points since it may not tally with other previous discussions, and should incase it's OP who needs a little reconstruction of the titled used, you can easily make a suggestion and quote it on the reply for him to take note.",

      "body": "\"Curiosity they say is the mother of all invention\". I wonder what would make anyone to want to tamper with the subject topic of another's thread for which he's not the OP.  I haven't thought of changing a subject topic that isn't mine and don't have the idea how's gonna look like if such is Ben done, buy rather for me to do so I believe it's commendable if I just place it as a suggestion or a recommendation to the op concerning his post topic and it's left for OP to do the editing.And if such idea as you contemplated is actually possible then many persons topic posts would have a countless alterations from different members as anyone can just deem it fit to change the subject at will. Imagine where 500 persons had to change the subject of a particular post in a day. That would be 500 times of a different subject on a single post. How weird",

As long as you didn't create the thread it is not rightful for you to change it because it wasn't your own initiative.It is not even wise to undertake such a thing; to me, it appears to be turning the person's initiative into yours when you are not the original originator of the post. If any changes are required, it is preferable to cite the original author of the post rather than updating yours. By changing yours, you've effectively isolated yourself from others and declared that everyone else's viewpoint is incorrect. The appropriate thing to do is simply draw the OP's attention to it; if he changes it, he agrees with you, and if he doesn't, you have nothing else to say about his topic title choice.",

I have not thought of doing it changing another person topic but the question just enter my mind and I was afraid of doing that so I said let create a thread for it so I would have answers.

As long as you didn't create the thread it is not rightful for you to change it because it wasn't your own initiative.This is not a matter of good or bad ethic here, the option is available which means you can make use of it. If the forum didn't want anybody to be able to edit the subtitle of a thread then the option won't have been available for you to be able to edit the subtitle during your reply to the thread. I feel this option is made available so we can have multiple topics under a thread. I found this helpful when I created the Nigerian Bitcointalk Community Hangout. {Current topic: #EndSARs}, the subtitle were used to start a new discussion on the the same thread and it was very helpful because you can follow different topics on the same thread.In addition to what others have said, when titles are changed and they get replies, the new post bares the change subjects and not the original subject of the thread which is useful for continuous discussion for thet particular topic and also you should note that for the fact a subject can be changed to fit a particular discussion that doesn't mean the original title can be changed,  only the comment subject get changed. Therefore it doesn't affect the main subject of discussion for a thread",
