I know that there’s a problem before on TRC20 when using trustwallet but it was already resolved on the updated version. I’m pretty sure that it’s about the gas fee since you can view your balance in your wallet which means you have the right network.",

Where did you download it from?Did someone give you a wallet or sold you a seed phrase and now you are trying to move the funds out but keep getting the error?IF that is the case, then forget about the funds. The scammer is the one with the private keys and makes you believe you own the funds, but you don't.Delete the wallet and move on",
