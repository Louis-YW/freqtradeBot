  "content": "I recently found some interesting statistics on Twitter that left me a little surprised. Actually, I thought that the US and most Asian countries were ahead in the field of Bitcoin and Blockchain. Especially when it comes to big Bitcoin and crypto services and providers. However, the statistics below show a different picture.It seems Europe is ahead when it comes to:Nodes: Europe has the highest number of Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes.On-Chain activity: Largest absolute number & relative share of on-chain activityRegulation: most comprehensive crypto-regulation globally (MiCa)Jobs: two thirds of global crypto industry jobsVenture Capital: 50% of venture funded crypto projects globallyTax: favorable tax regimes (especially Germany, Portugal, Poland, Belgium)Developers: largest share of blockchain developers (tied with US, 29% each)Values: Strong values of digital/data sovereignty and decentralization(at least that's what Patrick Hansen, a well-known EU researcher on crypto strategy and policy, claims after analyzing the statistics; see sources below for original tweet).Bitcoin, Blockchain and Crypto Jobs:Global Cryptocurrency Transaction Volume:VC Investments:Crypto Tax Rates:Sources: https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1675439201347616768I still have trouble naming big European providers, since all the big names are located overseas. Somewhat established European crypto brands are Bitstamp, Bitpanda, Ledger, Bitcoin.de or Kaiko. However, the big guys are either located in the US or not located anywhere (e.g. Binance).Opinions on Hansen's standpoint? If you have more statistics on Europe or the rest of the world, feel free to share them. Maybe we can map the development of the global crypto landscape a little better in this thread.",

There we have China that produces the most miners, then we have the USA that mines the most bitcoins, then we have exchanges like Binance that god knows where is it based, then we have crypto casinos that are registered in Curaçao but have headquarters in different countries. Then there we have El Salvador that wants to move on Bitcoin payments.Btw one thing that I can say for sure is that most crypto casinos, if not all, are based in Europe. I think that Bitcoin is very decentralized in terms of influence and power  That's good.",

I just need to include 1 setting (even the divorce rate), and of course without telling you, or something like thatWhat I read, but what I see:Nodes: Europe has the highest number of Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes.- Number of Nodes: (with today's numbers)I take the US to compare the number of nodes- United States: 10816 (30.90%) Now let's see what's going on in Europe- Germany 4805 (13.73%)- Netherlands 1641 (4.69%)- France 1258 (3.59%)- Spain 403 (1.15%)- Italy 384 (1.10%)I don't consider other European countries since their percentage is near to zeroSo we have Europe with ~23% while USA have 30%Nodes: Europe has the highest number of Bitcoin nodes FalseI admit, I have not checked about ETH since I'm a crypto-racist- Jobs: two thirds of global crypto industry jobsThe majority of these jobs are remote jobs working for companies outside Europe. And that's normal, since the company's aim is to target the European population.Two thirds, I doubt when you see how it's going on linkedin.com, cryptojoblist.com, and others.Europe doesn't create jobs but foreign companies do it- Regulation: most comprehensive crypto-regulation globally (MiCa)  That was a joke righ? the most killing regulation, worse than genocide. - Tax: favorable tax regimesThese figures should have been compared with other types of investment in their country. The way it's shown could lead you to believe that these are rates created specifically for crypto, when that's not the case. Even quoting 4 countries where the rate is low, you have to look at the other countries as well and make an average. Look at countries ranging from 30 to 40%. How it's favorable?

The way it's shown could lead you to believe that these are rates created specifically for crypto, when that's not the case. True, however in Germany the tax regime is indeed very intersting for holders. After one year your coins will be tax free if you don't trade them, while stocks will always trigger a 25% + church tax + soli tax. No matter how long you will hold them. Properties will trigger the regular income tax for 10 years. Accordingly, compared to other asset classes, cryptocurrencies are quite favourably taxed in Europe's largest economy, Germany.

However, one would also have to weight according to crypto users in the individual states, which would then again greatly limit the significance of the statistics.",

See here: https://bitnodes.io/I used Bitnodes.io toohttps://bitnodes.io/nodes/all/countries/QuoteBitnodes crawler captures these nodes from the addr messages returned by all the reachable nodes. Each snapshot or data point in this report represents a rolling window. A snapshot with window size of 1 day will include all nodes by IP addresses with timestamps less than 1 day old. The timestamp for a node here refers to the time when its peer last connects to it. If you turn on your Bitcoin node for only a few minutes anytime during the last 24 hours, it will be included in the latest snapshot with a window size of 1 day.Multiple nodes from the same IP address, but different port numbers are counted as one node in this report. A larger window size may increase the likelihood of the same node being counted more than once due to e.g. IP lease renewal.QuoteValid argument, true. However, any stats on this?Too old, but several years ago the US was THE country to be if you wanted to work on the crypto/blockchain industry.Nowadays if you check for exemple cryptocurrencyjobs.co there are- 118 blockchain jobs in Europe- 224 in the United StatesIf you visit https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/crypto-jobs-worldwide?position=1&pageNum=0You will notice the job market (remote, location)Quote\"One regulation to rule them all\"... WTF, lol.Well that's the purpose of the european union. The same laws to rule all european countries. European laws have more power than your local laws.

Thanks to Europe when they will say the taxes shall be XX% for every countryTo my knowledge, this is not true. As of today, the biggest part of tax legislation (income taxes etc.) in the EU is the responsibility of the individual member states and I have not been able to find any serious efforts on the part of the EU to change this. Accordingly, the competences in tax legislation on the part of the EU are still very limited today. And I honestly do not believe that this will change in the near future. The member states are neither willing to give up their tax sovereignty nor is tax legislation an easy legal field to harmonise.However, you're right on the last part: I also don't believe that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will remain tax-free in Germany forever (after holding them for a year ofc). Austria has just revised its tax legislation and introduced a 27.5% tax, the same as for shares. I can imagine that similar legislation in Germany will follow in the next few years. The government realised after the last bull market how much tax they were missing out on.",

Furthermore, germans would be reluctant to put money in a fund operated in Portugal, Romanian to invest in a Polish start-up and so on, that's why the whole thing is so fragmented and we don't have giant companies like the US or China does.",
