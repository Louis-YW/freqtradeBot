I believe there was a time when a plane crashed in the middle of the snowy continent and some of the passengers are dead but some has survive the impact, in order for the survivor to prolong their lives until the rescuer comes, they ate those people that are dead instead of killing the other survivors. There are always some options but most people don't really want to choose the hard way instead they forget they are human and they commit heinous crimes.",

Hunger is a big problem that's been there years ago that many countries and societies are dealing with.It is true that we're like in the wild looking to survive and that's how we're dealing with our daily lives. But it's a different survivability for those that are actually experiencing it not just ones but almost everyday of their lives.",

There's also a saying that varies depending who said it:QuoteNo man was ever more than about nine meals away from crime or suicide. (Eric Sevareid)And it's not only lack of food. It can be fear of lack of food for anyone who has been ever really hungry and poor. Or for a rich people who don't know how they could handle not being able to afford something they are used to, like food, housing, paying debts or lifestyle in general. People are often are miser when they is afraid of losing something, and generous when they see other persons losing something if they are able to feel sympathy and empathy.",

Everyone wants to survive in a society where hunger persist and it is either done by a trick or by crook or by a legal way.Even the Holy Bible acknowaedgles crime ignited by hunger and stipulates lesser punishment. An hungry man can loose his sense of reasoning. I would not blame a man that steals because he is hunger. If a thief come to someones house and goes straight to the kitchen and start eating and packing food, I dont think it will be ideal to call the cops if he does that without harming anybody.Hunger might not be the only reason for insecurity because other factors like greed also contributes, but it is one of the main cause of insecurity. This is why most countries that experience a high rate of crime is likely suffering from unemployment and hunger.",

A person who has enough to eat for himself and his family would prefer to consider rational ways to better both his life and the lives of people around him than to consider engaging in any illegal activity that will increase their level of insecurity.Similar to how every man wakes up in the morning and considers what the family will eat, the government of every community or nation should put the welfare of its people first. A man who is starving will do whatever \"illegal\" to survive.",

When a  man is hungry different things comes to his mind, when there is hunger there comes insecurity, because when you look at it, when a man is hungry is ready to do anything just for him to be able to put food on his table, so the main reason people do evil things that make a society unstable is because of what they are passing through. And there is also the aspect of the kind of leaders we have, when the leaders are not doing well for the citizens there will be a lot of crime and insecurity in that country.",

If hunger and health were not problems in the world, I also believe people could focus in electing actual politicians instead demagogues who take advantage of other's desperation.",

You're right about what you just said, if a child is hungry, he may be tempted to steal, if we want to tackle insecurities in the society today, then we have to begin with the consideration of the less privilege first, the poor and the needy, we need to create an avenue for several opportunities for the people to participate in one enterprise or the other, the government and individuals make take it a determination in helping others in need, these people got frustrated and were left with no option than to partake in illegal measn for a living sustainability, but that shouldn't be an excuse although, we all take full responsibility for how we lived our life.",

They all lead to hunger, which in turn leads to insecurity in the country. A country that lacks control over the factors that cause hunger will eventually produce criminals, and criminal activity will persist in the country. One of the most viable ways to stop all of this is to address the former before they escalate; escalation is extremely dangerous, and this is an example of what we see in countries where there are too many criminal cases.",

Out of the numerous factors that can push people into criminal acts hunger has the highest reasons. I agree with your fact, OPs; really, a hungry man is an angry man. Generally, humans can endure a lot of unfair situations, but hunger can cause a person to commit an act they never meant to. My friend told me what he witnessed in his house on a Sunday day last year. When he returned from church that Sunday, he noticed someone had broken into his house. He checked around his house, but everything was in place and nothing was stolen. It was only after he entered his kitchen that he realized his soup, stew, rice and beverages were gone. In fact, his refrigerator had been emptied. Due to hunger, humans can agree to do things like become hired killers or become suicide bombers.In most countries, the government takes advantage of these kinds of situations to get people to do their dirty jobs.",
