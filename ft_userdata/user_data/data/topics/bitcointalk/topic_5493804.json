A lot of people in the world still don't know what Bitcoin is. Only a few people are aware and are accumulating as well. More people coming to Bitcoin means more value.",

Bitcoin is still a very exclusive category of investment, even though it's accessible and affordable for most people in the world, since they have internet connection and a digital device.The point is that most people aren't interested on it. They prefer being slaves with fiat than free men with Bitcoin. The question is, why? Maybe they are too busy with another endevouars and personal problems that adopting Bitcoin seems a very far away thing. Maybe they strictly live by the rules and endorsements of a political or religious authority, so Bitcoin looks dangerous or forbidden.There are so many possibilities, although all of them indicate most individuals are still unable to develop authenticity, to seek their own paths by themselves and to think outside the box. And by that I don't mean the cliche of being a dumb revolutionary against everything built so far by our ancestrals, rather it's just to look for what is better for their personal development and welfare, which governments and leaders are unable to deliver and guarantee to us in this wicked world of lies and false promises.",

Money is what people want but when everyone has it (though there’s greed), money will reduce in value because it’d have become more common. Maybe a new thing with better value will then be used as currency",

And it is not because a large number of people buy Bitcoin and that will also make others to buy, things are not working in that way. In business, what works for one man might not work for the other and if anyone wants to succeed in business or investment, he or she has to plan for the goal of the investment. He has to k ow if it is for long term or short. Because some people are very good in short term investment and if they invest.i. long term investment then they won't succeed and some are very good in the long term investment and if they involved themselves in the short term investment then they won succeed. So the best thing to do is tok ow the goal of the investment. Either long or short term. So that you can lay down your aims to put into action.",

For sure, not everyone will adapt Bitcoin as we are saying, and the reason behind this less adoption is just some minor things that we won’t take seriously, but on the other hand, there are things that we should consider when we see someone who doesn’t believe in the digital currency, and those things are belief and knowledge. We have many individuals who can’t even use their android phones as they are supposed to, and someone who is struggling to meet up with their daily needs won’t adopt bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Because the time that he will even take to learn the process is a waste of time to him because he will not earn it immediately after, this person will surely choose his job over crypto investment, so the things that I think bitcoin is",

Well said!I hear many say that comparison, but when you break it down like that, I think of this:Trying to equate even one Satoshi to one penny is stupid.Even if both currencies fluctuate in price.One of them is a finite supply, designed to stand against time itself.

Still, I encourage all of us to try to at least try and invest in bitcoin so that we all get better lives no matter how poor or rich we are already Exactly, and maybe if you will research the addresses that have bitcoin or Satoshi's in them, there are many accounts or wallet addresses that hold a large portion of the bitcoin supply, meaning there are a lot of whales, so I don't think that it is necessary to encourage all the people around the world to buy bitcoin if they don't want to or if they don't have the capability to do so.But truly, it is worth trying to invest in bitcoin as it already has an established community that will make it strong and survive for longer. Remember,  without us who invest in bitcoin, bitcoin will not reach where it is now, combined with how smart the creator of bitcoin is. This is not to push you to invest in bitcoin, but to share and encourage you to try it because I'm sure you will see the beauty of bitcoin once you earn or benefit from it.",
