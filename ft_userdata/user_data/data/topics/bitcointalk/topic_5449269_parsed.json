  "content": "Oh poor Gensler Â  You have been trying to hunt down Bitcoin for a long time now as the ring leader, yet you are caught shilling another cryptocurrency, is this another 24hrs Jack Bauer episodic Mayhem? This is the case of a spearheaded leader that wants to regulate Bitcoin at all cost. Today, the head of the securities and exchange commission Gary Gensler have been caught promoting Algorand, with proof, in fact, this has been ongoing since 2019, he have been speaking highly about this alt in multiple public events.I have no doubt that this man is in for some trouble, I am not the Law ðŸ‘® bug....... In the United States, promotion of a security falls under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These laws regulate the offer and sale of securities, require registration or an exemption, and prohibit misrepresentation or omission of material facts. And those who fall afoul can face civil and criminal penalties, including fines and imprisonment. Â https://beincrypto.com/sec-chairman-gary-gensler-caught-shilling-algorand-now-deems-it-a-security/Anyways, I think someone needs to make a movie out of crypto because there is no place with a lot of drama than cryptocurrency space, I am glad to be a Bitcoin investor and believer, nothing, I repeat, nothing comes close in this crypto space like Bitcoin.",

They only admitted it recent months but years ago, when they started, they also attacked Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, called them as scam.",

This man probably be in trouble, Maybe not because of the law that you have mentioned, according to that, you need registration to promote anything related to registered securities and maybe Gensler has that registration (just saying not accusing, like maybe or maybe not) Let's further see how much they will fine him. Actually, he is more focused on Uber and i have seen many investors who have invested in Uber because (only my thinking) That they (investors) really understand the importance of Uber running on Artificial Intelligence and this will increase their investment profits on Uber's Stock. Plus Gensler talked about Algorand. but why? how can Algorand can take a vital role in that (AI) journey. Quote from: Ucy on April 18, 2023, 02:24:04 PMSounds like a case of moral police who despise pork so much and often raid, fine, and jail pork buyers/sellers but couldn't resist handsome rewards from companies to promote their pig oilÂ  packaged in beautiful containers This also sounds like, a person who is in charge of Securities and assets. As he was, maybe he forgot to not talk about them in public (hehe) because i know in private talks, they discuss them (hehe) There are 6 more tokens registered as securities according to OP's source link. Maybe he could be involved in any of them.",

To crown it all they are more governmental agencies that are deep down having some serious investment on bitcoin but how do we know about all these? Bitcoin wallets or address doesn't show up the account holders all less those exchange deposit address maybe could tracked and noticed it was from one of the famous exchange, but except that there's no way to detect them all..I believe he would have to face the law and judgement for promoting \"Algorand\". I believe there are more that would be reveal as time keep going",

He is against cryptocurrencies, full stop.His entire strategy has been to make sure the SEC doesn't actually make any rules for crypto, and then just sues crypto companies as if the rules did exist, thereby ensuring none of these companies have any chance of complying with the SEC because the SEC hasn't made any rules for the industry.The only reason he hasn't geared his actions against Bitcoin is because nobody considers Bitcoin a security and there would be no way to argue that it is. But let's remember the SEC repeatedly refuses to allow Bitcoin ETFs based on vague reasons that clearly will never be met. If Gensler wasn't anti-Bitcoin there would be no reason to reject Bitcoin ETFs.Also, Gensler is attacking exchanges, which does attack Bitcoin because exchanges are where people buy and sell Bitcoin.I guarantee Gensler doesn't care one lick about centralized vs decentralized, he very clearly wants to take down the industry in America and that includes Bitcoin. He is doing this by trying to take down the crypto exchanges in America and not doing anything to allow Bitcoin to more easily spread among the traditional finance industry.There's a few reasonable courses of action regulatory bodies could (and need to) take:1. Make common sense safety and transparency rules for exchanges.2. Make common sense safety and transparency rules for stablecoins.3. Allow Bitcoin ETFs so people/institutions still solely wedded to traditional finance can at least invest in Bitcoin if not actually use it (importantly this would also allow people to have Bitcoin in retirement accounts).4. Either state which kinds of cryptocurrencies are securities, or state that cryptocurrencies as a whole are not securities, or better yet come up with a new regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies since securities laws were written before cryptocurrencies even existed and crypto is an entirely different thing that likely would need its own set of rules. And have some pathway for crypto token companies that already exist to come into compliance (like if a pre-mine sale for fundraising is regulated then have some way for companies who already exist and whose token is already on the market to comply after the fact in a reasonable way). And of course give a reasonable amount of time for crypto token companies as well as crypto exchanges to comply with the rules.Gensler and his SEC hasn't done #1. They haven't done #2. They have outright refused many times to do #3, as did the SEC led by the previous chair. And they are very obviously refusing to do #4 because that would allow crypto companies & exchanges to actually comply and therefore be safe. Gensler instead is just trying to sue the industry out of the USA.",

The course begins with a review of Bitcoin and an understanding of the commercial, technical, and public policy fundamentals of blockchain technology, distributed ledgers, and smart contracts. The class then continues on to current and potential blockchain applications in the financial sector.which you can download from here or even watch on youtube was doing so for years promoting bitcoin and blockchain solutions to his students and taking questions and debunking myths about time settlements, transactions costs, decentralization and so on just because his hidden agenda was to...what? Tax the hell out of shitcoins and exchanges that print money and offer them to newbies only to let them devalue one month later and then start a new hype?So let me spell it again: All this is BULLSHIT!This guy has promoted bitcoin and blockchain more than 99.9% of this board has ever done but for some weird conspiracy theory, he must be evil just because he's the chairman of the SEC.Quote from: hatshepsut93 on April 18, 2023, 05:50:59 PMBitcoiners persecution complex at its finest.

Because not everything is going to plan and you can't invest 1$ today and get 10 trillion tomorrow we need somebody to blame, and of course, is the evil gubbermint! The lower the understanding about the basic economy and the deeper the frustration from its own failure the higher the need to find a culprit that is to blame, an all-powerful entity who has nothing better than sabotage this, but of course, at the same time this all-powerful being that controls everything will be brought down by somebody buying 10$ of coins.The whole thing is so frustrating I can't even describe how much I'm willing to curse everything right now- Saylor said Bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme, then when he smelled the $ invested millions of other people's money just for profit and he's the hero of the community- Gensler held course about Bitcoin for years in front of MIT students, not Twitter clappers, but because he is now the chairman of the SEC he is the evilest person in the worldSeriously, f^&%^&% this shit!",
