  "content": "This has been a persisting trouble and users on X (formerly Twitter) complained bitterly that they were not able to pay using bitcoin on McDonald's Bitcoin powered payment process at El Salvador. Not sure if the report sent out to Open node about this error have been resolved or a note sent out to the users regarding such a dispute.Amongst the multiple users who complained, Zeus and Leo Weese, (members of Twitter cryptocurrency community) share this on their page. The problem here is that when you try paying, the screen that's meant to display the invoice would freeze. However, after a while \"Zeus\" managed to scan the screen after it flashed for a nano second. The other user paid using the counter. What could have been the cause to this issue? Above is actually the invoice supposed to be that of ZEUS which he luckily scanned and paid.

I don't it is cause for alarm or any panic so long as users didn't lose their funds and there is no repeat of it. If there is a recurrence they could either change the payment processor or totally abandon crypto payment. I think the latter may be detrimental to the growth of the business. They may lose customers and then revenue. It would be wise if they can anticipate these issues before it happens so they they lose to their competition.",

Money is hard to find, so I won't blame them if they will panic immediately but they should also realize that it can't help anything.The best thing to do when this situation arises is to calm down and wait. If machine data's are not enough, indeed that they may need the help of the cameras. Almost all establishments now has it and it's very useful for different situations including this one here.",

It is also expected that there will be some errors that might occur because El Salvador implements bitcoin without proper thinking or planning, so we can expect that some people might complain, and for sure, some of them will not use bitcoin transactions as it will be an inconvenience for them. But I think this issue should be fixed by its people or who manages it, because if not, then bitcoin implementation in their country might not be successful.

Â Feel free to contradict.bitcoin for small amounts was deemed ok for small amounts pre 2017. due to how a $3 burger was not worth re-orging a blockchain, however with things added to bitcoin like RBF it made bitcoin near impossible for recipients to want to accept zero confirm's because now tx's can be dropped, rejected via the sender redirecting value to different addresses via RBF whilst transactions are waiting.. this was the way that LN became promoted as the zeroconfirm payment method. then the way bitcoin devs changed the fee estimate and bump fee defaults were done to make small payments to become more costly than a mcdonalds burger, again done to promote LNthe whole premise of manipulating bitcoin so that people have to pay more with the delusion that it helps miners, was another mis judgement by devs pretending they were economics experts(their not), devs dont realise the CEX market price is what rewards mining pools via deflation. also whereby more transactions per block would create more revenue for miningpools as a total of the block reward bonus.now we have it where people need to lock in value to a dodgy subnetwork and do it over multiple lumps(channels) for the HOPE(not100% success rate) that a payment will go through on the subnetwork.. thats even worse of an experience or strategy compared to people deciding to buy a giftcard for a value amount equivelant to a months worth of meals",

Bitcoin Lightning Network off chain transactions are solutions, faster and cheaper in transaction fee. It can meet demand on time, cheap fee and relevant for small transactions like purchases things at McDonald stores.I did not see information for Lightning Network in these photos and above discussions so McDonald kiosk only accept Bitcoin on chain transactions, not Lightning Network off chain transactions.They began the adoption since 2022.https://cointelegraph.com/news/mcdonald-s-starts-to-accept-bitcoin-and-tether-in-swiss-town",
