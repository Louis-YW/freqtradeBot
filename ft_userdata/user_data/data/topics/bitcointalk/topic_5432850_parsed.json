      "body": "CloudFlare is a man-in-the-middle, and I believe it is extremely dangerous, especially when it denies access to websites without the website's owners' knowledge.Is this not censorship?  Naturally, it is.Consider this: some people, particularly on BitcoinTalk, prefer non-javascript solutions; however, CloudFlare will deny access to bitcointalk.org if you do not use JavaScript, which I find completely unacceptable. With the funds raised from advertising, BitcoinTalk could easily run 13 name servers, each of which would have significant DDoS protection.The same is true for hosting. QuoteName Server: amy.ns.cloudflare.comName Server: brad.ns.cloudflare.comDNSSEC: unsignedBy the way, if BitcoinTalk worries so much about security, isn't signing the bitcointalk.org zone with DNSSEC would be a priority?Update: Blocking older HTTP versions used by botnets, such as 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, as well as implementing other server-side features such as pushing resources and using TLS 1.3, would significantly reduce the success of any DDoS attack. I'd even say it would make it nearly impossible.",

I contract for the United States Government to build anonymity technology for them and deploy it. They don’t think of it as anonymity technology, though we use that term. They think of it as security technology. They need these technologies so that they can research people they’re interested in, so that they can have anonymous tip lines, so that they can buy things from people without other countries figuring out what they are buying, how much they are buying and where it is going, that sort of thing.— Roger Dingledine, co-founder of Tor, 2004 speechhttps://restoreprivacy.com/tor/Regarding your comments on the quotes, it appears you didn't even read the original topic, which was about CloudFlare making bitcointalk.org inaccessible without JavaScript.",
