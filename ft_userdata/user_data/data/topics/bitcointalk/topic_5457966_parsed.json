Murphy. These two books can provide useful information in your trading journey. You can also refer to this thread - Big Library of Bitcoin & Blockchain Books for books related to trading.",

But the strategy to use in trading that is most important are:The use of very little amount of you your money to trader. Trading is very risky. First see it as gambling until you make money from it frequently. If you still lose, see it as something dangerous. Do not leverage or at least using low leverage. If you use leverage more than 5x for bitcoin, it is getting too high. For a better and convenient trading, even use no leverage at all. Trade with good coins like bitcoin. Some good trader will keep on losing just because of the shitcoins they are using to trade.Learn how to use indicators and learn about fundamental analyses too.Discipline yourself. Do not be addicted. Do not be greedy. Overcome emotion. These are very important.",

You should know that its not all about watching videos and reading books, you have to put everything in practice, and you have to start with little amount you know if you lose it wont affect you. Don't think because you have watched different videos and you will think you know everything already, and you will end up starting with big amount of money, its not done like that, you have to start practicing gradually and you will develop your own strategy, everyone one is having strategy that works for them.",

I don't find any books that are helpful in terms of strategy (I want it to be in a course or video sample teachings). But I would recommend you some books that tackle trading psychology. Those will be Mental Game of Trading, Trading in The Zone, The hour between the dog and the wolf.I would also recommend you to watch trading documentaries on netflix or at youtube, it will help you to realize proper expectation on trading your own account and what professional trading truly is.

And you didn't recommend him the one he was asking for. Well, I mean to disrespect and I didn't intend to point out it, but I thought it would help you to make more useful posts than these (As, this could be improved, no disrespect).  SeriouslyGiveaway, your recommendations are not relatable too, In my POV. Note* i know, the like and dislike of suggestions is for mainly OP, but i also had the same query so i think i should take this thread as an answer to my questions too, so, that's why i mention my feelings for some recommendations.",

Because,  I am sure investing a portion of your time into trading just to gain experience and build a skill is far more better than reading tons of books related to trading,  so what is most important is for you to read and learn the basics of trading and thereafter applying that knowledge in your trading activities over time.",

And if you have any free time then you can browse online about trading related topics. And you will get various videos related to trading on different social media, keep following them. Hope you can become a good trader with the ideas of the book as well as practical experience and various videos from social media.",

Books can get boring to read and sometimes the major points and things you should take note of are hidden in between too many unnecessary sentences that you miss them. But if you are the type that like reading and you are good reader, books can be good for you. But I still feel that you should have and request for some videos that you could watch as well to summarise the knowledge. The benefit of these videos is that you can always rewatch them easily than looking for a paragraph in a big book.",
