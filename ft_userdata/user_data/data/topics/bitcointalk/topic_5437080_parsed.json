Here the minimum salary is 300usd per month, and some people cannot change of social \"rank\" because of their ethnicity.Everyone can do some changes and could try to save money or BTC, but not everyone will do it with success. It is not working like that in some places. This is the reason I think your idea is not fully true",

      "body": "Everyone is born poor so it is up to us to change that. One cannot be lazy and stick in a dead-end job that doesn’t get you further. You cannot just sit around and wait for things to happen, you have to get up and go out there and get it done. Understand that being lazy is not a trait to carry in life, there is time and sweat to put in to survive in this world. Laying low does not get you ahead in life, it just brings you down and it will keep you in never-ending circumstances and leaves you unable to move forward. You must aim for bigger things so that bigger things can  happen in your life.",

It’s a difficult question to answer but many people who are fiat rich are actually miserable & live very sad, lonely lives.Surrounding yourself with friends, family & living a happy life means you are not poor, in some sense any way. Do not obsess with being fiat rich, it will not make you happy.",

Actually poor people are people who are not grateful for what they are. It takes effort, but a truly rich person is one who never complains about what he has. because everything needs effort and we have to be active.",

Tough word bro, we still have agency in our own lives and can work to improve our financial situation.On the other hand, wasting time on social media and not taking action towards our goals can hold us back from achieving success.In terms of practical advice, some steps toward financial stability could include setting achievable goals, developing a budget, and actively seeking opportunities for education and career advancement.Keep in mind!! That progress takes time, so it's important to be patient and persistent in your endeavors. There's no word for late.",
