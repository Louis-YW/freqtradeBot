      "body": "You don't need all the above-mentioned means of verification in order to change your username; you have already done what's required, which is sending a message to the admin. You just have to wait and see when he approves the change for you. I believe your chances of getting your new user name approved are based on the reason you might have given for the change of name request, and your activeness and contribution to the forum also have some added advantage in determining if it will be approved and how fast it can be done. Unless those that have special offers to their profiles, which they got either from their active contributions in the past or donations done to the forum, I don't think any user can change his or her name by itself. You can join the donators league if you are in such a hurry to change the name. And for the moderators, I think their access to what they can do is limited, and changing users names is one that I think they don't have access to, as I have not come across any statement of such (correct me if I am wrong).",

If still not considered then it's safe to assume that your request is more likely rejected and for the record only very few people succeeded with the name change requests in bitcointalk.Alternate options:You can create a new account with the name you wish and use it further (just my opinion though) because having multiple accounts in bitcointalk is allowed.",

It is also his choice to do that or not. Just keep on trying. I have also seen that it takes a long time before such request of change of name is being granted.",

Now that the thread has been made public I think it will get the attention of Theymos in addition to all the mentions he’ll receive from this thread, so the Op should just hope that his request get approved.",
