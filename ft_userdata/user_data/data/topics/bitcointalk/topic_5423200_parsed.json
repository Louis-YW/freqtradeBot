If you continue to use it to link to an obscure website, it will not change the risk.I wish you more luck in the future.",

Download the metamask plugin only on their official website.Wallets that have been hacked like this usually lure users to send some assets for Fee, and when they are in they will quickly move them to another wallet. some of them use bots to make fast transactions,",

I connect the wallet to countless website since I was into airdrop.The mistake I made was leaving some valuable tokens on the wallet, and one day I got a notification that I sent out tokens, it wasn't me and when I checked it out it was moved to a new ETH wallet.",

It costs next to nothing to install a new one.I believe what the OP said, if you just want to get a new one then create another one but not in the same computer since that computer that has your metamask wallet might be compromised. So, it's better to create it on another computer the one that hasn't been compromised but also we have to make sure that we downloaded the right app before going to install it on the computer.There are same stories like this happened in the past so it's not that different but this should be enough to warn most altcoins user especially when using this app(metamask).",
