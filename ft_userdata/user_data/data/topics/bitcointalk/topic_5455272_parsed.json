      "body": "An interesting idea for monetization, but I think that if a miner has no experience in repairing ASICs, he does not have a professional soldering station and has not changed chips before, then it is cheaper for him to contact the workshop. I have extensive experience in repairing various IT equipment, and I understand that information about repairs will only harm an inexperienced person. After an unqualified repair, the cost of repair increases greatly or a new board is required.",
