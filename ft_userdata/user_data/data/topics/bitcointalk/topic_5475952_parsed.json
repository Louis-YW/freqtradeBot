      "body": "Two days after your take down, now this forum has banned advertising mixers, I agree this platform helps their popularity, but I believe by banning them or rather using such scare tactics to persuade admins to take precautions and act on their own, regardless you have contributed to the already existing mixers long lasting operations.Here is why :Before, when a mixer was shut down by LE, a new mixer had to announce their operations, but they would have had to work for several months to gain at least %50 of the credibility of the former mixer, and it would have taken them 1 year to reach the same popularity, but now all the currently known mixers will remain popular among criminals because they have already established a trust in the community. That's why your actions has caused a strategic mistake, and now they are 1 year ahead of you guys. Good luck with your endeavours.We as ordinary citizens of planet earth reserve our rights for financial freedom under the rules of common sense, as long as we are adhering to the globally accepted laws of human rights, we will keep using tools such as Bitcoin and Monero plus other decentralized currencies. It will be best if you think about our rights before using such tactics in the future. We are humans, but tired of central banks tyranny.Hopefully we could all coexist in peace, but that never happens, not as long as there are corrupted politicians controlling all the governments of the world, and we all know they always get away with their misdeeds because they have money and influence, but nobody is above God, and cryptocurrency (BTC) is a testament to his will.",
