But for any speculative asset this is common so when you see people are selling then start accumulating and sell when people are buying and this is simple trick can make you billionaire in few years depends on how much capital you have to start with.",

I give you one example, ETH in the bear market was at it lowest below $100, so if you buy a ton and then sell it during the bull run wherein it went as high as $4000++ then that is a huge profit already.",

And this is very difficult, because most of the people who bought bitcoin more than $50,000 were waiting for the price to rise.",

The difficult part is what crypto are you going to accumulate. My answer would be Bitcoin if your having a hard time to decide which Crypto so why not just choose Bitcoin. Before that, we have to knowledgeable about crypto and blockchain and how it works.",

We should really know when to enter the market, bear or bull we can still make profit it’s just that perfect timing is the key and having your own analysis can help you with this one.",

All we are going through are market cycles, objectively these things are never new, everything has happened before and everything keeps repeating itself. So those who have experienced bear seasons before, they see this as an opportunity to accumulate as much as possible, not a time to panic. Panic only comes to newbies and for me it's better to let them experience the reality, there's no better advice than to experience it for yourself.",
