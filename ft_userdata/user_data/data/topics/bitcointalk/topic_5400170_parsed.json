  "content": "Introducing BANKER.FARM - the growing ecosystem aiming ultimately to gamify crypto investing.Utilizing a simple but a genius concept to offer investors the possibility to earn high APR by buying-in rounds, managing investment, and exiting nearby the ATH.The ecosystem consists currently of BUSD and BNB rounds on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and more are on the way.Earn up to 12% daily by staking BUSD and/or BNB (APR 1460%) and BusdBanker / BnbBanker (APR 2920%) rewards.BUSD and BNB rounds offers also 3-tier referrals & weekly holder airdrops!The initial investment gets locked when you buy in & stake (APR 1460%) and starts to generate immediately a modest 4% daily base interest paid in corresponding tokens.Depending on the risk/profit level you feel comfortable with, you can sell, reinvest, and/or stake tokens accumulating in your wallet.The real magic kicks in with the staking of rewards as it pays 8% daily extra (APR 2920%). This means in total 12% daily.Selling cuts profits as you exit the round or you can sell partially taking some profits while continuing to seek more rewards.However, the aim should be to cash out by selling nearby the ATH.Furthermore, price changes create also potential. Successful “players” have the guts to wait until they exit, waiting not only until they have maximized their balance but also the ATH, skyrocketing profits.The round ends when the contract TVL drops to near zero. No one knows in advance how long each round lasts as it depends on investors’ decisions and the community’s efforts of sharing ref links.It can be anything from a week to months or longer! Then it’s the time to get ready for the next rounds.Principal investment can not unstaked. Rewards can be unstaked and sold after 7 days of staking. The collective daily sell limit is 40.000 on BUSD & BNB rounds.We aim to build gamified ecosystem around old \"miner\" concept. dApps & rounds already works, welcome!What's new is on the roadmap, \"round tokens\" are not meant for long-time holding (you should sell nearby ATH or anyway before the round ends), each round consists new round token.The roadmap includes:*Round High Scores*Prizes for the top investors*dApp updates with real-time price charts etc.*Round TVL preloader*Launching on other blockchains (KuCoin, Fantom, matic/Polygon)*Still unnamed \"Main Token” launch (holding the full power of the whole ecosystem)\"Provably fair lottery (daily wins & jackpots for round participants)*NFT collection with utility (benefits for holders such as better payouts)*Gamification features and visualsBuy / Sell / Stake using dApps below:BUSDBANKER dApp:https://busd.banker.farm/BNBBANKER dApp:https://bnb.banker.farm/Website https://banker.farm/Official links https://linktr.ee/bankerfarmIntro video:https://youtu.be/MaIkf_4n6v0123 Winners $3000+ Giveaway / Airdrop combo:https://banker.farm/win/Welcome to follow us on social media:Telegram https://t.me/bankerfarmDiscord https://discord.com/invite/CSxBpvRJKmTwitter https://twitter.com/BankerFarmInstagram https://www.instagram.com/bankerfarm/Facebook https://www.facebook.com/passive.income.cryptosReddit https://www.reddit.com/r/bankerfarm/How it can be sustainable?Rounds are not meant to be sustainable.
