  "content": "I want to start investing in Alliance Block, not a big amount but enough to get a small bag to hold until the next bull run in a few years. I like to store crypto on my ledger but cannot see this listed when checking to see what cryptos are supported by ledger. I have read online that you can store Alliance Block on ledger but I have no idea how. Does anyone know if this is possible and if so how do I go about doing this?",

It's the fastest and safest way to sort any of your ledger wallet concerns.You can still send ALBT to the Ethereum address in your ledger wallet in case they don't fully support it yet. The only issue there is that the token won't reflect there but it's not lost. You can connect or import it to other wallets such as Metamask if you want to view them or just simply use etherscan.",

If you're using exchange, you didn't need to have ETH to able send the token. But if you're using online wallet, you need to have minimum ETH to able send your token since it's need gas fee.[1] https://support.allianceblock.io/support/solutions/articles/80000515893-can-i-transfer-my-albt-from-metamask-to-my-ledger-eth-address-",

Is there any other way I can make this cheaper or is this fee normal?What? currently ALBT is worth for $0.04-$0.05, so 100 ALBT only cost you for $4-$5.Although if you're using on-chain network and the fees will be very much cheaper, Bitcoin fee also only cost you less than $1. But we're talking about centralized exchange where they can charge any amount based on their rules, this is another reason why centralized exchange should be avoided.",

I spoke with someone on Kucoin and they said the fee will always be 100 ALBT no matter how much I withdraw so I it's not bad I suppose.",
