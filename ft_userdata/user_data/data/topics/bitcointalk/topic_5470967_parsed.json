  "content": "As the title says, I need around $8K USDT loan. Duration maximum 3 months but I am sure I will be able to repay long before the deadline.Interest: 0.17% per day on the base amount and will be paid at the time of repayment.Several lender can reach out because I am sure for one lender it seems a lot of money but if only one single lender can fulfill it then it's better for me.Please PM me on the forum only to receive the address. Only trusted users please.If we agree on the deal then you are required to post the amount sent (please don't post any address/transaction ID etc). At the time of repayment I will quote and confirm the repayment.Cheers,PS: My telegram @Royse777 in not available, I was giving wrong number several times and they locked me and suggested to try it later. I tried several times later but it was not working. So I am giving it 24 hours before trying again. Hopefully you will find me on Telegram from tomorrow but the exchange of wallet address and amounts will be handled via forum PM for security and reputation purpose.Edit: I just realized. I can do BTC collateral. For any amount larger than at least $2k",

But, I would be willing to do it in PMAs for the USDT, I can't. Since I only have BTC and am US (NY) based if I trade it to USDT it's going to have to be on a regulated exchange and the tax man is going to show up asking for their cut. OR going to one of the non KYC exchanges through a VPN and paying the fees. If nobody else steps up and you want to take the BTC let me know.-Dave",
