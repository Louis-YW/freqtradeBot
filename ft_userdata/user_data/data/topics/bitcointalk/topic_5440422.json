  "content": "I have a Barclays account in the United Kingdom and I intend to make a substantial purchase (several hundred thousand pounds’ worth) of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) in the coming weeks (early 2023). What is the best way to do this as securely and efficiently as possible, and with minimal friction on the banking side? I already have a verified account with Coinbase and I am already very comfortable with that already as I have already used Coinbase happily for several years -- but on all those previous occasions I funded my Coinbase account by sending the money from a different bank account in another country (not from Barclays and not from the UK). I have never sent money before from my Barclays U.K. bank account to any crypto exchange, whether Coinbase or otherwise.I assume that it should be possible to send the money as an international wire transfer from my Barclays UK bank account over to the Coinbase bank account in the U.S. (indicating my personal Coinbase account code in the ‘Reference’ section on the wire transfer instructions), and I assume that I should do this in person at a Barclays branch. I can break it up into multiple transfers over several weeks if needed, although I’d prefer to do it all in one or two transactions.My main concern right now is whether Barclays is going to freak out and hassle me (or worse) when I attempt to send large wire transfers to a crypto exchange (even to an established mainstream exchange such as Coinbase)?Any advice for sending money successfully from a Barclays UK account to fund a Coinbase account? Is this doable nowadays, or will my Barclays account get flagged or frozen?",
