Overcoming bear market is not easy in reality, you must have your good strategy and perfect timing or else you will just lose money again. Cryptomarket proves that they can rise again after the bear market, that’s a good assurance that investing on good projects can be more profitable.",

Whether bulls or bears, we want to see it at most time and that's what we want to see.That's why if I'm emotional, I'll just let it all alone and won't look at it every now and then. It is what I've used to do for any condition of the market until I've managed to have that plain emotion. But if you're not yet used to it, it can trigger you to sell at losses because you're looking at the numbers and the color red with your portfolio indicator which isn't really good.",

Hold your coins when there is a bear market which of course under your control the private key.A bear market is good for investors because it will give them a chance to invest in the market but it is frustrating if you are a holder which is the price down against the dollar. The real reason how to overcome the bear market is how to be a strong hand because holding in a long term will give you a best reward at the end.",

Dca is another way you can accumulate bitcoin in a bear market, and it is great to use it if you don't have any other strategy or means to go about things.",
