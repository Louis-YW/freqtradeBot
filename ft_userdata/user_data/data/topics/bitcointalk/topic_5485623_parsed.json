Alot of users here was introduced to bitcoin by a particular individual or by a certain event. Before they started researching deep about cryptocurrencies. And alot of users have to grow their knowledge of cryptocurrencies without knowing about this forum at first but ever since they migrated into this forum, the forum as also help them to enhance that previous knowledge they ones had. While some have to spend time (starting as a newbie)  in this forum before getting the real gist about bitcoin. So you don't have the right to decide who got to know about bitcoin or not to. Is in the individual hands telling yah friends and love ones about the beauty of investing and knowing about bitcoin you have already play your role as a good friend. Quote from: AVE5 on February 19, 2024, 01:07:52 AMContrarily this is also how some of our bitcoineers convinces unwilling individuals to get into the Bitcoin industry and Invest their funds with an explanatory manner of just focusing at making incomes while they ignores to explain about the risks involved to them and at the end of it they are held responsible for misleading them to the lost of their funds while the Bitcoin industry becomes a fraudulent technology to them due their lack of being oriented about the basics potentials of the Bitcoin technology. That the reason is always good to introduce bitcoin to your love ones and also Bitcointalk forum. So that they won't endup misleading theirselves investing in a certain wrong project (shitcoin) and endup regretting ever knowing about cryptocurrencies. Since have been in this forum haven't seen where any experience users or bitcoiners discussing about investing without mentioning the risk attached to that why is always advisable to invest on bitcoin because is more safer than investing in other altcoins.Quote from: AVE5 on February 19, 2024, 01:07:52 AMMost of the persons brought into this forum never had the passion being here in the first place but some of us ignores how substantial their contributions and what their unwilling potentials to the forum would result to. Yeah alot of users at first may endup not having any Passion about bitcoin. But as they spend more time in this forum and continue to see the beauty and the tremendous growth in bitcoin they would have a change in heart. And pretty sure that this forum as made alot of individual that at first was impassionate about bitcoin becoming very passionate. And am actually a proof of that at first when came to this forum with my half-size knowledge of this crypto space. At that time wasn't freak by bitcoin (not excited that much about it ) guess was because I didn't have much knowledge about it. But ever since I started understanding the concept of bitcoin due to the help of this forum and the knowledgeable users in it, I began to see the true beauty of bitcoin and now I'm damn passionate.",

This is a discussion forum, where the incentives should simply be the fact that there will be more people to converse with.As for incentivizing Bitcoin sort of \"evangelists\", you can incentivize through your own ways. Like how Andreas Antonopoulos grew a decently-sized YouTube channel, and sold a good number of books. If you're thinking of direct Bitcoin incentives, then lol that's one way of making it look like a total marketing scheme.Quote from: AVE5 on February 19, 2024, 01:07:52 AMThis might just sound uninteresting but it is pointing at those who are in competitive manners of brining in persons into the forum without being properly oriented.

Unfortunately, that's how manias work. We had a similar flooding of people in the pandemic where people flocked into stock markets because of boredom and due to the pursuit for income. The only difference is that hacks are a lot less damaging when talking about traditional markets.Quote from: AVE5 on February 19, 2024, 01:07:52 AMI don't know if these fellows who are desperate of brining people in to the platforms and in the Bitcoin industry are after of self recognition or whatever.Maybe, or maybe sometimes people are just too excited when they're making money that they want to talk about it.

There is no better than organic traffic and incentivized.  True, and it will be a hassle to invite or influence someone to do bitcoin or crypto currency stuff because they will keep on nagging you or asking you questions every single time. I have this experience where he discovers bitcoin because he sees me doing it, and from that he keeps on asking questions about bitcoin through me. At first, I'm willing to help and to guide, but later on, because I feel that he solely relies on me, I grow tired of it and say to him that instead of asking all things to me about crypto currency, why not join a forum, which is this forum? From that, he rarely asks me a question; instead, he focuses his attention on growing his account on this platform.There's no merit or benefit from pursuing others to join this forum or to influence them about crypto currency stuff, but if you know someone who needs this kind of forum, then I think it's right to share it with them.",
