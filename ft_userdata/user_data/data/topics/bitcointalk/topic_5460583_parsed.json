You first have to by crypto coins that you then transfer to a wallet. Use an exchange like Coinbase, krakenâ€¦ make a deposit, buy your preferred coin and then transfer it to a better wallet. If you have any question. Post it here.

The only issue is privacy.They probably asked for your coin address so that they know which blockchain/network you wanted to use",

Here are examples: Ethereum network USDC (ETH), Binance Smart Chain USDC (BSC), Polygon network USDC (MATIC), Tron network USDC (TRX), Arbitrum network USDC (ARB), Optimistism network USDC (OP). You can choose the network you want your USDC coin by copying the address and the moment a deposit is made, it would reflect on your wallet.But I wouldn't advise you to go for atomic wallet because it is closed source and was recently hacked and users funds were stolen. Buy and store your crypto funds using either a hardware wallet or open source wallets such as unstoppable wallet and only download from official website.",

It would have made sense to tell us about the questions you asked their support. That way we could tell you if their reply makes sense or not. USDC is a token that relies on a blockchain like Ethereum's or Tron's for transactions. To send USDC, you need the underlying network asset as well. So, if your are using the ERC (Ethereum) version of USDC, you will need to have ether to pay for the fees. The same is true for the other blockchains and their tokens. You will have to decide for yourself which of these networks and assets you want to use, and then purchase the needed USDC tokens + the native coins to pay for the transaction fees.Quote from: sheenshane on July 23, 2023, 12:14:14 PMIMO, they are acting like isn't a noncustodial wallet it seems a centralized one. They are not a decentralized wallet. That support rep that answered OP doesn't know the difference between decentralized and non-custodial. Atomic Wallet is supposedly non-custodial. I am saying supposedly because it can't be verified, and we had those hacking incidents that lack explanation of what happened. But Atomic Wallet isn't decentralized. And since OP wants to purchase their coins with fiat, they will have to undergo KYC as well.Â  Quote from: internetional on July 27, 2023, 07:06:20 PMUSDC is a custodial financial product. You give your dollars to Circle, they store your dollars and give you USDC tokens instead. Does it make sense to look for a non-custodial wallet for an asset which is custodial in its nature? It still makes sense using non-custodial wallets even if you are dealing with reversible coins/tokens like USDC. USDC and Circle as issuers can freeze your stablecoins in any address they please. It doesn't matter if the address belongs to a non-custodial wallet or it's from a centralized exchange. They can be frozen regardless. That's danger #1. Danger #2 exists with custodial wallets where the owners/developers/staff can also take your coins and prevent you from spending them. One good example is in the numerous scams we have seen by Freewallet. So if you are using a custodial service, you can have issues from two different sides. Regular users don't get their USDT/USDC or similar stablecoins frozen by the issuers just like that. If they claim they are, there is something they aren't telling you or they don't know the source of their coins perhaps. Getting into problems due to using custodial services is much more common and easily avoidable.Â  Â  Â Quote from: aylabadia05 on July 28, 2023, 12:53:36 PMWhen you need a wallet that supports more assets, use the Unstoppable wallet.This is probably the recommendation of many users who have used.

I am not saying it's bad, but it's a very weird product that I personally didn't like.It is difficult to find an open source, well-reviewed wallet that collects most of all altcoins in one place. You can find good wallets for the main blockchains, and then buying a hardware wallet is a better option for 90% of altcoins. Sometimes laziness is the motivation for people to download a wallet with the largest number of altcoins. some altcoins may need to be upgraded and forked, I read some stories that have tokens that have been frozen or burned and they do not realize that, unless you have time to follow news about altcoin, try to avoid investing in them.I don't think a wallet service that describes itself as a decentralized wallet is trustworthy or worth downloading.",
