  "content": "I just explored hard disk several days ago because I want to focus to download blockchain data to run the bitcoin core wallet or maybe next to run a full node.In general, there are 5 type of hard disk which is widely used1. Default Hard disk 2.5 SATAread and write between 50 - 120 MB/s2. SSD 2.5 SATAread and write between 200 - 550 MB/s3. Msata SSDread and write between 200 - 550 MB/s4. Msata M.2 SSDread and write between 200 - 550 MB/s5. NVME M.2 SSDthat 2 pictures Msata m.2 above and NVME M.2 SSD, as you can see the differentread and write NVME M.2 SSD is between can be 3000 - 7000 MB/sthat powerful, so what do you have to focus?, you have to focus on the shape of the slot on the laptop because each hard disk has the different slot. Old laptop gen 4 under doesn't have a slot for Msata M.2 SSD and Â NVME M.2 SSDI have ThinkPad i5 t420 that just have a slot for Msata SSD which was upgraded to 1 TB for bitcoin blockchain data yesterday,so if you have an old laptop and want to use NVME M.2 SSD, you can use it as an external by changing the target when run bitcoin core. just buy an additional case like below that you will able to run full node external with can read 5 GB/s data like the external hard disk. but it's still much cost.but, i heard research by Alvin Cox, JEDEC, that SSD drive is not safer to keep your data and will be lost in a couple of months if not turned on because SSD frive have limited life where different like HDD in general. so dwyor",

      "body": "You made some mistakes in your post, so I recommend that you correct them.In the \"Msata M.2 SSD\" section of your listing, you wrote: \"read/write between 2000-3500 MB/s\". However this is incorrect. Both classic SATA and mSATA offer the same data transfer speeds depending on the revision of the interface (SATA I, SATA II or SATA III). The mSATA and mSATA m.2 form factors are essentially smaller versions of the regular SATA interface that hard drives and SSDs conventionally use.The real boost in data transfer speed comes only with NVMe devices that use the PCIe interface instead of SATA, which provides a much more efficient way to transfer data.Using an NVMe device as an external storage really doesn't make sense, due to the speed limitation of USB interface. You can get the same data transfer speeds using everyday flash drives (with NAND flash memory), which are much cheaper and widely available.",

Also, SSD won't die just because you don't turn it on, most of the time it is caused by too much writing. You can learn more if you search about SSD write cycle.",

It is worse than HDD in data recovery and technical fixing.If you want to store Bitcoin blockchain data, choosing HDD is better than SSD.Blockchain data is available from thousands of nodes, there is nothing that is permanently lost because of a single drive failure, that's actually the sale point of a decentralized system, you lose the blockchain data on a failed drive you just put in a new one and resync from the network. Far easier than trying to recover it from a broken HDD.Anyhow, just go with a standard 1 TB SSD like the EVO series from Samsung, it's $80 right now and you won't need more space this decade.Quote from: Sarah Azhari on December 02, 2022, 02:34:32 AMI don't know what is the maximum age for the SSD?. but when read that article, 2 years is the maximum reached. so this is very inconvenient when running the bitcoin wallet is limited at that time and moving to a new SSD when reached maximum after 2 years.I bought my desktop SSD on 08.03.2018 according to the invoice in my email, HDD Sentinel says 1689 days and 15 hours of power on time, so, you can safely put 5 years minimum there.",
