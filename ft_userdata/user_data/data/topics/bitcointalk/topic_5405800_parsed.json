  "content": "Since its inception, Bitcoin has had a fluctuating price, with its initial price being $0. Bitcoin's price has demonstrated a tendency to increase in value rather than decrease, which has led many people to view it as the ultimate store of value despite the cryptocurrency's repeated crashes. And yet, after numerous crashes, how has Bitcoin managed to grow over time?The price of Bitcoin is mostly driven by DEMAND. The value of bitcoin will rise as long as demand is growing. In addition to surviving to recover from repeated collisions, it has also continued to expand and scale new heights.Source : https://www.makeuseof.com/why-is-bitcoin-going-up-cryptocurrency-rise/Source : https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-determines-value-1-bitcoin/Aside from market DEMAND, there are also several key factors affect Bitcoin price over the years namely:The supply of BitcoinThe cost of producing a bitcoin through the mining processThe number of competing cryptocurrenciesRegulations governing its sale and useMedia and newsSource : https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-determines-value-1-bitcoin/[moderator's note: consecutive posts merged]",

With each halving comes new news about the inflation in bitcoin being reduced and by the next halving it'll be lower than most if not all fiat currencies.",

While it might seem in the bubble of this forum that Bitcoin is very well-known, so many people have been using it for years and things like that, let's not forget that only up to 2% of the population use Bitcoin, so it's very far from being highly adopted, and we're still, regardless of how much publicity Bitcoin got over the years, are at early stage of adoption if we assume Bitcoin will become as widespread as smartphones or the Internet.As for the news, they can affect short-term Bitcoin trends, but I don't think they are a significant case of Bitcoin's overall growth over time. Also, I think the media largely publish what would be relevant for their audience, so if they cover Bitcoin, it's also about the demand for such coverage and is thus covered by the first cause.",

Bitcoin become famous due to it's new technology feature called blockchain which can rival fiat. This is the reason why many investors become a believer or hype to buy and invest on Bitcoin that creates the demand. The demand on Bitcoin doesn't magically appear out of nowhere. I just want to emphasize that it's new technology is the real reason for the continuous growth of Bitcoin price.Yes I agree, thanks for noting. I believe Bitcoin was the first application of blockchain and Bitcoin would not exist without blockchain.",

Whether we're having institutional adoptions, this is what they're also basing with their decisions.Just wait and see because when we're closer to the halving, this is going to cause many institutions going to have some sweet words again about bitcoin.",

The problem is, scarcity does not guarantee a high price, if there are no demand or use case for it.

When it comes to investing in financial technology that has the potential to revolutionize the world, Bitcoin is a wise choice. Due to its scarcity, Bitcoin's value may continue to rise.But Bitcoin can still decrease in value when unexpected things happen to Bitcoin that can cause Bitcoin holders to be afraid so they choose to sell all Bitcoins even though after everything is normal, they will also buy Bitcoins again. In this case I agree with what you say, because Bitcoin is indeed a very good investment and also Wise and has the potential to revolutionize the world. But you can also compare the current value of Bitcoin with last year where the difference is very far, even though in general Bitcoin will continue to be scarce.",

Most of them have already been mentioned and despite the fact that demand plays important role now, there is one other key aspect that is the predictable and small increase of new supply. This small increments of supply makes it way harder to debase its value just like what happens in fiat money!Other than that, you just need to learn about sound money, and all properties of sound money are in Bitcoin, therefore, nothing else could happen other than a value increase over time!",

Bitcoin mining will be profitable even at 1000$ just how it was 6 years ago, it's not a thing like any other industry, if somebody goes bankrupt you get a bigger pie of the rewards with the exact cost, and you don't have to increase production to offset the balance you don't have to do anything.The only thing that is changing every day with every move is the security of the network and the amount of $ you need to attack it.Quote from: kudosinitchi on July 10, 2022, 03:08:47 PMAside from market DEMAND, there are also several key factors affect Bitcoin price over the years namely:The supply of BitcoinThe cost of producing a bitcoin through the mining processThe number of competing cryptocurrenciesRegulations governing its sale and useMedia and newsAll of them are components that trigger demand, they are not independent of it or standalone.The number of competing currencies affects demand, the regulations and usage affect demand, and media and news trigger demand for coins.All those \"key\" factors affect demand, and the only thing that affects the price directly is demand and offer.You can have the media show things about the advantages of bitcoin 24/7 if there won't be any demand for the coins, news won't affect the price at all.Quote from: ChrisPop on July 10, 2022, 03:57:44 PMYou could argue that every asset value in this world is driven by demand. In other words prices go up when there are more buy orders than sell orders for a certain price.There is no arguing about it, every single thing in this world is driven by demand and offer unless you have a government intervention restricting the free market and either forcing or subsidizing the price.",

(demand is the same each year)however in year one there is only 10 items of needed function and utility. and so price is 1 item per $200however next year demand does not increase. instead the items are only 5 items of needed utilityeach person only gets 0.5 for $200 meaning 1 item per $400its not all driven by demand. its driven by many factors. the reason people want bitcoin is not simply because someone else wants it(demand) its because they themselves see utility in it, a need they see fits their life, a purpose it solves in their life, an expectation they see it fulfilling in their life.also theres things like how can they acquire it.some can mine for it. which does not impact the price market because they are not buying on a marketsome decide its cheaper than their regional mining costs to buy it and so they do. this is not \"demand\" this is supply. and not scarcity supply. but instead cost supply of method of acquisition.some people also set up stores and sell goods to acquire itpeoples hopes, desires, needs, and purpose for wanting bitcoin and method of getting bitcoin is not all simply the silly high school economics 10minute lesson of \"demand\".. there is more to it",

Bitcoins are limited in supply. So when the demand increases the supply becomes less and hence the price rises.And as the time passes by, more people come to know about Bitcoins and therefore increasing the demand to buy it.Hence when the demand of the coin increases, more people try to buy it in exchanges and therefore, the price rises.",
