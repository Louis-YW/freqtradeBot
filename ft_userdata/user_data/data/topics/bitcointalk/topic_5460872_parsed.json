Or you plagiarize and trying to avoid plagiarism and reword what you plagiarized so you used those tools for more correction in a way to avoid ban? Because if you do not plagiarize, you do not need plagiarism checker. Also the same goes to the use of AI to post on this forum. I neither use plagiarism checker not any AI tool for my posts.",

If you don't copy text from other sources and don't use AI chat, then you don't have to be afraid of being banned - the only thing that can happen to you is that your post will be deleted because someone reported it as spam, low value or repetitive content.Therefore, I would advise you to review previous posts before writing a post and to definitely avoid megathreads in which there really isn't anything new to write.",

You can check this link  Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQ.Plagiarism is a common problem since its a forum we do write a lot here and there are just a lot of members that doesnt want to participate on that and they tend to just copy and paste articles on the internet thinking that it might be helpful and probably get merit as well using that. I mean it's easy if you dont know about the topic just dont comment on it and avoid copying something on the internet there is a very low chance that your gonna get plagiarism especially if you're just constructing your post by yourself, plus you could also use the plagiarism checker as you said, it also detects AI work I think.",
