Just a correction, these all are p2p exchanges but some of them require KYC like p2p platforms like Paxful and Noones have mandatory KYC.Out of all the listed platforms I have experience with Paxful and Noones, and ironically both are similar in terms of UI except the color difference but liquidity in Paxful for BTC/INR is lot higher comparing Noones, so my first preference will be Paxful.It is just a p2p which has no issues related to deposits/withdrawals/etc but finding the right trader/merchant is in our hand that determines the security of our bank account too.",

I have not used any of the above listed exchanges for INR transactions, so I could not comment on INR trust. I did not face any issues using these two exchanges for USDT conversion as the transaction went smoothly without any issues. In general, P2P exchanges have a good reputation for buying and selling cryptocurrencies, converting to fiat currencies can be tricky. Quote from: Bitcoin Smith on December 06, 2023, 11:37:30 AMJust a correction, these all are p2p exchanges but some of them require KYC like p2p platforms like Paxful and Noones have mandatory KYC.Paxful and Noones are both the same exchanges if I am not wrong as Noones was started when Paxful was supposedly getting closed. I was not aware that they require KYC as I was under the impression that the do not ask for KYC till a certain amount. For example, before Kucoin implemented strict KYC they would allow up to 2 BTC worth of transactions without KYC. I thought the same for those two exchanges, they might have changed their policy I guess.",

Yeah the second point is the actual issue, we never know the source of funds from the other party which can become an issue even after 6 month after the trade happened by then we will be affected and our account will be frozen that is why it is better to go with KYC p2p exchanges in my opinion.",

You would need a lot of patience when using the exchange as tend to get disconnected quite frequently. BTC/INR issue is a big one and things get much riskier when trade is done on a P2P exchange. As I have explained in another post UPI transaction causes many issues due to the easy chargeback feature. Regardless of using a KYC or non-KYC P2P exchange, you do take the risk of getting into the trap of a scammer. We all know how easy it is for a scammer to pass KYC using fake documentation as there were a lot of such cases reported in the mainstream newspaper earlier this year. Until regulation comes into effect I think it is better to use direct exchange transactions and this is why I created this topic to find out how many of us have trust in the listed P2P exchanges. Till now I have seen very less responses, might be that people do not want to disclose this information on a public platform or they are using CEX for INR transactions.",

I wouldn't say easier but its not impossible either because exchanges added liveness test which is video selfie verification along with ID submission so its not that easy to get verified like years back in most of the exchanges but scammers always finds a way to bypass it or the easy way is to buy the hacked exchange accounts from dark net for a hundred dollar then they can make 1000 before the account gets reported.",

They can achieve things that other scammers would not dare to try. Heard a few hour back that in the India Blockchain week confrence that is being held in Bangalor,e one of our MP named Jayant Sinha has said it will take another 18 months for crypto regulation. Which means the bill  will be passed after the central election. I am assuming it would be in 2025 that we will see proper regulations around crypto in India.",

It uses TOR which makes it slow, knowing the way the internet in India works who will wait for it to load? It has INR/BTC and BTC/INR pairs but no security to guarantee the funds are legit. That is how Indians feel and that is the reason we Indian are still behind as we hate to take risks. Like a few of us, we use the forum as a form of notification and then post the requirement on Bisq the problem will be solved. Whereas we all are busy selling out Bitcoin rather than investing in it by buying more on Bisq. Most of us use the forum as a second income as we should have used it as a way to become financially independent.",

The congestion has been going on for the last 2 months and we all know it is temporary, and it will not affect the growth of BTC in any way, we are just less than a year ahead of halvening so there is good chance that BTC price will be doubled, so the holders are going to keep HODLing it. In India particularly there is no business that accept Bitcoin for payments, there used to be one restaurant but RBI shadowbanned it they went off so that part we don't need to worry about it now and the crypto investors in India will come clean only if government comes up with fair tax rates or else they are going to keep losing millions in revenue.",

Transaction fees are crazy at the moment and the whole network is so congested that it cannot be described. I have never seen insane amount of Satoshi high priority transactions. Reminds of the time when Ethereum network was going through such a situation until they decided to shift from POW to POS. It will take a hit in adoption of Bitcoin in the long run if the situation remains the same for some more months.",
