I am just kind of surprised that you are just hearing about bitcoin recently. If you have been on social media before, I am sure you will have heard about bitcoin even before now, but you are not still late. Welcome to the forum, and all this necessary information that you need has already been provided for you. Just take your time and go through them, and if there is anything that you don't understand, you can easily ask here and forum members will respond to you. But make sure you don't plagiarize because that's one of the offenses that I notice is popular among the newbies on the forum here.",
