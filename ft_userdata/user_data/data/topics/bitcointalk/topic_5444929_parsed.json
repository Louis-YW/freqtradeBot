Here everyone will find something interesting to look into or discuss. But since you created a topic on development board, I assume that you kind of interested in the technicalities behind bitcoin, which is why I'd suggest several useful sources of technical information (order is important):1) https://www.swanbitcoin.com/inventing-bitcoin/2) https://learnmeabitcoin.com/ 3) https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf4) https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook5) https://www.lopp.net/bitcoin-information/getting-started.html",

It is possible to do one without the other.You say you love Bitcoin, but do you already have the technical knowledge about BTC and now want to start coding or do you love the concept, but still need to learn how Bitcoin actually works?If you don't want to write your own programs such as Core Lightning plugins or other applications on Bitcoin, you don't really need to learn programming.To learn more about the technical aspects of BTC, I like to recommend Mastering Bitcoin. Maybe get the paper version so you can take it anywhere and highlight / bookmark certain pages.If you want to learn programming 'for Bitcoin', you should get started with generic programming tutorials like YouTube video series, blogs and the like. There are enough free resources online. Something like this: https://www.learnpython.org/",

      "body": "Do not start with Bitcoin start by learning a programming language and then come back to Bitcoin development because it will make more sense to you. If you start with Bitcoin development you are not learning the fundamentals of a programming language and you will learn a lot slower. Learn programming any programming language and then you only need to learn the syntax for another language you will learn all the same fundamentals what ever the programming language is. The most important thing to do is start learning now.",

When you already learned how Bitcoin's basic functions are, it's time for you to learn a programming language called C++ and also start to learn Bitcoin coding.  AFAIK, Python or JavaScript are the most common for a newbie language.  Might you'll also learn how to build a decentralized application or (dApp) in the future. So good luck to you, while gathering information, you can stay here in the forum and ask questions.",

But it is an important stage that requires patience, discipline, dedication and commitment. How you learn about bitcoins becomes your foundation and it matters. You will learn better about something when you have the interest to help you keep learning even at stages where it seems like understanding is now a problem. You already have interest in learning about bitcoin, and that is key. Everyone with knowledge about bitcoins got it by acquisition, they did not know about bitcoins automatically, but they heard about bitcoins and devoted their time and self to learning about it just like you are about to begin. Do not assume you know anything, learn and read about bitcoins from the basics before you slowly advance into more advanced knowledge.The fact that you have also become a user in this forum, consistently reading, researching and engaging meaningfully in discussions concerning bitcoins will help you become sharper in knowledge. You also now have the benefit of having a community to bring questions and concerns to, many people did not have that at the early stages of them learning about bitcoins, so that's also a good advantage you have.",

I mean if you start investing and trading on bitcoin and cryptocurrency you could learn it already plus you could easily add the knowledge you learn here in the forum, or you could also ask here in the forum if you need help with anything related to bitcoin and cryptocurrency.Programming is pretty fun actually but you just need to put a lot of time and effort into it, I mean if you planning to develop projects on blockchain, cryptocurrency, NFT projects, contracts, etc. that's the part where you need to learn to programming, It was pretty much in demand this day and pay a very good amount of money, plus company hires developers and programmers most of the time so if your interested you could do that as well, all you need is google and youtube, etc.",
