      "body": "Hi Tadako YokoWelcome to BitcointalkIt would be good to provide more details about your projects and goals from the marketing campaign. Campaign managers will need this information to decide whether or not they want to reach out to work with you. I believe that this information can be publicly available and there is no need for private communication.In general, if you are looking for a campaign manager, it is best to contact him yourself, and I can assure you from my website that there are many reliable and good campaign managers whose integrity you can verify by checking the history of their activity.I can recommend that you contact Royse777, who is considered one of the best campaign managers currently. Here are some useful links to contact him:Profile link: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=366632Portfolio:  Bitcointalk Campaign ManagementÂ  Signature & BountyTelegram contact: https://t.me/royse777Wish you the best of luck.Regards",

I stopped responding in threads because some of the members are too busy criticizing me for whatever reasons they have. When they see that I am trying to have a discussion with a potential client, they start sending cherry-picked comments via Private Messaging to convince the potential client with negativity so that they don't take my service. Well, it doesn't always work, or I wouldn't have so much business.With me, you are going to get the best possible return on your investment. The brands I am working with serve as a reference for this bold statement. You will not regret the decision to work with me if you choose to do so. I look forward to having a discussion so that we can understand each other better.Regardless of whether we work together or not, my best wishes are always for the success of your project.Looking forward. Cheers, If you have doubt and not comfortable with me then you already have two campaign mangers who showed their interest too. Little Mouse and yahoo62278. Both are highly qualified to give you good service. I hope it helps.",
