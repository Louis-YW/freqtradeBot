Don’t ever chase a project, if its too late to buy then so be it because you might got trap and you might not be able to sell it at profit anymore. 100x might not happen this year, as it is still down from its ATH, and its current price is down again.",

China's manipulation strategy is not arbitrary, it is appropriate that the country is called extraordinary, on the other hand China is the largest bitcoin holder after America. don't get carried away easily by FUD news, just understand what meme project will have a long future obscure concept it's too rare to survive. altcoins apart from meme coins which are definitely a lot to hold on to for the long term.",

Anyone who has been buying this stupid token during the pump already lost a lot on their assets. it's not even worthy to be owned for the long term hold. The drastic pump was just happening a few hours and it will back to the bottom again.",

Any meme token with an unfamiliar trace to the information on it background developers is a risk and nothing more, they are fast increasing the numbers of tokens being introduced and many people believed that they can quickly seize an advantage in making a quick time profit on them within just a short period of time, the truth is that the developers matters here, if they are not of higher standard of reputation it will only end in waste of money because many have been scammed through these same procedures after which the developers were found hyping their scam token.",

FOMO is very powerful the subject token have a very bullish signal in a form of big news event. People think the price will not go down when the hype is still very strong that’s why many newbie traders are being left out by whales that use their money as an exit liquidity from this money making shitcoin.Buying this very token is what I really done understand. This coin is pure garbage and feeding on the hype. Meme coins use any possible news to convert it for a bullish news. It's better to place your money as bet on gambling rather than a shitcoin without a future.",
