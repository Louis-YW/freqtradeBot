  "content": "PRIVATE ISLAND IN THE BAHAMAS SEEKS BITCOIN LIGHTNING WALLET PROVIDER PARTNERSHIPChub Cay, an island in the Bahamas, is actively looking for a Lightning Network wallet provider to launch a bitcoin standard to pioneer financial inclusion.QuoteChub Cay is an island located in the Bahamas and is currently looking for a Bitcoin Lightning Network wallet provider to partner with.Chub Cay Resort and Marina conducted an internal survey showing over 50% of its employees want at least some of their paychecks in bitcoin.The lack of banks and financial education in the area make using traditional banking systems inefficient and at certain times, impossible.Source ---> https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/chub-cay-seeks-to-adopt-a-bitcoin-standardI did a Google search and found that the island's area is very small, so they will not have international banking services. Do you think that Bitcoin might be a good alternative for these countries where it is difficult to establish a banking infrastructure? If that's true, we have millions, maybe billions of people who don't have a bank account or can easily send money around the world.",

Bitcoin doesn't need government approval'.",

Quote from: LeGaulois on July 22, 2022, 01:04:56 PMYes, millions are unbanked (just in the US 25% of US households are either unbanked or underbanked, that mean millions of people) but they don't need to wait for their government to do something. Bitcoin doesn't need government approval'.Unfortunately, most of these people are not at all interested in being part of any system, be it government and private banks or something they understand even less like Bitcoin. If they ever decide to try Bitcoin, the truth is that they won't have to ask permission from anyone, which is certainly a big advantage compared to many things in life.One of my neighbors once told me that there will come a time when you will have to ask for permission even to go to the toilet, and now that I see all the measures they have in store for us in the fall/winter, I wouldn't be surprised if they start restricting us in this regard as well",

But as mentioned above we are talking about the issues of 20 people but it can be an example for others as well especially for people who need to transfer funds across the borders because they can save lot of fees with sending money via Bitcoin.",

Bitcoin can offer something for them especially to replace other money transfer providers. Maybe they can request that visitors can also payfor goods and services with Bitcoin?Indeed as they are a private island they can* do what they like* and can all agree or disagree on what route they take, seeing as there are only 46 of themit should be easy.* give the two fingers to any international banking and runn with Bitcoin.",

In addition to that, based on the type of services that are being offered on that island, there isn't an urgent need [almost] for a confirmation [on-chain TXs should be fine].Yeah, I don't get it either.It's a private company, if they are already accepting Bitcoin, why do they seek some partnership when that's the whole idea of bitcoin, to get rid of the third party? Do they want a centralized solution in which they will not own their funds?I think the owner of this island has the wrong view or somebody is trying to sell him something that it's not needed.QuoteThe lack of banks and financial education in the area make using traditional banking systems inefficient and at certain times, impossible.Since almost all of the population is actually hired by the company that owns the island I don't think that really something they would want to advertQuote from: aoluain on July 27, 2022, 05:46:49 PMIndeed as they are a private island they can* do what they like Being a private island doesn't make it an independent nation, it just means that the entire island is the property of somebody, it's still a Bahamas territory and still the laws of the Bahamas apply there.",

Since no bank will be interested in setting up their operations for such a small population, there's no other way either. Since this island solely depends on tourism, such kind of initiative may attract bitcoin population to their island. Slowly we are getting there!",
