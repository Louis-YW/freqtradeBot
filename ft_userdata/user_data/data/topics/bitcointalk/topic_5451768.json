  "content": "Bitcoins has become a global currency and  topic discussed in every corner of the world. There has been many school of taught regarding bitcoins, however, bitcoins remain unique in itself and it’s usecases. With the global awareness on bitcoins via many medium, there is still fear in the heart of many, stopping them from joining the bitcoins space. That Bitcoin is the king of all Cryptocurrency and it is full of transparency is an undoubted truth.The fear associated with bitcoins is from other Cryptocurrencies. The issue of scam has become a major threat to those who are new to the system. Many curious and profit driven persons have fallen for scammers with the hope to making it big. Due to this occurrence , many person have classified all cryptocurrency as the same.Scam Cryptocurrency project, fake project promises has slow down the global acceptance of bitcoins. Since bitcoins is unique with a clean track record, I will suggest that:•   There should be an institution set up by core Bitcoin Blockchain and other chain Developers that will oversea and audit new Crypto project.•   After auditing, they will also be responsible for the announcement of the genuineness of the project. •   They will also help track down project owner if it happens that  there is any form of scam. •   They will help investors get their funds in the case of scam. •   This single institutions will have their branches across the world to make it easier for them.•   They should also work with social media to curb the spread fake project by verifying every crypto project on their social media. •   They will also be on the lookout to fight and bring down every scam project with immediate effect.I don’t think the multiple auditing companies we have is helping matters. This are just my suggestion to fighting for bitcoins reputation before the novice.what are your thought on this, is this possible or it's already in place",

I do not think the Bitcoin core should take responsibility for the entire cryptocurrency industry by creating a service that will review and filter upcoming projects.  It will hinder the growth of Bitcoin development since their attention will be focused on the filtering of incoming projects.  So I don't think making the Bitcoin core do the filtering is a wise decision.QuoteAfter auditing, they will also be responsible for the announcement of the genuineness of the project. It is obvious that whoever does the audit should do the announcement themselves.QuoteThey will also help track down the project owner if it happens that there is any form of scam. Lol, from auditing to an announcement to tracking people who conduct scam why it should be the Bitcoin core?  I can only say, let the government do their jobs of protecting their citizen from any form of scam.",
