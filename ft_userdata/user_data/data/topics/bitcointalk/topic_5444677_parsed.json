Â Your topic was moved because someone reported it, moderators in most cases do not act in a way to moderate something by themselves. In addition, there are moderators, global moderators and admins, and they have different powers on the forum.And yes, we also have a special thread for those who want to celebrate some of their achievements on the forum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5391471.0",

You were able to do it and the number of days spent is no longer significantOf course, there are fond memories. It was Full member that made me feel that a rank increase was possible. Exactly how long it took me to get this rank, I don't remember. That's what my first avatar was like, if I'm not mistaken, it was an image of a ledger hardware wallet. Then I didn't know yet that this company would get into a big mess with a data leak and set up its users great. And, 2 times. Otherwise, it would not even have arisen in my thoughts to put that avatar.",

I agree that it's not mandatory, but things like this are much better so reputation boards don't have so many achievement thread.The thread self-moderated by BitcoinGirl.Club has been quite active [13 pages] since its creation, so I think a lot of user have noticed and most user have been there to announce the milestone. Nevertheless, good job OP - congrats on your achievement.",

It's not easy when you desperately want to reach the next level. But, You are passionate about something. You won't realize that time is going fast and you will reach the desired rank. I see you are too excited about your rank-up. I saw you write good posts in Bitcoin Discussion threads. Sometimes joining Signature campaigns drops the post quality drastically. I hope it won't happen to you. I hope the new rank gave you a considerable boost inside.",
