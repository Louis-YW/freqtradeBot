  "content": "I was finally able to buy my house thanks to Bitcoin guys!!!I had sold some of my BTC back in November 2021, and since that moment I was waiting to find the right opportunity, the right house. Now it's done, I've found it and I am more than happy to know that I own this security.I had no other FIAT savings, no stock in the stock market, everything of value I own I was able to acquire only through BTC. I know it's not reasonable, nor necessarily intelligent, but heh, when you are born broke and have no diploma, no inheritance, BTC is still one of the few real hopes to improve one's social condition and living conditions. At least from my point of view..I'm just under 30, and after 5 years of doing ALL IN in BTC I don't regret it.I started out with just a backpack, a few hundred dollars and an old Thinkpad. I spent hours, dozens of hours reading about BTC and economy, lurking here, without even having an account for most of the time. Back in the time, I had sold some of my BTC after a pump to get a place to live (I mean to be able to rent an stable apartment and stopping to sleep in a fucking Citroen C3, or shitty Airbnbs), to get a degree and especially to buy some Antminers. I've solo mined BCH (yes I know, don't judge me, the difficulty was much lower than BTC and my hashrate was low...) and I had a lot of luck: a lot of blocks.All these blocks rewards, I instant swapped them for BTC, and I held until the end of 2021, where I secured part of the profits by reselling. I continue to hold the rest of these BTC but those will be used to pay for my future retirement.All of you here, regular and quality contributors, you and Bitcoin have allowed me to have a degree, a job I love, two years of wonderful travels, and finally the security of a home. I sincerely want to thank you all, I guess for most of you it doesn't mean much, but some of you helped me change my life, and even all the Merits in the world wouldn't be enough to show my gratitude.  I will spend my time as much as possible to give back to the community, to the begginers starting their Bitcoin journey. I am not the most knowledgeable but I will try to learn more each day, and to share what I know when I could help.",

Dodging tax? How did you buy your home when they check where the funds came from?  Thank you   I would also like to know how many people have been able to change their lives thanks to BTC, for example access to private property or healthcare, it would be interesting to have access to a sociological study of the \"winners and losers\" of Bitcoin, that could be very interesting from my point of view.I don't dodge my taxes tbh, I'm in a country where they are relatively low (for example less than 100 usd per year in property taxes, 10% flat tax on all incomes, 10 % on cryptos profits when >3k / year etc.). On the other hand, if I had stayed in my native country, I would probably have tried to avoid them (there it's in the 33% minimum on crypto profits and on incomes...)",

Perhaps congratulation Yeah I will hold until next ATH, even if I won't sell all my sats, I want to keep some BTC for the (very) long term. Personally I think there is still time to accumulate more BTC until we'll see next ATH ; the next halving is in 1 year and previously it took several months / a year before it was reflected in its fiat price. But who knows ?  Quote from: BADecker on March 16, 2023, 03:29:27 AMCongratulations. I only bought a car.     Thank you ! Congrats to you too !    I think that it is very good for yourself to buy something thanks of the increasing value of BTC, and good for the whole community, as it shows concrete examples of one of the interests of Bitcoin holding.I just hope that the car you bought was not a 2003 Ford Taurus    Like in this famous meme :Quote from: DeathAngel on March 18, 2023, 11:44:23 AMCongratulations OP, you can be so proud of what you’ve achieved, at still a young ago too.

I hope that my story, even if it is a modest success, could give inspiration and faith to continue the BTC journey to the newcomers !I will definitely stay around here as long as I can, I really enjoy the community, and the ton of knowledge this forum contains. I learn a lot here, spend hours of reading and for now, I've never regret the time spent here",

But so far, it is still not enough, still need to work more and save more. Hopefully, in the next bullish era, I will be really able to buy a house for my family. I ma always dreamed and thought to be able to buy it, and this is a high expectation, but with more effort, probably I will have the chance. Because as you said, I have no wealth from inheritance or I will not be able to get a loan to buy a house or rely on other people. only myself can realize what my hopes.Your achievement right now is very amazing, but I don't know what kind of obstacles you have been passing so far.
