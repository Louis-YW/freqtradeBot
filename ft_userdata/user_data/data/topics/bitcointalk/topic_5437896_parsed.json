      "body": "I think it’s a good idea to risk a small % of your available capital yes. The case against the SEC caused a lot of FUD so most people have steered away from XRP. The fundamentals are the same though, it is a good investment with good utility. It has the potential to bring massive profits. For this reason I would be happy to buy now & wait, in the hope that XRP wins the court case & goes on a big run.",

It has already been on its ATH before but another bull run has came but didn't go back there. Yeah, the case might be one reason why it didn't go up again.But for some reasons, many investors are avoiding it until the case is clear but for me even if they will be cleared and win the case still, there won't be that much difference from the current side that it has got right now. It's known for being centralized but many likes its cheap and fast transfer so we'll see.",

In 2017 and 2021, they reached all-time high 3$ (2017) with Bitcoin ATH 20,000$ meanwhile on 2021 they only reached 1,8$ with Bitcoin ATH 60,000$.They cannot make a new all time high, meanwhile other crypto can reached to next level.

This is just came from basic speculation.I think this happened because of the case that hit XRP vs SEC. This has already been mentioned by @hugeblack. IMO, traders and whales may not want to take the risk if one day the SEC wins the case. Thats why XRP trading activity was not that strong when BTC reached a new ATH. I also agree, for now and in the future bullish period, it is likely that this weak XRP bullish event will still occur, if the case is still not resolved. Also, XRP need another \"McAffee\" to pump their coins. I remember, XVG and XRP getting pumped 2017 because of him",

And the SEC is constantly tailing them so it's not worth the anxiety to see your investment just going sideways for a long time and instead of seeing gain after years you are losing.  I do hope they win against SEC though. But in the long run, it's not worth it. You can however use the XRP in exiting from an exchange and cash out which is a quick process.",

Now it is possible to invest in ripple, because after the current general price drop, this is one of the top coins that will continue to grow in price. Especially if, as expected, Ripple Labs wins the lawsuit filed against it by the SEC. However, then you need to track this project again and make decisions, since very often the price of this coin practically does not grow for a long time. Too much centralization of this coin often scares off investors.",
