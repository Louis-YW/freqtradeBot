I need a way to get reliable fee estimation for 2 blocks ETA. Any suggestions?Mempool.space has the most accurate bitcoin transaction fee estimator, so, use them the next time.Electrum and many other wallets can't calculate transaction fees accurately, so, never rely on them or you'll either pay very high fee and waste money for nothing or pay very low fee and will have to wait for days to get your transaction confirmed but problem can easily be solved anytime if you have enabled RBF which I strongly recommend.Also, keep in mind that there are times when fee fluctuates and if you see that mempool.space recommends, for example, 40 sat/vByte, the next minute it can grow up to 70 sat/vByte and you may have to increase it via RBF.To sum up: Stick with mempool.space and enable RBF in your Electrum. You'll never have a problem of fee estimation or delayed confirmations.",

Why is everyone overestimating miner fees?Because some (not bitcoinfees as that is broken by design) don't estimate the minimum reqyuired, they estimate a fee that will guaratee you you will get a spot in the next block, so on top of the previous block fees they throw other variables there, inflating the fee sometimes twice to the minimum of the last 60 blocks, as the crappier ones do.And if you do that you encounter avergaes like 110sat/vb like in block 816330 for example, thus the misleading calculations.Some are even broken the other way as bitcoin fees tell you you will get a confirmation of 11.92 sat/vB in 24 hours, yeah...try that!Also, be careful, some use sat/b some sat/vb, this is really bad when you try to use Viabtc accelerator, which uses 10sat/b as minimum.Quote from: PepeLapiu on November 11, 2023, 08:05:02 PMI need a way to get reliable fee estimation for 2 blocks ETA. Mempool.space is as good as it can get.But it too has flaws as nobody can predict when the next block will be mined, for example, the last block, 816348 took 30 minutes instead of 10, so from the previous minimum of 30sat/vb you're up to 60, the fee that was good 40 minutes ago for next block is not good even for two now.",

Both are in electrumThe best is to calculate yours using that estimator used above or check memepool.space but be rest assured that none are 100% accurate so the best thing is to use an RBF wallet set the fee and if it need bumping you can do that",

If you need to get into the next block , always use a higher fee than the minimum,Â  and using RBF is very good to, as you can change your fees if the transaction fee rate gets much higher",

They spoke about updates at BTC conference. Actually it's called \"Transaction Acceleration Marketplace\" where you rely on mining pool to include your TX by paying them other ways. In practice, it's not really different from using ViaBTC paid acceleration service. But with more node and pool support full-RBF, you could just perform full-RBF rather than using one of these acceleration service.It was on paper at least a bit different, as in being way cheaper than paying for accelerators as you would pay just as much as needed.So you had a tx of 10sat/b, Foundry would include it in the next block and then they would check what tx they had to kick out to include yours and if that one was at 60sat/b you would only pay the difference, so it would be a bit superior to RBF as you would pay the minimum necessary to get in the block and the mining pool won't lose a penny either compared to ViaBTC free.But that was how it would have worked, IF!",
