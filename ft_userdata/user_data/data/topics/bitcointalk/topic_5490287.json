Just my 2 cents.",

And as much as we like to see changes in Bitcoin, core developers will have to come up with consensus and it's not going to be easy.For environmental sustainability, it's not Bitcoin per se, but those who produces mining hardware and what renewable sources this miners are going to used as this is one attacks that anti-Bitcoin is when they try to picture it as the one hurting the environment as it consumes a lot of energy for mining.",

Another thing that could happen would be more people trying to make technology that involves bitcoin or anything like that, probably a better mining rig that can outperform the current one that most miners got, hell we might even see a rig that you can plug to your computer and mine bitcoins for you.",

I think the scalability, security, core principles of decentralization and environmental issues in the Bitcoin ecosystem and those four aspects are also things that we should know together both the progress and development of this innovative technology and I think the benefits are not only for the Bitcoiner community but the direction is towards sustainable adoption. Yes.  The four aspects that you conveyed are also basic foundations in the ecosystem and  if see BTC price up generally sound  the problem is always in high fees due to the increasing number of users and transactions and of course and this is also considered quite troublesome also for users. Well, for other advanced aspects I think the efforts that have been seen now are like there are Layer 2 Solutions such as Lightning Network,  There are continuing efforts to optimize Block Size and Transaction Throughput as well as Sustainable Mining Practices. But from what I've written, it's most likely just a general, but at least that's what I've known and been following for this time.",

I don't think the developers will find a solution to combat against high fees because with the high adoption and we want a secure network, high fees is inevitable.",

Like who would have thought we can do staking in BTC and can use BTC for dapps. And who knows what is coming next?
