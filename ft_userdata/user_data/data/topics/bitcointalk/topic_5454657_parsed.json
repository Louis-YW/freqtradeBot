  "content": "The title is basically the entire question so If you know you can skip the story below!I'm dealing with a ton of transactions, I have wallets over wallets and inputs over inputs, there is no way I'm consolidating them now and I'm nearly at the the end of my wits with selecting form coin control the exact amount to minimize the size. Two months ago, while paying for the thousandth time the wrong fee I suddenly found out that one of my exchanges grabbed the funds from deposit address with a CPFP payment to their storage. As good things are not long lasting the trick isn't working anymore for about two weeks ago, so looking for alternatives since 5-10$ a day every day is a bit too much and I'm so low on fiat I'm scrapping the barrel.That said, opened to absolutely any money/fee saving advice!",

Make use Viabtc's TX accelerator, see: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/Quote from: Potato Chips on May 31, 2023, 10:19:40 AMYou could only use it to reduce/save fee on \"your\" transactions. For instance, if you setup a transaction in a way where it meets Viabtc's minimum conditions, you could stay below the recommended fee rate and still have your transaction confirmed within a reasonable amount of time.2.

Make use Viabtc's TX accelerator, see: https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/Tried it, a bit of help but they still ask for 10 satoshi but per byte not virtual byte , that's more and they put a limit on 500 bytes as I would end up paying again a bit more since I can't consolidate 100 inputs in one but at max 3 or 4, I can't remember which one is it. It does help when the normal is over 50, but I hope those times will be gone soon!Quote from: Potato Chips on May 31, 2023, 10:19:40 AM2. Look into exchanges that supports LN, see: https://lightningnetworkstores.com/?tags=exchangeIf you're not familiar with LN, see: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5158920.0+1 for this, thanks.Bitstamp is allowing LN deposits, if true this is news for me, haven't used it since they asked me for proof of income but at this point I risk losing my income so be it!Now, the pain in the ass to convince clients to use LN since all my deals are on chain and paying to fund a channel ain't free either.",

If exchange is good, they will not need that. They charge withdrawal fees that are higher than required, and the real withdrawal fees are low, given that the number of inputs is one while there are several outputs. exchange may own a mining pool or have a connection to a mining pool, which enables them to include transactions in the nearest block they mine without paying high fees.Most platforms do not process the withdrawals of individuals separately, they are batching all in one transaction.Â  your withdrawal transaction will have one input and more than 50 outputs. This transaction has low fees, for example, 20 dollars, while they ask 15 dollars for each of the 50 outputs.if the fees suddenly increase, all they do is suspend withdrawals or manually edit fees.",

They only make transactions once you already trade your deposit coins from their exchange and before you can trade the deposit amount it requires 1 to 3 confirmations before you can trade the deposit amount.They were sweeping coins in large batches, probably during high fees times they had a lot stuck in and needed the funds more than ever, they didn't all me to trade or updated the balance until their own confirmations +2 blocks but still they were grabbing the unconfirmed by the hundreds, probably a bug more than a favor to the clients but it did help me a lot till they fixed it!One thing I saw was that only bigger transaction were subject to this favor, I got everything over 0.01 BTC confirmed this way but not any of the dust!Quote from: BitMaxz on June 02, 2023, 11:10:09 PMCan you tell us what exchange you use where they transfer and do CPFP from your deposit address to their own wallet?It's not working anymore and that's why the topic but sure, it was BTSE.Quote from: Findingnemo on June 01, 2023, 02:16:26 PMUsing LN maybe a choice but its not going to be simple pie for everyone and not every wallet support LN channel so if some of them are using wallet that doesn't support LN they need to switch to another wallet that support it and it's a lot of work to do.I make one sell over LN for about 50 sales onchain and 10 with altcoins, if I would force my customers to do so I would have no customers.Fortunately this topic might get obsolete as I'm seeing 10sat/vbyte passing by now!",

Perhaps because of how bad the fees were, CEX prioritized relatively big amounts as well. But yeah, the situation has gotten so much better compared to couple of weeks ago but I would still suggest consolidating your inputs- if you have many- when the fees are low.",
