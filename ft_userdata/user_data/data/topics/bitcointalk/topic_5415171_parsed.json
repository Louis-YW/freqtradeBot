I will be more tomorrow, he is aware that a post on bitcointalk has been opened and depending on the turn of events, I will go to the direct accusations and this will also harm msko projects too. .",

No news, no talk about this, why ?I never heard of this exchange, and others might also barely know it. Contrary to the FTX which has a lot of popularity and shill way before its insolvency, surely the public are concerned so does the media. FTX was also one of the exchanges that has a big trading volume. That explains the example of why its fall down is a contagion to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Back to the Decoin, I don't know how popular this exchange was, and how many users are affected. There is a reason why the media does not bring up this news. If you are affected and think the general cryptocurrency user should consider this theft or scam allegation, you should be the one who informed the communities in regard to it, after then it is up to the community whether they will resonate with the news or not.",

Nevertheless, I am interested in the question, for what reason did you choose this exchange? That they offered you that you entrusted them with your money, while there are many centralized and decentralized exchanges with a good reputation.This platform was one of the ICO projects that succeeded in collecting significant funds from investors to establish the platform. The platform has an official announcement here on the forum, and it has also launched a Bounty campaign to introduce the ICO program. What is interesting is that the platform has been operating since 2018, and it seems that it has real problems that were addressed in one of the discussions on Reddit, but there are no other discussions or many reviews about it.DECOIN: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decoin/Announcement thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3311450Bounty thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3311816.0 (Failed to pay participants)Discussion in Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/BonfireToken/comments/nf5mau/decoin_exchange_scammers/",

I tried to go to the project site itself, there hangs an error 503. It is possible that the team made a trivial exit scam.",

The currency team is the one that manipulates its price and its source code. We have to know that scammers are everywhere around us, so these exchange platforms are less reliable, so staying away from them will be the solution, so why risk our funds in unknown exchange platforms and currencies like this?",

No news, no talk about this, why ?It's caused by most of people in here were not using decoin. That's why people rarely talked about that. The site gone offline and nothing can be expected to be returned by scammer. The only possible thing to track the identity from the owner and then take legal action against them but the problem since those scammers might be on abroad and then you will be so difficult to catch them all. The scammer has been erasing everything now. It's become even harder to track where the money was going on. I didn't know why stupid people keep used this garbage exchange site when it was still alive.",
