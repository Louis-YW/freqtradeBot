  "content": "Hello,Back in the summer of 2009, I downloaded Bitcoin and mined very briefly. At the time I had a cutting edge gaming rig and I came across Bitcoin in a new article.  I remember mining Bitcoin and it brought my gaming rig to a crawl. After brief period of time and with Bitcoin being worthless, I uninstalled Bitcoin. A decade later, Bitcoin explodes and it made me think if I had any Bitcoin. I was really skeptical. I tried many many times over the years to find the wallet.dat file and no luck. Maybe my memory was bad. I very recently found the JakeWins, FindBTC, Github program to search hard drives that have seen better days. I get my computer programmer friend involved and we run FindBTC on Debian Linux. In 2009, I was using a WD 36GB Raptor drive made in 2004. At 73% of the way into the scan it hits a possible wallet.dat file trace. The possible wallet.dat file is seperated into four parts. FindBTC gives byte offset numbers where the file exists. We use sector editor to open each wallet file in linux. In wallet file 3, if gives the install location C:/Users/.../start menu/bitcoin/wallet.dat. Appearing to confirm that Bitcoin was installed. The problem is many years ago, I deleted the Users file on this hard drive. Questions/Help:1. What type of wording or language is contained in wallet.dat file from 2009? 2. Using sector editor to read the file, can I locate the address within the file? 3. How large should wallet.dat file be typically from 2009? 4. Any programs to recover a deleted Users file from Windows 7. 5. Any programs exist to recover deleted wallet.dat file. Please see attached images. https://share.icloud.com/photos/038socKcaDgEvzbr2BgW99twghttps://share.icloud.com/photos/04b2VtgMIusQWUPG8WUcBzzxw",

The wallet.dat file size depends on the number of addresses you have generated.I found this thread  asking this question about the file size and the information that 1135 bytes per address was confirmed.QuoteThis is a graph showing how wallet.dat's size increases as I keep adding new addresses:Looks pretty linear to me with a slope of 1135.0361445783133 bytes per address. https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/98497/what-determines-btcs-wallet-size-in-bytesI made your images visible here:",

What type of wording or language is contained in wallet.dat file from 2009?The file would be a binary format, so not really readable for a human.Quote from: TheMadGenius07 on November 01, 2023, 11:24:44 AM2. Using sector editor to read the file, can I locate the address within the file?That would be challenging due to the binary format as mentioned above.You might wanna use Bitcoin Core if you find that file. That would be the easiest way to import the wallet.dat. Another method would be pywallet.Quote from: TheMadGenius07 on November 01, 2023, 11:24:44 AM3. How large should wallet.dat file be typically from 2009?As @bitmover already said, that file wouldn't be big. From your statement, it also sounds like you haven't been mining for long. The size of the file depends on the generated addresses and their transactions, so it might not have been too much in your case. On top of that there were a lot of things not implemented in 2009 that could make it a larger file. So it should be in the range of a few kilobytes to a few megabytes?Quote from: TheMadGenius07 on November 01, 2023, 11:24:44 AM4. Any programs to recover a deleted Users file from Windows 7.5. Any programs exist to recover deleted wallet.dat file. I'm goin to summarize the question as it relates to both.There are several software such as EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard or Recuva that could lead to success. However, success is not guaranteed especially since it has been a very long time and the deleted data may have already been overwritten with new ones.",

There are some parts that are \"human-readable\" when the wallet.dat is parsed via pywallet or something.Since the OP didn't specifically talk about it, I assumed he meant the original file. In my previous post I had already mentioned the possibility of pywallet under his second question. There you could then extract exactly such parts from the wallet.",

      "body": "Hi,> \"Back in the summer of 2009, I downloaded Bitcoin and mined very briefly\"Do you recall what software you used? As noted above, creating an image of the whole drive before potentially destroying the remnants of your wallet/s would be wise.You could use 'ddrescue' or 'dd' under Linux, with the source drive attached via the interface of the time (SCSI/SATA/SAS....) to create a disk image. Once complete set the source drive aside for safe storage.Then mount, read-only, the disk image on a Linux system, see the instructions under the Ubuntu data recovery page.  New to this forum, can I post URLs?Then try: PhotoRec,Foremost, Scalpel.... being careful to only install from the official repositories, be wary of downloading software not from the official repositories.If you don't have luck with open source utilities, you could use the following rig to potentially recover the assets, take careful note of instructions:- Create a Windows VM on a Linux system (KVM...) and install data recovery utilities from any source. - Shutdown the VM and remove the network interface, assume the system might now be tainted. - Attach the disk image from earlier, you will need to convert it into something like a qcow file depending on the virtualization software you have used.- Boot and see what can be recovered with the various utilities. - Attach an additional disk to move assets out of the rig. - Assume it might too be tainted so be wary of moving onto a Windows system. - Eventually move coins to a fresh wallet.

He gave me a series of commands to run. We first want to search the word Bitcoin. This hard drive was also stopped being used in early 2010. Sure enough I got a number of hits for the word Bitcoin, which, correlates to what we discovered earlier with one of the possible wallet files hex code read out showing the pathway for Bitcoin with wallet.dat. Tracing the word using Grep command and than finding BlockOffset than running debugfs. Though icheck and inode don't work in NTFS on Linux. We're trying to find the sector block where the Bitcoin folder/wallet file starts.  Any ideas much appreciated!https://share.icloud.com/photos/01cQfRfdd9Evfni_X7oKR-oRQd https://share.icloud.com/photos/01cQfRfdd9Evfni_X7oKR-oRQ",
