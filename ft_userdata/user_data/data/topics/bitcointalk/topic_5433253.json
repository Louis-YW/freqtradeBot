However if you want to attach image, you only need to become Jr. member rank or bought copper membership, or if you want to wear avatar you must reach full member rank.A newbie user who have very good knowledge about Bitcoin and post very good quality post will earn merit very easy, also some people don't care with their ranks.",

Until then, accounts ranked-up by merely posting and gaining Activity, which was easy-peasy and required no real effort, nor was it affected by the content one wrote. Merits changed that, and reduced spam a fair share I’d say, at least on the main boards, and although a certain degree of spam is inevitable, those knee deep in the habit won’t get very far up the ranking scale. Merits are essentially necessary to rank-up (which itself has some benefits on multiple fronts), though it also plays additional roles that we could associate to aspects such as gaining a certain reputation, or receiving a pat on the back every now and then. Lately, some Campaign Managers require their participants to earn a certain amount of Merits in a given period of time, so there is that too, though any reasonable and constant poster likely won’t have much trouble with this.",

The rewards are for you to rank and it's only important if you are going to participate in signature and bounty campaigns because they are rank based.",

And secondly, I wish to tell you that having a higher rank just like mine \"Sr. Member\" is very possible if you want to, but only that it comes with a lot of hard work and sacrifices of which one needs to do to make it a reality. So in regards to the answer to your question, the reward system was implemented to differentiate between quality posters and spammers, who only come to the forum not providing any value",

Isn't that hard if you're knowledgable enough, engaging in technical topics, and of course with knowledge of it is very easy for you to have merit.So, therefore, I may advise you to read more first and learn, your quality post will be rewarded even without knowing you and it'll come spontaneously.",

Exactly. Despite everything, need to move forward, even if in small steps, but one day it will lead to high ranks. Perseverance and activity will become fellow travelers in this difficult matter. I also didn't think before that I could reach hero rank and it seemed very difficult, but time goes by, and I continue to put in some effort and this is already getting me closer to a new promotion.Personally, I see the advantage of the reward system in that it allows us to appreciate our achievements more, because the harder it is to get something, the higher the value for us. You should not see the reward system as an obstacle to yourself, but rather see it as an opportunity to improve your skills through rewards of merit.",

Before the introduction of the merit rule (reward, in your word) in 2018, ranking up was almost an effortless engagement. It was basically just write whatever you felt like writing and then wait for activity count to go up to expected rank. That was it. Once ranked up, one is able to get better renumeration both in signature and bounty campaigns based on one's rank. Members in the same signature campaign do similar task of meeting up certain post count but most payments aren't ever the same because of difference in ranks. May be that's about the major benefit with difference in ranks. Nonetheless, there are campaigns that have the same pay rate for all like what Chipmixer does.",
