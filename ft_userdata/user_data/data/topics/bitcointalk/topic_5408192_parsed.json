The past mistakes should be considered as a lesson that you need to work hard to overcome. It's better for yourself to stay positive about the market like that. Just as a guess, hold on for the long term and learn more. Don't just appear when benefiting and having happiness doesn't maintain success and sustainable investment is created.",

Most people dont believe this will be huge cause its really massive movement but history repeat itself apparently weve just enter a consolidation stage and that bull run can happen 2 to 3 years from now. Whay you are doing is good cause it can change your lives by doing dca and sell it on a high phase bull run.",

You are unlucky when you hold everything high, but you are not failing as long as you hold bitcoin and have not sold any of them. what you are doing is right, DCA when you can and just hold on till next bull season you will have success which I am sure will be bigger than what you expected.",

If bitcoin will be able doing it and then whole of market will be giving the same reaction. You will be seeing so many tokens in your portfolios will be going up. You will earn bunch of money if you have bought at the bottom. So many people are in big euphoria during the bullish season. This is what will be happening during the bullish season.",

You say war causes shock to the global economy and bitcoin is its victim too and the war shows no sign of ending, it's hard to see a better market than now. Everything is just a price trap so be careful.",

I never sold and continued to invest , I now focus on DCA every month.Realistically, what will the next bull run look like?First of all i think it is great that you apparently followed one of the most important advices if not the single most important advice if you are planning to invest into the crypto market: Never invest more, than you can afford to lose. If this would not be the case then you would now be full of regrets and maybe you even had to sell now with a big loss. Even though you are now probably very deep in the negative numbers in terms of profit that does not mean anything because the loss only becomes real once you have sold.Regarding what the next bullrun looks like? No one really knows i guess. So far i experienced the bullrun of 2018 and the one of 2020 to 2021 and i would say both of them were very different, so i would guess that maybe the next bullrun will start also out of the blue and will not behave like the last ones.",

To be honest, the last bull run, I'm sure that many didn't expected it to be like that. It was like more than times three of 2017 bull run and that's quite a lot to be seen.Maybe by the next bull run, it will be more than that. Just don't expect a lot and as you hold, despite seeing those losses, you only lose until you sell.",

But recently the market looks a bit positive. but I myself see that bitcoin could return to the resistance point in the area around 25k - 26k. but after that it looks like the bear market will return. and it will take some more time to get to the long bullrun market. so your decision to focus on DCA is the right thing. because the current market situation can only be maximized with the DCA technique. buy incrementally and sell incrementally. no need to rush and don't be afraid we will be left behind in taking the bottom price. be patient and do the analysis calmly.
