  "content": "Theres a lot of complaints for those 2 exchanges (others too I know but I focus on them first).Me too - I bought coins on HitBTC and YoBit - and now I have my investment stuck - either like HitBTC the withdrawel fee is 10% or more - or like with YoBit the coins are \"under maintanance\" and just not withdrawable.Users like me then can ask the support for help - but never get answers.As most coins - especially huge amount of very cheap coins are only tradable on YoBit and HitBTC if you look on coinmarketcap or cryptocompare - I guess its time to include those 2 mayor websites in our fight !I mean - look around - so many complaints about those 2 exchanges everywhere - but nothing changes !We need to complain to coinmarketcap and cryptocompare - and urge them to delist those 2 exchanges !That is the only way to HURT both exchanges - and get them out of business !Yes sure many people will LOOSE a lot of money - I too will LOOSE about 3500 Euro that way - but Im willing to because that way we can make sure that scammer exchanges in the future will not have it that easy like today.IF WE GET SCAMMERS DELISTED FROM THE MAYOR WEBSITES - AND NOT LISTED IN THE FUTURE - THE WHOLE CRYPTO UNIVERSE GETS SAFER !",

      "body": "i have never used Hitbtc but i say while there is the biggest scammer called bittrex still listed, that should be your priority. with Yobit at least you know where the problem comes from. they simply don't run wallets for 90% of the altcoins listed there. but if you withdraw the top 30-40 altcoins or bitcoin you will never have any issues and Yobit was never considered trusted to begin with.but bittrex used to be one of the trusted exchanges and one day they decided, ummm free money lets scam thousands of users who trusted us and become rich by robbing them. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=96390",

Yes, these exchangers are popular way back into those early years but they had tarnished it out and now been replaced with the current known sites that we are using as of this moment.Check this one out on having that similar DOGE coin withdrawal problem.https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5381570.0Dont make your hopes up that you could be able to retrieve your coins back. This has been long time an issue that never been resolved.It will really be better that you should move on and there's no way that you could be able to get those, and it is really just that indeed a waste of money and there's nothing we can do. I have lost tons of DOGE also in Yobit exchange but that was long time ago and didnt stress myself and its for the better.",

      "body": "I haven't seen much complaints about Yobit since long time ago to be honest and AFAIK they are not listed anymore on Coinmarketcap and large listing platforms. I know they offer some kind of HYIP investments or weird things but appart from that they don't lock accounts, never ask any KYC to anyone, and when a shitcoin is not available for deposit or withdraw anymore they always let the markets open to exchanges them. HitBTC is way more vicious and scammy IMO they are still letting deposits opened for Dogecoins but not withdrawals without any warnings, and the market they offer is 10times below the real price, for example.",

You should just created a website or a post in other platform about your experience on hitbtc and yobit.Quote from: seoincorporation on November 28, 2024, 07:55:53 PMTo get those sites delisted from coinmarket cap will be really hard because both of the are verified companies. What we can do is to burn their repitation on trustpilot.But that will not make those sites stop scamming users, the Best thing to do is to stay away from them.  People would have to genuinely make a review so that it won't be removed. I have tried it with other platforms like a casino but trustpilot didn't add my review but I definitely agree with this one which is to give them a review. I think the problem with the review I mentioned is that trustpilot needs proof of what I claimed about the website so in this case, people should provide proof about what they experienced on hitbtc and yobit.",

Plus, taking into account DOGE's price surge makes it even harder to believe it's gonna happen.I'm not sure about being delisted but CMC and coingecko do put out notice when they receive loads of complaints. Then again, it's been several years since they started being scummy and no notice has happened yet. On one hand, perhaps the huge loss of userbase has contributed as well + many folks just moving on and charging it to experience.",
