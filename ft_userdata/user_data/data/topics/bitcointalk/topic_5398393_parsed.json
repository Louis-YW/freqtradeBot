  "content": "We've been told to buy when the price is low and sell when the price is high. This is pretty much the thumb rule in trading. But that is not without conditions. It isn't absolute. It doesn't always guarantee profit. Let us not forget the RISK. And risk correlates with volatility. High volatility means high risk. And since the crypto market is a volatile market, the risk is higher here than in the stock or FX market.So, the \"buy=low, sell=high\" strategy only works when you successfully manage the risk. You can do that by:1. Investing less than 5% of your total portfolio in crypto2. Prioritizing other aspects of your finances ahead of investing in crypto       - emergency fund       - retirement savings       - high-interest debt paymentIn other words, invest only what you can afford to lose.To sum it up--\"Buy when the price is low and sell when the price is high, BUT invest only what you can afford to lose.\"It may not guarantee a profit but it can help cut down loss when the bear attacks.",

      "body": "I'd say it's better if you not invest on crypto aka shitcoins, but just invest in Bitcoin. The rule of buy low and sell high can't be used on shitcoins because they doesn't have any fundamental and easier to manipulated due to low market cap + centralized. Bitcoin is the only one coin who have fundamental and you can analyze how much it will goes to bottom etc. Looking on 200 week moving average the bottom may likely around $24,500, however no one can know does it will happen or not, but at least it can help your decision.If you didn't have good analysis, you do Dollar Cost Averaging by buy Bitcoin every day/week/biweekly/month in any prices. So in the long term based on Bitcoin's history, you'll enjoy the profit.",

      "body": "I fully agree. Unfortunately, this is something a lot of people probably failed to do. I guess there are many of us who seem to have overinvested in Bitcoin or perhaps crypto in general. In my case, I only have a small savings in my bank account. My retirement savings so to speak is also in Bitcoin. While I don't have debts, I also haven't invested significantly in less risky assets like real estate or government bonds or whatever. I don't have a stable business either. In other words, I am heavily invested in Bitcoin. I might actually be investing more than I can afford to lose, but since I am not actually losing even a wink of sleep even in the face of this bear market, I guess I'm doing it right.",

The OP is talking about \"crypto\", and applied to shitcoins his analysis makes sense, but if we focus only on Bitcoin, now is a good time to buy and well over the 5% he is talking about, depending on your knowledge and risk tolerance. If we start from the assumption of being free of consumer debt, having an emergency fund and want to invest in Bitcoin because of its limited, autonomous and decentralized nature, we can have a very important part of our net worth in Bitcoin. What percentage will depend on each one, but I always recommend diversifying a little bit, even if it is 80% in Bitcoin and the rest of premium assets, whether Real State, shares of premium companies, etc..",

Now in this bearish trend the bitcoin market has fallen down to lets say $50! What position are you in now? Profit or Loss? Now think about it in opposite way. The market has fallen badly, the entry point is $50, and on a fine day the price hits $100. Now what position are you in ? Profit or loss?I am pretty sure if you are able to answer both of them correctly then you know your claims aint right. - Simple math.\"Its not a question of altcoin or bitcoin, its question of how you manage your entry and exits in the market\".",

Because of that, the potential rewards are a lot greater than what you may get from the other investments. The sooner you accept this fact, the better it is for you.

I don't really understand why does debt is becoming a new normal on the current conditions, if you didn't have enough money to buy non-important stuff... it's better you wait until you have enough cash or don't buy it. It just sad that many medium-low class people really want to have luxury lifestyle, that's why they're fucked of their own debt.

But regarding buying bitcoin, I would say the best option is to place buy orders in different lower price levels because these days the price does lots of spike movements to lower and higher prices.",

When it is clear that our lives are full of things that are affecting us, we can see that investment choice is a way to find easy profits, but it comes out when people have financial basics as well as control over their own capital. But whenever the market shows signs of comfort in terms of money in investment, we can easily spend money to participate in anything that is talked about because they can only see what has happened but not the creation process that is the result. I also remind those around me to be satisfied and grateful for what life is going on, not to dwell on things that are not my own and see it as a goal that I also have to achieve.",

      "body": "OP, the vibe I get from your post is that you, like so many other investors in bitcoin, stocks, what have you, are afraid to actually buy when prices are depressed.  I'm reading what I see as rationalization as to why one ought to be particularly careful about buying during times like the present, when basically the entire market got flattened over the course of 48-72 hours.If you're looking to make a profit (and especially if you're a short-term trader), now is the time to be jumping in with both feet.  What we're seeing looks as close to a flash crash as there's been in a long time, and when I woke up this morning some of the coins I follow had already started to recover from the worst of it--so if you'd just bought any ol' shitcoin yesterday (or bitcoin at $28k)--you'd be in the black by now with more profits (hopefully) to come.Quote from: Despairo on May 13, 2022, 03:09:38 AMThe rule of buy low and sell high can't be used on shitcoins because they doesn't have any fundamental and easier to manipulated due to low market cap + centralized. No to the first part, and no to the second as well.  \"Buy low, sell high\" can and should be applied to anything.  Why did you even write something like that?  And bitcoin doesn't have any \"fundamentals\" either.  If you can tell me what fundamentals it has that a coin like ETH, LTC, or any other coin doesn't I'd really love to know.  On top of that, not all altcoins have low market caps or are easily manipulated.  Some do, but definitely not all of them.  Care to revise any of those false statements?Quote from: NeuroticFish on May 13, 2022, 07:26:26 AMActually buying low and selling high always brings profit.Christ, I'm glad I'm not the only one here who's not just writing nonsense and not giving a single logical thought to this discussion.  Arguing against the \"buy low, sell high\" model is akin to screaming at a room of geologists that the world is flat.",
