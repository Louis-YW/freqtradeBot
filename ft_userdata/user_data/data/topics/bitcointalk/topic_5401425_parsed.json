It will give faster results even on the same day. The assumption of this decision is that worrying about your father will not be saved until the bull market comes along and you turn out to be choosing a coin that is not following the trend.If you consider this immoral advice, then you can take a mirror for yourself.  Any financial advisor will not recommend that someone invest in critical health.",

I honestly don't know what you can actually do and neither of us here are sure where's the market is going as of now so it would be very risk if you trade, in investment there's a lot of scam projects lately and there is no assurance that you would have a profit after you invest to ICO or IEO.",

What would you save on this next bull run ? Much help would be highly highly appreciated !(I will updated you guys as how it goes) Hello OP. First off all i am sorry to hear that your father is in such a situation and i hope he is ok given the circumstances. To your question about tripling your money fast in order to pay for your fathers needed surgery think that you should not risk a crypto investment here. The risk of losing all those 50k usd is just way too high in my opinion. Also i think that you need to be really lucky at the moment to make a x3 of your investment because the whole crypto market is in bear mode.",

Without dad we wouldn't be where we are today and without bitcoin we would look for other things. Dad has only one and bitcoins are many, bitcoin is very good to invest, the opportunity gives us a lot of money but it cannot compare with fatherhood.",

Much help would be highly highly appreciated !(I will updated you guys as how it goes) I wouldn't risk the funds allocated for my father's surgery if I were in your situation. There are other ways for you to earn or save for crypto investment. It's between life and death and no profit could replace your father's life. They say that you must only invest what you could afford to lose so you better think of the possible consequence if you'll invest that fund. There's no assurance that the bull run will approach soon.",

What would you save on this next bull run ? There are two huge investment mistakes here:- Investing not free money, but money that is set aside for some need.- Increased financial expectations, resulting in higher risk and likely ill-considered decisions when investing or withdrawing.This behavior sounds more like a roulette game than investing. I do not advise anyone to do so, the outcome of such a scheme, with a probability of 95%, will be sad, partial or complete loss of the deposit.",

You don't know what the future holds, it might be bitcoin that can give you x3 in the future, or altcoins such as BNB and ETH. But as I have said, this is crypto, yes we expect a bull run in the next couple of years but in a emergency situation like what you have laid down, the choice is easy, I will not invest that money in crypto.",
