  "content": "First and before talking about it let me explain why I encountered this feature which isn’t familiar here in our gambling section community. Last month was bad for me while gambling. I usually enjoy playing slots particularly Sweet Bonanza and some Plinko game once or twice a week. I'm used to the ups and downs that come with gambling  and even that my overall history at my favorite casino is still a small positive number.But this month something I felt is off. I've been consistently losing from 6 or 8 bonus buys in a row before winning one with a very small profit, then again to go back to strict losses. It has been like this for last month now, I mean it’s like only downs lol.This is why I started looking for similar experiences even that I know it’s only gambling but I came across someone in reddit talking about seeds changing for slots or games. Unfortunately the casino I'm using doesn't offer this feature so i can’t really tell. Now my question is does changing the seeds really have any effect? Can it help with the ongoing losses and bring things back to normal?",

Just what I have said from the similar thread above.Quote from: Maus0728 on October 07, 2023, 12:53:29 PMProbably, that gambler you have seen believe to some kind \"Illusion of Control\"[1] fallacy where they can influence or control the outcome of the game, in his case not changing the seed, even when it's based on luck and randomization of numbers.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_controlAnd as far as I know, a streak of wins or loses is a good indicator of the randomness of whatever the game is!!",
