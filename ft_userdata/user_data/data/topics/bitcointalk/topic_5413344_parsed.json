  "content": "I have a project that has been on paper for a long time.I would like to know the readers opinion.Stable coin is based on a stable coin.Imagine a stable currency that appreciates over time.Imagine your purchasing power being greater.May this currency be guaranteed by its open reserves.And your reserves increase and never decrease.Where does the reserve and my trade secret come from.But think of it this wayToday you have 1 token worth 1 usdTomorrow this 1 token is worth 1.0001 usd1 year from now this 1 token is worth 1.1 usdwould be economically viableThe design and idea are good.The token could be used as local currency via the app.Used to pay bills, transfer funds, etc.Within this, the reserve box would be open and exposed with the values ​​of tokens issued and cash value.Example issued 100,000 tokensCash 110,000 USD1 Token = 1.1 USDCash rises according to token demand.Cash is a reserve that guarantees that the funds are worth something.These funds can be redeemed whenever the person wants.Inside the reserve.It does not depend on markets to appreciate itself.I don't know if there are similar projects.I have the idea.lack of investmentLack of partnershipI have some knowledge in crypto, development to get this project up and running.What I see the greatest difficulty is disseminating this idea. I tried some ideas before and abandoned, due to the difficulty in expanding in search engines.And difficulty finding new investors.I would like the opinion of the noble colleagues on the idea.I would like new ideas.Who knows, maybe this project will get off the ground and become something innovative for the crypto market.My regardsbitbrabo",
