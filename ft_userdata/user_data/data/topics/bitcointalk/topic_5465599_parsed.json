But lately, just as you've said, there have been a lot of drama that's happening.Anyway, my invested there isn't a lot and I afford to lose so it's like a do or die whenever the bull run comes and it didn't have any affection. I wouldn't be affected a lot.Still, money is still money on it and I'll just take the loss if ever it will happen.",

The best is still bitcoin, but you can gamble with altcoins.Majority of altcoins are ponzi-like in nature and because of the freedom that comes with centralization made it easy for most of the coins developers and team to easily scam the investors by pulling an exit scam on them anytime they see that the market is pumped enough to increase bounty amount.Bitcoin is still the best truly and I will not even advise anyone to gamble with altcoin unless on a few of those coins that already have a well-established team behind them, Trying to gamble altcoin may lead you into potential losses if you are not careful.",

Buying more of it as of now is not really good idea because it could be the end of it and you won't get back your capital once the price crashes once more. You might also lose some good opportunities from other altcoin investment which is decent and have a promising future.",

Luckily, I have already sold all my $GALA before but it's not because of this dispute, it's just because I saw a window of profit so I took it. Don't love the coin, that's my motto when it's not Bitcoin. If you see an opportunity to sell then take it. Although I spent a lot of money on fees because it was during the heavy traffic in ERC20, I risked it just to get all my coins out and converted to USD. Now it's up to you brother. Consider the market's condition too because we are not in the bull run yet. Those disputes could heavily damage their reputation and might pull down the value of $Gala if the investors sold their coins. It's not like they are just going to sit around and be rekt because of this owner's problems.",

But as we all know, negative news has a negative impact on the entire project, including their native token. Since the news published on Bein that you attached, MC on Gala has decreased again to $71M, IMO with the current bad news, it's not good to hold or buy $GALA. It's better if we wait until the case in Gala is finished.",

I would wait a bit to be more confident, as GALA is not in the category of those cryptocurrencies that will increase in the next bull cycle with 100% certainty, like bitcoin or eth. If the price doesn't sustain $0.016 and fails, then definitely your investment could be at a serious loss.",

Now that the hype is over, Gala is just like a normal crypto company that offer crypto game that is not profitable anymore due to low demand. Even Axie that start the trend for NFT games is already on the verge of flattening the chart. The only future of this project to revive is when the hype on Metaverse comes back which is very low chance.",

If you are really that having the trust on GALA project then its up to you whether you would cut loss or would really be holding up your position, knowing that we are really that still not on a bull run market on which everything do really looks that they are really going on the ground now. There's no way on telling or saying on which projects would pump out on that bull run season. This is what makes really that hard on making that kind of decision whether we should hold up or would be finding another place. It is really that very normal on having this kind of approach and doubts specially if there's a huge sell off.It would really be boggling up your mind and create that kind of feeling and emotion whether you should give up and find or look for another one or would really be stood still on what you have started.  Recovery and price pumps and jumpswould definitely be not a guarantee to happen because we know that this market could really make some projects pump and then die forever and there are ones who do eventually make out some recoveryafter that long time consolidation.It would really be totally depending on the demand and recognition since not all projects do able to get up such support.",

It looks stupid enough if you are still beliving in this shitty project. I meant you just need to realize the fact if the legal battle in internal will happen soon. This will put the project in trouble for long term. I don't get it why people are still believing in this steam copy cat. The internal drama is something that will be so hard to be solved. You may see if the internal will be splitted. You can still trust it and risk your money but if i were you and i will search a better coin to invest rather than keep waiting for this shit to go up with so many internal drama that will come soon. The better thing is to stick into another altcoin which can be trusted. Does your investment be at a loss now? Im just seeing some gala investors were just moving.",

A time will come when they will be hyped and they will reign and act as if they dominate. They will give unexpected profits and lots more, but when the time is gone, it will be a thing of the pass. I remember when Gala was a hot cake investment asset. But today I have seen people mentioning coins worth holding for the upcoming bull run but no one mentioned Gala which means it's time has passed. But I am sure as Op, some other people's investment is trapped there, they should wait for bull run and if there is some kind of growth, they will sell, even if it's at a minimal loss.",
