      "body": "Rei network is spreading through twitter like malice. I guess this is because complete.finance is using that handle as a proxy. And Rei network is not exactly Rei but Complete finance in conspiracy. Probably u are also an initiator and a beneficiary of their partnership with SpaceID. I can see why u are doing it. U need to be interleaved with crypto space, with ur features and layers scattered across the defi but its impossible to do with shitty name. U are chancelor Palpatine and Rei network is supreme leader Snoke.",
