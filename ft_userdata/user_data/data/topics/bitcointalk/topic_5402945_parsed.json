  "content": "Having just (re)joined this forum after probably a decade, I am a bit surprised the forum does not have a dedicated section for website/domain trades in the marketplace section.How or where do you usually buy/sell websites for BTC if not here? A quick google search doesn't reveal an obvious or main market either.I have some projects that I would like to sell in the coming months (in exchange for BTC) and am curious about the current best practices. I'd imagine there's a go-to escrow service that can be trusted. Either a centralized party or perhaps even through smart contracts.",

      "body": "Escrow is definitely the way to go, if you pay a small sum as a donation or maybe they charge you for it, then you can work with legendary accounts that everyone trusts. There are many people willing to escrow here, some of them charge you for it, and some say they are free but it is reasonable to give them some donations for helping you out, usually not a big amount of course.Selling an online business, or a website in the crypto world is not easy, there are SO many people who are doing the same that it is a saturated market, which means that something that could worth more in another sector, could worth a lot less in the crypto world because of how many there are out there being sold and not getting bought.",

Either a centralized party or perhaps even through smart contracts.You should definitely use escrow for that as the domain transfer to other accounts & registrar could take days in the best case and could completely fail to transfer in the worst case.",
