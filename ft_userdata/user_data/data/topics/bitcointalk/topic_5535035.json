  "content": "The recent dip in the price of Bitcoin have left so many investors feeling tensed and worried but there are still strong reasons to stay positive about it's future and below are my few concluded reasonsMarket Cycles Are NormalAs always, Bitcoin have moved in cycles, with unusual corrections followed by radical and significant rallies. Major dips usually sets the stage for bull run and the current dip I think should be considered as one of those moments.Growing Governmental and Institutional interestsRecently, we've experienced huge investments into the Bitcoin market from two powerful governments of the world namely USA and Brazil. If the government of the USA which controls the largest economy of the world can buy reserves, it'll definitely attract other top national governments to also do same so it's expected that in the nearest future, the influence that comes with the presence of these governments will cause a high surge in the prize of Bitcoin which will likely to see it reach a new ATH. Again, regardless of the short-term volatility, institutional investments have been on the rise. Renowned companies and firms are adopting Bitcoin, resulting to long-term stability and credibility to the mother coin.Bitcoin Scarcity Remains TimelessBitcoin founder and creator Satoshi Nakamoto introduced 21 million units of bitcoin to the Bitcoin network to ensure it's scarcity so as demands grows over time, this fixed supply continues to remain a significant driver of value.Regulatory Transparency Is Improving The regulatory structures around the crypto space are gradually becoming clearer by the day. While regulations seem be discouraging to some people, they generally enabling environment for wider adoption and investor protection in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general.Summarily, while the current dip can be challenging for existing investors and discouraging for intending investors, Bitcoiners have many exciting reasons to remain positive and confident in the asset's long-term potentials.",

On the long run this governmental and institutional interests can as well turn out positive irrespective of how greedy and selfish investors turns out to be. Let's assume more institutions offers bitcoin ETFS( Exchange-Traded Funds) we will definitely have wider adoption and this will significantly affect it's price.The more the government keeps adding Bitcoin to their reserves the more adoption it gets from the masses. Also if larger quantities of bitcoin get bought by the government leading to scarcity and limited supply we know price will definitely roar.Â  We can't avoid manipulation from our world leaders so the earlier we learn to live with it the better we take advantage of the opportunity it offers.",

Because it's been carved to all of us that we're going to hold no matter what. And this is based on the historical gains that we've got from Bitcoin and what we've witnessed for all of those years. The weak hands are going to sell when they don't like what's happening. But someone who understands what's happening isn't going to do the same but will resource out for as much as they can and will buy the dip.",

They have not yet recognized Bitcoin, because if the investor understood the nature of Bitcoin, he would never have decided to sell Bitcoin. Price fluctuations are the natural characteristic of Bitcoin. Those who invest in Bitcoin only as a means of quick profit are the only ones who cannot achieve real success from Bitcoin. Bitcoin will definitely increase in the long run, but many do not believe this, but they will regret their disbelief a lot later, when Bitcoin achieves a position greater than its previous position.",

They can't control emotions when their portfolio starts dumping, which led them to sell at a loss. But actually, in this situation, we need to accumulate Bitcoin cheaply. When Bitcoin pumps hard, then we just regret what we missed. But during the dump, we can't control our emotions. That's the reason whales are making money since they know the market sentiments. I think Bitcoin is giving an opportunity for us to accumulate right now. Those are capable of buying but still worried; they must need to regret.",

They buy in large quantity which I think gives a little edge over individual investors and because they invest more, they can easily spread FUD among crypto marketers by sharing exaggerated information so they can make huge profits from price manipulation. The good thing is that Bitcoin is decentralized and will always be no matter how the worst they can do is to manipulate the market and not to control the Bitcoin network. We've seen how recent pronouncements from Donald Trump had major effects on the price of crypto but to experts, they already understand the game and would not fall for these manipulative moves.",

Not all people staying positive all not get ruled out by emotion since there might be someone who sold their bitcoin not because of the dip and it could be because of they are having problems and are forced to sell their investment or some part of their investment coincidentally during dip where some people might think that you let the emotion change your decision making. If you did sell it when you see a sign that you a dip is gonna happen then I wouldn't call it a loss but an opportunity to buy more bitcoin with the money you got from selling your bitcoin if the price you sold your bitcoin is higher than the current price of bitcoin like you sold at 90k for example and bought bitcoin again at 70k which is not bad in my opinion.",
