For example, when you buy a stock, say AAPL, how do you get out your AAPL from the exchange? In case of BTC you can send it to the hard wallet and then keep it there. Then I thought ok, probably buying a stock is just a record on a book. You never will see the physical stock (piece of paper). But then what if the exchange never had that stock? And projecting this thought to the crypto exchanges, what if some well known CEX do not have enough BTCs that is being traded on that exchange? All that numbers and volume could be fake. Then the CEX is becoming like a traditional bank, where unless everyone will want to withdraw their BTCs, they are ok trading non existing BTCs.  well, what do you think?",

Those were stocks or bonds in the paper form, called certificates. I don't think they exist anymore. Maybe there are still companies that issue them, but it's more of a commemorative gift, or something given to large investors as a gift from the broker, or a company. Nowadays you do everything online. You open a brokerage account, or in case of bonds you can buy them on the government's website. They stay there on the account, you don't \"take them out\" the way you move bitcoin around.This is done to prevent thefts like the ones from the movies where if they took your certificates you'd be left with nothing. Now the broker has your name and address and all the other details and if you lose access to your account you can recover it pretty much the same way you recover your mailbox, or a Netflix account.Yes, the numbers provided by CEX could be fake and they could be insolvent. FTX was and so was MtGox. You don't know if they have the money which is why people recommend users to do their trades and withdraw. Don't treat CEX like a wallet.",

You guess it right that they're all numbers but they follow the price in the market and that's why it's truly possible that all of those numbers projecting in the spot market and balances were all just numbers until you request to withdraw it then that's how they're going to release the actual coins. But because of the ruckus that the earlier exchanges did, this gave the notice to the regulators that there should be some transparency that they can show to them and to their customers, obviously. I think the first one to do the proof of reserve thing is CZ for his company, Binance.",

They know anyone would want to withdraw the BTC so everything that is traded in the exchange is available for withdrawal. They'd be labeled scam if they are not allowing withdrawals.Judging from how many exchanges went insolvent, I think it is fair to say that at the very least they need to provide proof of their sustainability. If they do that, users can see whether they have the ability to sustain their business if all users withdraw their BTC or coins at the same time. Even if they do that though, they can still lie or deliberately be misleading to avoid further questioning. I mean, even the latest FTX case can be solid proof that 'reputable' exchanges need more than just name and marketing to survive the market. You should not underestimate how scammy exchanges can be regardless if they are popular or not.Quote from: bittraffic on April 08, 2023, 02:33:38 AMIf there is less BTC volume then there are just a few people in the exchange buying and selling.

Exchanges can fake them anytime, or at least manipulate them to some extent to hide their insider trading or something similar.",

It doesn't just happen with centralized exchanges, but even the banks you are depositing with have the same problem. They use our deposits to invest in other areas, so when something goes wrong, they can't fill their budget, and if everyone rushes to withdraw money, it will lead to lack of liquidity. What you get for depositing money in an exchange or bank are just virtual numbers, and they can give you as much as you want. Bitcoin will only be yours if it is in your personal wallet.",

Because I am new to the field, I might not understand certain things you guys might already know. For example, when you buy a stock, say AAPL, how do you get out your AAPL from the exchange?Buying stocks means you have a contract stating that you are partially an owner of a corporation. Typically broker is the one creating those contract when you buy and sell. This contracts will give you ownership to your stocks and there’s a huge difference between stocks and cryptocurrency so you should not compared them as similar thing.Bitcoin can be compared to Gold and Fiat because it’s currency in crypto.Quote from: a298b112 on April 07, 2023, 08:30:44 PMAnd projecting this thought to the crypto exchanges, what if some well known CEX do not have enough BTCs that is being traded on that exchange?

Then the CEX is becoming like a traditional bank, where unless everyone will want to withdraw their BTCs, they are ok trading non existing BTCs.  well, what do you think?This is actually what’s happening on CEX for example FTX, FTX liability is greater than their assets that makes them collapse after their customers pull out their balance. Some CEX is using their customer money on different investment just like banks doing on our money but crypto is worst because there’s no transparency on the proof of reserves that will show customer balance is 100% backed by exchange reserve.",
