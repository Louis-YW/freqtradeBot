Cus we've been preaching that everyday in here....any new member that got registered in here needs to understand the rules first, before thinking about ways to being helpful in here.Well, I understand your point of view and I'm very much happy with the way you enlisted them.... Apparently, i made a little post on that fact since I thought it was important to for them rookies to know. I'm not bothered for the fact that everyone wants to make a little cash during the learning process, what troubles me if when you wanna make some cash outta greediness, without UNDERSTANDING what You're doing exactly....Sandra üßë‚Äçü¶∞",
