If I offer discounts which will encourage more of my customers to get crypto, how can I possibly sustain it for long to ensure that i don't run at a loss?Yes ofcourse but question is these will be done only if you actually gain from people paying in crypto, currently the incentive that will be given to customer will not entice additional revenues or profits for the company which means all the incentives are just free social service and that ofcourse no business likes to do. Therefore it's impossible that such a thing would happen in any scenario unless you create incentive for business if they accept payments in crypto.",

If I offer discounts which will encourage more of my customers to get crypto, how can I possibly sustain it for long to ensure that i don't run at a loss?If giving discounts and some free gifts, there's still a way to cope with it through bringing your profits first. Your mark-up has to be a little down if you'll budget the discounts. That's all you need to do, a re-calculation on how much will come to you and how much you'll give to those crypto payments from your customers as an incentive.",

You are doing business, why should you be selling your goods at a losing price? No business could sustain that way. Forget about crypto payments, you'd rather receive all payments in fiat but with a profit than crypto but with a loss.

If I offer discounts which will encourage more of my customers to get crypto, how can I possibly sustain it for long to ensure that i don't run at a loss?I don't see much future for your idea. For starters, you talk about \"crypto\" in general, so you are including a bunch of indeterminate shitcoins. Why do you want to incentivize a series of centralized, premined shitcoins, which in some cases are clear pump and dump schemes, etc?If you were talking only about Bitcoin, I could understand it more, but not even then. Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin as of today are mainly used as an investment, and people are not going to pay massively with them as long as they are an investment.I can sell shares with my cell phone in an instant and pay with the money I receive with the debit card, but I do not do it because the money I have in shares is an investment, and I will not use the money from an investment to pay for current expenses, such as food in a restaurant even if they offer me a small discount, because I expect to get more out of the investment, regardless of the fact that if I sell the stock to pay for a fucking steak and a beer I will have to pay capital gains. The same applies to cryptocurrencies (as long as the current price is higher than the one you bought).",

If your hands created your product, you could well discount products.

I will also look for the most popular item in the shop and offer the discount on that item.

Another thing is that even you will give discounts to your customers, there is no assurance that they will really pay you in crypto though giving discounts isn't a bad idea as well.As for me, giving discounts are not for long term especially when it comes to crypto because you might end up losing because of how crypto moves. Just let them buy using crypto for one time would be the best I guess and just let them use their crypto to buy at your store.",

The same applies to cryptocurrencies (as long as the current price is higher than the one you bought).Since you can sell and buy shares in an instant why don't you do the same with bitcoin?You have the choice of paying 100$ with a CC or $90 with bitcoin, pay with bitcoin and then buy 100$ worth of bitcoin with your CC.
