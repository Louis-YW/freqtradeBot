  "content": "Having watched this videohttps://www.bitchute.com/video/JQ3vO4upK6CXAt 20 second Mick Savel says that the Trump administration would buy up 20/25% of the Bit coin network which will then demonetized the value of BRICcoin, hence as BRICcoing is back by gold the value of gold will collapse meaning Trump will be able to wipe off the US debit.Not so long ago my bank manager sat me down in his office and said \"Dont put all your eggs in one basket\" meaning dont just spend all your stocks on gold. But with a great reset pending after the plandemic I could not think of any thing ells to buy at the time (and boy did I make the right decision!)But now I think well maybe now is the time to diversify that port folio after the message from Greg Reese Reports (reporter for Alex Jones Info Wars). So can anyone advice on a a cheap exchange site that will trade me my GBP in to BC for say a 2Ks worth? After all when there are online share dealing accounts like Trading212 giving free trades away on the London Stock Exchange and no subscription costs to have an account with them, then surly there must be something siular for BC (given the fact its only electrical computer running costs)",

All you need now first is to breed your mind up to suit the markets system as it fluctuates not usually to users favour.",

Maybe you should stick to gold and other assets that you believe in because with this mindset you have about bitcoin, it is very obvious that you are not ready to invest in bitcoin. You ain't doing us any favour by investing, investing in bitcoin is not risks free, bear this in mind so when you eventually invest, you would be fully prepared.",
