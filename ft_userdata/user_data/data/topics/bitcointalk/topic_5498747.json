L2 layer is providing the opportunity to move funds as less as possible with bitcoin but not yet widely adopted. Custodial services are working for profits so they will take advantage of making money whenever it is possible so better not trust custodial wallets even if the offers you to move bitcoin at cheaper cost.",

In any case, my bet is that maybe in a few years a transaction on bitcoin could be within the range of hundreds (or maybe a thousand) dollars. In such case, it might be worth it to consolidate your coins on the main chain only once a year or so, for example.",

What is the end goal of Bitcoin? Global reserve currency (digital gold), or peer to peer cash? I am not sure both can be attainable in its current design ( am also a noob and just trying to understand more). If it is a cash system like it has existed in the early days, cold wallets for personal use makes sense. But if Bitcoin continues to grow it and is adopted by more, it may become a global reserve currency due to its finite supply. Under this global reserve currency assumption, bitcoin would be backing every bank, who would be throwing around huge transactions and willing to pay large transaction fees. This would crowd out individuals who want to use cold wallets other than those who hold a large sum of bitcoin, as they would have to pay bank level fees to move around Bitcoin which for most would not be economically feasible. In this scenario, the blockchain would become the source of truth of transactions, lightning would be used by banks for settlements, and you would need a secondary currency backed by bitcoin (US dollar, mint, other crypto, third layer solution, etc.) and make personal cold storage options (for Bitcoin specifically) unfeasible for most. Am I missing a key component of this train of thought? In this scenario, custodians become almost necessary due to the amount of transactions needed if everyone used their own personal cold wallet. Is this the natural progression of Bitcoin, or are there developmental efforts to make cold wallets feasible for all in the future as the adoption of Bitcoin continues?",

It was in 2021 when my kid's friends said the same thing. Former was suit and tie, latter was Gen Z -- neither actually held any coin. Just an app or broker that told them they had Bitcoin. So did any of these guys interact with blockchain? Nope.That's a shitty simplification but it makes sense to me to explain why in spite of breakneck \"adoption\" it still takes shitmemetokens called BRC20s to flood the Bitcoin network.",

With bitcoin’s price being volatile, the same goes for transaction prices. We can’t determine just how huge can the mass acceptance be and how much it can impact transaction fees.

Now, I can't recommend anyone to store a small amount of Bitcoin in their wallet.@OP: nobody can predict transaction fees in the far future, but you can consolidate your inputs so you don't have many small inputs in the future. Having less inputs, and thus a smaller transaction (in bytes), will sharply reduce transaction fees if fees get much higher.",

Anyone with knowledge or resources they could point me to would be greatly appreciated!This is my first time hearing about Fedimint, I searched about it and came to know that it should not be called a layer 2 solution as it is not built on the main layer of BTC. It doesn't work like other L2 solutions work but we might use it along the lightning network for security and privacy and if used with LN then we might make a cheaper transaction as well. Overall, it's also a good thing, Recently I came to know about L-BTC and now this Fedimint. I am learning day by day haha. Speaking of the tx fee, I would say defimint is not going to help us in fee thing as it can't solve the scalability issues, only L2 networks could but to setup LN for the first time we have to pay the normal fee, besides not so many cexs supports L2, so if you are dealing directly with CEXs you first have to confirm either the exchange allowed L2 networks. Prices will increase due to high volume or transactions, but it not only depends on this factor but to understand them you first have to know How Bitcoin Fees Work",

We should probably do something about the block, we did move to segwit just because the legacy one wasn't all that great which is understandable and nothing wrong with that, but also we need to remember that we are not going to get anything profitable out of this if we are not careful.If we end up doing something quick without checking it first, then we are going to have a cheap and fast blockchain that could get hacked into. This is why things are slow in the crypto world, security takes time, and you double check everything constantly even a line of code.All the above, I like to speculate from the price point view; I mean how higher bitcoin prices would be impacting the transactions fees. Yes, when bitcoin will be valuing very higher like one million or ten million per bitcoin then we can say 1 satoshi or 100 satoshi will be enough for one transaction as a fee because 1 satoshi may value $10 or $100. In another perspective, when bitcoin will be valuing too higher then people may not spend much or like people will not spend bitcoin for daily needs which means bitcoin will turn as \"pure asset\". So, lesser transactions and blocks will not be 100% which will lead to lower transaction fees.",
