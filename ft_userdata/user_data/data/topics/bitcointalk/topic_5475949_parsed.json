      "body": "Hey you don't have to blame your friend for not telling you anything about his business rather just think he is trying as much as possible to secure himself from being down because most times people don't know what it takes to be making money and for that, he must take precaution on the kind of person you are maybe who knows if it was your character that made him hid it from you possibly seeing you as person who is too desperate asking him about his source of income and how he usually makes money. Believe me or not, anyone that is regularly asking these questions to his friend would end up breaking the relationship they had for long because with our Nigerian mentality when you began to interfere and involving yourself too much about personal income you easily becomes an enemy to your friend.My advice to you is that limit on how you asked about someone personal hustle or business because most people don't feel secured when their friends began to asked them about their personal income and how they makes it all less such person is your biological brother/sister and relatives then I will say you can keep disturbing them for the knowledge to be shared across you and to some other of your relatives who are really ready eager to learn. When you are too focusing on someone personal income it becomes a problem and at that point you create a point of suspicion to yourself if there were anything for you to know he don't mind closing everything for you so that he can secure his personal interest and protects his income because (Nigerians no dey like wen their 6sters or brodas dey progress pass dem, so dem go do anytin to bring dat pesin down na wetin make plenty pipo dey fear to tell pesin wetin dem dey carry chop so abeg make you no blame dat ur friend wey no gree show you road).",

Don't get me wrong but there are several reasons why some persons hold back from sharing all types of information even to friends. There are people that you will share information to that will dampen your spirit and kill your jinja. They are many even among your friends. As a matter of fact, there are some of my friends that called Bitcoin outright scam and they are still waiting for me to cry later for investing in Bitcoin. If your friend is not sharing information with you, then check yourself if you are the type that will hinder him or if you will be able to put in the work expected to succeed in those business. Besides, have you approached him and he refused? You can't relax and wait for someone to come and teach you what will help you. It is you that need the skill and it is you that should go for it. However, I'm not denying the fact that some people are naturally selfish... that one dey.",

Sometimes our friends do try to tell us about something that will be beneficial to us but we rather pay less attention to them till when we see them making good results from what they ventured into and you can't also blame somebody that wants to see results from other people before joining them in what they do because often times being too incusitive to join a particular trend leads to danger and sometimes being defrauded and checking at the high rate of internet frauds now you will see that it is really difficult to convince someone to join you in what they do online.Fraudsters and scammers have made online platforms look like scams and persuading someone to be part of something that is going on on the internet is not easy at all. Though there a times when our friends tries to bring our knowledge to something that will be beneficial to us but we pay little or no attention to them.Another factor why some of our friends finds it difficult to introduce us to some platforms like this is base on fear that if they bring you up to the system that you might channel all your responsibility on them like buying data and airtime for you to navigate through the forum at all time so not wanting to take some of these responsibilities also makes our friends not to get us involved in what they are doing.",

I will advice to have this in mind that no one owes you nothing,  don't force people to show you things that are generating money for them, allow them to teach you willing. If you keep on disturbing them they will not teach you because you are being too inquisitive to know what he is into. It is choice for him show you are not , you must be into what he is doing for a living . So not take things personal when people refuse to show you things they are into.",

Do you think it's easy to see someone who gives you food whenever you come visiting? If you're my friend, introducing you to what I do is totally my decision and mine alone to take and if I decide to bring you into getting involved in the business I do has a lot to do with the kind of person I see you as. There are some friends that should just be your friend and that's it, there are some you could consider a business/ hustling partner and this has nothing to do with any competition of any sort.Let me share my personal experience in this context. There was a time I was into cpa marketing and a friend will always come to the house and will see me being busy on my system, he always ask me what I do and i just tell him not to take it seriously but he pressurised me to the point that I agreed to tell him about the cpa marketing ànd about how to go about it. Because I had only an account and was preparing for my exams at the time I had to tell him to be managing the account so anything that comes out at the end of the week we would share it. They guy was too greedy and was asking that since he will be the one working for the number of weeks I will be focusing with my exams that I should allow him take all the money then when I'm done with my exams I can create an account for him and then collect my account back.Immediately I just put him out of anything that has to do with the business and hard to face my stuff alone.The country is already hard and there are lots of people that are very not serious and are looking for people they will drag down with them. If I don't feel the need to bring you into my business life based on the fact that I don't consider you someone I could trust enough as a business partner, that doesn't make me a bad person and you should just let it be at the point we are.My sincere opinion though.",

      "body": "I'm not sure if you asked him directly about wanting in on the opportunity or you're just making conclusions? I have a friend who thought such of me in the past and it's not always as it seems. He might have left you out for any of the following reasons:1. Sometimes, It's just a waste of time: in my experience, a lot of people are very interested in making money but only a tiny amount of people are willing to put in the work necessary to achieve commendable results. You might put in effort to help a friend and their unwillingness to put in the work simply means a waste of time. If you do this 3-4 times, it becomes tiring. 2. Not everyone can teach: He might be a good money making doesn't necessarily mean he can teach. Sometimes, it's just easier to help others rather than teaching them especially if the subject matter is complex and hard. Success is hard. Even harder to impact on others.3. Some people are outright bad: I once had an experience and indulged my friend in an opportunity but he simply when behind my back to tarnish my name and get me off the opportunity so he alone will dominate. It's very little trust in this space because not everyone who seem loyal or humble at first will always be. My best guess be say him just dey try dey careful sha. You never can be too sure since no way to know people's actual intentions.You should meet him and have a serious conversation with him about instead rather than drawing conclusions from a distance.",

Don't blame your friend for not telling you his secret to his source of income,  I pray you wake up to realities some days to know that success has a principle and is not a matter of emotions as you want to make it look. Also be thankful for your friend,  for he has shown you love by giving you things that you need,  because what I can understand from the whole story is that you feel your friend is lucky to have hard what he has instead of you taking a look at the sacrifice he pays to be who he is. Thirdly if I were to be your friend all the while I would have discovered that what you want is not the love he is showing you rather your eyes are on his position,  and that is another form of jealousy from friends. Now do you take the time to know why your friend is so sceptical about people around him like friends to the point of keeping his business a secret from them? How many bullets of betrayal made him to decide to remain private,  sincerely speaking,  not many people know exactly what most successful do for a living,  because it is none of their business,  and because your friend did something and succeed in it,  doesn't mean that you will also succeed in the same venture too,  so stop assuming that you can do what your friend is doing. He may succeed in that line and you may become a failure in the same line,  so life no is by copy copy,  do your own thing,  pray to God for success be persistent and keep improving in your own little way,  some days,  you will also discover your path to follow.",

I don't subscribe to the idea that people are selfish rather I prefer using the word self centered on the ground that looking out for ones self first is not against the prowess of humanity. Giving or sharing information is relative meaning that a person can easily dish out information to a person and withhold such information from another. This is why it is not in my book to address someone as selfish. People go a long way to get information and some information have instruction of not sharing to any person. If a friend is providing food and other goodies to a friend, it is let for you to ask him out of the way forward and not for you to sit down and way for him to share the information. Your thinking here shows how myopic you reason. This might be far from his your friend's hought. From another angle, this shows that you are a self centred person also. It will interest you to know that you are what you think.",

However,  I think he was scared that I will be making money like him or,  that I might even make more money than him that is why he decided to keep it as a secret but nothing is hidden under the earth but thank God I figured out what it is and he will be surprise how I knew it. Nothing bad to share update, wetin A no know B fit know, believe me nobody fit do am alone everyone need help or support from each other but no be for now ohh everything don change everybody dey do wetin go favour am and don't wait for anyone update. Me personal any update wey go ruining my life I no want,  some people no know wetin their friends dey do for living sometimes the person fit dey into dirty bussiness or stealing but the person dey get money sharp and you want to join that person, na illegal business and grace differs.It's better for you to make your own research and find what  suits you.",
