The problem is that masses tend to trust centralized and custodial services where they have to sign up and avoid being responsible with their own money. It why custodial services like Coinbase and blockchain wallet are so popular among new users and noncustodial wallets like Electrum less popular. Some people just don't want to go an extra mile.",

In this age of technology, scams move faster than law enforcement can and people are able to scam and go missing still - and a lot do (and once those people are gone you're going to find it hard to recover the money). I think investors are happy to know the source of their funds too, they're a lot less likely to be propping up illicit industries if regulation does well and non kyc coins cost more than kyc ones for example (like how \"fund\" coins are cheaper - due to management fees mostly - like Grayscale). I liked the Theymos endorsed ico idea though with howeycoins, I think more of that sort of education might come from regulation which should be supported. Transactions in bitcoin are likely to remain irreversible though too and that's something that could be educated on more too (I don't know if it's a good or bad thing that wallets don't include their own education documents and force them onto their users - electrum's readthedocs seem like a good example of having useful education but aren't something an excited newbie would potentially find). Getting a user to enter the nmemonic they've just written down and then a phrase of \"I downloaded this software from electrum.org and can confirm it by going to my browsers download history or seeing it's been signed, I also understand confirmed bitcoin transactions are irreversible and will try my best to follow the documentation from [source] if I'm using this wallet for any purpose other than testing with a small amount of funds. I understand bitcoin has value and that I'm the sole controller of my wallet and will keep it secure along with my computer to the best of my abilities and not install untrusted software on my computer\".",

On the side of the government, there are a lot of reasons why regulations are and will be in placed for the whole crypto marketplace...and I even agree with many of the reasons. Now, on my own PoV, what the government is doing is exercising its own power over everything as it does not want to be caught with anything off-guard. At this age, governing is a very complicated thing and for sure it does not want to add cryptocurrency to the mix of things that it does not any control with. And as such, it is hoped that eventually there will be more and more investing people that will be looking - and entering - at cryptocurrency with more trust and confidence. In other words, we are slowly getting away from the old Wild, Wild West era. Now, will that be good or bad? Let history be the judge.",

Dumping the fiat system and choosing an alternative would simply mean that the institutional investors would lose the support of the central banks and the governments, which will kill their business.The more crypto looks like fiat money, the more institutional investors will get interested into investing in crypto. The problem is that cryptocurrencies will lose their true nature, if they simply turn into another form of fiat money.The current situation in terms of global crypto regulation seems enough balanced. Any more regulations regarding the mandatory declaration of cold wallets and/or dumping PoW coins would simply destroy the balance. This means that crypto will turn into \"fiat 2.0\" and the institutional investors might like it, but the true crypto supporters, who want decentralization would be repulsed by the new regulations.",

It looks like the cryptocurrency regulatory process is in full swing and will continue until regulators are sure they can monitor everything.Now, all who are involved in the world of the Money Market need a system that protects investors. If we are not sure whether something is legit or not it is better to just avoid it.In other words, the future of cryptocurrencies will depend on regulation—but regulation is done right. There is nothing wrong if the parties want to regulate this industry, as long as it is done in the right way.

Trying to regulate a phenomenon, a breakthrough in technology, alleged regulators make it less significant and less useful because any attempt to invade its development process prevents people from achieving the desired financial well-being. Regulated bitcoin won't enable people to express their will via peaceful protests against the broken traditional fiat system; it won't protect their savings from rapid devaluation, it won't set them free from shackles of financial slavery, with regulated bitcoin, masters - banksters will retain their power in keeping people poor.",

      "body": "Quote from: Ratimov on October 25, 2022, 10:29:25 PMIn general, the trend towards a fully controlled crypto market in general, and bitcoin in particular, has been going on for quite some time. Every year the word KYC ceases to cause some kind of rejection and resentment. More and more crypto users are beginning to see this as normal... and even necessary, despite the fact that regulation, KYC, and centralization are against the foundations of cryptocurrencies.Some people consider KYC important to be protected, although there is no guarantee at all after doing KYC, on the other hand many retail traders continue to push for regulation, which they think can protect their investment and the security system we expect.Regulations and KYC also cannot guarantee the level of security and the overall process of crypto travel. This will only impose the wishes of some people who think differently from the concept of Crypto.QuoteI have repeatedly, participating in such discussions, written that the regulation of bitcoin and KYC is the reverse side of the success of both bitcoin and the entire industry. After we have seen the explosion of adoption and the emergence of cryptocurrencies in the everyday life of many people, this is starting to attract more and more attention from governments, bankers and regulators. If earlier they said that bitcoin is a bubble, bitcoin is used for drug trafficking and fraud, they tried to prohibit and limit it, now the course is set for regulation and centralized control.  There is a kind of fear of the growth of Bitcoin or Crypto in general, so the regulation is constantly being developed, but to make people believe it more, they use the excuse as a form of security. If I'm honest, regulation is always being pushed and talked about everywhere, only for the benefit of some people, but not entirely the wishes of those involved in Cryptocurrency investment, this concept is completely against the bitcoin journey, even bitcoin adoption continues and grows very developed, although no such regulation exists, regulation is just another reason to limit decentralization.QuoteWeird things are starting to appear in cryptocurrencies, such as reversible transactions, specifying the KYC of the sender and recipient when making a transaction, attempts to transfer bitcoin to PoS for spurious reasons, etc. A little more time will pass (3,5,7 years, who knows) and KYC (centralization) will already be perceived as the basis for working with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The concept of cryptocurrencies is no centralization, no KYC, everything is anonymous and without third parties. But at the same time, without regulation, a huge number of scams and scammers appear, many exchanges manipulate prices with impunity. How to find a balance between regulation and the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) and is it possible? What will the industry look like in 10 years in terms of regulation and KYC? For this reason I strongly agree, Cryptocurrency does not require KYC, Regulation and Centralization, all forms of development methods are self-determined steps, as you said the concept is anonymous and does not require third parties.In the future we will continue to be faced with regulatory pushes, making it even more annoying. Despite Bitcoin's growth and widespread adoption, there is no close connection to the reasons that continue to be voiced.",

So you telling me if KYC becomes solid thing in the crypto from all the directions then we might just see crypto as centralised system. So it may happen that bitcoin would be nothing but informal alternative to the fiat system. Now this has given second thoughts like, if it becomes reversible transaction then many people will start using it because they will have security of error free system and use it as alternative to fiat. Practically transactions are irreversible but with KYC we know both parties so any third party managing transactions can resend money easily to them. That’s gonna be hard to digest if it happens. In next 10 years you ask, it would be nothing but fiat system.",
