You must be a Jr Member to post in Serious Discussion and a Full Member to post in Ivory TowerÂ - Posts in Serious Discussion only activate a potential-activity period. They do not increase your post count.Â - Posts in Ivory Tower neither activate a potential-activity period nor increase your post count.",

Newbies have been restricted on these options Cus who knows? anyone could just pop-up and Begin to write some execrably, crappy garbage ( put together). Some doesn't make any sense and could be something totally different from the topic sentence, wack!! You checked another topic and you was able to reply? That should tell you that it ain't getting optimised for every board.Well, on the other hand -- if you were a member -- it's either the thread is locked, you don't have up to atleast 300 post (for some threads),or you have that particular board on ignore (which I don't think it'll show up as an option for you). You just have to keep posting to get your ranks just so you'd participate anyway, anytime you want.Sandra ðŸ§‘",

Whilst the former two mentioned boards do allow you to read the content within whatever your rank (not post, as mentioned in @hosseinimr93's quote), the latter, Investigations, canâ€™t be accessed, even to read it, until you reach Member Rank.A few related additional things to consider would be:- You need to become a Jr. Member (or acquire a Copper Membership) to post visible images on the forum.- Posting frequency is limited by your Activity (not Rank), as per the following formula:Quote from: theymos on December 25, 2013, 03:50:28 AM<â€¦>Code:waittime = 360;if(activity >= 15)Â  Â  Â  Â  waittime = (int)(90 - activity);if(activity >= 60)Â  Â  Â  Â  waittime=(int)(34.7586 - (0.0793103 * activity));if(activity >= 100)Â  Â  Â  Â  waittime = max((int)(14-(activity/50)), 4);Essentially, you start-off with a 6 minute cool down time between posts, and as your Activity increases, it can go down to 4 seconds between posts.",

Â Due to the rank \"newbie,\" some users may post replies that are off-topic or even irrelevant because, as the name suggests, we're relatively new to the forum and haven't learned much. Many of us haven't even read the rules, so we may spam or plagiarise. In order to prevent negative trustÂ  and getting banned, users may choose to lock the thread. It's a component of keeping us safe and shielding us from tragedies like these. Additionally, there are some that aren't important enough for you to research or learn.",

The reason isn't far fetched as it's in the text to show a level of seriousness to issues discussed. It takes conciseness and in-depth knowledge to address serious issues and these have to do with members exposure to those types of issues, without which nothing of benefit will be derived from such engagements. However, I don't know why  Important Announcements  you mentioned is put under such situation too and members can't respond there. Why can't members reply or react to announcements? Do you know?",

As much as I avoid replying in a resurrected thread, I sometimes fail to take notice of the dates. I failed on this one once again. Thanks for pointing this out. I actually made my reply when the topic was at the top. And seeing that it was still at its first page and the latest replies were also posted very recently, the impression was that it was just newly created. I was wrong. But now I understand how this thread has resurfaced. Since this was bumped by a newbie, he/she might have been searching, exploring, and reading newbie topics.
