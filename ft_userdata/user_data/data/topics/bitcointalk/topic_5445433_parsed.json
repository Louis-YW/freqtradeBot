  "content": "I created a RBF transaction recently that has a single input and two outputs.Output A sends to somewhere that I'd like to transfer some funds.Output B is the change back to my Electrum wallet.However, I was feeling patient (and greedy), so I adjusted the fee to be especially low.Now that some time has passed without confirmation yet, I'm becoming impatient and have decided I don't want to wait quite so long anymore. I want to increase the fee paid on the transaction.However, if possible, I don't want to add any additional inputs to the transaction, nor do I want to alter the amount in Output B being sent to the change address.  Instead, I'd like to reduce the value of Output A, so that the additional fees come from the funds that are being transferred.Is this possible?  And if it is, what are the steps in Electrum 4.3.4 to accomplish this?",

Instead, it provides me with a menu of \"Copy Column\", \"Copy Address\", \"Details\", \"Pay...\", and \"Delete\":If I click on \"Pay...\", then I'm able to adjust the fee, but unfortunately, it seems to extract the fee from the change and I don't see a way to tell it to extract the fee by decreasing the payment.",

You can see that in 'preference'.On the history tab, you will right click on the transaction:You will be able to click on increase fee. Then click on show advanced settings:Then click on decrease payment",

      "body": "I did not disable the RBF,  you can see it here on the \"Pay...\" selection from the \"Send tab:My transaction doesn't show up on the \"History tab\".  It only shows up on the \"Send\" tab.Oh, I just remembered a contributing factor to my problem. When I tried to send the transaction a few days ago, I got this message:I didn't want to pay the fee, so I copied the raw transaction using the Export->Copy to Clipboard option:Then I pasted the exported raw transaction into a few transaction broadcasting locations to get it out on to the network.So, the transaction HAS been sent (I can see it in mempool.space), but apparently, my Electrum doesn't know that?  How can I convince it to refresh it's list of transactions in the transaction History tab from a node that has it in the mempool?",

      "body": "So, the node you have connected to doesn't have your transaction in its mempool. I think you should be able to broadcast a new transaction with desired fee rate. If the fee rate is higher than the fee rate used for the previous transaction, those nodes that have your previous transaction in their mempool should replace that with the new transaction.",
