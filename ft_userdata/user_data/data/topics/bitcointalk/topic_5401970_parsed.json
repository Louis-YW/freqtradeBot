A Byzantine Fault Tolerant Network Solves the Problem of Byzantine Generals. This is a situation where all parties agree but one or more parties may be unreliable. The most actively used consensus mechanisms are Byzantine Fault Tolerances. It takes its name from the historical problem of how the Byzantine generals would agree to besiege a castle.Byzantine fault (also Byzantine generals problem, interactive consistency, source congruency, error avalanche, Byzantine agreement problem, and Byzantine failure) is a condition of a computer system, particularly distributed computing systems, where components may fail and there is imperfect information on whether a component has failed.The term takes its name from an allegory, the \"Byzantine generals problem\", developed to describe a situation in which, in order to avoid catastrophic failure of the system, the system's actors must agree on a concerted strategy, but some of these actors are unreliable.       WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | TWITTER  | MEDIUM  | TELEGRAM  |",
