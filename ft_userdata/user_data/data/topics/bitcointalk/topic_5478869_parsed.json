  "content": "It is well known that blocks will scoop up on average 1vMB of transactions at the top of the mempool. If you are lucky and new transactions are being broadcast quite slowly, then a transaction with a depth <2vMB will also get confirmed fairly quickly. Ditto for <3vMB, except you'd need a lot of hashpower to come online at the same time and beat the average difficulty.A deluge of transactions coming at the same time might push your transaction down to 5, 10, 20, 30, or even 50vMB assuming you've used a reasonable fee. In this case, it may appear that your transaction is \"stuck\" and is not moving higher up the mempool after a couple of hours. Assuming you don't want to RBF, your best bet is to wait until the next day and check the mempool again to see by how much it changed, because miners tend to process transactions faster at midnight. Or maybe there are just less transactions being created during that time. I don't know the reason.For instance, today the fees went down from 260 sats/vB yesterday to 180 sats/vB. Although your transaction might still have the same depth, because many other people have created a transaction with the same fee as you, and now everyone is stuck around that depth.Some people might be tempted to use an out-of-band transaction accelerator. That might work, but there is a problem with this: Everyone's using it all at once, that available spots are depleted merely seconds after new ones are made. The solution to this problem is to just wait it out, as fees cannot stay like this forever, and unconfirmed transactions will usually be evicted after 2 weeks anyway.",

      "body": "The whole situation in the mempool is so pathetic now and I don't think a solution will soon happen. If anything will happen at all, it will possibly be around February or late January which makes it so worrisome. The size is increasing most times, and so is the fee. My fear is that won't it still double the present fees when the price of Bitcoin actually doubles? I think we should prepare for the worst over time.Also for the waiting, I think it is easy for those who are not depending on the Bitcoin transactions sent. We send our Bitcoins for a reason(s), it is not everyone who will have the nerve to wait for transactions to be completed in a week, a month or more. This happened to me around July and I know the effect on financial plans.Fine, I wasn't so dependent on that money sent then but I had a very good investment plan for it. Can you imagine missing that plan just because of the congestion? To make matters worse, I couldn't accelerate it with ViaBTC because the condition of the fee didn't meet the minimum requirement as the congestion just started hours before I made the transaction, so I never knew. But for these big guys, I am sure that waiting will not be an issue, but still, it is disheartening that fiats will never hook your money like this, and the same goes for almost all other coins and tokens. It is shameful that Bitcoin which was supposed to be the role model is the one holding people's money.There is no way it can exonerate itself from this, no reasonable justification here. A lasting solution must be found.",

Or maybe there are just less transactions being created during that time. I don't know the reason. My best bet is many people tend to make less transactions at that time. Although there is variation of time zone but most traders tend to work with the UTC time and that’s why from 01:00 UTC to around 06:00 UTC we usually experience the slight reduction of mempool congestion and as such tends to reduce the fee rate. This is also one-of the reasons for weekends having less fee rate compare to weekdays, most markets like forex in the US are close. Although not related to cryptocurrency trading but some traders have also apply this analogy to it too. Quote from: NotATether on December 22, 2023, 04:34:39 AMFor instance, today the fees went down from 260 sats/vB yesterday to 180 sats/vB. Although your transaction might still have the same depth, because many other people have created a transaction with the same fee as you, and now everyone is stuck around that depth.People tend to make round figures when picking the transaction fees or fee rate and since the miners pick transactions base on fee rate or set up their mempool arrangement of transactions base on fee rate yours might be having same fee rate but will be down. The best thing to do is to not use a round figure but add some decimals like 120.2 sats, this makes your fee slightly higher than those in that 120sat group.

In the space of 1 minutes the 100 free acceleration is easily filled up not like when the pool is less congested and at least for 2 hours same 100 wouldn’t be free. The default time for fee to drop is that 2weeks but it seems to vary because some wallets have an inbuilt rebroadcasting feature that continuously rebroadcast the transaction, and also each node picks the transaction at different time (Although not much difference) and also the size of each nodes mempool is different and larger than each other, as such some might still be having it beyond that time and that means it will not completely drop to the wallet. The best thing to do is when you feel like the fee rate is below the purging fee, one should just try to broadcast the transaction again with another higher fee rate  by changing the servers until the one gets the server that doesn’t have the transaction again",
