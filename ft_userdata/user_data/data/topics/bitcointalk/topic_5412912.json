      "body": "Forcing crypto mining farms to have adaption to become more environmental friendly is good and is a thing should be done.However, if accusing that crypto mining industry is the main or one of main causes of global warming and climate change, that is absolutely not true. According to stats from Bitcoin mining council, you can easily see that the total electricity consumed by Bitcoin mining is smaller than other industries. More impressively, Bitcoin mining industry uses more renewable energy resources than other industries and all the world.It's 59.5% sustainable in Q2 2022 (take from the source below)Q2 2022 Bitcoin Mining Council survey confirms year on year improvements in sustainable power mix and technological efficiencyWatch more on Youtube for result discussion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ISSe8A3pVc",

      "body": "It's truly amazing that while the use of energy in Bitcoin mining is valid enough reason, whether the source is renewable or not, miners are still looking for ways to mitigate its environmental impact. Not only are miners gradually shifting to the use of renewables, they are also using excess energy that the grid cannot anymore store, energy which is otherwise wasted and unused. There is also the use of methane which is otherwise flared. Not only does Bitcoin mining make use of such waste, in effect, it also saves the environment from the harmful effects of gas flaring. Other than this, we've also read how the heat emitted from Bitcoin mining is recycled in many ways, to heat office buildings and homes, to grow plants, and so on.I'd like to believe that all this is done not because Bitcoin mining is heavily subjected to severe criticism and FUD by clueless critics but because the Bitcoin miners themselves are also aware of the earth's state of health.",
