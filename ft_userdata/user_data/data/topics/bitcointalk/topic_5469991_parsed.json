Offcourse, nobody actually takes the effort to critically review each and every line, as a result, in the past, there were vulnerability's in older versions of electrum, and you'll never be 100% sure the current version is vulernability-free (but at least, you ARE able to verify the code if you really wanted to). The best idear would be to use electrum in an airgapped setup, that way most vulnerability's won't hurt you, or at least use electrum in combination with a good hardware wallet.",

They usually prefer hardware wallets, which are the most secured wallets. Although electrum is a very trusted wallet but it is also more vulnerable to hacking compared to hardware wallets.I think they prefer to use electrum since you don't have to spend money in it. By the way, I've been using this wallet for many years now and I never experienced losing funds that's why this wallet is recommendable.",

Nice suggestion I will not trust anyone blindly will do my own research.Here's a how-to: https://electrum.readthedocs.io/en/latest/coldstorage.htmlAn airgapped setup basically means you never enter your seed on an online machine, nor transfer any walletfile that contains any private keys or seed information to an online machine. you create a new wallet on an offline machine and only backup your seed on a physical (offline), secure mediumYou export your master PUBLIC key to an online machine (trough QR codes, or trough a safe device) and import it into your wallet on the online machineYou derive public keys from your master public key, hash them into the address and get receive funds using your online walletWhen you want to spend the unspent outputs funding the addresses you created in the previous step, you use the online machine to create an unsigned transaction (since the online machine does not contain the master private key, the transaction cannot be signed on the online machine)you transfer the unsigned tx to the offline machine for signing, and the signed transaction is transferred back to the online machine for broadcastingan airgapped setup is usually even more secure than a hardware wallet, especially if you use qr codes to transfer the master public key and the unsigned/signed transactions, you do a \"proper\" setup of the offline machine and you make sure you pick a trusted wallet. if you don't have a spare computer you can use as an offline machine, you can use a bootable usbstick to boot a linux distro with disabled network interfaces: just boot from the usb stick whenever you need to sign transactions and reboot into your \"normal\" os for the online parts of the process.I'd suggest starting with testnet coins in order to get the hang of things... The whole process is doable even for not over technical users, but it does require some basic knowledge. There's a learning curve . I'd say there are gradations in security when doing an airgapped setup, ranging from relatively safe to completely paranoid, but in general, it'll be safer than using an online wallet even if you don't go into \"paranoid-mode\"",

I have read some posts by using search button every where someone recommends electrum often.In this case you should trust what people are saying about using electrum because it's the best Bitcoin wallet (been online since 2011) after hardware wallet. If you don't have money for hardware wallet you can use Electrum but as you expand your Bitcoin stash, it'll be better to move to a offline hardware wallet. Electrum has been used by many members of the forum and it has been confirmed to have everything been said about the wallet. It's very easy to install and to navigate yourself around the wallet. But in general don't trust everything you see on the forum and just because people are talking about it doesn't make it valid, do your research because the forum can have lots of misinformation and when you blindly follow what you read, you might end up in a regrettable situation.QuoteCan you tell us why I trust Electrum or why it's better than any other wallet? First and foremost, it's a non custodial wallet, so you're incharge of your coins (private key/seed phrase). it's an open source wallet and has a reputation of been trustworthy (been online since 2011) It supports multi/change of addresses features which increase anonymity. It supports Replace by fee (RBF) feature It supports Segwit address. it support customization of fees and not having a fixed fee.This are just few reasons why it's better than others and where other Bitcoin wallet matches electrum in everything then its reputation of been online since 2011 gives it more superior points above others as they're new in the game but electrum has been offering Bitcoin wallet service for more than decade without any setback. Electrum though is an online wallet so other precaution need to be apply to protect your coins like using it only on an airgapped device.",

I think OP should learn about custodial wallets and non-custodial wallets, closed source and open source, from there he will know how to choose the best wallet for himself. But I agree with you, the safety of bitcoin does not completely depend on the wallet but on the majority of its users, which is us. Therefore, OP needs to have knowledge about security and basic knowledge about bitcoin before deciding to invest in bitcoin.",

Also even if the platform is trusted still its up to the user on how he gonna secure his wallet since if he's to lazy taking some good actions to make his wallet then there's still a chance that his balances will gone and taken out by those hackers.Also don't put all your money there or the one you can't afford to lose so that you will not regret if something bad happens to the platform. Electrum is good and reliable wallet but its up for you on how you use it and also don't click any unwanted links by using that so you can escape those possible hacking scenario which already been experience by some other people.",
