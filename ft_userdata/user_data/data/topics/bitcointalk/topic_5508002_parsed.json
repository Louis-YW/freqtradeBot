It's totally possible to have a way higher Bitcoin price and keep the transaction fees decent. The blockchain just has to be kept away from useless garbage like Ordinals, Runes and other \"the next shiny thing\" crypto projects. The hashrate can be adjusted when more BTC miners stop mining. Some BTC miners might have to switch to mining altcoins for several months. Nobody can guarantee the BTC miners big profits. Mining is a business like any other business and no profit is guaranteed.",

Okay, that is something to look at, Foundry USA and Antpool together control a great % of the network's hashrate, but at least that's two different & competing pools, and right now no single mining pool controls >50% of BTC's hashrate. However, i agree with you, the more powerful these pools get, the more likely it is for them to censor and blacklist tx's and addresses based on request from LE and government authorities, i believe that it is the bigger risk than the expensive 51% attack.",

Let me know when one pool gets above 40% again. It's 2 pools, one with 10's of 1000's of independent miners.As of now looking at everything. 1) We have low fees with the occasional spike.2) A lot of hashrate.3) More small independent miners then ever before.They are all using a limited number of pools but that is not a big deal. What pool you use can be changed by miners in a couple of minutes.Look at it this way, if you want centralization look at ETH where over 80% of their nodes are hosted at Amazon / Hetzner / OVH and other providers. It's like nobody runs their own node at all. (POS or even just for themselves)-Dave",

The hash rate will reduce but not to the extent that it will have negative effect on bitcoin blockchain security. If miners drop then not only does it mean a lower hash rate needed to attack but also cheaper gear available to be bought for and datacenters without a client. so ready available power, Bitmain sells their latest miners for $20-25, used miners go for $5 per th/s, suddenly the security is down to a quarter in $. The last thing needed is some top miners going bankrupt and available to buy alongside their gear at scrap-level prices.",

Ser, the problem IS actually how could the fees support the security of the network if miners' earnings in fees are not consistent. Peter Todd proposed a solution, and it's ABSOLUTELY not going to make many Bitcoin HODLers very happy. BUT I believe if it's a matter of life or death for Bitcoin, it will be changed. It will probably be another hash war, and the community might understand the miners' debate. I hope the Core Developers will be there as the stewards of the hard fork though, and also remain as the stewards of the network.",

Yes, I also use the same method when the Bitcoin network fees are somewhat high or there is a time delay in transactions, where sometimes I use LTC or some other altcoins in order to reduce the fees and get a fast transaction.Many people have started using this method when the network is congested and the fees are high, some of them also prefer to keep the high-value Bitcoin for the long term instead of wasting it on simple daily transactions.",
