What's more great here is they clarify that there's no price change,no fees and surcharges that means no need to worry with such extra fees. Now crypto rich guys can transact without worrying anything since now they can use crypto to buy those luxury cars offer by Ferrari.Click this link for source https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/ferrari-will-start-accepting-crypto-payments-cars-usThis is huge adoption since now automotive industry are now noticing the value of cryptocurrency and in future maybe we can see more companies will adopt it.So which company do you think will be next to announce that will accept crypto? @Nwada001 thanks for that.",
