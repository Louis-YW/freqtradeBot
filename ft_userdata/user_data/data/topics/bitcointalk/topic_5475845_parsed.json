I don't know the exact percentage but I can say and stand to be corrected that 95% of traders even the so called professionals are not profitable. How do I know this through simple deduction. 95% of these unprofitable traders make their money through other means and their unsuspecting followers don't know this. Some of the means are - starting a YouTube channel and making money of a) affiliate programb) YouTube ads- Having a paid course.- Trading signals- Selling trading merch- impressions- and others.The true 5% of traders that are very successful and profitable do not even have a YouTube channel (only a very few exceptions).

It is, of course, impossible to get an exact number, but as a rule of thumb, we believe 70-90% is close to the “correct” ballpark figure.Quote from: https://www.datasciencesociety.net/what-proportion-of-day-traders-find-themselves-profitable/#:~:text=Approximately%201%E2%80%9320%25%20of%20day,99%20percent%20of%20them%20fail.Approximately 1–20% of day traders actually profit from their endeavors. Exceptionally few day traders ever generate returns that are even close to worthwhile. This means that between 80 and 99 percent of them fail.Quote from: https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/tradingidea-60554/why-90-of-traders-lose-money/#:~:text=Based%20on%20several%20brokers'%20studies,forex%20traders%2C%20or%20options%20traders.Based on several brokers' studies, as many as 90% of traders are estimated to lose money in the markets. This can be an even higher failure rate if you look at day traders, forex traders, or options traders.I can agree to that, most traders are losing.Trading is not gambling but it should be seen as gambling because they are the two things online that can make people to easily lose money.",

Aside from that, most of them are still appearing to know something, but the truth is that they know very little and that knowledge in this area isn't yet that deep, right?But I believe that many individuals profit from trading; it's not a large profit, since in my experience, I earn from trading, but it's only a small amount every day. Let's assume it's between $5 and $10 or more for the entire day, and it also depends on the market scenario.",

If traders are profitable in what they're doing, why are they allotting a huge amount of time composing a course for trading if they can just use that same time to go 100% on trading instead? That means they are not that profitable, and they have to do other things in order to make money. If I were them and I'm getting a lot of money in trading alone, I'd probably lay off the rest of my time to relaxation or expand my trading ventures even further.Rich people do not share their secrets to other people that's why they are rich. They don't want to disturb their income stream because that's how they make bread. If a lot of people suddenly goes to their spot and compete for the same resources because they pointed out where the source is, that rich people will eventually notice that it thins out their yield and will probably have to move somewhere else - if that source is really profitable to begin with.",

Ask them to join some trading contests and they won't obliged to join one because they will not show any interest in doing so. That's the reason why they want you to just listen to their contents and that's it.

This is still not a sure profit though. Honestly, it's very possible to convince someone even you are not profitable in trading. It's because not all of our trades are lose trades. I have seen a trader who have a YouTube channel and made a breakdown of their winning trades but suddenly he disappear because he doesn't posted new content in his channel. It convince a lot of people because he is good at making content and he accumulate many followers in just a month. However, profit from making is not enough to cover your loses in trading, maybe it's one of the reason that he is not making content anymore.",

So very true, many traders especially those who market themselves in social media showing luxury life claiming that they did it because of solely trading but in reality most of them are just attracting people to join in their group, that's one of their scheme, showing how luxurious they are then attracting potential customer to avail their courses or seminars, at first they will say that the seminar is free but eventually will offer you something like subscription, because mostly the free seminar are all about them flexing their so called achievements and all about the services that they offer but about trading there are little knowledge that they share, but we can't blame because its their way of living, but yeah not all we see in social media about successful people with luxurious life are not all true its part of their marketing, some true successful and true traders are lowkey because trading is not easy like what those social media traders imply.",

When I read your thread to the end I became increasingly convinced that this was very likely to happen according to the facts. I suspected this when the owner of the signal group experienced large losses when the market experienced a reversal followed by its members sometimes experiencing liquid/margin calls. Of course, what makes them survive is because these traders still have a lot of funds saved from the withdrawals of their members' funds. Besides that, if they open a copy trade, the results they get will also be bigger and clearer than the trade they made.I tend to see that a true pro trader will focus on their trading.",

Profits and losses are a part of business and before trading you need to accept that your business can have profits as well as losses. Now if I am doing business and if that business is making loss regularly then after some time we will not do that business anymore because no one wants to do business with loss. Traders definitely make losses in their trading, but it is temporary, if you can be patient for a while, then I think a trader can recover that loss and see the face of profit again.

Always remember that your loss is someone else's profit and their loss is your profit. Given the fact that the crypto market is quite uncertain, we can never predict the future 100% accurately and thus, we may lose it all. I can read a book and make its writing as a content script for a YouTube video. Nothing is stopping me from doing that. All I need is the view, not the experience in trading. You can share knowledge without having any actual experience. This is why many are losing in trading. They have gained the knowledge but not the experience. And they follow those other traders rather than doing it on their own. And those so-called social influencer traders have found other ways to earn money as you mentioned. That's why they never focus on improving themselves. Thus, their followers stay the same.",
