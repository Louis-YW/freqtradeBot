  "content": "Sportsbet's Bitcointalk World Cup 2022We're thrilled to inform you that Cro2 team (Trofo & cryptofrka) will be hosting Bitcointalk's World Cup 2022 sponsored by industry leader Sportsbet!We want to try out a competition that would be a bit more immersive than regular forum competitions during one of the biggest sports tournaments in the world. The competition itself will favor knowledge over luck and the plan is to see who is the biggest football fanatic on Bitcointalk!The application list can be found here, this is a temporary spreadsheet so you know in which status you are. Green is certain, reserved spots certain until Wednesday.We'll announce once the list is final.Competition format:32 players will be divided into 8 groups – we'll be using the same system as in the actual World CupThe points will be collected by answering a questionnaire (to be filled in Google forms before every round)It will consist of 10 questions per round that will require some football knowledge to answer (starting formation, starting forward, player with the best passing statistics, will a dominating team have over or under 7 shots on target etc). Each correct answer will win a point and based on points won, the players will be ranked in their groups/and later will be decided on who the KO round winner is.In the group stage the format will not be h2h – the possibility of a lot of players having the same amount of points is too high if we base it on 3 points given for a h2h win. We'll rather use the total points won in all group rounds (with 30 points being the maximum a player can collect) and 2 players with the most points overall from each group after 3 rounds will progress to the knockouts.In the knockouts it will be a h2h system – with player who collected more points advancing to the next roundThe timeline is the same as in the actual World Cup – with competition lasting until the WC final Prizes:Total prize pool is 177.53 mBTC (3500$ in BTC at the time of the transaction). These rewards will be paid out at the end.The funds are escrowed and in control of the Cro2 team. You can check the wallet here: bc1qge3m389y0kezc6qxnzv8ehuvdv5etveu242vzsjwfjk9x58mtfnst0wxwcWe will keep the initial USD rewards in brackets, but the rewards will be paid out in BTC.1st place 76mBTC (1500$)2nd place 40 mBTC (800$)3rd place 25.5 mBTC (500$)4th place 10 mBTC (200$)QF loss 4 mBTC(75$)R16 loss 1.2 mBTC(25$) We have left in reserve about 0.4 mBTC for transaction costs, if anything is left over it will be added to 1. place reward, if it isn't enough, remainder will be taken from 1. place reward. It is the biggest reward and few fractions of mBTC more or less shouldn't have much of an impact.Competition rules:There will be 7 rounds in total (3 in the group stages, 1 for R16, QF, SF and final/3rd place)To participate in the round, the player has to play a 0,5 mBTC ticket (or 0.5mBTC equivalent in any supported payment method) on Sportsbet before the start of that round. The ticket must include one game from the World Cup from that round with minimum odds of 1.5. Cashout is not permitted - we can check it with Sportsbet.Failure to participate in any of the rounds means an automatic disqualification from the tournament. That requirement ends when the player is eliminated (example - a player who lost in the QF does not need to play a ticket again in the semifinal to claim his reward)The answers need to be submitted before the 1st game of the round, as well as screenshot of the ticket. We may ask you to provide betting ID as wellRank Member and higher can participate, with Trofo and cryptofrka excluded from the competitionHowever, if we don't fill all the spots, we will look through the applications from lower ranksUsers with negative rank will be taken into consideration only if the spots are not filled even with lower ranked members. For negative rep users we will decide on a case to case basis, based on the seriousness of the incident. This will be subjective, but there's no other way around it.If we still don't get 32 players to participate, some groups will have lesser players – or we will fill the spots differently in coordination with SportsbetIn case of a draw between 2 (or more) players, we will have a tiebreaker question. It will be the 11th question of each round, will be counted only in case of a tie and will always be the same (the minute of the 1st goal in the last game of that round).Both the groups and the knockouts tree will be drawn at random before the first game of that stage of the competitionThe registration will be on a FCFS principle, if we will have more than 32 players we will keep them in reserve in case that some people fail to participate in the 1st round. After the 1st round is complete, the registrations will be fully closedOther standard forum rules apply - no multiaccounting, don't try to be smart and cheat with SB tickets, etc This thread is for registration only, please write down your Sportsbet username while registering as well.The discussion thread can be found here.We hope you'll have fun with this competition and that it's the first of many similar ones on the forum.",
