It gives more money for them, and also it suits with their ideal of the metaverse. And also, Twitter has done that, would be naive if Meta didn't catch up.Quote from: Kavelj22 on July 03, 2022, 09:44:22 PMWill facebook users will still have the option to use metamask or facebook will develop his own wallet?As a start, they can/able to simply connect the address with the current popular web3 wallet, that seems the reasonable thing to do even after it's been established, noting Twitter also does that. It gives both the user and the company not much of a hassle since the targeted users are already familiar with it.",

If they wanted to, they would create their own market and would probably become the largest NFT market. However, I'm not sure if Mark Zuckerberg will want to do this.",

Crypto allows someone to be able to transact anonymously, but when someone links their wallet with their facebook account this means that facebook knows who owns the digital wallet and all transactions in that wallet and this will allow facebook to collect huge amount of data about crypto transactions globally .",

Maybe not to create own wallet is better for the platform, but depending on other security I mean if there is multiple security like fingerprint etc it will be more reliable.",

Facebook is not interested in making NFT or meta world something big, they do not care about your investment at all. What they care about is getting attention. This means that we are in a world where facebook is doing this ONLY for making more money.So, if you think for one second that they turned their name to Meta, or making these NFT stuff, just because they are very interested in it as well, then you are very wrong. They are only doing it because they care about the fact that they could make some good amount of profit from it. This is why I believe that we shouldn't really be getting hyped about it.",

We can say that, their continuous innovation can make things possible. Privacy risk? I don't think our privacy will be at risk, a user should also be responsible for every actions that he will make. Every project has their own security team, and user should be part of it because most of the time the reason why a person got hack is because of his own fault. This is possible but I only don't think if this will become successful or if they will push it. Maybe this will be the same to what happened with libra coin which facebook have planned to create. You think your privacy is safe with them because they are a big company and maybe you aren't aware that they have been involved in an issue in regards to the data of the users.Normal users can't be part of the project's team but what you mean there is that they should cooperate to what is being advised to them in order to secure their data's. Yes it's true that sometimes its the users fault because they aren't knowledgeable enough.",

Facebook is a hub of people who pretty much do not mind (or are ignorant) of Facebook collecting their information for their own use. Heck, they even use it themselves as a way to publicize who they are and what they're doing. I don't even think this would be a thing for other users, this would just be used by project owners themselves as an advertisement of sorts. As for connecting wallets, this should be rather easy to implement at this point in time imo so I don't think they wouldn't do that. As for implementing/creating their own wallet, well it certainly wouldn't be impossible.",

I conclude the update is likely due to their main goals of the Metaverse and mainly to keep up with about what's happening. IIRC, he is also already concerned in regard to the interoperability of it, and surely will try to find a way to integrate anything.Regarding their Diem project, it's been since a long time ago that it has been getting scrutiny. So, I don't think there is any hope that Meta will look further into it.[1] https://youtu.be/Uvufun6xer8[2] https://youtu.be/iwyyxEJCIuU",
