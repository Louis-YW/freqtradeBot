      "body": "Welcome to the forum, and it's good to have you here. You can take a small tour of the forum and other casino Ann threads to see how things appear from their end. You will need to activate the  copper member on your account  in order to enable you to add images to your Ann thread.I just took a quick preview of your casino, and I must say the design is catching my eye. Without going forward, I want to ask a question regarding the accepted currency, as you mentioned only a few altcoins and its chains there. Is BTC also enabled for withdrawal and deposit, as the listed currency you mentioned on your front page might just be for the allowed ones that can do a direct wallet connection to the casino? It’s mentioned in your thread here but not on the casino front page.",

The Op or you?You definitely should go with the advise above and get a copper membership to allow you post images because I can see that you dropped a direct link to an image that’s supposed to have displayed here in the forum, and trust me you’ll only get 5% of those that will visit your thread to click on that link that’s because no one wants to click on a link posted by a newbie since it could be malicious so do well to get your account upgrade to copper rank. Edit: Quote from: BitRuby on September 21, 2023, 11:46:02 AMYes, currently BTC and BUSD do not supported for withdraws, but we are providing swap utility of BTC and BUSD to (USDT, USDC) which are supported for withdrawIt seems like both accounts are controlled by the same person.",

What exchange rate you are using and does your swap feature has a exchange fee because this will surely be disadvantageous your user. Why not automatically convert all the deposits to USD then allow then to withdraw on any currency that you support without the need to swap or something. Duelbits has this kind of feature that automatically convert deposits to USD coins then user can withdraw on their desired currency directly on the withdrawal tab.",
