Of course, those who are rolling big amounts of money are given incentives by the platform depending on their promotion. Those who are getting these rewards from this kind of promotion often lose a big amount of money, it's not intended as a reward for users to earn money but to at least give some reward for their patronization.",

There is no statistics currently. But if you google previous year draw, or search here in Duelbits topic, you might be able to find at least some statistical data, to get more clear picture of this competition. Good Luck anyway.If you hesitate whether you want to participate or not, I suggest to make a minimum 50$ deposit and take part in daily mystery box opening activity. You dont lose anything, because you will either get a free spins, or a task, that is not obligatory to complete. Your maximum loss will only be ~1.5$ when you withdraw in USDT.",
