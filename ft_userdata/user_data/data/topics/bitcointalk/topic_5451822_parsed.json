Like Ada, it will also be a monolithic design. According to Kopite7kimi, these GPUs will be fabbed on TSMC’s 3nm (N3) node. You can expect transistor counts of over a billion and densities of nearly 150 billion/mm². Blackwell should offer core clocks of over 3GHz and bus widths of up to 512 bits, resulting in memory bandwidths rivaling HBM memory.https://www.hardwaretimes.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-to-leverage-tsmcs-3nm-n3-node-launching-in-late-2024/",

With the 3080 card launching in September 2020, and the 4080 coming out in November of 2022, it is likely to continue the trend. Although we’re not sure if it will keep getting pushed back, with separate launches. So we could see the RTX 5080 in Q4 of 2024, or later. Either as part of the launch or not depending on Nvidia’s plans. But for certain the 3nm node from TSMC will be 2024 at the earliest.https://www.wepc.com/gpu/guide/rtx-5080-release-date/",
