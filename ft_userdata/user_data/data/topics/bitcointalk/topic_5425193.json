  "content": "Hello,As a representative of the Fennec project, I'm excited to bring the forum some news about our project. We have an excess of coins, and were hoping to organize some \"bounty hunt\" types of events. We're open to any potential ideas that the community may have, and are currently running two random giveaway events on our Twitter for anyone who engages with our tweets. These giveaways will continue for the next several weeks or months. More than anything, it's our goal to increase interest and awareness around the Fennec project, with the end goal of adoption in mind.We plan on launching an online forum in the coming months, once our community has grown to a sufficient size. All adspend on this platform will be payable in FNNC, which will provide us with our first use case! This forum will not be similar to BitcoinTalk.org, it will be something completely unique and will fit a different niche. Our main goal is growing out our community so that the forum will have some traffic in the future.For anyone interested in learning more about the Fennec project, we are a YescryptR16 algorithm mineable cryptocurrency, a bitcoin fork with some modifications. We launched on November 21st, 2022, so we are less than 2 weeks old at the moment. Our hash rate is about 1 MH/s, so there is definitely room for new miners as well! However, our announcement was aimed at raising awareness of Fennec's giveaways. If you have any questions about mining or anything else about our project, please feel free to contact us (https://www.fennecblockchain.com/Contact.html).You will be able to find more information about us on our LinkTree as well (www.LinkTr.ee/FennecBlockchain). On our LinkTree, we have included our GitHub, Website, Block Explorer, Mining Tutorial, Official Mining Pool, and all of our Socials. The easiest way to get a hold of us would be by email (fennecblockchain@gmail.com), or Telegram (please see our Telegram link on our LinkTree for more information).I will be around over the next week or so to check back on this Topic, so that I can answer any questions within the forum. Thanks for your potential interest in Fennec! Those of you who want to get more involved in the project, we can surely arrange other forms of payment for your engagement, but this would be at the discretion of the team. Thanks for checking out our thread!",
