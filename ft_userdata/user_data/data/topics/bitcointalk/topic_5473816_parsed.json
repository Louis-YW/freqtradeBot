If you want to prioritize your transactions, you can add transaction fees by using the RBF feature in the Electrum wallet. In my opinion, it's not difficult and you can look for a thread that explains how to increase transaction fees using the RBF featureedit : But it seems like the wallet has a lot of transaction history, I'm not sure you're not familiar with bitcoin",

So there's no need to panic like that and stay calm and relaxed about what happens to you.",

Is there a way to do it?You shouldn't spend the fund that comes from an unconfirmed transaction.  You should use a wallet which supports coin control, so that you can choose which coin you want to be used for your transaction. If you don't have any other fund in your wallet and you want to make a transaction which is confirmed fast, you have to pay higher fees, so that miners include both transactions (the parent and the child) in the same block.Quote from: lucifur on November 12, 2023, 02:59:06 PMI'm trying to add the second txn you sent to viabtc but it's not working.

The volume of a single transaction must be ≤0.5 KB, and the transaction fee rate should be ≥ 0.0001 BTC/KB.If your TX doesn't meet the criteria then you can opt for their paid accelerator : https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txacceleratorBut it's too expensive and I don't recommend using it unless you can't do RBF or CPFP and really need the TX to be confirmed.",
