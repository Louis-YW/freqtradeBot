You can buy anytime that you want big or small simultaneously at different price level or in random pattern depends on your current financial capabilities. The method of buying Bitcoin is not bound on any rules or method since anyone can freely accumulate whenever and whatever they want because Bitcoin gives us financial freedom to control our investment.Saying there’s only two way on buying Bitcoin is wrong because there’s a lot of possible combinations and irregular patterns to do it. Also this is not ways on buying Bitcoin but rather a measurement on when to buy Bitcoin.",

      "body": "The dollar cost averaging is actually advised just to reduce the risk of losing and also having to wait till the price gets down to a certain amount. Which might either not come through or might take longer time to come. But is not entirely bad to buy big at a time if one has the money to buy at that time. For example any price currently below the 20k and closer to 15k is my personal support level that bitcoin could fall low to currently. So any amount one has he could just buy at that time. Having a certain planned amount to been used for bitcoin investment should be invested into it straight away although DCA is better but the longer it stays in fiat the more I feel it is not save from any inflation risk that could come. But this isn’t an advice not to have some funds on fiat though",

Buying big will help you get a good amount of bitcoins quickly.It depends on the market. If the market price of bitcoin has decreased very significantly, you can buy high amount of bitcoin at once. Let me give you an example. Assuming the price of bitcoin fall back to $20000, someone can decide to buy big and it will only lead to happiness when the price of bitcoin increase.

I think if you have enough money to buy big and follow up with buying small amounts, but you just decide to buy small amounts regularly, you are not doing the best for yourself.  What is advised is to buy bitcoin, if you like you can buy small or big, depending on your pocket. If you are collecting $500 weekly, you are saving and also using money for other things and only $100 that remains, you can be using $50 or more to buy bitcoin weekly. Sometimes, buying weekly is just because you do not have much to invest or when you are not sure of where the market is going.",

Buy bitcoin as you wish, if you have the opportunity to do so, faith in the profitability of BTC and the willingness to invest in a risky asset. There is another amazing (one of many others) option: invest in btc without buying it. Can you guess or should I give you a hint?",

      "body": "In my opinion, we should not be too rigid and follow only one strategy. I mean, depending on the situation, we use different strategies, not necessarily buying once or always using the dollar cost average. For example, when bitcoin fell to $15k last year, that was too low a drop, we should buy a large amount instead of still using DCA with only 10% or 30% capital. By the way, there may be some risk as there is still a chance that bitcoin will continue to fall, but if calculated carefully, the profit will be much larger than DCA. I also bought a bulk for $17 last year, and I missed under $16k, but the difference for me was negligible.",

I also bought a bulk for $17 last year, and I missed under $16k, but the difference for me was negligible.That's correct, but it's still not a surprise that some people don't really have a planned price they want to buy; some people just want to always be a lamer in the crypto space. At $15k, some people are still speculating for $10k or $8k, but they fail to realize that buying Bitcoin below $19k is really a perfect opportunity. and even if the price dropped, the difference wouldn't be that much. Some people are afraid of the perfect time to buy; they feel if they buy at a certain price below $20k, it might still fall more, but even if they are afraid, they can divide their capital into two or three places and invest one portion, although it depends on how huge the capital they even have.Last year, a friend waited to buy at $12k based on his speculation. From the advice he gathered on YouTube and other platforms, he became so convinced that Bitcoin would fall to $12k that even when the price spiked from $15k to $17,000, he still believed it would dump more. It wasn't until this year that he finally bought it for $20,000. So if he had bought when it was still less, he would have made more profit; even without the DCA, he would have at least used some of his capital to buy at the $15k price while still waiting for his speculated price.",
