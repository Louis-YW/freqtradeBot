  "content": "DOT, 90% cheaper than ATHNEAR is 92% cheaper than ATHThis is not financial advice, but I am very interested in this question.If you consider these coins unworthy and not fundamental, I can write another list, but it is more convenient to explain my opinion on the example of the DOT coin.I know that many investors have bought this coin for more than $20 and haven't sold it yet. I do not believe in the price of 1-2 dollars, if this happens, then there will not be much liquidity.Will buying a $5.2 DOT coin be a mistake? Yes, it is possible if the price falls to the $3-$4 range, but you will still benefit because other investors were buying 4-10 times more.It's hard to buy at the bottom, but at this price you'll be better than 70-80% of other investors. If the price of DOT drops to $3, either you are an averager or you will wait out the losses, but you will be in a much better mood than those who bought more than $15.Why don't you invest now for a period of 2-4 years?Are you afraid of the SEC Regulations that the regulator will call DOT a security?",

Just as if I knew, I speculated it would reach $50+, but I still had some double thoughts about not risking it because I felt it would drop. But after it broke the $40 range, I totally gave up on investing. Although I was actively trading one altcoin, that became so volatile on the Binance exchange that I didn't really give in for Dot.Now that the price is really down to $5+ from the all-time high of about $60, I think it's a good chance to buy, but if we still look back to the ATL of the year before the ATH, it was $2 then, and there is still some possibility that It can fall below the $3 range you even suggested. I have long forgotten about this DOT and some altcoins I was admiring back then because I quite lost my interest in altcoins after some incidents. For your reminder about DOT, even if I chose to invest in DOT now because the price is very low, I wouldn't risk much but just buy like 100 pieces of it or less, and if I can see another ATH or $30 even before the four years, I will just sell off. If I buy 100 DOT for about $500, if the price can just get to $50 or $30 any time soon, I will just pick up my profit from there and leave.SEC is one reason why I will not hold that long even if I choose to buy now, and my second fear is that altcoins can just crash so easily; the example I always give myself is the Luna crash.",

Most altcoin buyers are short term investors so if they see price not going up despite seeing BTC taking its minor bull run, its not helping investors decide. They will only concider buying if there Bull season is confirmed.",

The only beneficial people from such coins are their owners. Fundamental coins are those coins that have a large ecosystem in which many other well-known projects work. These ecosystems have a team of well-known developers and large investors. Examples: Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos, NEAR, Solana, Kusama, some L2 tokens of ethereum solutions.You yourself have to choose what fundamental coins are for you, I do not suggest buying a pepe token Even if the regulator recognizes Ethereum, Polkadot, Cosmos and other large projects as securities, they will not be closed and will not stop being used. Teams will negotiate with the regulator and pay fines, and the American budget loves fines.",

Only to get the price high and sell it to take the profit. But if people think other coins are cheaper and have more upside potential, they might try to analyze them and buy them.People will have their own choice, and hopefully, they can analyze it before buying. And whether it is DOT, NEAR, or even some other coin, don't rush to buy it but wait a while and do some further analysis. At this time, there is a lot of temptation to buy lots of altcoins because the prices are still low.",

Usually those projects are way to expensive already for my standards but now an investment into them makes sense from my point of view. A few months ago i have bought Cosmos for around 9,90$ per coin or so. And even more recently i have bought NEAR for 1,79$ per coin. So with NEAR i am now in the loss zone, but i am planning to hold for a longer time anyways so that does not matter that much and in the mean time i also get staking rewards, which is a nice bonus. If i would have spare funds now i would probably buy some more NEAR or Cosmos.",

Well it's indeed the hyped coin these days and that's why I tend to avoid all the meme coins now these days. There are still promising coins in the market, and my nostalgia senses are tingling from the coins mentioned in the OP as I did day trade before especially Polkadot. I am just not sure about NEAR thoughMaybe not all of them are for hodling, but surely they're still profitable. I just do not have the full-time to explore all these altcoins that's why I just stuck myself to Bitcoin....maybe for now.Quote from: killerfrost on May 26, 2023, 12:08:34 PMI will speak in general terms and do not want to target a specific audience, now perhaps you and I both understand the predicament of the market at this stage.
