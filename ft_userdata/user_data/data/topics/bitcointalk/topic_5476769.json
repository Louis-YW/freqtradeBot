If a transaction is not confirmed, a scammer can use RBF to replace the transaction and the transaction will become not valid again.",

Although transactions can not be reversed there is the double spending feature or rather the replace by fee (RBF) feature which the scammer can use to redirect the same coin sent to you to another address with a high transaction fee, so do not accept an unconfirmed transaction as payment get at least a confirmation first. The most secure number of confirmations is 6 because less than that can face something like a reorg which is rare. Also check the recipient address well, a coin sent to a wrong address can never be recovered except the recipient returns it which is rare because you most at times do not know the recipient. Also use a good wallet with bumping features like RBF and CPFP to avoid your transaction getting stucked on the network without confirmation if you use a low fee for transaction. Also the only authentic accelerator is the viabtc free and paid accelerator, or the memepool.space own (which I haven’t seen a review on). Do not give money to any unknown claimed accelerators they will only rebroadcast your transaction which is something you can do from your wallet. Lastly if your transaction is stuck on the wallet and you can do any of the above, do not pay anyone to help you it is scam. The two things that will happen is if the transaction fee gets lower the transaction will be confirmed and if it doesn’t gets lower tey transaction will be dropped.",

In addition to this, keep your software updated; maybe later it won't be, because it becomes prone to hacking if it is not updated immediately.",

If you are generally asking then there are hundreds of suggestions I can give to you using my knowledge but I do have to use Google to do some research. But if you don't want to wander here and there on Google search Engines in search of scams. I will suggest you to read this thread.Physical Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Attacks that Have Been Reported Worldwide by DavidvictorsonI know this thread doesn't talk about ways to avoid these scams, but it does talk about different attacks that have occurred to the users of the BTC network. And if you are one then reading a few of them will tell you how hackers caused victims so much trouble and what victims were doing wrong. You have to use your knowledge to process things.",
