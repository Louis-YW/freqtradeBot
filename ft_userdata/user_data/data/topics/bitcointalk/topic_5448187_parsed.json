Many people start businesses they know nothing about because their main aim is to make quick gains. They fail to understand that planning is very important in business. Recently there have been fire outbreaks in some major markets in my country. And this has led to the loss of goods worth millions of dollars. The truth is that most of these business owners will go bankrupt because none of them have any insurance policy. So I want to add to your list that every business should consider taking an insurance policy to protect the business from unforeseen circumstances. I know it is not cheap but depending on your business, an insurance policy might help to sustain businesses.",

Business is simple. Just \"money In\". Do something that will make you money. Making a logo won't make you money but finding a good prospect whose willing to exchange their money to the value you're offering regardless of not having an online presence, logo, marketing, or supporting network is a sound money making business. You don't need a perfect plan. A good plan executed today is greater than a best plan tomorrow. Just do it now. Business is money in. You don't need a strong foundation right away,  but you need strong character to start and continue.

Some do business because they are bored, want fame, or recognition despite of not making any cents. Real business is making money. And your success depends on your own definition. While it's true that making money is the primary goal of any business, there's more to it than simply \"money in\". A solid foundation, including a well-thought-out plan and a clear understanding of your target market, can make a huge difference in the success of your business.Having a strong online presence, a well-designed logo, and effective marketing can help attract potential customers and establish credibility in the marketplace. Additionally, a supporting network can provide valuable resources and connections to help grow your business.While it's important to take action and not get bogged down in planning paralysis, it's also important to take the time to develop a solid strategy. Rushing into a business without a plan can lead to costly mistakes and missed opportunities.Ultimately, success in business is about finding a balance between taking action and planning ahead, and defining your own version of success.",

A niche is an improvement of an existing idea or offering something new or different. Customers will gladly accept such service or product but it attracts extra cost to the goods or services. A firm that sells electronics and offers free installation service will have to employ more staff. New products sometimes are not accepted by customers easily. Most times people are used to particular goods and they don't want to use or try another one. But when the firm starts succeeding it will outshine all competition.",

A lot of businesses nowadays are keep failing because they keep starting business that can be considered follower the followers which means that they are creating business because it is the current trend business which they really pure copy not just the idea but everything. They are really not passionate or what they called niche in that kind of business, they just copying someone's idea because they know that it is the trend and for me it is a big problem that it can be considered as main factor why it only give them short term return and it will be a big problem in long term.By identifying your niche, you can easily think a business that have problems and solutions that you can easily solve. For example, my niche is crypto and stock trading. The current problem that I see is a lot of people want to learn crypto and stock trading so for my solution is I will create a business mentoring program that will teach how to trade stocks and crypto in different types of person. It is a simple idea of creating business out of niche. Be creative and make sure you use your brain to think daily in order to create and start a very successful business.",

Yeah, nobody who's wants to establish a business that doesn't have a proper agenda, the agenda of business woman or man is to ensure that it's business is flourishing, but the factors that hinders business not to accelerate or accumulate as expected, is when you are unable to figure out a good site, secondly lacks of management when the business is in progress, I think that should be a major factor while business does not prosper. Any moving business suppose at least have a backup plan's, so I believe the back up is what that can keep business to be substantial or sustainable.",

But what the OP mentioned to me is very reasonable, but I also understand that the application is not easy, even myself or the organization will have problems in the process of operation or development.

By taking the time to plan and prepare, you can increase your chances of success and build a strong foundation for your new venture.All are necessary indeed but know the things that should be prioritized; capital and concept. You need first to distinguish what kind of business would you be engaging yourself with; remember that it is easy to start a business but it would be hard to stay still 'coz if things won't be managed properly, expect a huge loss or bankruptcy. Capital on the other hand is self-explanatory. These things might be simply but believe me, these two are the core idea in a business; team, marketing strategy and the likes will only follow. Also, sometimes in a business practicality and simplicity rules. Just look at those concepts which aimed to offer something \"new\" to people ending up with nothing. There are times a business does not need to be revolutionary, it may come to an existing idea only; not always needing you to be complex about it.",

One point that can be added is that it is important to have a strong mentality in building a business. because I know that building a business will also drain our mentality. because business is an unsafe zone, so we must always adapt at all times to adjust to market and economic conditions around us. we must always be ready to face various obstacles. and it is also necessary for us to make a backup plan and also reserve capital.",
