  "content": "Today when I see  this thread I been won make comment for the thread but I say NO because watin I go talk no be every Nigerians nai go see am, nai make I create this special thread. I for like use this our own Nigerian Pidgin English language but NO because no be everybody fit understand watin I go talk because some people no they understand pidgin language.So what I am about to suggest is for more Nigerians to go and apply for our Nigerian board merit source so that when @Theymos decides to accept the applications we might have about 3 or 4, maybe even 5.We should not just put all our hope on @hugeblack because one day he might get tired of us, and relent to help us with more merits.My suggestion is based on this. Now we have only three (3) applications and most of us already know their names. When @Theymos accepts the application, and there is only three (3) of them, he might accept only one (1) person but if there are more like up to five (5) reputable members, he might approve two (2) or even three (3), so please let more Nigerians that has good reputation go and apply for the Nigerian board merit source.Abeg make e no be like say me dey force you ooo., I just they try let us know say watin be our own nah our own, @hugeblack fit stop to dey give us merits anytime despite say nah promise em make.",
