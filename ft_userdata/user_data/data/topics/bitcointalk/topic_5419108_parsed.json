  "content": "Dr. Faketoshi fails another Satoshi test, and this time it's the simplest of them all; I'm sure everyone knew Bitcoin is an implementation of the Dai's bi-money proposal, but Dr. Faketoshi said it wasn't, and this time he sounded so confident, but he never realized that the real Satoshi taught us and left us a note on every future question, but Dr. Faketoshi failed yet again to do simple home work. How can you be a creator of something while failing to answer a simple basic question about your own creation? A liar accusing someone else of lying? The fake tales continues... What Satoshi said....

Had Satoshi not reserved some coin in his wallet, we would have seen thousands of Fateoshi on the internet every day. Satoshi was plainly prepared for what was to come. A man with 17 Masters degrees and zero knowledge about bitcoin.",

Anyone can do it with little effort, but there will always be people who will not be convinced, just because they like having \"alternative opinion\" and go against the grain. Note how CWS tweets have only a few likes - he's just a cult leader with a small cult. It's better not to pay too much attention to him.",

Sometimes it is funny ironic how the burden of proof is seemingly taken by those who don't need to prove anything.While everybody is calling Mr. Wright a faketoshi, they are also the ones who are looking for evidence to convince each other that he is indeed faketoshi. And while Mr. Wright has offered no proof whatsoever that he's indeed Satoshi, he's basking in the glory of having people try to prove that he is fake. I guess he loves this.",

Someone can say whatever they want, but Satoshi obviously surrounded himself with some people he shouldn't have trusted, which led us to the fact that some still use it to their advantage today.",

HE IS NOTits no longer about proving he isnt satoshi.. its now showing how much of a fraudster CSW is as CSWhow much the man known as CSW needs to be punished for being a fraudstertrying to claw it back to debates about \"we need to prove he isnt satoshi\" is just adding a troll ?? at the end of the sentence which the silly idiots grab onto as if its not yet provenso lets just use the proper terminology.. he isnt. no question. he just isntnow its time to call him out for his crimes, lies and fraudsno one actually cared about someone claiming to be satoshi (just name grabbing) we had phases where we would all say \"we are satoshi\"the point is the utility of the identity of having access to coins and able to maybe tweak code somehow was peoples concern about the identity.. well that identity debate is over. CSW is just NOT him.. end ofso now lets poke at the stuff CSW is. the malicious stuff, criminal and fraud stufflets wake up his disciples to how much the scammer has scammed his fangirls. get them to realise they were scammed financially and get them to start suing himget his own crowd to start circling him . but not with kisses and hugs. but with court summons. make his world shrink..we ow need to stop with the \"proof of satoshi\" conversationsand begin the fraudster conversationsmuch like what people in 2019 started doing with the cryptoqueen(one coin) scamno more playing identity tennis.. and instead start finding criminal holes to poke out that will get CSW in legal trouble.here is one ideadone tweet ayres asking \"do you think csw is satoshi\"or \"what proof have you seen\"instead ask\"when are you going to sue CSW for scamming you\"\"have you tried to get your cash out before its gone\"make it so that his fangirls have a deadline to test their own investment viability. how easily they can cash out and what excuses CSW uses.. start to get his buddies to start ecitingtry to wake them up to then stand over CSW as a dark shadow for different reasons",
