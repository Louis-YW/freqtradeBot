I was thinking about the next halving, but I would also like to hear all of you guys’ opinions.The next halving affecting negatively? Explain that. So far halvings have positively affected the price and have the logic that as supply is reduced, the price tends to rise by the law of supply and demand.",

We have had more \"major\" red candles in the past that were on an actual down trend like from 7 to 14 of June with a total of 35% drop.This makes it more of a panic sell.Quotenot only for BTC, but, also on the crypto market. Shitcoin market always dumps every time bitcoin price makes a bigger than usual move.QuoteWith all of the recent hype because of the ETH Merge, while still on a bear market,Shitcoin stuff are irrelevant to bitcoin price moves.Quotemost of the narrative these days didn't even bring up the CPI variable before.Possibly because it is mostly unrelated.Not to mention that if you think about it, the hedge against inflation (ie. bitcoin) should go up not down when they report high inflation!QuoteWhich are the next events that you think will negatively impact BTC prices?

Nothing more than significant reduction in power usage as the merge is about changing from PoW to PoS.

But so far it did have put a dent on the market, nevertheless is not like that we haven't seen the price going up/down by 10% in a single day. And specially in a bear market? we shouldn't be surprised by it. I guess the better approach is how it will affect the price in the long term, or let's see if at the end of the month we are below $20k. So there's no need to panic just before the market goes down from $22k->$20k.",

Just because of the CPI data release.The CPI data came in at 8.3%, which was expected to come in at 8.1%, because of this We got to see the dump in the Bitcoin.And the bull we saw turned out to be a trap.Currently, if we look, a very big event is coming, the merging of the ether.After that, there is the meeting of the FED on September 21. The higher CPI data is a clear indication that the rate will be higher in this meeting of the FED. That is, the rate can go from 75 bps to 100 bps.If the CPI data can come to 8.3% then the rate can also come to 100 bps.Which would cause a massive crash in Bitcoin.Rate means that the bank is increasing the interest rate.If 75 bps comes then the market can move a little bit more. But more chances are 100 bps which is more chances of bitcoin crash.bitcoin dump we can see in coming next few days and weeks.",

The market reacted really harshly to the CPI rise, even though it was just a tiny bit more than expected.But hyperinflation is mostly here to stay, imo. They can raise rates all they want, but then how is the government going to service it's debt? Printing money. I think they are backed up against a wall.I think $BTC is the only long term asset out of this nonsense, that or real assets like housing, energy and food.

Just take the example of the last bull run, halving occurs on 2020 and then the pandemic came and we all thought that the market was doomed but it wasn't.The next halving is my biggest factor and belief that I have that faith on it because looking at the history, it's always been that very factor. Well, the cut of the miners reward and the demand factor, that's most likely surely will make the price higher of bitcoin.It's incomparable to the altcoins halving or any update like this merging.",

We shouldn't worry too much about short-term events as there will always be bad news being spread during a bear market to drag the market down. That's how the sharks collect their bitcoins.We are a long way from bitcoin's next big event, the halving event, an event that is believed to be the catalyst for bitcoin's price rise. So until then, there will be a lot of volatility, many are predicting that we haven't really bottomed in this bear season so the best thing to do is stay calm and well prepared to face tough days' upcoming towel.",

But it's too soon to say.Additionally we are not just in an inflation alone these days. We have had inflation alone over the past couple of years and during that time bitcoin went from $3k to $70k.Currently we are in a recession with inflation which is entirely different. Meaning people can not earn enough money anymore (hence the recession) while price of everything keeps going up (hence the inflation).That's not to mention the two ongoing wars on food and energy.",
