  "content": "The term ‘Titano Network Metamask’ has surged on the Internet recently as the demand for adding Titano to Metamask is rising.It is a DeFi platform specialized in staking.The first version of Titano only exists on Binance Smart Chain.Its mechanism is backed by $TITANO token, which is a rebase token.A rebase token will automatically increase, or decrease its supply based on the rebase algorithm.This means the amount of token in holder’s wallets may increase through time systematically.Learn more about Titano Network Metamask in our article.",

I have seen several similar projects, they don't last long.True, I don't like this kind of algorithm, this is similar to stable coins to begin with, however it doesn't have reserves like for example Tether, but instead, burn tokens in circulation or mint tokens based on the current state of the market.So I would suggest to do your own investigation on projects based on rebase algorithm. Maybe sooner or later, it might have some loopholes that might de-pegged its price, just saying.",
