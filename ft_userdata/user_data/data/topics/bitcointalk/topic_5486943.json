You can get good profit even you miss best ten days each year.See Bitcoin profitable days (98.3% as of writing) and its yearly candles chart (with only 3 Red Yearly candles in history).https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/charts/bitcoin-profitable-days/https://charts.bitbo.io/yearly-candles/",

I wonder if it simply means the highest individual ten days puts together. Not necessarily the the ten days in a row with the best return. In that case I guess you can get a negative percentage so far this year when you take out the ten best days spread throughout the past two months. But if that is the case its a pretty arbitrary and meaningless graph since there is plenty of appreciation outside of just the top ten days, even if the graph says its negative. Because the top ten days could overlap on the price chart, like days from early January when Bitcoin shot from low $40k's to high $49k, and then days from February when Bitcoin shot from low $40k's to $52k, covering much of the same ground.",

I believe it's what you say. But I wonder, if you get spare days, not being consecutive, how can someone get an aggregated percentage? Just by adding them together?For example:Day 1: 32%Day 2: -12%Day 3: 10%So, adding Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 the percentage is 30%, but if you take these days consecutively and calculate the increase in the period from Day 1 to Day 3, then the percentage is 27.76%.So, in general, I don't know how percentages work when you want to calculate cumulative percentages.",

      "body": "Interesting point of view to get more copium haha. I mean it's going up, will continue to go up until the whales decide to buy at cheaper prices. What exactly I mean is that when they start dumping like 20%, everyone in the market will start selling so that they don't miss out on this pump. And that will bring the price to go below. I am expecting a bit shakeoff as I posted one chart today on the forum. Lets see where the price goes in a week.",

I did not look into it with details and how the author made that chart. I shared as it reveals interesting point of view and I think it's enough.Here is a break-down of Bitcoin price change in 2024 so far.p_oc: percent of price change between open price and close price daily.open: Open priceclose: Close priceIf I take a sum of 10 best days so far in 2024, I have it is 50.5%, that is closely to the number in the chart and if I take sum of the rest, probably it gives a number is -9.2%.If I drop two latest days, 27 and 28 Feb, two cumulative numbers will be 42.2% and -15.1%. Did the chart author make a typo from 42% to 52%?Green daysCode:      +------------------------------------------+     |      date   p_oc        open       close |     |------------------------------------------|  1. | 28feb2024    9.5    57,071.1   62,504.79 |  2. | 08jan2024    6.9   43,948.71    46,970.5 |  3. | 26feb2024    5.4   51,730.54    54,522.4 |  4. | 26jan2024    4.7   39,936.82   41,816.87 |  5. | 27feb2024    4.7   54,519.36   57,085.37 |  6. | 01jan2024    4.5   42,280.24   44,167.33 |  7. | 14feb2024    4.2   49,733.44    51,826.7 |  8. | 09feb2024    4.1   45,297.38    47,147.2 |  9. | 12feb2024    3.4   48,296.39   49,958.22 | 10. | 04jan2024    3.1   42,855.81   44,179.92 |     |------------------------------------------| 11. | 29jan2024      3   42,030.92   43,288.25 | 12. | 07feb2024    2.9   43,090.02   44,318.22 | 13. | 08feb2024    2.2   44,332.13   45,301.57 | 14. | 15jan2024    1.9   41,715.07   42,511.97 | 15. | 02jan2024    1.7   44,187.14   44,957.97 | 16. | 24feb2024    1.6   50,736.37    51,571.1 | 17. | 16jan2024    1.5   42,499.34   43,154.94 | 18. | 10feb2024    1.3   47,153.53   47,771.28 | 19. | 01feb2024    1.2   42,569.76   43,075.77 | 20. | 11feb2024    1.1   47,768.97   48,293.92 |     |------------------------------------------| 21. | 10jan2024    1.1   46,121.54   46,627.78 | 22. | 20feb2024      1   51,777.73   52,284.87 | 23. | 06feb2024      1   42,657.39   43,084.67 | 24. | 18feb2024     .9   51,661.97   52,122.55 | 25. | 19jan2024     .8   41,278.46   41,618.41 | 26. | 23jan2024     .8   39,518.72   39,845.55 | 27. | 27jan2024     .7   41,815.63   42,120.06 | 28. | 24jan2024     .5    39,877.6   40,077.07 | 29. | 16feb2024     .4   51,937.73    52,160.2 | 30. | 02feb2024     .3   43,077.64   43,185.86 |     |------------------------------------------| 31. | 25feb2024     .3   51,565.22   51,733.24 | 32. | 05feb2024     .2   42,577.62   42,658.67 | 33. | 15feb2024     .2   51,836.78   51,938.56 | 34. | 20jan2024     .1   41,624.59   41,665.58 | 35. | 13jan2024     .1   42,799.45   42,842.38 |     +------------------------------------------+Red daysCode:     +------------------------------------------+     |      date   p_oc        open       close |     |------------------------------------------| 36. | 05jan2024    -.1   44,192.98   44,162.69 | 37. | 07jan2024    -.1   43,998.46    43,943.1 | 38. | 28jan2024    -.2   42,126.13   42,035.59 | 39. | 21jan2024    -.3   41,671.49   41,545.78 | 40. | 25jan2024    -.4   40,075.55   39,933.81 | 41. | 13feb2024    -.4   49,941.36   49,742.44 | 42. | 03feb2024    -.4   43,184.96   42,992.25 | 43. | 06jan2024    -.4   44,178.95   43,989.19 | 44. | 11jan2024    -.6   46,656.07   46,368.59 | 45. | 19feb2024    -.7   52,134.81   51,779.14 |     |------------------------------------------| 46. | 30jan2024    -.8   43,300.23   42,952.61 | 47. | 21feb2024    -.8   52,273.54   51,839.18 | 48. | 31jan2024    -.8   42,946.25   42,582.61 | 49. | 17jan2024    -.9    43,132.1   42,742.65 | 50. | 04feb2024     -1   42,994.94   42,583.58 | 51. | 17feb2024     -1   52,161.68      51,663 | 52. | 23feb2024   -1.1    51,283.9   50,731.95 | 53. | 22feb2024   -1.1   51,854.65   51,304.97 | 54. | 09jan2024   -1.8   46,987.64   46,139.73 | 55. | 14jan2024   -2.4   42,842.26   41,796.27 |     |------------------------------------------| 56. | 18jan2024   -3.5   42,742.31   41,262.06 | 57. | 03jan2024   -4.7    44,961.6   42,848.18 | 58. | 22jan2024   -4.9   41,553.65   39,507.37 | 59. | 12jan2024   -7.6   46,354.79   42,853.17 |     +------------------------------------------+",
