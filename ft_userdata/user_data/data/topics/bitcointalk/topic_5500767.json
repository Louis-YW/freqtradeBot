However there should be no calls for alarm for those who weren't opportuned to invest at the early days cause there's still hope and the different ATH's Bitcoin has reached is a big prove, so the best decision to make is to invest at this point when it's still the current price. The people I feel sorry for are those who have the financial capacity to invest heavily in Bitcoin but still have doubt over it's potential, I mean why would anyone even have doubts when they've seen Bitcoin set different ATH since it's creation to this point, well there would always be a doubting Thomas, those who would still find it difficult to believe even when they've seen prove that sometime is real. Nevertheless, if there's anyone who's willing to invest in Bitcoin but still have doubts, I put it to you that the best decision you'll make is to buy Bitcoin and Hodl, don't get discouraged by the drop in price cause I believe you should've known by now what volatility means.",

      "body": "OP can I tell you that I am the one who took the best step and not the miners? Lol.The miners are actually like external bodies of the developers of Bitcoin but do not need to be convinced because they have the technical ideal of how possible Bitcoin creation could be actualized to reality utilization while I am obviously not associated with any of it and needed to be convinced by those who are already into the system and then will have to think otherwise in both positive and negative before making my decision until I accepted Bitcoin even though I was late.I heard of Bitcoin around 10 years ago and just last year I embraced the technology. Sometimes I found myself to be blamed why I was so late but I came to understand that my emotions needed to be balanced so that I can be able to handle the risks involved in the financial technology while understanding that Bitcoin is a volatile currency.So, others who are still in doubt of Bitcoin also needed such time to balance their emotions while on the rhythm contemplating their decisions and interests on the Bitcoin.Moreover, Bitcoin is not a centralized system that the government as the authorities may say that... From hence forth, this is the acceptable financial system that everyone should embrace instead Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that leaves everyone a self decision to decision what their intake is about the currency so, let us not find those who could not invest or accept Bitcoin as alternative means of payments to be lost in the digital era ed maybe today. It just all about choice.When to invest and when to sell all depends on the investors and individuals and it doesn't matter what we used the funds for. Those who fears holding at the Dip are literally investors who do not understand what it means Holding and Buying at the Dip and if they do, they would always take chances to explore more to their assets while the ATH ahead proves the rewards.",

If their investments bring profit, their wealth increases and it's good. The rich knows what they do and usually they do well with their investment. Warren Buffet, Berkshire Hathaway did not invest in Bitcoin but their wealth, net asset value did not stop its growth since 2009.Regret is with people who did not use money to invest in anything that was profitable in latest years and only hold their money in banks. Their wealth loses by inflation recent years.Bitcoin has very good ROI and you can see it there.https://casebitcoin.com/https://cryptorank.io/price/bitcoinhttps://charts.bitbo.io/satoshi-per-dollar/",

They not want to end up like Tulip Mania, they might think in 2018 it's over, but since Bitcoin can make new ATH in 2021 and 2024, it's no longer Tulip Mania.",

There are sometimes that you just need to wait until the massive bear season is over but we are not yet in that period of time.Any investor that is planning on long-term hodli, the best time to buy is during the bear season because he will buy at a cheaper rate and when the bull season comes, the price of bitcoin would have increased 2x and above. It is traders that should buy bitcoin during the bull season for them to make little profit due to price fluctuation.This is why newbies who just want to start their bitcoin journey should start right away if they are prepared and should not wait for any special time to buy, because time waits for no one. DCA approach is a good accumulating strategy in the sense that it helps you to grow your portfolio with little amount that you are using to DCA weekly overtime.",

Bitcoin is not a means of transaction without a 3rd party but a means of investment and this is very far from Satoshi's vision. Regarding Hold, I hold some and sell some to make ends meet. It seems like if one holds Bitcoin from the 2017 price then he will make a lot of profit. At that time I believed that Bitcoin was capable of providing profits. I even spent a little money to start investing. At this time I feel lucky because I got to know him earlier. If anyone is new and wants to start then don't hesitate. The value of bitcoin is not an obstacle, investment is taking advantage of circumstances and there is always an opening to make a profit.",

We have discussed this multiple times yet the question still lingers on “are we using Bitcoin the way Satoshi intended?” Well Satoshi’s intention for creating Bitcoin was well documented in the Bitcoin whitepaper and every other discussion Satoshi had on the Bitcoin forum. With all due respect to Satoshi, I believe he has done his part and entrusted the rest to us. We can decide what Bitcoin should be - an asset, commodity, store of value or payment method. In my opinion, Bitcoin is whatever the Bitcoin community agrees it is.",

When I told a friend about this , he boasted that he'd rather buy altcoins instead and it sounded silly. I did the math with him and for him, he'd have to pick the right ones that are actually able to generate those 10x gains. And there are thousands of altcoins. It's very hard to pick. After it he saw that the best bet by far is the bitcoin-only strategy. And it's never too late to invest.",
