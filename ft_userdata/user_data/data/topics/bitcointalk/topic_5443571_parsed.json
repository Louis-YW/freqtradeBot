This scenario seems much more likely to me. I visited the site you are promoting here, which is bitlems.com. the domain was registered less than 20 days ago and already offers a profit of 10% per week and up to 250% per 3 months period.

But then I did realize that they use 45° rotated old WAVES[1] logo as theirs and there are no social urls such twitter or medium, to see if the project is legit or not. It's indeed fishy especially when this project gives away 100USDT for the new users. In this case, I agree with examplens.[1] [img height=30]https://talkimg.com/images/2023/05/17/blob03135b73be42ea6d.png[/img]",

Were you able to withdraw your bonus after a week has passed, as you mentioned? It's been over a week since you created this thread and we haven't seen you again, man, most of the new scam exchanges do these offers just to lure clients to make a deposit on their scam platform, I don't think you could withdraw from their platform because there are no reviews about it on any of the review sites or in the blogs, I think that this exchange platform appeared to you in an advertisement in Google, Did you do your own research? I've seen a lot of negative highlights about this Bitlems exchange, Check out the following screenshot:",

Should have accumulated passive 1200-1400$  As the saying goes, \"if it's too good to be true, probably is\".And if you are saying that you can't withdraw and ask you to deposit more, then it's a sign that this is a scam.Anyhow, good luck to you and your $1000 invested, hopefully you will get that supposedly accumulate passive, if not, then it's gonna be too late because you are not going to get that money back for sure.",

I know an exchange that gives 50$-100$ to test out and the profit can be withdrawn.",

This person posts a suspicious story 3 weeks after creating an account and I would not even dare to click on his link. This whole fake legend smells from the very beginning.There is clearly a 2nd scenario here. Sites that offer super profits should be avoided. This is a fake bait. Even more so, go around a mile when they ask you to replenish a deposit in order to withdraw a bonus. This is a classic scam.The verdict for beginners is simple: don't fall for this folly.",

If you open the home page and scroll down, you will see a profit calculator which tells you that you can earn 70% profit in only a month for your investment, so if you invest $1000, you will get $700 profit in a month.That is too good to be true and anyone with sanity should understand that it cannot be true and they will never pay any of that but it is just to show and attract new users to make deposits.",

      "body": "With that kind of story, I have that quick coming up that type of exchange is a scam. No exchange will give you $100 for free and then will ask you to deposit because that's the actual there. And it has happened for so many times when newbies have asked in the past how they're going to get that free money. But the reality, is that they won't get it. Once you deposit on that exchange, they'll have another questionable requirement to you and might ask for another deposit. It's a loop that you'll never like unless you're the owner of this website and you're shilling it here. And with the whois information given, this is the type of exchanges or websites that I mostly avoid.",
