Only an example!!!!ERGO lost much of the reputation after this BlockTime disaster and the in my opinion not successfull hardfork, the stolen ETC twitter account and so on.",

They may have lost a good chunk of the revenue they had over the last few years, but these companies (at least most and the biggest ones) didn't rely on ETH mining.We are talking about companies that existed before mining - many years before. And they have always been growing, as they are in a very strong and constantly growing market segment - games.Furthermore, with the history of the metaverse and virtual/augmented reality, these companies still have a lot of room for growth and a lot of market to explore. Of course, the revenue immediately reduced, but it does not significantly affect them.Perhaps the smaller companies felt a greater impact, but even so it shouldn't be a problem (if they know how to manage the situation well) as there is a lot of market available.",
