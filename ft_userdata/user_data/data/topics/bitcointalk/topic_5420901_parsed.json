Quoteit's different when compare it with bitcoinDon't just look at the growth of bitcoin without taking into account the risks it brings. Your home doesn't increase in value, but at least it's safe for you and real estate is considered the safest asset. For bitcoin, it might give you 3 other houses but could make you homeless in the future.Don't and absolutely must not do that, invest with money that can be lost and make sure it doesn't affect your family's life.",

For example price could continue dropping (meaning you could lose money) for some time or price could stay here but in both cases it could take a very long time for price to go back up for you to start seeing any profit. Can you accept the fact that you may need to wait for a year or two to see profit?Also you should educate yourself about storing bitcoins correctly in a cold storage so that you don't just lose all that money to a hack or malware or something like that!",

But guarding bitcoins is in fact more difficult than maintaining an abandoned house. While you are in the waiting process, your management skills are at stake. I mean, are you able to keep your bitcoins intact up to the expected cycle limit from a wallet security standpoint or do you decide to switch to holding another asset that seems to be increasing faster, or something else.",

Hopefully you have obtained adequate knowledge of how Bitcoin price moves and also how you should store your Bitcoin, never use an exchange even though it is a local exchange which is always considered safe by many users, buy a Hardware wallet and store it safely",

You could answer your question: why wouldn't you buy it again today if you made a profit? Though the problem with you is that you need to look at risk; since you sold your first bitcoin, you still came back to try it again. This time, you should consider the risk: what if bitcoin continues to fall? What would you do? Are you one of the chickens that will sell it at a low price? or are you the one who, like a Spartan, holds it no matter what?",

Great advice, let someone else rent that house and take the profit to invest bitcoin. I am trying to accumulate bitcoin and when bitcoin hits my goal I will sell it and buy a house, I think even if bitcoin has more potential, I won't do the opposite. Sell my house for bitcoin, i swear I never thought about it",

Good move, you have taken the right risk on your investment, now you can buy as many bitcoins as you want and rest assured there will be big improvements in the future.Keep calm and hold your bitcoins.Quote(I have 2 house, which I want sell it is abandoned house)For me this is the right step, because you don't sacrifice your place of residence in investing, that means you take advantage of unproductive assets to develop further, the risk will still exist in investing.

Although I don't know your country and how real estate is booming there, nevertheless, it would be a very good bargain to buy Bitcoin at lower prices to sell later. Only that you would have to be careful and wise before investing the money. As no one knows the exact time that serious buyers would come for the houses, you might start the advert now, but keep the money in your bank account after selling, (USD) if possible. Then you continue to analyze and speculate on Bitcoin and wait until a bullish trend is confirmed. For now, the trend is bearish and might go lower before it starts buying in near future.",
