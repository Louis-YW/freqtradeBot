I'd recommend searching for advice on making a strong password, if you don't have any ideas on what to use you can use the first 6-8 words of a newly generated random bip39 mnemonic (from a trusted wallet software and one that won't be used to store funds) as a password.",

This way even if you lose access to your device which contains your wallet, email and forum profile, you can recover everything back.Also, avoid phishing links, preferably, click to always stay logged in.

You may consider it to be safe, but I don't think so. I use my main and regular email for my bitcointalk account. By this,  if anyone has access to my email, it will be very difficult to know that I used same for my bitcoin forum. This is because I only recieve a message from bitcoin forum only when I am sent a message and it doesn't happen often. So, hundreds of messages covers the message from bitcoin forum.But if a dedicated email is used, definitely all the messages in the email would be from bitcoin forum which will be a clear indication of how important the bitcoin forum and email is to you.What I consider not do is using same password as my forum password in other third party apps.Op, in addition of the above solutions given, ensure you access bitcointalk.org from only devices you control. Avoid accessing the forum from random devices  and consider not to save your password in a browser.",

I think the salient thing should be for the user to put up a very strong password for the email address and every site one registers on and make sure not to log into a phishing site. Bookmark the sites you visit from original sources as that will ensure you're interacting with the original source.QuoteIt would also be much better if you avoid using a public wifi to access your accountThis is very sound an advice. No one should think they want to save data or money by using public WiFi. It's not advisable and it could expose one's secret and private information. If you must use WiFi, let it be with casual stuff and sites you're searching.",

      "body": "First and foremost, I would like you to please note that you are not the only person who has been victim of cyber crime. It is unfortunately a fact that all of us have been victims at some point or the other of online criminal activities. This is even more prevalent in our crypto world. Security remains one of the biggest challenges for everyone and one of the most important areas of focus and priority for the crypto community in particular.The most important thing to protect your account from hacking is to set up two-step authentication on your account and a strong password. A strong password will contain a mixture of letters, numbers and special characters. It should be lengthy and should not have any words repeated from a previous password. A strong password prevents a hacker from being able to enter your account but remember that it cannot stop a hacker from getting access to your email account and use that to hack your account. Never re-use a password, a hacker can pick up your password from somewhere else and use it to log in into your account. This is a very important point. Beware of email phishing scams. Emails purporting to be from a crypto-related email provider or exchange pretending to be asking for a password. Avoid clicking on links or opening attachments in emails.These are just a few things that come to mind right now, but of course , I cannot know all the vulnerabilities out there so you should do your due diligence. Stay safe.",

You are still new on here, and as Newbie your account does not worth much, probably not so interested in hackers taking someone's fresh account.you definitely need to have some kind of verification, with which you will be able to prove the original owner of the account. You got the best suggestion to sign a message on your Bitcoin address, I would also suggest one more possibility, verify your account through the unofficial Bitcointalk Discord server Bitcointalk Party - Discord serverI saw some of the BTT moderators there and I believe that you will get the quickest reaction in case of a problem.",

Sincerely you said the Truth because, their is some factors that can make your account to be hacked, i can say one of the major reason this happened is because of review of emails password and inactive or inaccurate of securing your email, and in addition, your account password been reviewed also to someone, actually if someone have access to your account details, it's very obvious that the account can be changed without knowing or penetrating to your email. Lastly, creating account without a valid email,  that gives the hackers the deemed opportunity to uproot your password..so in all ramifications, be curious and consciousness of your details.",
