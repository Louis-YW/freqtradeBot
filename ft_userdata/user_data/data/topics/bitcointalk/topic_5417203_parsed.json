He spent quite a lot of money on it, and even sent David Marcus to a senate hearing to defend this coin. Metaverse is yet another shitty idea, which will bring Zuckerberg close to bankruptcy. I guess he is feeling insecure due to the decreasing popularity of Facebook. But it is natural. Facebook achieved growth at the expense of MySpace and Orkut 10-15 years ago. Now time has come for Facebook to undergo the same treatment.",

Zuck is trying to put a cart before the horse.You've got to wonder where such a big sum of money really ends up and how the breakdown actually looks. Whether it is mostly spent on arranging server contracts, hiring super computers to do some sort of modelling, building up data centers, or how much staffing is allocated to this project. It makes a super convenient way to offset taxes by reallocating budgets or hiding certain costs within this research & development which might actually benefit other companies within the Meta group. The more they spend on this project, the more they can write off profits in places like Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp - I hope the regulators are paying close attention to the accounts.",

      "body": "I think Facebook's metaverse spending spree is probably more of an existential issue than one that'll be fixed soon, they might even find more things to attempt to invent in the meantime while making themselves even less efficient.They seemed to have problems going down the route most other big tech firms did by selling cloud computing (I think this was particularly because of how slow Facebook's servers have always been). The metaverse might go like those games available on Facebook too (messenger particularly). Google then got instant playable games that didn't ping all your friends who played the same game with your score whenever you played it...Quote from: noorman0 on October 15, 2022, 12:16:57 PMI don't know how long I haven't heard of the progress of their project which I think has stalled in the last few months.

I've played some good games that have a core team of about 80 devs.For the biggest mmo rpgs I can think of:Final fantasy 14 has 400 devsWorld of warcraft is estimated to be 100-300 peopleI think these VR experience builds will become cheaper the more they're built though too. Most of what's needed for AR and VR is already out there - I bought a game on steam back in 2017 and was given a VR version of the game (I didn't play it that way though because I don't think it'd have been that much different). There will likely be the first few attempts at the metaverse before it comes a lot cheaper to produce though (unless someone like unity tries to take it on straight away). Films also became more expensive to produce somehow even though a lot of their editing and production costs became cheaper (mainly because of the cameras they need iirc) this could be something that happens with the metaverse too.",

Facebook's company may have one of the largest company to start something on the crypto industry however it doesn't guarantee that they could succeed to anything they plan to.Each and every startup crypto has different usecase which is why some of them failed and some of them end up a success. You don't need to have a multi billion company for your project to succeed but rather be able to follow through your plans and roadmap.",

I will say one thing - this failure will save many even more money, and the Meta and Zuckerberg will receive the most valuable, albeit insanely expensive, experience.",
