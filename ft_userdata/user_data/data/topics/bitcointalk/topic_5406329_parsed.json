  "content": "Has anyone dealt with crypto-arbitrage? Is it really such a profitable thing? And how difficult and risky is it? I 'm asking cause I talked to the guys from the firm, so they offer 20% per month. So I'm thinking, should I go try it myself or work with them? If anyone is wondering what i'm talking about, here's the link: https://intelfin.io/",

From what I can see they do offer their trading bot as an investment and promises you to make a profit.But the fact is this kind of strategy is the same as other investment sites. They offer an attractive profit but if you invest in the latter, you are scammed.I suggest you stay away from them and instead of giving them links here on the forum put them inside the insert code tag or remove HTTPS on the link so that it won't rank up on Google and to avoid new users clicking that site. A bit check of your post history it seems that you already have a thread about this why don't you read your old thread instead. Do you own this website?To prove that you don't own this website remove all links to that website here on the forum instead put only the name.",

In fact, you would keep it to yourself and only involve close friends and family to take advantage of the offers. But since that isn't the case, you need \"investments\" (deposits by us that will never be returned) and you are not going to get those here.",

Of course, you have something to do with the shady website, scam bug.Yep, an instant red flag. Anyway, I checked that arbismart.com and this sentence will tell you everything that you have to know about that service \"Annual interest rates reach up to 49% on all fiat orcryptocurrencies aside from RBIS, which offers unmatched rates of up to 147%!\" So, Luna and Celsius couldn't handle giving 10-20% interest yet arbismart offers up to 49% on fiat. This can only end in one way.",

Then I want to still say something because some newbies whose spirit of lossing money is following would still be tempted to open the link and invest. Any investment promising you high RoI is a scam. They don't produce money or mint coins, there's no way a legit company will give you a return of 20% and above monthly. It is absolutely not possible, please in order to be successful and meaningful, avoid pay one and get two.",
