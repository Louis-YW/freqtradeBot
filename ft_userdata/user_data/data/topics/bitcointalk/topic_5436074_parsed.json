  "content": "QuoteOn Wednesday morning, Bank of America customers began reporting issues with payments processed through the money transfer service Zelle, which led to money disappearing from their accounts.Many customers took to Twitter to express their outrage as they began to notice the missing funds.One user tweeted, “I almost lost my mind when I saw $2,000 was missing from my account.”Another said, “So cool how @BankofAmerica magically disappeared a large Zelle transaction that HAD ALREADY POSTED and I had used to pay bills. Now I’m extremely in debt in my checking and I can’t get ahold of them. Unbelievable.”Zelle is a money transfer service that works with U.S. banks to move funds directly from one bank account to another. Zelle transfers are quick and free––making the service a popular alternative to credit card transactions that can take a few days to hit users’ accounts and often require fees and bank transfers. However, the service has been under fire by government officials for being an easy facilitator for fraud and theft.The website downdetector.com reported over 1,000 outage reports for Bank of America by 10:30 a.m. EST, coupled with a similar spike in Zelle outage reports.Over a customer support social media account, Zelle redirected users to Bank of America, saying, “The Zelle App & Network are up & running. We are aware of an issue that is impacting Bank Of America customers when sending & receiving payments. We recommend contacting Bank of America’s customer support team for additional updates.”Zelle does not offer any protection for payments made through their services—which means that there’s no safeguard for customers if a transaction goes wrong.Bank of America told TIME that, as of 3:00 p.m. EST, the issue has been resolved and customers are receiving their funds back.The Charlotte Observer reported that customers received a notice when they logged into their online bank accounts on Wednesday, saying that transactions were not missing, but delayed.“Zelle transactions made between January 14th and January 17th may be delayed in occurring and posting to accounts as requested,” the notice said. “Transfers will be completed and will appear in your account activity and balances as soon as possible.”In 2020, Bank of America customers reported another major glitch, with accounts showing inaccurate balances of as little as $0. The company acknowledged the issue, saying at the time that any inaccuracies did not impact their actual funds. “Some clients may currently see an inaccurate account balance in online or mobile banking. There is no impact to their accounts and their information remains secure,” Bank of America said.Global payment service ACI Worldwide reported last year that fraud loss in the United States from Authorized Push Payments—scams that trick victims into willingly making large bank transfers to fraudsters—is expected to rise to $3 billion in 2026.In a report issued last fall, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said four banks provided data reporting over 190,000 cases of fraudulent transactions on Zelle involving over $213 million of payments in 2021 and the first half of 2022. In the majority of the cases, the report noted, individuals were not repaid the amount they were defrauded. Zelle did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.Warren called out both services on Twitter Wednesday afternoon, writing “@BankofAmerica and @Zelle are apparently failing customers again, with money somehow disappearing from accounts. This should be fixed immediately and customers should be compensated. I’ve called out serious fraud issues on Zelle and this is their latest failure.”https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/a-bank-of-america-glitch-sent-customers-into-a-panic-over-missing-funds/ar-AA16uJ5D....Uncertain as to whether this is the type of publicity US banks and financial institutions need in 2022.This is nothing new. There has been no shortage of this type of news over the last decade. I have a feeling that the majority of people who were once completely oblivious to these types of occurrences are becoming closer to news cycles and current events. If banks in 2007 had a glitch like this one, the american people would not have cared. But things may have changed to a point where people are becoming much more savvy and connected to current events. In which case, I don't know if financial institutions want this type of negative publicity, considering the fallout could be more serious and widespread today than in previous eras.These types of casual glitches also make it difficult for banking industry CEOs like Jamie Dimon to comment on crypto or bitcoin. I hope people are aware of events like these and taking steps to adapt and prepare to our shifting economic climate.",

Thank God the issue was resolved immediately because in my country you would have to queue, fill firms and wait for weeks for it to be reversed. But in Bitcoin just ensure that your keys are safe and you have the right address during transactions.",

Therefore, people will complain, start thinking about alternatives, and will return to the old service whenever they feel that it provides them with quick solutions and is used by all their friends/family.It is not limited to banking services, but even social media. There are many excellent options and alternatives, but the largest number of users is the one who has the say in the end.If we see an increase in Bitcoin adoption and scalability solutions are available, then they will be excellent alternatives to banking services and may deal them a fatal blow.",

The banks and the national media started the outcry that if people don't return the overpaid money, they'd be accused of theft/fraud. So essentially blaming customers for the faulty machines.I still think that you shouldn't be keeping money paid out to you in error, but it's on banks to take responsibility for that and to organise a convenient way such money could be returned.",

      "body": "With what has happened recently in the banking system, people are no longer safe keeping their funds in the bank. Should people start putting their savings into Bitcoin along with it? I don't know how others may be seeing it, but the banking sector is failing gradually. People will have to deal with these recent occurrences and be prepared to see them happening more frequently in the future. How can someone trust their money with a bank, and if anything happens to the funds, they can't do anything?Naturally, some people are careless about keeping their security details safe, but that's what they must learn if everyone begins to use Bitcoin.On January 12, 2023, 6PR published a publication about a hardworking 18-year-old Albany resident, Aurora Casilli, who lost her life savings of $36,000 in a second as she fell victim to a sophisticated phone scam.She is a customer of the National Australia Bank (NAB).Quote from: https://www.6pr.com.au/hardworking-teen-36000-out-of-pocket-after-sophisticated-bank-scam/Aurora told 6PR Mornings host Gary Adshead, that she woke to a text from NAB that stated an unauthorised transaction had gone through on her account.“I was immediately freaking out – so I didn’t think for a second and contacted the 1800 number and once I clicked on the number it was like ‘welcome to NAB please select your options’ so I selected my option, the little song went on for an hour, where I was then asked to provide my details,“Everything was so legit, I could not believe it. They basically said no worries we will create a new account where you can transfer your money – I immediately transferred the money and that’s when the guy hung up the call,” Ms Casilli said.you can listen to Casilli as she explained: https://omny.fm/shows/6pr-mornings/hardworking-teen-36-000-out-of-pocket-after-sophisKyle Carey also fell victim to a similar scam as Aurora's and claims to know 15 victims too.Quote from: https://www.6pr.com.au/hardworking-teen-36000-out-of-pocket-after-sophisticated-bank-scam/ Kyle Carey, is another NAB customer who has recently fallen victim to a similar scam.Kyle told 6PR Mornings that he’s a member of a Facebook group with 15 other people who are also victims of these NAB scams.“I got a message from the NAB number that always messages me and basically they sent me a verification code – so I called that number and got put into a holding line – they basically got me to transfer $8,000 into a new account,” Mr Carey said.“I got told by NAB to call the actual fraud team and they said it will be a 6-8 week process and then 2 weeks after it happened, NAB emailed me saying that they won’t be able to retrieve any funds and that they feel like they’re not liable.”How can someone lose $36,000 and another person lose $8,000 of hard-earned money? People trust their money with the bank and get frustrated for it. I don't know how others view this, but I am so bitter with all this incident. When I was growing up, I was not hearing all this sort of scam news about banks; people's money was protected by the bank. WHAT'S YOUR OPINION ABOUT BANK?",
