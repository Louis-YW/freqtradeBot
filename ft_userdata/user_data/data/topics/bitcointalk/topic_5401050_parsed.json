  "content": "I have started watching old famous movies from different cultures and countries and I noticed every culture has their own original style of early film-making. So I decided to make a list of such movies. If you have a movie recommendation, please post it in this thread and I will add it to the list.However please post it in the format : [Title of movie (year) - plot:...] [Your own synopsis on the movie] [Optional: Video link to the full movie]Old Movies Worth Watching Kin-Dza-Dza! (1986) - plot: Two humans are trapped on an alien planet which was made almost uninhabitable as a result of selfish greed and a disregard for nature. I recommend watching this movie subtitled in its original audio. Full movie available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYHv8eJrW2Y This movie was really one of a kind. It was its own artstyle, it showcases the damage and corruption done by the Soviet Union from the perspective of a visiting Foreigner.Here is a good explanatory video (Watch with translated subtitles): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWoo16-udZg Harakiri (1962) - plot: The grandfather of a samurai asks permission to voluntarily perform harakiri but stalls by first telling his sad story, which builds up to a vengeful ending. You really can feel the emotions of this movie as it imbues the complementary emotions of vengeful satisfaction and benevolent discontent. I recommend watching this movie subtitled in its original audio.Three Days of the Condor (1975) plot: A CIA office worker becomes the target for assassination and attempts to find out the reason. The experimental nature of early film-making in America is a sight to behold.Old Movies recommended by fellow Bitcointalkers:Recommended by Arriemoller : The Phantom Carriage or Körkarlen (1921) plot: Swedish Silent Horror Film, by and Starring Victor Sjöström. Full movie available on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ew6XUvvoK_oThe movie's film-styles have been widely copied by many modern films. Some examples of visual echoes in other works throughout the century : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ1RTpikz8IThis is the english translated full version. (Bad quality and weird music added): https://youtu.be/ZvQzaSa_4Q0Recommended by Lak93xy: Das Boot (1981) plot: A German U-boat stalks the frigid waters of the North Atlantic as its young crew experience the sheer terror and claustrophobic life of a submariner in World War II.It is shivering how they build up tension there. The pure horrific reality of what the people actually might have felt when boarding U-Boats back in 2nd WW. https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082096/Recommended by odolvlobo: Seven Samurai (1954) - plot: A village hires a group of samurai to defend them against raiding bandits.This movie is considered to be one of the greatest Japanese films. It was directed by Akira Kurosawa, considered to be one of the greatest directors. It has plenty of action, humor, and drama. The Magnificent Seven is a famous American remake of this movie set in the American West.Sunset Boulevard(1950) - plot: A struggling screenwriter stumbles upon the mansion of a forgotten silent movie idol and ultimately becomes her gigolo. The movie shows the events leading to his death.This is a dark creepy drama. It ends badly for everyone. I like this film because it does a great job of bringing out the complexities of the main characters, contrasting their eccentricities and delusions against the other characters.Dr. Strangelove (1964) - plot: A deranged American general initiates a nuclear attack against the Soviet Union.This is a very entertaining dark comedy about pathetic politics, bumbling bureaucracy, and a mixed-up military leading to the end of the world. The movie stars Peter Seller, who plays three different characters, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and Sterling Hayden. It is directed by Stanley Kubrick.(Last updated 16. November 2022)",

I love Marvel and DC, both the comics and the movies, but I've always preferred other movies. The first movie on the list is \"Shining,\" which is based on the Stephen King novel of the same name. It is a wonderfully atmospheric and compelling movie that will not disappoint. I ranked the entire \"Hannibal Lector\" film series in second place, since it is a universally appealing movie. I'm going to rank \"American Psychopath\" in third place since it's an intriguing movie like the book, but he's already a novice.",
