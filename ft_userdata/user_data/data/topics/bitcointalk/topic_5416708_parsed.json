Well, that was in their wallet (no private key for you).If that's no longer available I'm afraid that the chances for you to get those coins is slim (I should say 0).However, this is not an issue with Bitcoin, it's an issue with Miniclip itself, so the only ones who could help is them (i.e. allow you withdraw those coins to your wallet).Now think it over: what would be the reason they would give you now valuable money you didn't claim when you had the occasion?If you think you have a chance, ask their support.",

      "body": "MiniClip? Like the games websites? Are you sure those were Bitcoin and not just their in-game currency?Because searching for \"Miniclip Bitcoin\" only leads to project threads from 2012 [1] and 2014 [2] with users considering creating a MiniClip clone but with Bitcoin which leads me to believe that MiniClip themselves never used Bitcoin.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=118421.0[2] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=896402.0If you're not referring to the games website or MiniClip indeed did use Bitcoin in the past your best bet is trying to recover your old account or, as mentioned by Neurotic Fish, getting in touch with their support.",

And another post on Reddit here https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31qbm1/miniclip_8ball_pool_bitcoin_betting/What I think is that he might be read those threads and posts before and remembered that he earn some BTC playing the 8ball pool p2p betting so it means Miniclip 8ball pool is not involved. If I'm right he should receive the BTC in his own wallet or in exchange.",

In most cases, the web has collapsed, like some users of bitcoin faucet sites recently asked about the bitcoins they accumulated in the past.If they ever offered bitcoin, I would have known bitcoin earlier. I still have one of the miniclip games (8pool) on my old phone from 2013 and never get a notification that they use bitcoin. I prefer that what you mean is hosted by a third party.",

My friends and I were playing games on Miniclip back in 2010-12. I don't recall seeing anything about bitcoins on the site. It's a shame, because then I would've heard about Bitcoin a lot earlier than 2019.",

Just like the usual thing in playing with other players and betting with it then it was the thing that ETF and heretik said. I guess this is all case closed for OP.",
