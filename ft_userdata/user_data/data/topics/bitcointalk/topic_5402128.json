  "content": "I was planning or releasing my series 2 coins this coming week, but more than half of the mint was stolen in route to the distributor. The distributor is someone I trust, and is not to blame at all in any way. Coins with serial numbers 002-104 and 121-128 were shipped and the two boxes arrived empty and sealed back up. My guess is someone at the usps distribution center heard the sound of coins looked into the package seen the btc logo on the coins and thought he hit the jackpot than stole the contents and sealed them back up. It hurts bad right now, but I will bounce back. If you see these coins on ebay, or wherever they are stolen coins.They are not loaded thankfully but it still sucks. I have 80 or so sets left of series 2 coins I have to put together I still plan on releasing at some point. Anyway if anyone sees them for sale anywhere let me know. I have not sold a single coin to anyone so if you see one its stolen",

Hopefully they will hit ebay as there is no where else to really sell them. This royally sucks. The good part is most of the people that would buy such coins is in here. Nothing is worse than a Thief. I swear",

How can you be certain the distributor isn’t at fault? It seems like that would be the most likely place they could have gone missing. Especially if the box was well taped. I can’t imagine any federal employee thinking it would be worth it to do something like this. The penalties involved would far outweigh any potential gain. I’d be looking at the distributor and asking them to review security tapes of what happened once the packages arrived and when they were opened to determine if one of their employees might be at fault. I doubt this would be an isolated incident either if they have a crooked employee in house. I hope you get some resolution from this.",

      "body": "To add another perspective (although the chances are low, still a possibility though).The sender might not have properly sealed the boxes (or the boxes were not of good quality). During transit, boxes might get slightly crashed, a hole opened in the box, hence some items fell off. At an arrival destination, they observed the hole in the box, and re-sealed the box.This might sound like a science-fiction scenario  , however, the receiver of the package can prolly check if such a scenario is applicable. (the condition of the box, if the same seal was re-applied or a new one added, indications of how the box was initially opened before re-sealed, coins bundled -or not- together with additional packaging materials inside the box etc. etc.)If USPS keeps weight records at each checkpoint, then should keep pushing them to provide those to you.I had an instance in the past, where I received a small box that was re-sealed in one edge/corner. There was a printed note attached from my national postal network, that mentioned that they received the package with a hole/opened and they re-sealed it. (fortunately, nothing was missing from the contents). I am international and this was an incoming parcel from another country, hence your case is different due to that everything was handled by USPS.Really sorry about what happened to you & I will keep an eye out in case I see any of those coins around in the interwebz. I am looking forward to getting my hands on those new coins whenever you release them for sale.Edit: I read again and realized that you mentioned that \"two boxes arrived empty\". Too much of a coincident then... Edit 2: When someone dispatches many coins inside a box, bubble wrapping them in a way that no coins sounds can be heard, is a common sence...",

As long as any external sealing materials are covered by the brown-paper-tape that is used for registered mail, it is acceptable.So the box can be secure as you would like.. even use some duct tape... lolAnd to add to krog's comment about the \"departure postmarks\"... from what I was told recently that each postal clerk has their own stamp. So this registered packaged can be tracked back to very first step of which clerk you handed to over the counter",
