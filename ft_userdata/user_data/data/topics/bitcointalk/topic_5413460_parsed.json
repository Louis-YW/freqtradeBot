As a gambling industry, one of its problems arise in the form of the regulatory requirements in different jurisdictions which can vary by state, country and even within countries too. Most of these casinos are not focusing anti-money laundering measures but most of them are working in full accordance with the laws and guidelines created by the government and other gaming institutions. If the government has an agenda it is going to want to push it forward, they are in power after all. The most likely situation is that the government will require its casinos to be AML compliant.",

But unfortunately I think the law towards casinos and certain requirements tighten up that's why many fraudulent people struggle now to use casino as their platform to launder money as they require a KYC to their users and also especially they request a huge amount of money for withdrawal.",

Both are illegal, sure, but that still does not have anything to do with the other. If you get caught with scammed money then obviously that money will be seized. As far as money laundering goes, it might not be allowed to be seized by the casino unless they recieve an order from the police to seize the laundered money, but you will still get into trouble with the law.I doubt any online or offline gambling casino, whether crypto based or fiat based, cares about enforcing the law. They do it because they have to. Of course they would rather make more profit and not give any of their players up if they had a choice.",
