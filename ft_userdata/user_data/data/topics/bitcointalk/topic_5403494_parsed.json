The bulltrap will always possible to happen. This can be an exit liquidity for the whale who wanna try to sell their coins soon.The chart looks like a recovery but this can be a very bad thing. This may be only for short term and the worst thing has not yet come to us. People must be careful but i do see that some altcoins over performed the trend right now.",

This is true. The current correction is just a relief and there's a possibility that there will be a second wave of dump once Bitcoin hit a strong resistance. There's a news that SEC might approved a butcoin short ETF and whales are pumping the market in preparation fpr the short ETF. This theory has a point and the timing of this correction coincides to the date which the bitcoin short ETF proposal has been announced to the public.Reference:https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2022/06/20/proshares-is-launching-a-short-bitcoin-etf-this-week.html",

During this bear market we really need to be careful as the current market is really volatile.Never make a decision haphazardly without considering it because as you said the market is still volatile,however it is difficult to predict market movements so it is necessary to be careful,the most important thing is to keep up with the progress",

But what i do know is that it is risky to buy alts anytime, but much more risky when the market is the way it is now, altcoins are more often than not pump and dump coins that are pumped by hype, and i am afraid there is no sort of 'hype' in the network at this very time. Many alts that have crashed would not rise back up again, so there is no need trying to buy them cause chances are high that you will buy an alt that is going completely off the market with this bear run.",

That's a good point but long term, buying alts when Bitcoin is 20k or less is going to be a great deal. I'm accumulating CNDL and ATRI and will buy more the further Bitcoin plummets in price. I see this as a blessing in disguise.",

In crypto currency, there is not an early time, and there is not a late time when it comes to investing. And before you can claim the accolades \"crypto currency investor\" you must be an individual that can study the market and take profits in the bear market as well as in the bull market. All you have to do is to conduct adequate research to have a good entry and have a tp limit before investing in a bear market or a bull market",

The price has been on fluctuating levels from the past week going down to $18,000 but today with the correction back in $21k level, this is not sure that the correction is bull for now.",

It is every investor's pipe dream to buy at the bottom right before the market turns, and in fact, without insights, 99.99% of investors will never buy at the bottom. So it is stupid to try to wait for the absolute bottom to buy, it is better to pick up promising projects step by step. And to argue that you should not buy now, because it can fall even deeper, you can forever.By the way, that is exactly the reasoning of those who did not buy anything at the time of the covid crash in 2020, thinking that this is not the end and will fall further, in the end they were all deceived and the market began to grow without them. So if it's a utilitarian project, buy in stages rather than trying to buy everything in one go at the lowest possible price.",

This warning you are giving looks very good and I think at this point everyone is also making incremental purchases with the money they have because everyone also knows that the market is not on a good track yet and there is even a potential for a further crash to the price point lower even though the pump slowly is also very likely to occur from now on.",
