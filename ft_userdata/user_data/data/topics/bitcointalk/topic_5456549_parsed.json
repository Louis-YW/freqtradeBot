If the password is simple and you have some idea about that, you may be able to brute-force the password. If you haven't created the wallet yourself and you have purchased that, you have been scammed and I recommend you to not waste your time.",

I think it is an encrypted Electrum file that its seed phrase and password are encrypted, so he needs the password to be able to spend on the wallet as the file contains the seed phrase and password, but encrypted.One of the best way is to backup seed phrase which can be used instead to access your coins easily.",

If you can get to either of them you'll be able to spend the funds in the wallet. It is a must to back up the seed phrase to your funds in more than one secure location, that way you will eliminate an event of a single point of failure and always have access to your funds. If the password you used is something you can remember, take your time and keep trying, you may get it.",

It's just there are many people who ask help and later we learn that the files were bought or received it some how illegal way.Did you say that you can open the wallet without the password? With the Electrum file, as far as I know, you can not even open the file if it's password protected. I will suggest the same as hosseinimr93, your best shot is to brute-force the password.",

With the Electrum file, as far as I know, you can not even open the file if it's password protected.In electrum, you can choose to not encrypt the wallet file and only encrypt your secrets. In this way, you can open your wallet, check your balance and transaction history without any need to enter a passworda and you will be asked for your password whenever you want to make a transaction. To do so, you must uncheck \"Encrypt wallet file\" when choosing your password.",
