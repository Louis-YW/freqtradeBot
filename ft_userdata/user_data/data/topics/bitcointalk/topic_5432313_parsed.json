I would appreciate data from a reliable node.There can't be a reliable tracker since each node can experience a specific reorg while others don't.The nodes that didn't receive the orphaned block(s) don't have to reorg since they have the valid block(s).In other words, a \"tracker\" may say that there's a reorg in xx date while others say there's none.If you have a Bitcoin Core node, you can use getchaintips command to see if you've reorgs.\"active\" height is the current tip, \"valid-fork\" is when it performed a reorg, while others are likely reorgs.",

There were 6 instances of stale block candidates in 2022 according to the data. There were many more of them in 2021.",
