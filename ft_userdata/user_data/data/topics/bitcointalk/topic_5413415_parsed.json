I will message them privately first to give them a chance before I bring it in public.",

Account Ziyush has a negative reputation for running scam service while user wwzsocki is a trusted user here in the forum. The OP will not gonna waste time posting this thread if both accounts has a clear reputation. Probably to warn other user that dealing on the other account if the connection is valid.I doubt that this enough evidence to connect 2 accounts here base on the typical guidelines of investigator here in the forum.",

The OP will not gonna waste time posting this thread if both accounts has a clear reputation. Probably to warn other user that dealing on the other account if the connection is valid.I just had a quick look on Ziyush's trust page. It seems OP and Ziyush had issue with Cryptopia. OP was arguing in favour of Cryptopia and Ziyush was arguing against it. Is this the result of the two feedback left by OP? To me it seems it's the result of the argument. Please correct me if I am wrong.On the other hand Ziyush sent a negative feedback to OP which also reflects issue with Cryptopia.Clearly it's between two guys who did not have common interest and wanted to protect each others project or project they like.The other feedback on ziyush feedback page is about nothing but a dead project. In 2017/2018 we had so many of them.",

But, frankly, I do not see a good reason for you to publish these suspicions to the public, as long as the two accounts are not involved in suspicious activities. Given that having more than one account on the forum is allowed, the desire of the owner of both accounts to keep this a private decision, I think it is good for the rest to respect it.This is in addition to the difference in the situation that you encountered with each of the two accounts. I don't think you are posting this just for defamation. Or maybe you want the rest of the members to search for stronger connections between the two accounts just based on suspicion .",

I think your reason is floored tbh if you were involved in the coin you would be in the telegram group with the benefit of more information.Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1546400 combat007    2018-04-11    Reference    awesome coin to mine. meseenger is the future and coins associated with them are fortune..Quote from: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=trust;u=1546400 ranchi    2018-04-10    Reference    Bitsum have personel telegram wallet and that is controlled by user,",
