      "body": "I believe no one here believes CBDC as crypto since it’s just a digital version of fiat that store on centralized ledger. Banks needs to level up their game since crypto is already starting to make some noise on financial world. There’s a lot of free money flowing on crypto that supposed to be with the banks alone if crypto didn’t exist. Simply they are trying to disguise as crypto so that normie user will use it instead of the stablecoins available on crypto.Personally I’m neutral on this topic since most of the stablecoins available in crypto has a high risk to fall down in near future like what happened on UST while USDT has a lot of shady background. I feel more safe putting my money on my country CDBC rather than crypto stablecoins in long term if my purpose is just to store my assets in stablecoin.",

Also if you're using centralized exchange to buy and sell your coins, this mean you're not care with decentralization!I don't understand why there's many users are complain with centralization while you're still use anything that centralized.To be honest CBDC is more trusted than USDT, USDC, BUSD etc since most banks will offer insurance if they lose their fiat (although there's no proof if it will be same to CBDC).",

So be carefull CDBC is not crypto, but camouflage the new fiat.They did not actually make it as camouflage, instead it actually a FIAT. There is no foundational difference, the difference is mainly in the form of it, which is it exists digitally and is more centred than current electronic cash. If they really want to make decentralized cryptocurrencies to became less decentralized, doing it via regulation is way simpler compared to making a psyop of crypto camouflage.All in all, a truly decentralized system is hardly controlled by a centralized entity. And here is a related quote worth remembering from Satoshi:Quote from: https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/4/#selection-32.12-32.13Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own.",

But difference in CDBC would be that people would actually trust it. It wouldn't need to be backed by fiat as it would be fiat. However there isn't yet a blockchain that would work in a way that would keep regulators happy about issuing CDBC into it. So far every experiment on it has pretty much failed. I could still be years away.",

To stop its growth is a tedious task and to have competence is possible. In such a way the risks of cryptocurrencies were briefed and the solution is achieved through CBDC. This is how CBDC were getting marketed. Most of the cryptocurrency users understood well about it and stands away. Even after years the CBDC developed on different countries can be seen as now, but it'll be hard to see cryptocurrencies in the similar level of growth.",

That's funny how eagerly they want to control it. As if they can just put stop and run buttons on their system to control the bitcoin. Let us not forget Bitcoin white paper and how it is made.

I do not agree that governments cannot move away from fiat; I mean it might take some time but when more than half of population of a nation adapt and demand then governments may follow El Salvador. CBDC must be an intermediate attempt by governments to deviate people from the attractions of cryptocurrencies. It means people will follow the most convenient and beneficial thing which must be cryptocurrencies (considering against fiat or CBDC), but before people realizing all the potentials of cryptos, government will play all the drama and CBDC must be one of them.Moreover, CBDC is not a centralized version of cryptos but it is another form of same fiats without any physical existence.",

I mean I'm seeing it as the only \"currency\" we can used if we want to transact to government agencies. And if it is treated as regular fiat then I guess there's nothing wrong with it. Of course, we still be very cautious of it's usage as as I have said, they can simply monitor us with their CDBC's.",

But there are multiple benefits for the government to push for a digital currency. They can have a bird's eye view on their citizens financial data.

This might be what the gov'ts use as a preface to their agenda on introducing CBDCs but it really is much more than that. By issuing their own CBDCs, governments are significantly improving how their cashless payments work. They become faster, cheaper, more economical, and work efficiency increases significantly. It is hardly possible to agree with the opinion that CBDCs are created in order to resist cryptocurrency. States have enough other leverage to fight cryptocurrencies.Yes, CBDCs will be completely under the control of governments, but their non-cash transactions were also under their control. So nothing has changed in that regard. CBDC can be considered an improved form of non-cash government money and nothing more.",
