  "content": "I wonder how ordinary people around the world felt the worsening economic situation in their respective countries. I know that although many are very much aware of the soaring inflation, nothing has changed much in their day to day lives. I can observe that in some families. They seem oblivious of how the prices of basic goods and services are rising in double digits. From my household, however, we can literally taste the economic downturn. It feels odd and sad that we have to sacrifice taste in order to somehow cushion the impact of the economic problems my country is facing. Onion here is already hitting $12.57 a kilo. Depending on the size, that's about $0.63 apiece. Cooking an ordinary dish for a small family requires a bulb or two. During this holiday season especially, we normally need tens of onions. That's not affordable anymore. So we had to greatly reduce the use of onions and try not to care about how the dish would turn out. On ordinary days, onions are even removed from the ingredients.I had to share this here because it feels like the economic situation has already affected the most basic need of everybody. It seems insignificant because it's only a spice, but I thought that if the economic situation is already affecting everybody's taste buds, it could mean things are getting pretty serious. I wonder, especially in other countries, how drastic is the change in your daily life that's brought about by this economic downturn?",

In my country, the increase of these two commodities is more pronounced which is also a need that is considered basic for food activities and serving. the rest are still relatively stable in terms of price.",

There is no doubt that food has become more expensive, this was definitely seen this year during the shopping for the holidays, because I paid for everything from 20% to over 100% more than a year ago.",

It's crazy how onion is much, much more expensive than that of the main ingredients for a basic meal. We in the upper middle class even skipped meals that require onions in order to complete the recipe. That's how things are currently here, and the government is adamant that there isn't some kind of hoarding that's going on nor the onion sellers are banding together to create an artificial shortage of a commodity that can easily be farmed even at the comfort of our homes.We just planted our own onions in our garden hoping to be self-sufficient when it comes to these simple spices that can heavily be controlled by traders at will. Hereis an article from CNN Philippines outlining how bad the current situation is. Prices of onions per kilo doubled almost overnight just because of the holiday season.Quote from: jackg on January 01, 2023, 06:20:17 PMI'd assume it was import based issued that means that onions cost more.That's the crazy part. The country is known to have very fertile soil apt for growing onions all year round, except during hurricane seasons but still, there are loads of farmlands wherein you can grow onions without a problem. A lot of crops, vegetables, spices, and literally anything that a farmer can produce here in the Philippines, we now import. According to official reports from the government, the country didn't produce enough onions approaching the holiday season. Imports are also not that good hence the limited supply. Onion is a very important commodity in here, especially during the holidays, and so a lot of people are speculating that this is an orchestrated attempt to gouge the prices in order to make a huge profit off of the situation.Quote from: jackg on January 01, 2023, 06:20:17 PMI was buying quite a few electronic items over Christmas and it's surprising me they've become quite a lot cheaper and I don't really know why. Perhaps this is companies still trying to sell things or getting cheaper transport fees because they're devices are small compared to other items that are being moved (a computer is likely much easier to transport than flour, grains or meat). I heard electronic components became a lot cheaper and readily available in 2022 compared to 2021. If they were really cheaper, PC parts should also be included but unfortunately that's not the case, although the prices of GPUs and RAMs were relatively cheaper compared to 2020 and 2021 that's for sure.",

Another thing that has happened is that the main payment that families have, which is usually housing, has also risen due to the increase in interest rates. Those who had a variable rate mortgage have their payment increased with the revisions, those who take out a mortgage now also pay more for it than a few months ago, and to a certain extent this is also transferred to the rental market. In the end, people have to do the same or more with less, and that is what central banks are looking for, lowering demand to lower inflation, which is done at the cost of the suffering of families. That is why it is good to keep Bitcoin, although now it has fallen, in the medium and long term it maintains and even increases the purchasing power quite a lot.",

If I'm not mistaken, imports of onions were withheld for the reason that local harvesting usually starts in the 2nd week of December. That means local supply will flood the market and such abundance is supposed to bring the prices down. To everybody's surprise, however, the price continued to rise even at the end of December, and until now. It's almost hitting $13 a kilo.There are various reasons cited. Again, there's the decision not to import. Another is hoarding and price manipulation. There's also the fact that it's holiday season, although the price has already been rising for months. As a matter of fact, just 6 months ago, a kilo is only around $2. But of all the reasons cited, none is convincing enough. I suspect that a few powerful people up there are benefitting from this that's why they prefer to keep it this way. And even though freshly harvested onions are coming in volumes, the price won't easily go down. Back when a kilo was worth $6, middlemen were only buying it from actual farmers at $0.50. I'd say this is largely about the government sitting on its job. And it's probably intentional. The price has been rising for months, and I can't feel any urgency from them. The chairperson of the senate committee on agriculture just brushed the issue off saying she can live without onions.
