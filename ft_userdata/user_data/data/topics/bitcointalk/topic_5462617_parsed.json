If you fix the economy, create jobs and businesses for people, then it becomes easier to tax people and they will happily pay. If we continue like this, we might resort to the dark old days of government moving from village to village arresting people because of tax. Well, wetin concern a hungry man with tax!",

And for me, I think it will be far more better if her nomination is not politically inclined (i.e to last only within the timeframe of this new administration. But if she is been given a permanent federal job appointment to take effect the moment she finishes her final year. Then this will be a welcome development.",
