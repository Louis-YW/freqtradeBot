  "content": "For our savings, it’s very important to convert our money, or some of it, into a store of value to keep it safe from devaluation and to keep purchasing power. Saving is very important and only a good store of value is suited for savings to prevent devaluation. But how is a reliable store of value designed? Finding out, what a good store of value is about will lead us to few conclusions: It should be proven to be scarce. It should be easily transported and easily exchanged. It should be easily divided and keep value (not go broken). It should be accepted and people should consider it as a store of value. We can see: all points are somehow important to define a good store of value. Since a long time, Gold is considered as a good store of value but also Bitcoin is designed as a store of value, it’s also called digital gold. Bitcoin is limited to 21M Bitcoin making it a very reliable store of value! Since Gold existed, it has been store of value number one but now, we have Bitcoin, competing against Gold as a store of value. We can compare advantages and disadvantages of Gold / Bitcoin and some people might consider Gold and Bitcoin to have as a store of valueWhich is very good for Bitcoin because currently Bitcoin is only 5% of Gold's marketcapitalisation. Bitcoin will close its gap to Gold in terms of marketcapitalisation. Many stores of value are existing and we should always consider for and against arguments. What is a good store of value for you? What makes it unique, what is a must have for a store of value? In my opinion it’s proven scarcity and Bitcoin is very good at it. HODLwagmi",

However there are many scarce cars such as a Nissan Rouge convertible, however since nobody wants it, it doesn’t have much value.Same with many of the alt coins out there.Many have small supply however they still have low value because nobody wants them.",

Second reason is its unregulated unlimited structure. You can carry money in usb hard wallet in your pocket and noone would ask you anything about it.",

I think that's boring but as of now, many people already trust bitcoin and can say that it's one of the store of value because of its limited supply and as we can see it grew a lot from its over 13 years of existence.Btc adoption will not decrease but it can only increase since many people didn't knew btc yet. We don't know the exact value of btc but once massive adoption takes place then for sure its value can increase over 100k. Fiat money isn't a store of value not because it's only a paper but because its value depreciates over time due to its unlimited supply.",
