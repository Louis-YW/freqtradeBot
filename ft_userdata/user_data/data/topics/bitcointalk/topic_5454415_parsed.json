My pattern now is that I gamble for a short time. If I lose at first, I use martingale. If I lose second, I use martingale until third time. If I lose, I quite for the day. Let us say my first bet is $0.5, second bet $2 and the third bet to be $5. All on 3 odds bet. I wish my target to be the third bet. But if I continue to win, I enjoy it for a short time and I quit. Anytime I fail before the short time end to the point that I lose three times at once, I quit for that day.",

I don't top up on the same day to chase losses.There are times when I feel like ending the day already so I just put x10 of my usual bet size on games like Crash and for 100x multiplier.

Your gambling habit is too much and you need to limit it or else you will end up losing and draining your bank roll all the time. It is better than we see gambling as fun and also have a time frame,in which we us for gambling,so that no .matter the case maybe either winning or losing,once the time duration elapse we should just quit the game. I have never played long shot before because am not that kind of person that is so much down with gambling. I gamble during the weekends and I do that with my friends sometimes or alone. I enjoy short time pattern because it helps me to control my gambling activities",

You will enjoy watching the game aside from betting because you will have a chance of interaction with host during bonus compared to regular games that just offer you a regular bet pattern.",

A point were you can be satisfied without considering your bankroll status and just pure fun on gambling experience?It is a well-known fact that many people initially engage in gambling for entertainment purposes, placing small bets to pass the time when feeling bored or something. However, it often doesn't feel like a significant amount of money has been lost at first. To make up for the losses, some gamblers may feel compelled to increase their bets, hoping that a single win will recover their previous losses. Unfortunately, this approach can lead to even larger losses. That's why, in my opinion, having a gambling budget and setting realistic goals is super important. You gotta set aside a specific amount of money that you're okay with putting at risk. Whether it's for a day of gambling or just one session, you gotta stick to that amount like it's your lifeline. That way, you can still enjoy the excitement of gambling without going crazy and risking more than you can afford.",

      "body": "Caught in a loop in the online betting realm, huh? Feels like déjà vu, right? Two culprits usually have their fingerprints all over this one: ducking a loss and the gambler's tall tale. Ducking a loss is all about hating to lose more than loving to win. Might be why you struggle to throw in the towel when you're on the ropes, and why you find yourself making some dodgy bets to claw back what you lost.Now, the gambler's tall tale is the wonky idea that if something's been happening a lot recently, it's going to start happening less, or the opposite. This could be why you're hanging tough with the same bet size, even when Lady Luck's giving you the cold shoulder. If you're feeling in over your head with your gambling habits, how about chatting with a pro? Remember to draw the line and bet responsibly. The end game is to keep gambling a fun pastime, without it taking a bite out of your wallet or messing with your headspace.",

They use their considerable advantage to either fix the odds in casino games to their benefit or add a buffet to sports bets along with in-depth long term analysis to determine the right price to offer. Unless you have a strong advantage over them, you will always suffer defeat in the long run and only analysis over thousands of bets can tell if you're a winner. Talking about profits when gambling is dangerous territory because you naturally go into every bet with a disadvantage, so it should just be for fun.",

I always conclude my mistake after gambling. I keep repeating this cycle. You're making common mistakes here.For starters, you're impatient, which isn't a mistake, but rather a personality trait. The main mistake is gambling to get money. I know it's nice to win and earn from gambling but don't ever think of winning money as a goal that you have to achieve. If you want to gamble, put some money aside and consider it lost the moment you make the first bet. If you win, great, but don't worry if you lose, the money was lost when you deposited it. Understand that it's not your money anymore. You're not taking a risk by betting. You take the risk by moving money from your wallet to the wallet of the casino. I hope this will help you calm down when you play.",

A point were you can be satisfied without considering your bankroll status and just pure fun on gambling experience?The same problem is with most gamblers and there is no solution for that problem other than self-discipline. As you know that gambling is an addiction just like drugs and if someone becomes addicted then the desire to earn more comes automatically in the mind of such gamblers. In order to save ourselves from such losses we must have to be disciplined enough that losing of some trades won't have any affect on your mindset.I have also gone through such losses and I must say that it's really hard to stop oneself from betting in such situations. Our mind is made in a way that we want all our losses to cover up and we win even more than the losses, and that's why many people for Martin gale strategy, and they  multiply their bet amount with each loss. I won't recommend that strategy because sometimes we lose more than 10 times consequently, and if the strategy is followed then we will have nothing left in our account.A gambler should stop the bets if he/she losses many times consequently. In such days it's better to stop further betting because if we continue betting more then we will empty up the whole account in a single day. It's always advisable to stop betting in losing days and start betting the next day to avoid such losses.",

It's important to recognize when gambling starts to have a negative impact on your emotions and finances!!! If you find yourself caught up in a long losing streak or feeling the urge to chase losses, take a break from gambling. Stepping away from the activity can help clear your mind and refocus your perspective. Engage in other activities you enjoy and give yourself time to relax and recharge.And instead of focusing solely on the outcome and the potential to make large profits, try to approach gambling as a form of entertainment. Enjoy the experience of playing the games, the thrill of anticipation, and the social aspects, rather than being solely driven by financial gains. By shifting your mindset, you can reduce the pressure and stress associated with gambling!!!",

We know that it is really just that a common reaction on having that chasing losses because we've been thinking about on how to break even or getting it back which is really that a very bad behavior to have as a gambler.Instead of recovery, you would rather experience the worst since things would really be even more severe if you arent really that lucky on that time or on that particular gambling session.",

However, in most cases, the other way around happened which is losing most of the time and the result, will come back again on the initial bet and the cycle will just repeat, coming back and forth to your initial bankroll or worst, now playing lowered than your starting bankroll.Honestly, there's no other way to handle it but to force ourselves to just keep and maintain the starting bet amount no matter how many times it keeps coming back and forth to our original bankroll. We will only consider changing our bet if somehow, the bankroll increases while in the process. Patience is really the key.",

A point were you can be satisfied without considering your bankroll status and just pure fun on gambling experience? I'd be a hypocrite if I say those kinds of losses didn't get to me back then. Way back then, I'm betting religiously so to speak. I only bet 1% of my bankroll to make sure that I have more games to play. The stress of losing a lot and winning a little will get to you really. So I tried doing the Martingale strat (you double your bet after every subsequent loss to make sure that your wins cover your losses). Until I realize that I don't have that hefty of a bankroll to carry on the strat after a few plays. It might work for you especially if you have a bigger pot, but for regular players this will never be the long shot solution they are looking for. This was until I found out about just moving on. Sometimes losses can't really be recovered no matter how much games you play, and no matter how big your bag is to support your Martingale strategy. The best thing to do sometimes is to just quit while you still have something to keep, and then carry on the next day. It has saved me tons of money, and altogether allowed me to stay sane and safe from gambling addiction. I know this is not the conventional tip you're really looking for but it's better than belligerently wasting all your bankroll on one go.",
