Many Bitcoiners have lost their funds in the past due to a bad hardware wallet because they neglected to employ these easy crypto techniques; Do not trust, Only Verify!!! Step 1. Don't send your Bitcoin to a hardware wallet until you've thoroughly tested it. Taking your entire Bitcoin balance from your Exchange wallet and sending it to your ledger( cold storage ) without knowing what you're doing is extremely risky. First, you ought to send a small amount of bitcoin to your hardware wallet. Keep an eye out for it to appear there. Wipe your hardware wallet clean, factory reset it, and re-enter your seed phrase into your hardware wallet, plug it back into your computer, and check to see if your bitcoins are still sitting in your wallet as you believe.  Step 2. Then send it back to the exchange. Check that you can receive and send Bitcoin, that you can wipe your device, that you can re-enter your seed phrase, and that everything still works. Do this with the smallest amount you can afford to lose; it is better to lose a single cent than your entire savings. Before sending all of your assets, make sure your hardware wallet is working. Also, make a habit of distributing your assets over many hardware wallets; do not keep all of your coins in one location.",

Sometimes the hardware need to be properly tested before thinking of making any transfer from any device to it. One needs to be cautious and careful while doing it because if the hardware malfunctions while saving your assets without test running it, your assets are all gone. OP all you have said is just the right thing to do. Following the steps you have stated would save one the Heartache of losing their assets if properly done. Like I have read other replies, reputable hardware wallet should be considered  when having the thought of buying one for yourself. Dr o well to always reset to factory settings after purchase before using it so as to making sure every setup before then is cleared for a fresh settings. By doing this I believe your assets are well protected.",

Not saying it doesn't happen, but I haven't heard of anybody, who bought an original, unpacked device, verified that it's legit, set it up, sent the coins and lost everything.QuoteStep 2. Then send it back to the exchange. What if you don't use an exchange, or can't send it back and forth? You don't trust a wallet provider, but you trust an exchange?

It's advisable to store in a hardware wallet as it's safer compared to just letting your crypto sit in exchanges.

      "body": "What are you trying to test? If the hardware is legit, if the hardware is working, or if the hardware does not carry a backdoor.The first one should be done by examining the packaging. If everything looks new and untouched you can check the wallet using software provided by the manufacturer. The second one can be tested simply by setting up a wallet, turning the device on and off a few times, charging it and checking if it holds charge. You don't need to send money in and out because if you can set a password and access the device with that password it means it works. The wallet does not really send or receive anything. It's just a device used to confirm the key and passphrase. All the transactions are really done by software on your computer. The third one may not manifest itself when you send a test transaction. If the device is infected the hacker may not try to steal your test amount of 0.001BTC, but will steal 0.1. Sending dust to the wallet will probably prove nothing if someone was good enough to plant a bug inside the hardware wallet or its cable. Yes, you read it right, it's possible to plant memory chips within the USB cables!",

Just send a small balance from the hardware wallet to Electrum, and vice versa. And, to check your 24 mnemonic seed is correct with the address, you can use iancoleman running on an airgap pc or locally. This can minimize the error when you swipe it back into your hardware wallet.",

It might seem like a lot of steps, but it does make sense. When you set up a new wallet, you generate a backup in the form of a seed phrase written on a piece of paper or something similar. How can you be sure your backup will work if you lose or damage your hardware device if you don't test it beforehand? Okay, maybe you don't need to factory reset your device and start the whole process over, but it's a good practice to at least test the backup seed by importing it into a software wallet on an offline device before you send any substantial amount to your wallet.",
