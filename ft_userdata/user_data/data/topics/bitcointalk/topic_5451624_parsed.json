Those places are not that important right now, and any place where you are not allowed to post, your post will not even go through in the first place. If you have contributions to share and ideas that you think will be helpful to others and those threads are still open, feel free to drop your comments under those posts. There is no harm or crime in doing so as a newbie. Your ideas and things you have upstairs matter a lot; those are not being rated by rank.",

Isn't that how it works?Logically, how do beginners learn what is possible and what is not? The function of not allowing writing in certain places should work.

Serious Discussion, Ivory Tower (child board of Serious Discussion), and Archival are examples of such boards (I asked a question about being unable to post in Archival when I was a newbie).",

I think that what he is asking is the second question, but most of you are answering to the first one.IMO, if you really have something to say, don't restrict yourself: many good ideas come from unbiased outsiders and virgin minds that, although don't know many details we do know, don't have yet adopted general beliefs that may not be entirely correct but, for having repeated over and over again, we no longer question them.Well, maybe it is not decent to write in the most technical sections of the forum if you don't know about the matters they are talking about there, but this is not only a range issue.Another good place to post apart from the ones mentioned by my colleagues are Local boards if you are a native of a foreign language like me: in my experience, newbies are usually very welcome in these little tribes and veteran members are much more permissive there than in the \"north\" (international boards).",

But it seems those two sections aren't working like was been expected since it make people not interested to post on there. Moreover it's unclear which post should be posted there, let's say someone want to discuss about technical Bitcoin, a newbie can post in Development & Technical Discussion section. If the thread discuss about serious topic and no have relation with Bitcoin, it can be posted in off topic section.",

Before you even had the need to post in a thread where newbies are restricted, you might have ranked up.Back in my newbie days, I was also curious and careful not to post where I was not supposed to, so I asked the same question and got different replies.

Like it's all encompassing.I don't know of the Meta board is restricted for newbies but I'll say you don't bother using there for now as it's discussion concerns every issues about the bitcoin forum.

I'd say that however, there are boards that a newbies shouldn't post in if they have no knowledge about what is discussed there. Meaning that they can not contribute meaningfully to any conversation that goes no on there. You cannot be a German and post on the Russian board, unless of course you understand Russian. Archival is also another board where it is just like the waste bin of the forum.",

Just make sure that before you comment, you at least provide some insight and contribute a meaningful discussion which is relevant to the topic of the board.Most of the newbies that I observed comment on whatever board they desire without even understanding the main topic at all. While this is not prohibited perse, but this contributes to the overall spam that degrades the quality of the threads.My greatest advice would be that if you were to comment on a certain thread, research about the topic to avoid any potential conflicts in the future.",
