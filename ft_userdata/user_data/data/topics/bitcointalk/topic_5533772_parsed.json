  "content": "So i made a post here saying I was new to coinbase, but people didnt understand my sarcasm. Anyways Im not new to coinbase but havent used it in 5 years. EverytimeÂ  I think I'm making money the fees eat up my profit which is %5 on a good day. You used to use limit orders to have almost no fees when doing trades daily or more.But 5% in 24 hours I think is really good, but so does coinbase, i guess.",

      "body": "Coinbase has gained a reputation over the years, which makes people use them very well, but if their fee rate is not favourable to you, why not try out other exchanges? 5% off your profit or on each executed trade is not good in the eye. Other exchanges, which I have used, are not on advanced trading, though, but fees are still as low as below $0.1 for each trade. You can shuffle around the forum and check other reputable exchanges with low fee rates.",

      "body": "On what pair you are trading? Is that BTC/USD fiat or it's crypto to crypto?Maybe the fees when trading with fiat are much more expensive than trading with crypto to crypto. Have you tried USDT pairs?I no longer using Coinbase long time ago so I'm not sure about their exchange fees. I tried to research but it seems that Coinbase's taker's fee is 0.6% and the maker's fee is around 0.40%, which is pretty high compared to other exchanges that offer below 0.1%. I think it's a good idea to use Coinbase for trading unless you have a lot of capital because they have tier levels. If you have a large amount in your wallet, the fee rates are different.Look at here: https://exchange.coinbase.com/fees",
