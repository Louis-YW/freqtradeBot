It makes sense to keep in touch with your family and friends whether things are going great or the markets tanking. Gotta make sure the highs don't go to anyone's head or the lows don't bum anyone out too bad. Supporting each other is good. Your people matter more than money. But I also agree with JeromeTash, people need to learn to deal with the consequences of their actions themselves. This aint kids' stuff we're dealing with here.  Everybody's got to take responsibility for themselves and the risks they take.  We can support each other, but we cant be babysitting grown folks or cleaning up their messes for them.  They want to play with fire they're gonna get burned sometimes.  That's just how it is.",

Life isn't money you can recover later if lost This ain't the first bullrun and won't be the last we're expecting, so just like the first comment explicitly put, if you love them that so much then get them oriented about bitcoin and about money management entirely maybe that can relief the tension tension when the time arrives.",

When they have money for investment, I assume they already have jobs and are matured enough to control themselves. You can not control a matured person and you don't have rights to do this. Even their parents can not do this on their matured boys and daughters so don't feel like you can do this.When people are too optimistic or pessimistic, they can become uncontrollable and undisciplined with their actions so that they can gain some unwanted results. If you try to keep in touch with your family members, it is good but you can not save them all times. Anyway, paying attention on them is better than don't do that.If you want to help them, you have to tell them- When you have profit, try to save your capital first. They can use profit to buy things, enjoy life or reinvest it but initial capital should be saved.- When you have loss, tell them that it's not the end of the world. Opportunities will come later but they must be calm and smart.Tell them to not touch altcoins because they will lose money to altcoins.",

I've done that with my friends who stayed intact with me in bears and bulls. Many have already let go of their hands together on this journey but only a few that can be counted with fingers stayed with me til' the end. Anyway, I've got no problem with the ones that held with me until they have finally sold.They have regretted their decision after seeing the low price this time but that's how their journey was and can't go back anymore because they find it too expensive based on their living situations.Although it is a sad thing that there have been stories in the past that many can't take the bear market because it's either their first time or they've lost a lot on it and don't know what to do.I think most of those that have sadly ended their lives and committed what shouldn't be done were majority victims of the scam projects like luna.",

I think that it's not your responsibility to check on your relatives especially if you didn't have any part in them getting into crypto, maybe a little concern would be enough but checking up on them isn't or shouldn't be your responsibility.

I feel it's the challenges that don't kill you that makes you stronger. The way I regard Bitcoin investment is like a gambler staking a game that has a 50/50 odd of either winning or losing.

This crime committed will not happen if they are just been careful dealing with their investment especially with their expectation towards what will happen to that particular event. If they just know on when to take their money out while they are in profit for sure doing such nasty crimes will be out on their minds. But since you or we are there for them then its best to guide them up about the situation that might possible to happen on bull run and the after events so that they will not fall on thinking that it may always go up and it will not fall since to many people got caught up with that and lose a huge stash on their balance.We really need to keep in touch with them so that we can properly guide on their possible decision making so their experience on bull run season will be more good than any other people still speculating.",

I have this friend of mine whose elder brother had Bitcoin and it was bull run then and the price of Bitcoin keeps increasing and according to my friend, his elder brother was advised to split his Bitcoin into different wallets for his safety but he refused as a result of the fact that he wants to be seeing his investment grow in one wallet coupled with the assets value he paid deaf ears to the advise. A week later, he got hacked and all his Bitcoin was stolen. It was like a dream to him that he lost his Bitcoin assets and  a night mare to him that his hard-earned resource was stolen just like that.Ever since that experience my friend told me his brother has not been storing his assets in a particular wallet but in different wallets for his safety if eventually one is hacked the others would be safe. OP, this topic made me remember this incidence because that period when it happened to be frank it was a very tough and rough time for him as they were constantly checking on him to know his state of mind so as not to do otherwise. If you have a friend and a brother into Bitcoin do well to always check on them and advise them if you can. Play your role as it matters and watch how they respond to your opinion or advise.",

Check their wallets and the tokens that broke them, they don't have a single sats on their wallet, it's altcoins and meme coins because they want to make the type of money their long time friend that had been here want to make and in the process, they buy at all time high and crash.
