Today the price looks up and broke the $29k resistance, but I really want $29k to hold through April. Of course there has been a lot of speculation about the price bitcoin might reach over the course of April, but I think $35k is still a hard to reach if a lot of people are pushing for more selling. We are currently into 4 months of increase since January 2023 and hopefully that will continue for the next few months as well.",

This is an important indicator that you should not ignore.So far it seems that the price prediction is in accordance with the reality in the market. The bitcoin price has managed to break through the $29k resistance which is likely to reach $30k in some time. Great start to the week for bitcoin but anyway the hardest thing right now is keeping the price above $29k let alone expecting it to be new support for bitcoin price.Right now the bitcoin price is trading at the exact same price as it was on June 11, 2022, if this trend continues then $32k can be expected. Early bullish may have been made, but let's see how far this trend going on.",

The resistance limit bitcoin held onto throughout the month of March is positive. I was expecting a breakthrough to $30,000 but it didn’t happen. We are already getting to the middle of this new month, seeing the price moving and maintaining the $28-$29K+ limit, a $30K is most likely possible before the end of the month. But more bearish time is still coming ahead before the bitcoin halving takes place.",

If we look at the previous cycle, Bitcoin recovered to $10-11k, which was 50% of the peak value, but then crashed again before the new cycle started. If something similar happens now, we can fall to $18k again in this year. That's if the previous pattern still holds, which might not be the case anymore.",

We may have seen the lowest low for all we know for this bear cycle. And we have been trading sideways for the last 10 days, and now there is a big uptick in the price, and we might see $30k for this month or even higher if this bullish sentiments and FOMO continue.As for the CPI report, speculators are hinting that the Fed will end it's series of interest rate hike.If this is the case, the most likely, Bitcoin and the rest of traditional market is going to really because of this positive news.",

It's rising slowly but surely.     Probably this day will not end when it is possible to reach 30k$ per one bitcoin in the market? Whatever the reason is, I don't know yet, but the only thing I can say is that this is a good sign for our bitcoin holders.https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?theme=dark&type=spot",

US treasury debt has been short dated in its average term last I checked which could be dangerous in its rate of change, cost of interest fiscally.34k for BTC is top price for its ability to move before greater resistance.  It might be able to move further then that but would require more volume in order to do so, presumably that will take more time and development.  We dont move in straight lines normally.",
