  "content": "All proceeds from this auction will be donated to the yogg rug fund. The highest private bid between now and Monday, March 20th 5pm Pacific takes it. If the highest bid comes in under $10k, I will make up the difference... so it's a guaranteed additional $10k donated. Please submit/private-message your bid to me in USD amount.I just shipped two of these out of the US today and this is the very last Diamond Builder for sale, serial 09/10 [unfunded] - so who knows, maybe a bid over retail price is even possible Â Here's a quick video that helps to visualize the diamond eyes and the opals inside better... https://kialara.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Untitled-design.mp4I'll likely be bumping this thread a couple times since there won't be any active bidding, but feel free to ask questions or open a discussion below.And without giving too much away, I want to share that I have a new, self-custodial design in the works that invites the holder into the creation process in a fun and innovative way. This upcoming edition marks a transition towards a trustless wallet model designed to be more accessible to a wider audience... It's just a couple months out, and as usual I'll be announcing this to my mailing list so make sure to subscribe in the footer of kialara.com to be notified. https://thebittimes.com/kialara-project-celebrates-ten-years-of-storing-bitcoin-using-art-tbt40776.html",

Happy to hear you love them!@Chi, seriously I canâ€™t believe itâ€™s been ten years eitherâ€¦ and weirdly at the same time, it feels like a lifetime ago that I discovered bitcoin. A lot can change in a decade.@krogoth, weâ€™re all a part of this relatively small and growing/evolving community and anything that can help out like this Iâ€™m happy to do.

I would prefer the actual payment to me be in BTC, but would consider other arrangements like a wire or paypal, cashapp etc. for the right person and/or a previous customer of mine.",
