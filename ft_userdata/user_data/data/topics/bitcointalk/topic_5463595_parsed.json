      "body": "Although I am not a die-hard fan of spot ETF it is good news from Europe. Investors are giving more attention to the spot bitcoin ETF approval applications in the US because of the large US crypto market and the financial base of the firms involved. As of August 17, 2023, BlackRock's net worth is about $100.63B. The postponement of the approval is one of the factors that affected the price negatively. Jacobi FT Wilshire Bitcoin ETF is a worthy consolation to the Bitcoin community. It seems Gary Gensler has not changed his negative perception of bitcoin. Maybe the positive impact of these Spot ETFs on the European economy can make him reconsider his strictness. Let's see how the crypto market will grow without these spot ETF hypes.",

I thought that now the manipulators are buying up bitcoins in order to start selling them during the mass launch of ETFs in the US and Europe.Market participants have long needed an affordable spot bitcoin ETF to diversify their investments.",

I was referring to this,https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1656362002577772544So in essence, US Democrats are anti-crypto and US Republicans are pro-crypto and supporter.For me Gary Gensler as long as he is align with the Dems and still be the the Chair of SEC, we might not see any ETF being approved in the US, in my opinion.",

Well, it's true that it'll only be accessible by a select few but with the media coverage and popularity it's gaining, it's retail availability could extend, right? But then again, after it's launch last year, it got a lot of backlash from crypto ETP issuers who regarded the move as one solely bent on getting \"PR advantage\". I feel Gary Gensler will let this one upping by Europe slide, especially as the he has chosen to be on the fence concerning the decision to approve a spot ETF in the US.",

I don't think publicity is going to affect availability that much for products like this. It is not impossible of course, but most considerations are usually related to the product itself (volatility, risk exposure, etc). Retail is probably not the main target for a product like this anyway.",
