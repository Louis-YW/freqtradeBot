Go for dinner or something & have a good chat. He needs to pay you that money back though. Just because you have money doesn't mean he can take money & not pay it back. You are not a charity so he really needs to respect that & pay you back.",

      "body": "This shit happened because of a measly $150, especially when you said that you are rich etc., seriously? You know some debt isn't worth the conflict, that's why I usually won't lend money to my friends. I'm not a bank. But when I do lend them money and they can't pay, I won't bring up the debt into the conversation, except if they want to borrow more money.If no serious harm was made, I think you can always apologize and let it be \"water under the bridge.\"",

I never lend money to friends or family, it’s just not worth the stress. To be honest I can probably count on one hand how many times people have even asked me to borrow money. In the past with one of my wife’s relatives I just told him I had all my money invested so couldn’t lend him any.It’s just not worth the stress, as the OP’s situation shows.",

I should've used this reason instead of just partially lying \"I don't have money\" when actually I have some. True, for those people who are just kinda new in this lending money situation, don't taint your family/friend relationship with debt. It's not worth it, you give it free (don't expect repayment) or don't give at all.",

      "body": "if your friendship is destroyed just because of that then it means that's the price of friendship for you.I've experienced it and now I realize that a friendship cannot be valued by money. Money is easy to find but true friendship is very difficult for us to get.making up and forgiving each other is the right step. I hope you and your friends realize the importance of friendship.about money can be discussed in a relaxed and warm manner so that your friends' hearts will melt and they will definitely pay your money back. asking or collecting money also has good procedures without having to offend other people.good luck",

Money first should not be put in between friends. However, it’s all said and done, he doesn’t understand that is just like stealing from you, when he knows he owes you money. Add death threats, which today shouldn’t be taken carelessly. That is scary, regardless of how you handled the situation, you are not at fault. No one deserves to have their life to be threatened. It is too bad that you are put in danger with such behavior. That $150.00, is worth less than losing your life.",
