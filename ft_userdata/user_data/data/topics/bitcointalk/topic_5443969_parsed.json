      "body": "@Timelord2067Hi Timelord,I appreciate your contribution, but i'm disagree with your point of view. Each time you wrote \"late\" , I have always agreed in advance the extension of the loan with the lender and paid fee, extra fee and generous tips (take a look!). My business (Which is not my main job, because I have another job) requires money that I use for a maximum of 10/15 days, and then I collect the profits. Whenever I get a return on my investment, I pay off my debts immediately. Just to be clear, these are multiple arbitrage trades that pay me small fee . As soon as I pay my debts, I immediately start over with new operations. I have therefore always preferred to pay a little more interest, but request more loans over the course of the month instead of asking for a loan only for a longer period. As far as reputation is concerned, I have been on this forum for 5 years, and I have achieved the status of senior member little by little with commitment and dedication, I have always reported  incongruous or suspicious posts to the moderators and I have tried to give my contribution as far as possible. I was capable of it.I'm proud to see that historical users (Shasan, DarkStar) have accepted me among their borrowers. It is natural for me to request higher amounts because this means higher profits for me. It is equally natural that in the end the lenders will make their considerations and also their negotiations with which we will decide together the final amount to borrow.",

Have a nice day.Quote from: Timelord2067 on March 09, 2023, 01:30:11 AMTL; DR - the lender asked that their claims of trustworthiness based on rank and past loans be scrutinised.  I did so, and, with the additional information of stockmarket manipulation, I have decided the OP is an unacceptable risk of lending funds to without collateral.Quote from: fillippone on March 08, 2023, 06:23:00 PMSince I have been summoned in this discussion, let me clearly state that the merits I sent to HedgeFx were originated by his contribution in the Italian board. Since I am a merit source for the Italian board, and he often posts in that board, the amount of merit could appear disproportionate.Funny you should mention a Legendary user - Loan Defaulted [SiNeReiNZzz] comes to mine.  Late with their repayments to shasan then they stop making repayments; default and go dark never to return.  (All the while using the veil of their Legendary status and their previous loans where they provided no collateral as \"proof\" of their trustworthiness).It was a ploy to lure someone to hand over money.Quote from: fillippone on March 08, 2023, 06:23:00 PMEven if he were a legendary member, and I had given him all of his merit, this wouldn’t affect the validity of his rank. Having said that, I don’t know anything about OP’s lending and trading/gambling strategies, not I have any interest in those. The OP of this thread has used those exact same two list items (their rank and their past loan history) as \"proof\" and invited us to review their trustworthiness.  I did.  The OP is regularly late making repayments and their rank is skewered because of your generous merits (translated from Italian courtesy of Google) - Gems you have merited include being unable to withdraw funds when they made 100X profits, burning their \"recovery phrases\" in a back yard fire to sex toy purchases and the vague price of this Forum (then the more, shall we say \"dubious\" posts if you get my drift?When I put my observations of their claims of untrustworthiness in a post, the OP then came out with the information that they plan to use said loans to fund their gambling on the stock-market by placing both shorts and longs.Quote from: HedgeFx on March 08, 2023, 04:49:52 PMHedge mean that i open long and short position at the same time. Having facilitated uncollateralised loans in the past myself, I find it an unacceptable risk for a borrower to gamble with the money lent to them.",
