Suggestions or existing projects out there instead of building my own? Look at etoro. AFAIK, they're the first ones that has this feature, and then many have liked the idea of just copying because they think that it is \"passive income\" for them without doing anything.But the actuality of it is that, whatever happens to the trader they've copied, it'll also be the result of their trades. So, it's not always about winning and some unexpected losses may come even the trader is an expert.",

Suggestions or existing projects out there instead of building my own? I have noticed some copy trading in forex, but not yet in crypto and I have not noticed anything like that yet on the exchanges that I am using. In forex, there are trading platforms that have such option. Also if I remember correctly, i have seen such in stock trading before. I do kit know how it is but i know copy trading is usually used by traders that do not want to learn, trade and five money to those providing copy trading on trading platforms. I can never do copy trading.About copy trading with telegram bot, you can get those that trade often and have most accurate result if possible. Or start to learn how to trade, gain months of experience and see if that is possible from you. But I will not expect people to believe you or in copying trading because many new traders have tried it and failed.",

Is one thing to be dedicated to building your telegram copy trading group and another thing to get traders to follow that up. It is not a big demand for traders to follow copy trading, so if you have the idea of making profit from it definitely you are going to have a low turn out. Although, it is good to have copy trading for cryptocurrency because I know almost all forex platforms have such facilities, it is still something new with cryptocurrency exchange.",

I'm going to check all of these out - definitely interested in binance leaderboard idea. My main problem was time. Given my other activities, I don't have time to learn to trade my portfolio myself. There are no \"professional\" options out there, but beauty of blockchain is there are no secrative 'hedge funds' with political connections driving success. My theory is that I should be able to find the most successful traders and mimic their trades in near real time. TG use only because that's where I'm aggregating other feeds/projects and plugins with my wallets. I may try, as some have suggested, expirimenting with small amounts across multiple platforms.",

First off, start by putting some aside in bitcoin and do not touch it, I always put some money aside in bitcoin, I get paid in btc when I work as well, and that means I have some bitcoin savings.After you have done that, try to spread it to eth, and when you have enough of that then bnb, and keep doing that down the list.

He is going to build a bot on his own. It only becomes risky if you rely on other's work but if you're the one who do the job then the risk will get lessen. Not all in telegram are scammers but there are still legit which can help you make money but expect that most of them are not free.It works like that because the people behind it dedicate time, effort and skills to find the best method for their customers and also for themselves.

I'm also integrating other feeds into my bot that I can't discuss here.Update: I started expirimenting with a small test amount as many in this thread have suggested. I can say I've had moderate success thus far -- about 5% growth with 24/7 trading in past week...obviously, not a long enough time horizon to claim any kind of proof of concept, but certainly better than had I left even this small test amount in BTC for the past week. Also better than many of the top traders on binance did for past 7 days. I'm going to double this small test amount over next week, make some tweaks to the bot, and will report back.",
