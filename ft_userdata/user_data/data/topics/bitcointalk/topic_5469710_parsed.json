  "content": "For more than 1 month, the KRAKEN service has been deliberately withholding my funds!!  Initially, they closed my account and asked for a bank statement proving the receipt of funds into my KRAKEN account.I provided everything after that, they started answering me once a week:Hello Juan, As previously stated unfortunately, we must inform you that we will be closing your Kraken account. For security purposes, we cannot disclose the reason for this action. Please note that as you still have a balance on your Kraken account, we request that you complete the following actions: Request a Recall to be made from your Bank for the deposit of €799.46 made on the 14th September 2023.Kindly note that you cannot open another Kraken account.I have already explained that I cannot request a refund, since the bank does not have such a function, their response is to ignore it.I DO NOT ADVISE WORKING WITH THESE SCAMERS!THEY OWE ME - 1700 EUROSWhere else can I file a complaint about this service?",

In the lower left of this thread \"move topic\"..I don't know why a bank doesn't have a statement of account when most of them have but without it you can't get your fund there for obvious reasons. Or do you mean by \"recall\" is refund? I guess this is something a bank can only do for a certain transactions like frauds, etc. This is the cons of having fund on such regulated exchange, or i say most US based exchange.[1] https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0",

I have never requested something like this from my bank, but why did your bank refuse the request? It should be something they can do right?",

They have no right to keep your money blocked in the account. At least if the verification has failed, a refund should be possible, and I think this is what they are trying to request you to do. But what I don't understand is that you said they scammed you 1,700 Euro, yet the recall is for the deposit of €799.46, Why the difference?",

      "body": "If we are to label each and every centralized exchange that has this kind of problem as scammers, then all centralized exchanges are scammers. Let us all, therefore, avoid them. I understand that bank recall is not an easy process and it all depends on their policies, but is there a bank that doesn't offer this function? Isn't this feature required by law? Especially in your case in which the company itself was the one that requested the bank recall, I suppose it's easier. Anyway, you might want to consult a lawyer who is an expert and has experiences in fund recoveries for this. He/she might give you the best advice. It might also help if the response of the bank is put into an official document so that you can forward it to Kraken itself. They might take another route favorable to you.",

The CAD deposit refund request? I don't think it will work on OP cases since Kraken explicitly told him to request a refund from his bank. If it is really an archived FAQs page, most of their explanation probably no longer applies. There should be an FAQs page on their support website anyway. CMIIW.",

Few years ago, they asked me an extra KYC for a fiat deposit from a bank account, I refused to complete it and they sent me back the funds to my bank account without any issues, they even took the normal withdrawal fees for that. If they can't send your money to this bank account for some reason, they should at least offer you to send your funds to another one.  You could maybe try to contact some of their regulatorshttps://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031282351-Is-Kraken-licensed-or-regulated-",
