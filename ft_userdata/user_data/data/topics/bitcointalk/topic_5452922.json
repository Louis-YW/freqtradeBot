      "body": "Miners in this context are processing units or circuits whose primary purpose is to process data, they are then programmed to compete to confirm bitcoin blocks. Mining gear are not special equipment designed specifically for bitcoin mining. In the early days mobile phones and PCs could function to mine bitcoins, but as demand grew the need for higher computational energy also grew, leading to the adoption of GPUs and then ASICs. If you can design a processing chip with enough hashrate to be competitive today then sure, but this is not a DIY hack you can do from your garage, but requires investments and expertise.If you can get ASIC chips along with some other parts, you can experiment with coupling it yourself and test running the equipment.- Jay -",

You could join his Discord server, a lot of people are on it to talk about and discuss DIY Bitcoin ASICs",

In Shenzhen, China, some factories have already produced finished products, but intel finally abandoned the asic chip project. Compared with bitmain’s QFN package, intel’s flip-chip BGA may It does not have the advantages of scale and cost. In TSMC, the 14nm process chip needs about 3 million US dollars for one tape-out, the 7nm process chip needs 30 million US dollars for one tape-out, and the 5nm process chip costs 47.25 million US dollars for one tape-out. Not any private person can do this. It is most likely to design a DIY finished product. FPGA can be used to realize basic mining, but the computing power is not enough. It must be as strong as ASIC",
