  "content": "Hello everyone  In 2018, when I heard about Bitcoin from an elder brother in the area, I became addicted to Bitcoin. Since then, I started learning about Bitcoin from that elder brother and got the opportunity to learn more details from the forum by logging into Bitcoitalk with his ID.  . And in view of this in 2020 I invest some of my savings in Bitcoin. From teaching, when Bitcoin broke past record highs at the end of 2021, I had the opportunity to make a good profit from my invested Bitcoins, but my strong belief in Bitcoins prevented me from selling Bitcoins, after which the price of Bitcoins began to decline.  Then different people tried to discourage me in different ways but it is from this forum that predictions about Bitcoin and my confidence in Bitcoin still make me come. Hopefully during the Bitcoin Halving of 2024, Bitcoin will break all previous records and reach a peak price. What is your opinion on this?",

By the way he could have rather told you how to have a Bitcointalk account of your own.Regardless I hope you start to pick up the right things from now on because Bitcoin is no respecter of your interest in it, if you make wrong moves you could get financially hurt.",

I know I acquired some little fractions of Bitcoin in 2019, for which I made a bit of profit as per what I invested, but if I had bought more of it in 2020, I would have made a much bigger profit than I did.By the way, at OP, after the Bitcoin halving of next year, I really don't think the bull market will start and hit the top high in 2024; it could happen in 2025 or thereabouts. I don't think we really know when the bull will become very high.",

I am also thinking the same and even if there are people that discouraged me before (not from the forum) I'm not allowing them to change my decision on how firm I am as a long term investor.But every bull run should be taken advantage by everybody. If there's the chance you're about to make profit, take your profits. You have to take profit even if you're playing long term in here.That's how it goes and how you're going to enjoy the long waiting game.

The post halving effects come later, it’s usually months or even an year away from the halving block. It’s awesome being confident, you go past bear panic modes way easier and it’s less likely to make illogical decisions.",

Yeah, btc halving comes next year but as you already know the price impact does not follow immediately. so you should not be disappointed when you don't see a huge price pump immediately after the 2024 btc halving. But one thing is certain, the next btc bull market is likely going to be high than 2021 and previous. I would say be happy with your investment and expect a more explosive next bull market.",

There is a possibility that the previous ATH won't be reached during the halving year but the following year which is 2025.And since we still have time left before the expected huge bull run next year, a lot is continuing to invest regularly. I also have my own DCA monthly as the current price also means potential for us to grow our assets. You can also just hold your bitcoins and go for the long term which is beyond the 2024-25 cycle. Some are even predicting the price of bitcoin to reach as high as a million dollars in the future.",

It will either end in you selling to early in the bull run, or holding on for too long and regretting. Ask yourself what will make you comfortable? Maybe redeeming your fiat money and still having the amount of bitcoins you own? In such case wait for bitcoin to go up by 100% and sell 50% of your holdings. Maybe you need a certain amount of fiat to buy a house? Maybe you want a retirement fund? Make sure whatever you do you stand behind that choice and it will all be fine.",

We had been hearing about semilar stories like this one and I am happy that yours looks very similar with high expectations. You invested in Bitcoin and you made profits and you are happy? Wow, that's cool to know. You want to know what will happen to Bitcoin price during halving? The price is going to pump just like you have experience once and you are going to make some good profits if you hold and buy more quantities. I can see you are ery confidence as an investor and I hope you are not going to be in a rush if the price to not get to where you expected it to reach. So many investors also have set there take profits too to the previous high. We expect the market to be very bullish by next year so we all have to prepare to the best.",

So BTC is getting rarer in the future which will make the price more expensive.Bitcoins are not rare simply because miners get less reward each time a bitcoin is halved, but bitcoin's scarcity is due to its limited supply. Increased demand will make it more expensive - that's the nature of the market for any limited product.Quote from: ginsan on June 22, 2023, 09:23:39 PMI think to keep piling up when there is an opportunity because you will regret it if you keep delaying buying BTC.Don't accumulate bitcoins every chance you get - but do accumulate when you have a budget and are confident that you are making entries at the right time. You can wait for the price to drop lower as the volatility of bitcoin prices allows you to get it - but if you are sure you want to buy, then do it with DCA.Quote from: Trust M.C 100 on June 22, 2023, 03:09:51 PM[Note: No one will misunderstand as new ID.]Marina5 just being active and sending you merit right on your first post - so maybe it's not wrong that some people assume you're both alt.

The only thing is knowing when to take profit and when to buy more. Take for instance someone that sold at 40k plus, late 2020  to 2021 and bought last year (2022) where there was a huge dump which saw the price drop to as low as 14k  certainly didn’t lose or will regret. Also there are some certain price tag that some people have setup to be there pull out plan and I don’t see anything wrong on that because you are certainly not predictable of how high it will go or how high it will come down. The best after long term holding is to take profit when you can.",
