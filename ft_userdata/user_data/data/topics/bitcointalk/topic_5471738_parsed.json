Sometimes referred to as a negative yield curve, the inverted curve has proven in the past to be a reliable indicator of a recession.Inverted Yield Curve.Image by Julie Bang Â© Investopedia 2019With over inflation since Covid-19 globally, let's see how many countries have Inverted Yield Curve. You will be shocked to see that there are 26 countries have it.It's not coincidence that there are some bankruptcies from the USA. to Europe in 2023. They are consequences of money printing and Inverted Yield Curves then bankruns.Quote26 countries have an inverted yield curve.An inverted yield curve is an interest rate environment in which long-term bonds have a lower yield than short-term ones.An inverted yield curve is often considered a predictor of economic recession.",

That's why bonds, term deposit etc are always shown in investment or financial courses. Hopefully people shouldn't be tricked by the government and choose a better investment.Quote from: Catenaccio on October 26, 2023, 11:12:48 AMQuoteWith an inverted yield curve, the yield decreases the farther away the maturity date is.

Iirc aren't they called war bonds or there are other types of government bonds out there that you can invest in even during times of peace?

For a safe stable income yes. But you are never going to get rich with them if you go for safe ones.Much like anything else. You might get lucky with a 10% APR yield bond. Or that countries economy might implode.-Dave",

I envy the US in terms of ease in investing, in my country, there's a lot of hoops and loops that you have to jump through just to be qualified and when you're qualified, you will realize that it's not worth it to invest in that investment anyways.",

Some prefer security rather than gain, you can indeed make a ton of money from investing in Bitcoin but if you fail to do it at the right time?Buying coins last November would have gained you 200%, buying the previous November and you would be at a 50% loss, some just down want to play with this and are aiming for security and a way to easily get their money out of it at any given moment!When you ask yourself why some do what they do, you have to stop thinking as a Bitcoiner, it makes no sense to try to understand people when your mind is fixed on this, this is why gold bugs don't get Bitcoin, this is why oil investors are thinking the solar industry is doomed, some people don't understand another kind of investment and they don't want to ever do, they are happy as they are and that's it!Now, to make things far more interesting, do you know what backing 70 billion out of 85 billion in Tether?Â  Quote from: DaveF on October 27, 2023, 01:29:58 PMYou might get lucky with a 10% APR yield bond.

Not sure how successful anyone has been by investing in bonds but it is a sure thing for rich people. I have never heard anyone in my circle talking about the bonds even though they are in the trading and share market. Somehow Bonds have not reached in the hearts of common peeps (my belief) and it shall take lot of patience as well. We do have Gold Bonds available in the India but its not worth it since most of the indain families believe in buying the physical gold as traditional thing. You would find more Gold in the form of ornaments and jewelry being gifted in marriage than what it would cost them to perform the entire 6-15 days of ceremony in various castes. I highly doubt anyone of them would be interested in buying Gold Bonds. This is just reference but other bonds are literally far from such adoption. I would put more trust on the Bitcoin rather than putting my money on such thing.",

I found it alarming that so many countries are close to the 100% GDP level with their debt. There is no way that the majority of developed nations can reduce their debt levels considerably in the next 10-20 years. And now looking at the returns of the government debt I wonder who is actually still giving their money to the government. Comparing the short and medium term yields to the inflation rates it doesn't make any sense to buy anything below 5-10 year debt, and even then you are just offsetting your inflation losses and don't make any real returns. To me this seems like a really bad investment and traders don't except any government collapses to give them their money so freely. Nouriel Roubini has warned about the rising debt levels in his recent book Mega threats. If interest rates keep rising we could see a wave of government defaults and bond holders losing a lot of money. I would rather invest my money differently than buying government bonds.",
