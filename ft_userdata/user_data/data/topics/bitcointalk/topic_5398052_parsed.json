      "body": "Am confused about this whole situation here.  Haven't many stablecoins dropped below their peg?  What was the big thing about TERRA USD?  Was it because it dropped so much?  The same thing happened with waves and USDN and it dropped similar to TERRA USD and then went back up to 90% + etc.  How come there wasn't that much talk about USDN compared to TERRA USD?Also, wasn't it pretty obvious that TERRA USD was eventually going to go back to its peg of a dollar?  When i saw it went to 0.70, i thought... isn't it a no brainer to buy TERRA USD because it eventually will get back to at least 0.95 or so?  Someone did mention the upside was you make max 30 percent but you could lose the whole amount.  But isn't this little risk?Also i read tons of people on twitter talking about this such as they lost 30% of their life savings and many were immediately selling their TERRA USD correct so they wouldn't lose more?  What i don't understand here is... why are these people so freaked out?  Did they literally had all their live savings in TERRA USD the stablecoin?  But what about Terra coin?  isn't it obvious TERRA USD stablecoin was going to go back to its peg or close to it later on? it was mentioned they sold a ton of btc in order to try to get TERRA USD back to its peg.  So if they did that, isn't it obvious worrying about TERRA USD Peg isn't that big of a concern?  Still confused why so many people were freaking out over this.  So why do many people have so much in TERRA USD then?  Heard about anchor staking and they give like 19.5% but is that owning TERRA USD the stablecoin... and earning that amount of interest similar to like how people own GUSD and earn GUSD on gemini?  if that is the case, then i would understand why so many people would own a stablecoin like TERRA USD.  Or is that anchor interest just having TERRA coin and not stable coin?  Because you would earn interest but its not stablecoin interest.Even saw on the terra reddit, there was a suicide hotline link shown.  i am still confused why so many people were freaking out?  Again i don't know much about crypto terms such as these sites liquidating shares and things like that but when it was mentioned they were going to sell billion dollars worth of btc to get ust back to its peg, why are people then concerned?  its not like hey ust is keep going down and the company is doing nothing at all to fix the issue?  Also saw someone on twitter mention, if terra luna goes down in price, btc and all the other coins will go down but that is the only way to get TERRA USD pegged back.  Can someone explain this or why?  They then said if terra luna goes up in price, then the stablecoin TERRA USD would drop so it's a lose lose situation.  is that statement true and can others elaborate on this?  So if you own both TERRA USD and terra luna, what do you want to happen?  Don't you want terra luna to drop a lot so the TERRA USD to peg back to a dollar... then when bull market again, terra luna go up?  Could both TERRA USD and terra go to zero?  So let say TERRA USD went to 0.  What would have happened?  All the cryptos would have dropped even more correct?  But are there people that put a ton of their savings in UST or Luna?  The way you see people responses on twitter on this, you feel as if all their savings was on it.  Now would this situation been the same or worst if say this happened to GUSD or USDT or USDC?  im aware UST is a top ten crypto but i couldn't believe why there was so much talk about this.  Were people that owned LUNA much more concerned than those that owned UST?  Assuming one person owned USD while another owned UST.  if you owned UST... the stablecoin should eventually get back to its peg.  LUNA... after a while should go back to its normal prices when bull market right?  So why so much talk about this?",

In the middle term, bitcoin won't be affected by this event.DeFi isn't perfect so far, and needs to be developed up to that point. Especially in the existing security, they are far from safe like what happened with UST, everyone is afraid of the stable existence of the coin because of that. I think they should perfect their coin stable program ecosystem first before starting DeFi, doing that at the same time makes them unable to maintain one of them so they have to suffer losses like this.",

Despite the fact that we all know that one stable coin equals one US dollar. So, in crypto, any stable coin requires a lot of funds to keep its price stable. Who finances the stable coin in order to keep the price stable?Now comes to the question of why this happened to them. Well, there is no exact reason, but people are speculating that maybe the team has done something wrong with the fund. As a result, Luna no longer has enough funds to fund Ust Coin in order to keep its price stable. which is likely trustworthy. Because, as we can see from coinmarketcap, the luna valuation is lower than the ust valuation. So now if Luna dumps their price to zero, they can't even stabilize the price of UST. So that is the reason why Luna should have more value than usual. So now Luna needs at least 30B to get back on their game. But I don't think it is possible to gain trust from users again. Let's see what happens.",

Just the amount of money Luna Foundation is looking for to borrow is so huge, and with the reputation they've gained in the last couple of days, I don't think they will be able to convince anyone to give them that much money.

I mean think about it, there were some people who crashed Luna so that Luna team would have to recover and when that happened they used their BTC to short it, because they knew that Luna would have to sell btc and drop the price, and they helped and got the money back from the shorting.Since, there is no way of recovering without that, Luna kept going for a few days and those whales kept profiting that way and it never really recovered because of it.
