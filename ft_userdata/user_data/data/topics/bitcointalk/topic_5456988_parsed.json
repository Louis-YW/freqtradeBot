Bitcoin is the antithesis of fiatIt is its antithesis but rather it’s alternative that’s just edges it interms of usage ease and other features. QuoteIn your opinion, bitcoin is an asset or a currency?Bitcoin is both. First as the founder satoshi put it out to be a currency then through the use of it, people begin to see its value of been a strong investment asset just like how other stores of value like gold evolved to been assets. This was actual due to the fact that as fiat could devalue bitcoin doesn’t devalues due to the limited supply it has and also as hedge against inflation. QuoteIf bitcoin is an asset, it is now. Most people will hold bitcoin as an asset and take advantage of the rising price of bitcoin. If so you are still dominated by fiatIf bitcoins were currency, it would be complicated if bitcoins were used to buy cheap things, transaction fees would be very expensiveYou can’t beat the fact that it will rise in price not because people stores it as an asset but because people demands increase on it and that subsequently would increases its value. The fiat currency grows in value as its becomes more valuable and attractive to many. Just like I said it is an alternative currency so one could actually use other currency to pay for small transactions and then use bitcoin for cross boarder transactions or much larger transactions. This isn’t saying bitcoin can’t be use for smaller transactions too but to minimize cost of the transaction which are substantially less when the mempool is less congested than fiat transaction fee charged by banks sometimes",

If you have taken your time to go through the bitcoin white paper, you would have known better on the origin of bitcoin and why Satoshi had invented the bitcoin technology. Satoshi invented the Bitcoin to serve the place of fiat in the sense that bitcoin would serve s a digital currency void of any control from any quarters but the reverse was the case as whales saw the important futures of bitcoin and manipulated the market causing the weak hands and early adopters to sell making them control a large percentage of the bitcoin market. Since then, many people see it as an asset and store of value while for those who accept it as a means of legal tender sees it as a digital money.",

Fine, perhaps what Satoshi had in mind while creating it was as currency but what the globe is making out of it is asset. Check the early prices of Bitcoin and what it's today, and so many of us are still speculating that it will even do more than a double of its current ATH after halving next year.

Sorry if my argument isn't comprehensive, I don't have a deep understanding of bitcoin yet Let me just clear up confusions you had regarding bitcoin's place in this whole blockchain shenanigan. You're right first off, you could say bitcoin's the progenitor of the blockchain, and the decentralized currency system. It pioneered the idea, and rallied multiple coins and projects that aim to improve upon this concept, or capitalize on it for profit and gain. Secondly, bitcoin is indeed decentralized. No question about that. The problem comes with your last statement, wherein you mentioned bitcoin being the antithesis to fiat. While there's some truth to that in the fact that some bitcoin maximalists and die-hard Satoshi Nakamoto Meat riders regard of bitcoin as some sort of money jesus, Bitcoin isn't made to antagonize the current financial system, it could be argued that the reason why bitcoin is here in the first place is to provide and improve upon the current paradigm by giving the people a taste of what decentralized monetary system could give them in the long run, Of course as time went by bitcoin became bigger than its previous directive and is now not only acting as a form of currency that you can exchange for goods and services but is also acting as a form of asset you can invest in for profit. Fiat acts the same way anyway, we don't see Fiat Meatriders acting as if Fiat can only be one type, why rally the discussion of whether bitcoin's an asset or a currency then?",
