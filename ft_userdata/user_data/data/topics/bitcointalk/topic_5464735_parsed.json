Pretty sure if you put 11% to a community vote it will fail unless this is 2021 and I got lost. Good luck with your project.",

Let alone be listed in a decent exchange. Maybe look for more valuable projects out there. Though I don't know if you are mining or just staking.Also, you can check their other social media channels to see how their devs are doing on this project. If it is community driven, the possibility of lack of funds maybe is their main hurdle to push thru their plans.",
