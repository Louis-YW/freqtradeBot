You could have  replied to what I have asked in my topic that is right at the bottom. I have bolded enough for you and everyone to answer, who are part of bounty campaign or who are investing in shitcoins to gain profits. People like me will always be in the process of getting more Satoshi and are you of the league is my question.",

This advertisement will trigger their greediness and carelessness to more easily spend money.QuoteDo you still believe in Bitcoin and do you guys are still following the same pattern of converting some of your earned crypto to Bitcoin?Yes, I do.

I see it as the cornerstone of the crypto market. While I do dabble in meme coins and altcoins, it's primarily for short-term gains and to diversify my portfolio. However, my end goal remains the same: to convert a significant portion of those gains into Bitcoin. I think it's wise to leverage the potential profits from altcoins and meme coins but always intend to strengthen one's Bitcoin holdings. So, yes, I’m part of the league that values Bitcoin above all and continuously works towards accumulating more Satoshis.",

Once someone can profit easily from altcoins, how can they convert those profits into a slower growing asset (bitcoin)? Instead, they will continue to reinvest in meme projects or projects that they think will continue to bring them high returns. Surely many people will say that they will still follow that model, but I really don't believe it because no one doesn't like to make money quickly and restraining greed is not easy. If they could restrain their greed, they wouldn't have invested in altcoins and memes in the first place.I also got some of these memes by mining free via telegram, but unfortunately I sold it as soon as it was listed on Binance. It's a bit unfortunate to see that its price is still increasing and shows no signs of stopping    .",

Bitcoin is the dominant coin and altcoins only rise after Bitcoin's bull run but we have to be realistic, Bitcoin isn't going to grow 100x of its value or something similar. The market capitalization of Bitcoin is huge, the price of this coin is huge, and it's not going to rise from 60K to 600K, that's not gonna happen. It will probably rise a maximum of 3x-4x of its current price.Altcoins are not a bad investment choice but memecoins, they are a hit or miss. Memecoins carry no value, absolutely zero but it's a well-known fact that people invest millions of dollars in it. If you are lucky and the memecoin that you bought will become mainstream, you'll earn a lot of profit. It's no different from the HI-LO game.",

That's how I treat memecoins; they are not to be held for long before the person's investment will sink with it.",

There are a lot of people who gain a lot from airdrops as well as shit coins and meme coins so much that it is their full time job.
