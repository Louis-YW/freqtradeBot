We also asked Intel if it planned to exit the Bitcoin ASIC business entirely, but the company responded, \"We continue to monitor market opportunities.\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-discontinues-bitcoin-mining-blockscale-chips-no-future-gens-announcedQuote from: hack3rcon on April 19, 2023, 09:50:32 AMDoes this affect the price of Bitcoin?

Since as of now Intel has some of the most advanced fab plants in the world.Even now Bitmain and Canaan and the other players do not produce their own chips. BUT, I can't see them gong to intel to make them if they have a competing product.Did someone do the numbers and figure out that making chips for miners is going to bring in more money then designing and making their own? Not something you say in public but could be one of the reasons why.-Dave",

We definitely need more of a globally distributed supply chain for mining machines.Personally what I would really like to see is smaller ASICs that are cheaper. New mining machines from what I can tell can cost many thousands of dollars when supply is low which makes it really hard to get into mining. It'd be great if there were options for smaller like $500-$1000 mining machines that have the efficiency of the expensive ones but just have less power.",

It seems that bitcoin mining is not as profitable as other current businesses. But this reason is hard to believe because the price of bitcoin is recovering gradually and they can start making good gains in the future. However, Intel also claims that they might also be ending the production of LTE and 5G modems. Maybe other businesses have higher returns than the ventures they are abandoning. Who knows if the company has the intention of venturing into spaceships or artificial intelligence? Almost every firm is considering building its own AI to outsmart competitors.",

They reduced their dividend and made cuts across the board while announcing outsourcing plans. I think companies are still a bit scared of recessions after the 2008 collapse that nearly bankrupted everyone. Intel is just trying make sure they can survive a US recession.",

So i don't expect we'll notice the price impact.Intel has been around for a while. They applied to a patent for a Bitcoin miner in 2016: https://patents.google.com/patent/US10313108B2/enHere's the patent itself, granted a few years later: https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/4f/47/48/83ef700835e37c/US10313108.pdfSo, I think there might be other reasons, not that they were new. Intel is struggling at the moment so maybe they just need to focus and stop anything that is not crucial for their vision.",

They have their own R&D and for sure they could have seen that as a opportunity. Nevertheless, I doubt that they want to garner the market here, there are more interesting fields for them and most likely the management would still focus on that one rather have invested a lot of money and time with Bitcoin Mining hardware. So budget wise, doesn't make sense for them. Besides the competition is already though with Canaan and Bitmain already the face of Bitcoin Mining.",

I can understand why they decide to stop though since other markets are definitely more interesting for them. Crypto is niche compared to CPU, GPU, and so on. Not to mention their GPU division is still in a shaky position right now. Plus their HEDT market was beaten by AMD in the last few years. It is understandable that they would rather try to improve their products there compared to Bitcoin mining.",

I mean I feel like a business has one responsibility and that is making a profit, if you do not make any profit at all then there is no reason to produce anything, and they saw what it did and what it brought and they realized that was not something they can profit from (probably) and just gave up. Look at graphic card manufacturers as well, they had so much profit from selling out all the time, and even with that they still created an alternative type that couldn't be used for mining, which was still sold but after seeing the bad results it went to gamers instead.You need to remember money now causing losses later is not a good money, you need less money if you have to, if it means more money later on.",
