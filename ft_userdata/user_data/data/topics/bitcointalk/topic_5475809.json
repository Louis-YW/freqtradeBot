Quote from: puradak on November 28, 2023, 04:37:27 PMI am using software wallet called 'electrum'. I downloaded it from the official website 'electrum.org'Is this safe wallet?It is definitely one of the best software wallets but it is as safe as you make it to be, so be careful not to download any malware on your computer as you may loose everything. When you have more bitcoin (or even better, if you can afford it now as there are Black Friday deals), get yourself one of the hardware wallets that are much safer.",

You should avoid any custodial service for holding your bitcoin.In addition to the possibility of getting hacked, custodial services like exchanges can freeze your fund for any reason. You should use non-custodial wallet, so that you have full control over your fund. Quote from: puradak on November 28, 2023, 04:37:27 PMI am using software wallet called 'electrum'. I downloaded it from the official website 'electrum.org'Electrum is a trust worthy open-source wallet. The code has been reviewed by many people and no vulnerability has been reported. But take note that any online device is prone to hacking. Even if you use a secure wallet like electrum, it's still possible that your device is infected with a malware and your wallet is hacked. If you want to be completely secure, you should run electrum on an air-gapped device or go for a good hardware wallet. If you are going to use electrum, keep multiple copies of your seed phrase in different locations and avoid keeping it on an online device. Also take note that the seed phrase is all you need to recover your fund and anyone who has access to your seed phrase can steal all your fund.",

Please understand me.Electrum itself is safe because it’s open source which means many experts eyes already review their code for safety purposes. The safety problems rely on your side including but not limited to safe keeping of your private key/recovery seed phrase, protecting your device from malware and other form of attack that will exposed your key to hacker.It’s better to invest on hardware wallet to guarantee that your asset will be safe forever since it’s airtight. Just use a quality brand that offers security and transparency.",

      "body": "That amount is still small, but if it is getting bigger, you need a better secure means.If you have 2 devices, like a phone and a laptop. Why not go for 2-of-2 multisig? It is safer than a single signature wallet.If you have just one device, why not generate a seed phrase with passphrase, or seed phrase alone after your format and reinstall the OS. But having passphrase makes offline backup secure. Get some addresses to fund, backup your seed phrase and passphrase and have a watch-only wallet instead.I like 3 devices and with 2-of-3 multisigElectrum wallet on airgapped device is also very safe. Or you can get a hardware wallet like Passport.Or you can get a hardware wallet and multisig it with a wallet on your device. One seed phrase will be completely offline.If you lose your seed phrase backup you lose your coins. Also if you lose your passphrase backup, you will lose your coins. Backup both differently in like two different locations and not together.Online wallets are not safe.",

Offline Electrum wallet is far from any online attacks, malware, and hackers so if you want to hold a big amount of BTC then an offline/cold storage wallet is the best option.",

I have been working since 2011 and still has very powerful security features. Many of the experienced people also recommended Electrum wallet.

      "body": "I like Electrum, it's a reputable wallet. It's non-custodial, so nobody has access to your funds but you. I'd say it's very safe, but there are still things to watch out for. #1 is that you need to make sure that you don't lose your passphrase because you can lock yourself out of the wallet this way and no customer support would be able to help you. Another thing is that, if you don't have a password on your wallet (so it opens without any obstacles on your PC), you need to make sure that your PC is safe from prying eyes. Using a password can be annoying, but it also protects against that.",

Passphrase is also called custom extension word or 13th/25th word.",

However, you have a big part to play in keeping your Bitcoin safe. Write you seed phrase on a piece of paper and keep it safe. Don't take a screenshot of your seed phrase, and don't save it on your phone, mail or cloud storage. I could go on with more \"don'ts\", but if you can set up the electrum wallet in an airgapped device, that would be perfect.",

That you want to keep your bitcoin safe forever,  meaning you really don't have plans for your bitcoin. And perhaps you dont have an investment plan or Target, like how long your investment will last or whether you will still be accumulating. It's seems you just want to be stocked with what you have. Very funny of you.For the electron wallet I see no wrong about it. It's a person choice to choose any type of wallet of your choice but when choosing be security concious. For the Cex you said I think it's  better you save your coin in DEX rather CEX.",

Decentralized exchanges works in a way to be used also for the exchange of coins and finally the coin will be sent to an address on your noncustodial wallet. If you want what you are talking about to be correct, it is that custodial wallets and decentralized exchanges should not be used for savings, that noncustodial wallet which people have the private key should be used.",

Please understand me.I like your enthusiasm, even though the amount of BTC you have is still small, you have thought about wallet security. Because very many people don't think about the best wallet if they have a small amount of btc. In this case, even though you are only 19, you are already mature because you are already thinking about long-term security. This is a good start for investing in BTC.Because for me the most important thing in investing in BTC is wallet security to avoid hackers and your choice is correct by using Electrum software because this is the safest wallet for storing BTC in the long term. The next step you need to do is buy BTC in stages using the DCA strategy.",
