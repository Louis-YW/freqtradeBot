You are also paying for the security and peace of mind.On a different note, can someone explain to me the benefits of using a custodial and centralized exchange such as Binance for P2P trading? What am I missing?If you use the platform already, can't you just use the normal spot market to acquire the coins you want? Are the profit margins better for their P2P deals? Do you pay less in trading fees? It makes sense on Bisq or Hodl Hodl. Why do it on Binance?",

Do you pay less in trading fees? From what I saw, Binance P2P supports a lot of payment options to buy crypto (Advcash, Revolut, Skrill and hundreds more that I never even heard of) while if you want to buy let's say bitcoin on Binance using their regular way you will have few options only (debit cards, bank transfer).",

Are you using some e-wallets that are only supported on the P2P exchange or what advantage does it give you that the regular exchange feature is missing?",

But don't give to much belief on it and always believe on your own research or skills in trading since at the end of the day you are the one who's going to decide which price you want to sell it. But make sure you not became greedy and always do it when you are already in bullish condition.",

Most of the trader on P2P exchange has a food feedback and those bad feedback user usually offers a price that is far lower or higher than the average listing price.Actually for me you can’t be scam on P2P even if you manage to make a transaction with bad reputation user because you can check everything if you receive the funds in your wallet before you confirm transaction for fund release. There’s also a feature to filter merchant only so that you can avoid those low ratings.",

And so far I haven't encounter any issues, it might just be that I'm lucky or something like that... But when the value of what I want to sell is quite significant I do go through most of the negative feedback to see the cause of it and when I'm not comfortable with that certain trader I don't initiate anything with them I just move to the next one till I see a decent one.",

They dont wanna messed up their record to continue a great reputation on buying and selling.Traders who are trusted enough will be the choice as well as looking at the price level and ratings recommended by others. Especially if making a big sale as you mentioned, then feedback and ratings will be the main criteria. as well as how fast they can process it. there are many merchants who have good feedback, but some processing is too slow. and for big sales make sure everything is safe. Don't choose p2p traders with low ratings and also have negative feedback, and there are also some p2p traders who play prices without being able to process transactions that will be made. Can set a filter to get the right merchant.",

Even though you've follow the right procedure, it still has a chance the centralized company e.g. bank, e-wallet, payment provider etc can reverse the seller's fiat money to his bank account. You might able to solve that case, but it's take time, energy etc since you need to contact Binance and tell what's happened before. Moreover there's a chance you might got a dirty coins, it will harm your privacy.Checking the feedback is important, but it's better to trade in this forum with a trusted account or through Bisq.",

I often find new P2P merchants who want to be on top by charging a lower purchase price and a higher selling price for customers. So don't be fooled by price games. Look at the order limit displayed, you must make a minimum purchase or sale transaction with that minimum order if you want to be accepted. If you only want to buy or sell for $50, then you should look below that price.  Currently, I rarely use binance p2p if it is not an emergency. I prefer to trade on trusted accounts on forums or with of my friends who can do P2P quickly and reliably.",
