That is a significant amount to be dropped on the market simultaneously, although we don't have sure if receivers are going to sell those coins or hold. Added to those 2$ billion dollars there is the judicial permission to Celsius crypto lending bankrupted company to sell their mined bitcoins. I just don't know how many btcs they are going to sell, but whales knowing about these news can find the perfect opportunity to manipulate the market, driving to a deeper crash.",

But if they are all sold at once, then it can create an atmosphere of panic. But this panic does not last long. They will recover in a short time. So there is nothing to worry about in my opinion.Mt.Gox's release of bitcoins to pay victims during that year will not increase the bitcoin supply, since there are still 21 million bitcoins in the world, so I don't think it's too serious here. If people get their bitcoins back and they sell all of them on the market, this is seen as the next opportunity for those who don't trust enough to buy bitcoins when bitcoin was at $17k and they regretted it hitting $23k in recent days. It is better to see this as an opportunity rather than another cause for concern, a drop in bitcoin is good for us.",

Of course, but is it an impossible amount of money for the market to absorb even if we assume all the coins are sold at the same time? Of course not, the price will most likely go down as the demand is not really that high now but that is pretty much it, after a period of stabilization the price should return to the current levels without too much of a problem.",

If so, then \"HUG THE DIP\".Selling those quantities at a one-time big-time might create a possible huge crash but for big investors, who else doesn't want to buy at an unexpected bottom price that we might not see again once the bull trend commences?Those supposed dump bitcoins will surely be absorbed easily into the market by most traders and that will lead again to fuel the recovery period to where it all started at the price before that supposed speculative crash.",

However, part of the settlement is that they will be paid in cash, and then some in crypto like BTC and Bitcoin Cash.Although I think that it will have a huge impact to the market, it might be short term though. Or at least investors are not worried about it because as I have said, part of it is in cash and maybe those who are going to received it will still hold the coins and wait for the next bull run because that is the right time if they ever want to sell it.",

Once they release the bitcoins to the public soon, FUDs will start spreading (and topics/thread like this). People will start panicking reading those news and articles, they will start selling their bitcoin because they are going to think that \"BTC is going to crash heavily\" (and will be more convinced when they see threads/posts like yours) and will end up crashing the market. In other words, bitcoin won't crash because of those 2 billion worth of BTC, bitcoin might crash because the FUDs that will be spread. The drop will be temporary and the market will recover rather soon like it has always been.",

There can be a dump, going by obvious reasons, but if it happens will it matter to much to us holders? No. Because we will buy back at low prices and continue to hold. Most of the victims will sell because they have been waiting for a long time to get their hands on this.But the process has not started yet and hence not a reason at all to panic. In fact we traders should never panic about any upcoming dumps, let them happen like any normal process.As traders stop giving here to everyday news. You have to learn to be resistant to these and treat the numbers.",

There are still buyers.This could be a FUD also that they are spreading.Again Mt.Gox is used to fud and causes panic sell on the market.It is not real reason of this fall because Bitcoin has rallied from $17k to $25k and it must be pulled back. I believe that Bitcoin after this pull back will climb gradually to $27k or $28k and we will get another fall that can be bigger than this one.Mt.Gox is a very old story and with high trading volume of Bitcoin market nowadays, it does not cause big effect than in the past. Don't panic but I know people will still be panic.",

There is currently no confirmation that all Mt.Gox users will receive all in bitcoin, maybe they will get it back in USD. We still have to wait for the official announcement from Mt.Gox.https://u.today/mt-gox-provides-important-update-on-repayment-process-what-it-means-for-crypto-market",

But if they keep their BTC on hold and sell it when the price increases again, it won't crash BTC. But even though the price of BTC crashes, it is an advantage for those of us who have fiat because we can buy BTC at the lowest price, which is the best moment to buy BTC.
