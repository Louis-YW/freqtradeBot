Gambling is good when it is for fun, but bad when you are addicted by either spending too much time and money on it. I will advice you to try as much as possible to not be addicted.",

      "body": "The answer can go many ways. Many people will say that it has to do with the kick and adrenaline. In the end I think the answer is always money related, you want to win money in the end. And what could be better than winning money from home on your computer and in which you also feel the excitement of winning money? It is then winning money and not earning it. Many gamblers consider it work, but you can't lose money in work. However, gambling does. If you spend an evening in a casino, other motives may apply, of course. But you don't gamble online for fun, that's a money issue, in whatever form.",

While some take gambling as a livelihood, some persons like me do it for fun and would get engrossed in it at the, second or third tryouts. My continuity however depends on if I win sooner than my tryouts expire, my cash becomes exhausted or Â some other thing much more interesting tickles my fancy at the moment.",

What drives you to gamble? Is it the long shot of having a big profit coming in or is gambling simply a way of spending time for you?Just like you, it's fun to gamble and turned into a hobby. But this time, it's different from before. I've got a lot of time to gamble before but not anymore these days. I just want to gamble if I want to and I just have fun whenever I'm in stress but mostly, it adds more stress because I'm losing instead of winning but that's part of it. No doubt that I've thought of gambling as a way to make a lot of money but I'm wrong with that principle when I've realized that it's only me that's losing in it but the counterpart of it is having fun.",

Gambling is good when it is for fun, but bad when you are addicted by either spending too much time and money on it. I will advise you to try as much as possible to not be addicted.Those who gamble for fun are also somewhat addicted to gambling one way or the other, but excessive gambling to the point of losing control over one gambling habit is what makes the difference.As a matter of fact, most gamblers, don't gamble for fun any longer there has taken gambling to another level by betting huge amounts there can't afford to lose or put themselves under due rest if there lose.So gambling should be done with some level of control because it can easily get you carried away and before you know it, you will exceed your budget..",

The maximum I've ever gambled was ~$50, I know it's small but I do that so as not to get addicted to it and I believe that ones I become addicted to it that fun vibes will no longer be there.",

I don't gamble regularly just once in a while, that way I avoid getting used to gambling and I am enjoying myself with it.

I actually gamble occasionally for entertainment, special tournaments and matches of favorite teams attract me to gamble. But I haven't won any big bet yet, but I have won some small bets and most of them were sports betting . And I think this is how gambling should be played, because there is no guaranteed result, whether it could be for long term or short term. And it must be given only for entertainment Addiction should be eliminated as soon as possible.",

Gambling is something should be for fun but majority of people do end up on getting addicted and become impulsive and in resulting on spending up tons of money with it which is really just a common situation and people should really be avoiding that for it not to happen to theirs.",

Gambling should be for fun, nothing else, because if you treat gambling as a source of income, making money for your needs, that is not right because your greediness will be triggered, and becomes addicted soon. It would help if you had control of this in yourself in the first place because this is a very important thing to remember. So it means gambling is when you need to spend time while having fun, the last option could be the profit that you can get but this is not a necessary thing.",
