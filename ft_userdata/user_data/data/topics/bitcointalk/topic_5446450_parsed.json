Banks like Ally Bank, Simple, BankProv, Revolut, Wells Fargo, USAA, Bank of America Financial Center, Chase, Goldman Sachs and many other banks in United States are crypto friendly.Read this:https://bankbonus.com/best/crypto-friendly-banks/#:~:text=Which%20US%20banks%20are%20crypto,Chase%2C%20and%20Bank%20of%20America.But I am always wondering why people are depending on banks on what they can have without bank.",

He asked for a \"crypto businesses\"!There is no business that is larger than one man store that can run on only bitcoin, you need to pay bills, you need to pay wages, you need to pay suppliers and there is no way any company would survive on crypto-made deals!Quote from: Oshosondy on March 27, 2023, 09:27:41 AMBut I am always wondering why people are depending on banks on what they can have without bank.So you're telling me that you haven't used a bank in the last two years, or a service derived from a bank not even once!Might work for a while in some complete black market economies in 3rd world countries but it's not going to happen if you want to run a business in either US or EU.With Silvergate and Signature gone, Millenium cutting ties with crypto and Simple sold, the few that are crypto-friendly and deeply interconnected with exchanges that are left are probably Ally Bank, USAA, and..cough, cough.. BoA. Not on the same level of friendliness as the others but at least they have Coinbase integration and they do state, they have no problem with you actively trading and buying crypto through their account.",

It is important to note that the regulatory landscape for crypto businesses is constantly evolving, and banks' attitudes towards them may change accordingly. Banking relationships can be complex and dependent on a variety of factors, such as the type of crypto business, its location, and its compliance practices",

      "body": "There are some but they are mostly regional. A bank like JP Morgan won’t want to deal with the crypto headaches so they are out.Right now it’s a problem for regional banks because if they accept crypto, and a year later there is some scare and a bank run happens they might have the same problem that Silvergate did and become insolvent. Hence why many won’t want to take that risk.",

Do you know Silicon Valley Bank is not a bank which specializes to serve cryptocurrency business?That bank served for start-ups in IT area bht they collapsed. Additionally, if you check Big Tech company stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, Goggle, Apple and other companies in this field, you will see how they fell a lot in the last year. Are they better than Bitcoin? I guess not.So the given reasons that it is risky to have a bank that serves cryptocurrency companies is onky partially true. It is hard to say it is more or less risky if a bank serves for non-cryptocurrency IT companies and cryptocurrency companies.FTX exchange collapsed within a week is terrible but some banks collapsed within two weeks is more terrible.",

Well, the typical crypto exchanges. Coinbase(COIN) has even their stock and that means that they're engaged in both markets, the stock and cryptocurrencies. And by means of telling that they're happy, I'd assume that they're staying and won't be moved with all of those reported bank failures.Robinhood I guess is also one of them.",

I don't know maybe it had been a long time you have bought coin using fiat but you don't have to bother yourself about whether there is any bank that would be happy buying cryptocurrency with your own money. There are many banks those days that are tarding in cryptocurrency because they know that the market is very volatile and because that they can earn more money through customers funds by investing in them.",
