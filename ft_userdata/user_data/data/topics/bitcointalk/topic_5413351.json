      "body": "I have included the first picture I took of the private key with the most severely blemished sections shown, this picture was taken while the key was still under the foil and attached to coin as I immediately noticed the faded font Furthermore, there are characters like this which are slightly blemished which appears to be Zk? but if its zk or 2k that's another few hundred guesses added to the possibilitiesAnd as mentioned by owlcatz, there is also the issue of similar appearance of characters irrespective of ink status, such as this part of the PK which is crystal clear but I still have to try 1 vs l or even in the first picture 0 vs O vs o.  I believe there are well over 2000 potential combinations based on character similarities of which I have already tried ~300 of what I felt were the most likely characters  The PK paper has remained untouched with the PK facing upwards since removal. However, ink has actually further faded to the point where the last 3 characters in the first image above are no longer distinguishable (I would be entirely screwed had I not taken a picture yesterday). For reference: room temperature 68 degrees with humidity at 35%. The slab was cracked at the top and spliced down the side with no pressure on the coin.If anybody is able to adequately decipher the above characters/share photos of redeemed XMR private keys which allow me to successfully sweep the wallet without entering thousands of combinations, I am more than glad to offer the peeled XMR coin or 5 XMR as a token of my appreciation  , just shoot me a DM and I can share what I have already tried and a few other characters in question. Will post a separate summary thread to help future peelers as well",

What has your experience been when redeeming Lealana coins? I have never seen anything like this, and over the years helped assist people peel at least 2 x 100 XMR coins, & few 25's and 50's, as well as many 5 XMR brasses ... Only issues I've run into are aforementioned troubles with deciphering / eyeing the lettering / fonts. Keys & Paper have always looked just fine otherwise. I have to wonder how this one may have been stored prior to grading.... /thinkface...This looks like something different, as I have to assume that Lealana would QC the privkey sticker/prints to ensure they are readable prior to sticking under holos ofc...  I also know that The Canary Thread by TeeGumes has one of these coins as well - I wonder how that project is going? hmmm.. PS - I have confidence you will eventually get it right - it's a pain because the wallet has to sync and you have to jump hoops etc, I get it, too...",

Syncing it is the pita, but I guess there are other wallets out there that may be easier/faster nowadays...",

One thing I do for all my loaded items is use water proof paper and have the private key in qr and alphanumeric format as well. I noticed some coin makers only have a qr code for their private keys IIRC.  What happens to that should it smudge or something like this happens? That's why I do both to make sure that issue never arises",
