Not for TX(transaction) but for Bitcoin address/public key to convert them into hash160.Here are the tools that I'm talking about below.- https://bitcoin.fo/tools.php",

Can anyone explain how to find hash keys and hash160 for a given tx?For starters transactions don't have anything called \"hash keys\" or \"hash160\".Each transaction has a hash that is used as the \"transaction ID\" which is the result of computing SHA256d of the stripped transaction (removed witnesses). And a \"witness transaction ID\" that is computed by finding SHA256d of the whole transaction.Each transaction has at least one output that contains a script and in that script we may or may not have a hash which may or may not be using HASH160 of the public key or a redeem script. It may instead contain the public key itself, tweaked public key, SHA256 hash of redeem script, etc.",

RIPEMD160(SHA256(publickey)) gives a pubkeyhash, which is then used to encode a P2PKH address.Quote from: Zilon on July 27, 2022, 06:17:22 AMBut note before before applying this hash functions you should have generated your private key using elliptic curve multiplicationYour private key is not generated using elliptic curve multiplication. Your private key is simply a random number, generated using a good source of entropy or derived from your seed phrase (which is in turn generated using a good source of entropy).",
