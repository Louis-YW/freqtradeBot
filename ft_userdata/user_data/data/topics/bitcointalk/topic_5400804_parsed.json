  "content": "Quote(Bloomberg) -- Capital controls imposed by Russia have turned the ruble into the world’s best performing currency this year, though not many people can pocket a profit on the rally.image link:  https://i.ibb.co/TtBp8hY/russian-ruble.jpgThe ruble resumed its advance against the dollar on Wednesday as the Moscow Exchange reopened after two days of public holiday. It’s now up more than 11% against the US dollar since the start of the year, surpassing the real’s 9% advance to become the top gainer among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The offshore rate is up even more, about 12%.The ruble’s gains result from a series of measures taken by the government to defend the battered currency in the aftermath of Western sanctions. On top of imposing capital controls, Russia has forced exporters to sell foreign-exchange and is demanding its natural gas be paid for in rubles. Strategists say the rally isn’t credible as many currency-trading shops have stopped dealing in the ruble on the grounds that its value seen on monitors is not the price it can be traded at in the real world.Still, the irony of the ruble performing so well while at war is remarkable, especially as other countries that imposed capital controls in the recent past have not achieved the same results. Turkey and Argentina tried similar measures when they faced a horde of sellers in the past few years with disastrous consequences for the lira and the peso, which reached fresh all-time lows and never recovered.The ruble took over from the real as the world’s best performer as the end looms for Brazil’s monetary tightening, which is weighing on the currency. After raising the benchmark rate by 1,075 basis points since early 2021, policy makers in the Latin American nation have signaled a slowdown in the pace of hiking, as well as their intention to wrap up the cycle soon. While the real’s carry will remain high, the spread to US rates will likely shrink as the Federal Reserve keeps raising borrowing costs at an aggressive pace.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ruble-surpasses-brazil-real-best-162446964.html....Someone said russia is headed towards ruin and being outperformed by the united states economy.At the moment, the russian ruble is up 11% versus the US dollar and rated the #1 performing currency of the year.Meanwhile in the united states retailers are bracing for bad earnings reports due to inflation:https://www.reuters.com/business/wall-st-week-ahead-retailers-set-earnings-stage-after-inflation-sparked-market-2021-05-14/Evidence appears to suggest the US economy is weakening while the russian economy and its native currency is becoming stronger.Where does this idea some have that russia's economy is doing poorly come from?",

There are currency controls in place preventing free market corrections, foreign companies who want to escape are currently tied in from selling any assets at the best price (which is why ridiculous nationalisation plans are being drawn up). All of these are the actions of incredibly weak and short sighted politicians.While it may generate huge sums from selling energy and have a nice reserve of funds, it is still a basketcase economy. This is what happens when corruption infects every part of a society and people do not have the structures around them that encourage innovative thoughts. It will survive in the short to medium term being economically isolated, but it has the potential to be so much greater if it had a better government.The graph you posted effectively tracks the price of oil movements over the same timeframe - if the rest of the world fell into recession, the price of oil dropped, then Russia's undiversified economy would suffer among the worst.",

The ruble was up 20.32 percent against the dollar as at the begining of the month, trading at $67.09, down from $84 a month ago.Fears of a eurozone recession, along with the Euro's bearish trend, have also reignited the possibility of the currency reaching parity with the US dollar.https://nairametrics.com/2022/05/04/russian-ruble-gains-20-against-the-dollar-within-a-month/But inspite of the fact that the ruble is currently swinging in value versus the dollar, the Russian economy is significantly showing indications of deterioration. Russia's economy is experiencing a downturn unlike any it has ever seen, and this and many reasons has made many educated Russians to apparently abandoning the country. In a report, the Institute of International Finance stated, \"The current crisis will wipe out 15 years of economic improvement.\"",

This is of course a bit misleading because Russia is trading with the whole world. And if countries like Holland or Poland are being cut off from the gas trade its not that Russia will sit on all the excess gas. The whole world needs energy and many countries are still friendly with Russia. If the price is right they will keep buying from them. I think that the initial shock on the Russian economy came from the fear of a war between Nato and Russia. But the Western countries made it clear they are not going to intervene on Ukraine. We will have to watch over the next 12 month how hard the Russian economy is being affected. The currency markets might be the wrong indicator with the high inflation we see right now.",

Laughed heartily! I won't talk about the US economy. But about the Russian economy with pleasure, especially since it is so beautiful.Tell me, is it realistic for you, the economy that is on the world market, over the past few years has reduced its share from 2.4% to 1.7%, is this a powerful economy? And in general, how much or significant? Seriously ! With such success, one can speak about the economy of Burkina Faso, Armenia, Swaziland .. How do they differ from the Russian economy? And yes - they have no gas and oil, for sure !!! But the embargo will fix that very soon. And as one person said, \"Russia is Zimbabwe with snow.\" Let's leave Zimbabwe alone, they are already not pleased that they are compared with Russia, let's take another country. Nigeria! Why ? And because Nigeria can, in many respects, be compared with Russia. In terms of population, Nigeria is larger than Russia. The economy is also resource-based. But only in Nigeria it is really growing, unlike \"great Russia\" About the economy - I think a good indicator of the economy will be the standard of living of the country's population, right? So here we are back to Zimbabwe. The poverty rate in these two countries is essentially the same. In Russia, the truth is that propaganda is working to the fullest, telling how all the inhabitants of Russia are prospering, but .. this is a fake. Name me any developed country where ordinary foodstuffs are sold in installments?  No, not exclusive giant tuna, from the auction, but ordinary bread and staple foods!

He now needs not to strengthen the ruble, but rather weaken it - in order to benefit from Russia's huge trade surplus. Therefore, the reduction in the mandatory rate of sale of foreign currency for exporters to 50%, and the increase in the period of mandatory sale to 120 days (which actually completely cancels it). And the problem is that it seems that this is not enough - after the recent sharp reduction in the key rate, the ruble has weakened, but now it has begun to strengthen again. Because Europe now needs rubles to buy gas, and in Russia no one needs dollars and euros because of the loss of confidence in them and high sanctions risks.",
