  "content": "We can not stop it if we are depended from the mess crators if you use those money who created all the mess then the world never go to normal.We are depended on usd and eur and other fiat currencies.The solution here is simple we dont use their currency anymore becouse they have made mess all over the world economy and MONEY printing We can even use doge coin it works why not if it can get the job done The fiat vurrency is ok but those who control fiat currency are not smart people look like they have turn grazy they have messed up the world where they live in probably thet understood but its too late.But to finish this madness we let them use their own currency and things like that we just dont deal with them we ignore its simple we use some good fast transaction crypto and thats it.Local business companies and shops can accept crypto easy and price out prices with new crypto thats it.",

We can live in hope, every day is closer to the fiat ponzi scheme finally collapsing.We can start this by setting our businesses up as Private Membership Associations.
