I wouldn’t say this businesses have collapsed but rather they were shut down and the main reason was that the business owners do not want to transact in old currencies. We could all point fingers to the government for their lack of proper planning for the redesign even though they thought it might help curtail the problem of vote buying in the next coming election. Then aside the government the commercial banks should take some responsibility too. First by hoarding the new notes and giving it out to politicians and people known to them rather than making it accessible to the general public. The bank also failed in updating their mobile banking apps which proved in this period that it can’t handled many transactions and it resulted in slow transaction process. The USSD codes that were supposed to make it easy for the cashless transactions has since been having network problems which clear shows the lack of proper preparation by this commercial banks, because Fintechs like Opay and Palmpay have been doing excellent well this period. The citizens themselves made life difficult by charging exorbitant fees through the local POS withdrawals. Hospitals should also have provided means of accepting cashless transactions rather than sticking to the old way of paying with cash. The government is currently looking to extend the deadline again for another 90 days period",

Cheer up for those of you who live there.Some people are suspecting that this move by the central bank has a political undertone. Nigerian elections are normally challenged with vote buying, which means that the highest spenders always win. The present government wants to ensure that there is a scarcity of physical Naira notes to ensure that vote buying is reduced. But this move is affecting the country negatively because Nigeria is not yet mature for online or internet banking. Many citizens are illiterate and cannot use any other banking channels apart from cash transactions. Nigerian internet service providers are unreliable and the country lacks infrastructure such as electricity supply. Switching from physical money transactions to online banking should be gradually and not his urgent style.",

The Barter system becomes the alternative for people especially in rural areas who are heavily into farming, fishing, hunting and other activities that provide a level of self sufficiency for them. Trade by barter can help them in this period before people begin to adapt.",

Nigeria will certainly be one of those countries whose inhabitants may resort to primitive exchange systems. Nigeria is a country that suffers from political and security instability that affects the movement of the economy and impedes its growth. A reality that forced many people to adapt their lives and lifestyle to the new circumstances, and to adopt behaviors that they thought had become a memory from the distant past or that they were on the road to extinction.",

Demand for reliable 3rd party escrow services could be as well. Which could pave the way for growth of that business sector.While electronic escrow can collect a percentage of transactions, automatically. It could be far more challenging to escrow commodities and material assets. If they trade 3 chickens for 1 goat, how does escrow collect a percentage?I think one of the biggest obstacles to people avoiding second hand markets and trades is difficulties associated with scams and unreliable bad actors. A trustworthy and reliable escrow service (along with some form of insurance) would definitely go a long way towards increasing trade volume and participation of barter based systems. That is probably the area where markets would need to develop and innovate for economies to have a chance of thriving on an independent basis.",

The thing is that they don’t need blockchain and high technologies, they need to quickly, here and now, exchange what they don’t really need, for what they really need! In critical times, relationships always descend to more primitive technologies, and only real products that provide life and survival are of value. Even gold and diamonds in certain situations are exchanged for a simple loaf of bread in order to survive, although in ordinary life you could buy 1000 loaves of bread for the same diamond ring ...

It is a weak consolation for those who suffer because of it, but if you have a political alternative, then as a people you must show the will for change in the next elections.As for barter trading, I can only say that it still exists in countries that are far more developed than Nigeria, and I have personally witnessed it in the rural areas of my country where people who live from agriculture exchange their products. People used to do this on a much larger scale because they were much more focused on production, but the more the human population moved to big cities, the more they became dependent on money and shops.Unfortunately, this turned out to be a big problem, because if someone closes banks and ATMs, and if the distribution chains are also disrupted, then we have an angry and dangerous mass of people who are ready for anything.",
