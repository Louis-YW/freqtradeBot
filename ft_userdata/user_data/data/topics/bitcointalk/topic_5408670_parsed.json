  "content": "Ethereum total value locked (TVL) increased significantly in July due to a recovering market that saw investors pour more liquidity into decentralized finance (DeFi).Ethereum was one of the best-performing blockchain projects in the last month. According to Be[In]Crypto research, Ethereum gained 24% in total value locked in the seventh month of 2022. ETH opened on July 1, with a trading price of $1,068.32, reached a monthly high of $1,759.88, tested a monthly low of $1,033.96, and closed at $1,681.52. Overall, this equates to a 57% increase between the opening and closing price of ETH in July. (Source: Beincrypto)",

As i seen from some sources if there was possibility for the new ethereum will come in the next fork which was around mid of september. It seems like those people were doing preparation for such event. I can't even deny that if i have some ethereum as well but using it in the ethereum decentralized application is too risky for now with so many dapps being hacked and stolen by hacker.",

Some ETH miners are unhappy that the mining of this coin will soon stop and declare that they will fork so that mining can continue. However, this market already has Ethereum Classic (ETC), which continues to use the PoW algorithm and mining. Therefore, creating another similar fork would be redundant. We look forward to September 19, when the ethereum mainnet merge is scheduled, to look at the results of the biennial update. That is why, apparently, the price of this coin has been growing in the last month. I hope that this trend will continue in the future.",

So, those that has ETH are seeing to be fine locking it on LPs or for the 2.0.",

I love them, and I would love to own one eventually as well, very hard thing to do though so I doubt it would be anytime soon at all.",

A lot of people are expecting a new ATH for ETH this time, but I don't see it as long as bitcoin doesn't bounce back. there will probably be a small rally for ETH. ETC will certainly also increase in this ETH upgrade.",
