  "content": "Ironic question right? Well, as a crypto lover/ investor or whatever, only one thing that comes to my mind. That is, to be honest, if I get a time machine now, I would probably travel to the past and advise myself to buy BTC when it was so low. In the past, I may not have had the cash to buy it, but somehow I would convince myself to gather some money to buy it. Or take something from today and give it to my past self. This is just like a fantasy. A daydream that is impossible to do. But have you ever thought something out of the box? Like we are in 2022 soon to be in 2023 (Happy new year to all). As days pass by we are moving toward the future right? Thinking about it like this puts us in the past. Our future will become our present one day. So are you going to think the same thing about your future and just continue on living? Bitcoin is here with us since 2008. We can't go to the past, can't change it. After all this, you may be wondering what I am trying to tell here. Let me explain then. Considering our present as our past, put yourself in the future and think about what your future self would advise you right now.  In this bear market, the price is low. Not as low as in 2008, but it is low now. What are you going to do? Ignore this now and in the future tell yourself when Bitcoin crosses its ATH again that, \"if only I had a time machine now\" Well, a bear market is not a thing to be panicked about. It's an opportunity to fill our bags. Hold it for the future, as if your future self told you to do so. Every pro-crypto owners know this. Time to learn for yourself.This topic is for newbies who are thinking that BTC will fail and get vanished out of existence. Read this, and you will understand [Note: Not your financial adviser, Do Your Own Research]Be sure to let us know what you think about this!",

      "body": "Yeah time is short and we don't know what tomorrow would looks like, apparently this is inevitable and i strongly believe in the future we would keep yelling over missing such a wonderful opportunities whereby looking at bitcoin then would be too high for one to venture into, so it's advisable to at least hold any fraction we think we can.but op one thing you must note is that not even everyone who could have been patient to hold till this very day, i know from when bitcoin was launched there were people who bought thousand of bitcoin then after 2x, 5x, 10, to 100x they sold off, those who bought very cheap would likely say they have hit jackpot without knowing it was just the starting of bitcoin and i believe there could be lots of regret from then till now., So is something they can't control or hold because everytime bitcoin will likely create new ATH after its circles and they must surely sell off thinking that would be last ATH but failingly.",

If you don't take advantage of this now, that years later you will fantasize about a time machine in order to move from the future to the present day. I think it's better to try to achieve what you want than to regret later that you didn't take advantage of the opportunity.
