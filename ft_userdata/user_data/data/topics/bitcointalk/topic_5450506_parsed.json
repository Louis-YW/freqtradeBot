They are not the same as China mainland but having some great initiatives in the Asia is great.In 2017 bull run, we had Middle East and in 2023 market towards 2024 bull run, we might see more adoption growth including regulatory aspect in this continent. It won't stay outside and watch the Europe, South America and Latin America countries to play as hubs of cryptocurrency.Soon we will have big countries to announce their bombing adoption on cryptocurrency and related companies with clearer regulations so that companies in this field can more easily to comply with.",

A recent announcement came from a traditional bank and they are famous and with their statement, a lot of people probably have managed to buy and really believed in that idea. I do hope that it can come to fruition and continue to have that kind of power and backing from everyone. A lot of people would be rich just by holding BTC as well.",

Taiwan and China has already geopolitical issues so I don't know how successful Taiwan will be when it comes to implementing because China will going to oppose it at any cost since that's being their nature.Well, what we understand from all these the banks started to realise that bitcoin is not a small thing anymore and if they don't adapt the trend then they will be like Nokia.",

It will eventually happen, Taiwan and Hong Kong are economic giants and they are competing in a subtle way, Hongkong being a colony of China and one of its economic arms, and Taiwan who established their own identity in the Asian region.Asia is a strong economic region and the adoption of Cryptocurrency will further strengthen the region, and of course, China's Hongkong and Taiwan don't want to be late in adoption.The adoption of these two economic giants will bring positive feedback to the market, hopefully, it will turn the tide and we'll price of Bitcoin and other top coins to surge.",

By this comment, you've already said my mind, let them flex muscles, as to who be the first to integrate bitcoin into her system,Ours, I believe is to sit and watch, while our bitcoins in our wallets continue to increase in its value, thereby making us some nice profit.I've always said it before that bitcoin is here to stay, it doesn't matter the several challenges faced, challenges are normal experience for every new technology, sooner or later, I see bitcoin becoming a major global currency in the entire world, it wil happen sooner than we think.",

Not sure how it will impact the global market, but as far as I can see it doesn't really change how the status quo works that much. I can imagine people being more open to sharing that they have crypto and want to trade on a registered exchange, oversea exchange gets more hurdles to pass if they want to serve customers from Taiwan (depending on the law tbh), and so on.At the very least, this is better than how US do their thing where they just sue exchanges left and right because they fail to register their service and follow regulation when the regulation they set is unclear and so easy to interpret to different ways.

      "body": "Hong Kong regulators have been taking steps to regulate the cryptocurrency industry and provide greater oversight for trading activities. In November 2020, Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) proposed new rules that would bring cryptocurrency trading platforms under its regulatory authority. The proposal includes requirements for licensing, due diligence measures, and capital and custody requirements. In addition, the SFC has issued guidance on security token offerings and has been monitoring the activities of cryptocurrency exchanges and initial coin offerings (ICOs) to ensure compliance with securities laws. As of April 2023, Hong Kong has a regulatory framework in place for cryptocurrency trading platforms, and licensed exchanges can offer trading of certain large-cap tokens to retail investors. hopefully the ftx issue won't be repeated in hk",

Because as seen mainland China is quite anti-Bitcoin and Altcoin and even prohibits it from circulating in their country - and with the support of Bitcoin and Altcoin trading and transactions at traditional banks in Taiwan and Hong Kong it proves that they are independent countries and are not constrained by mainland China.",

Q4/September is what we need to wait for here, till then fingers crossed as to what happens next. If they start doing this following HK, we can expect good price pump in the next few months and even more when it starts.But another aspect to this is the government questioning of companies and all which often happens a few years after they get settled in. They are needed to keep their growth in check but lets hope that does not bring down the spirits.",

With all indications, it might seem to be like a competition of who gets the more crypto business utilisation. There’re a lot of entrepreneurs whom I think the government there wants to focus on in order to maximise the use of cryptocurrencies in their businesses. This will make the widespread faster and use amongst the citizens there. The adoption is getting massive day by day and it’s a welcome development to the world of cryptocurrency.QuoteWhatever is the reason? I feel that this news should bring a lot of cheer to the market.

It may be for their benefit, but what is more important is that it is being adopted and will gain more global recognition and use.",

True and Very interesting to see the development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in various countries, and considering the recent announcement in Taiwan announcing traditional banks to offer crypto trading services is certainly a significant development in my opinion, Although it is not clear what motivated Taiwan's decision to move swiftly on Bitcoin regulations, it is possible that competition with China or Hong Kong's recent crypto banking announcements played a role.But regardless of the reasons, the fact that other countries are feeling cryptocurrency and trying to promote its growth is undoubtedly positive news for the market, For me it's normal As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies continue to gain acceptance it will be very interesting to see how this impacts on global financial landscape.",

So, venturing into cryptocurrency shouldn't be new to my hearing because to enlarge their trade relationship with other countries they'll need to have different payment options available for potential prospects. Taiwan is growing and I don't think that they took this decision because of Hong Kong, between, they import lots of agricultural products from other countries, and if they decide to pay in bitcoin that'll be a better growth for the currency.

Taiwan government has seen how China blocked the banking transactions of the local government and citizens of Hongkong. So probably they are preparing for that. Another reason could be, Taiwan is trying to cash out from the current regulatory situation in US. The way US is treating the crypto companies, they will look for another destination from where they can operate. Probably they are trying to fill the gap. But overall it's a good news!
