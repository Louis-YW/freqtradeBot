  "content": "I love to play a Poker Tournament now and then. It is actually my favourite game at a casino. So, here's the oldest trick for online poker gambling players. I consider myself an average player, as I've never charged my account and have earned a few bucks from it. Typically, I look for tournaments with many players with buy in's up to $3. The downside of this is that these sorts of Tournaments are very time-consuming. Thing is, the main trick of making money out of Poker is to be very patient, pragmatic, logical and emotionless. If you follow the main trick, you will be able to step into the following trick which is \"know die foe\" given that you need time to study an opponent, tournaments make perfect to improve techniques and work out the patience, pragmatic, logical and emotionless side of playing. I have some simple strategies I follow to try to stay on the money. But first, lemme tell you how I started playing poker without ever making any deposit. I first started to look for reviewed and popular poker rooms offering first-sign promotions, allowing you to start playing without having to charge your account. You can check that out here.Once you log into a room and get a promotion, you will have two options to follow: either go for multi-table tournaments with up to 2k players OR go for the Sit & Go's with 9-player tables and $1 buy-ins. If you are comfortable with your skills, you should get some earnings in the long run and take some cash out. With the profit, you can check for new promotions and step into new Poker rooms and keep earnings coming. Of course, that to get the earnings you will have to find a way of always staying \"on the money\" and make sure that your earnings are always bigger than your losses. To do that, you will have to follow a playing style and follow some simple in-game rules to keep up and finally get to the point where you will have your ROI. But since secrecy is the soul of business, I won't tell you what these simple rules are, but if you guys give a small contribution from your own experiences, I'll also reveal mine and then we can work out some sort of tutorial or something like that. What do U guys say?",

Easier said than done, and besides every poker player knows this and anyone who took the time to learn the game fundamentally knows for sure that this is the way to go. What OP requires is a concrete strategy that amps his win rate without using any form of cheating or whatnot.  In my case back when I was heavy with Poker, is just playing aggressively. I call everyone and this especially works when you are used to playing less cards or with a smaller hand. It paints the impression that you're either calling everyone to which they could either retaliate or accept the challenge. Either way you can guarantee a larger percentage of win since not a lot of people expect aggressive plays especially since the pulse of the game right now is mostly based upon \"playing the slow and steady matchup\".",

Also, its efficiency depends on the player who does it which is why I cannot see it as cheating, 'coz if it is, it should be applicable to anyone who would do it on the actual game.Quote from: passwordnow on September 13, 2023, 10:23:08 PMQuote from: Katy Laurence on September 13, 2023, 12:48:41 PMTo improve poker game.

Meanwhile, what is being discussed is online poker games.In a land-based casino, it may be easier for us to read our opponent's movements, one of which is by looking at their behavior and facial expressions.However, the most important thing in playing poker is to understand all the existing rules and regulations and have good self-confidence. And this is very important because most of them make mistakes and play carelessly when joining the gambling table. because they are unable to understand the existing rules and have good self-confidence.",

Steal Lots of Blinds, But Don't Exaggerate!!!This strategy has been applied in online poker tournaments for many years and is still used a lot today because generally the small blind or big blind tend to win and most of the time, they do this without having anything in their hands. Therefore, a pre-flop raise is important, as long as you know that the small blind and especially the big blind have a more conservative strategy.In this case, they will hardly get into a fight with you, but as I said at the beginning... you can't overdo it because if you do it all the time, one day you'll get caught and then the fun will be over. You need to show that you are raising when you have a good hand.",

I don't feel the need to play every hand; I wait for strong starting hands and favorable situations. Folding weak hands is often the right move.\"Playing the player\" is one of the strategies I learned from an acquaintance who is passionate about card gambling. Paying attention to your opponents' tendencies is crucial because you need to spot patterns in their play style.I don't focus on secrecy; it's often more productive to engage in discussions with fellow players to exchange ideas and learn from each other.",

Playing a multi-table tournament of 2K players or more and coming first is purely a matter of luck no matter how well you play. What is not a matter of luck is to have consistent results that indicate a positive EV and that is known by playing many tournaments. With this there is a problem is that the variance is much higher than in cash tables and players who had very good results long ago in the long term, after a brutal variance moved to a modality with less variance or simply left poker.",

It wouldn't be a tournament if it went over and finished after a couple of minutes, especially since the changes in the table can also change the mindset of the players themselves, creating these so-called unpredictable actions every now and then, which is what honestly makes poker rather enjoyable even if you're playing with the same people for a couple of rounds.Quote from: Blawpaw on November 27, 2022, 01:08:21 PMOf course, that to get the earnings you will have to find a way of always staying \"on the money\" and make sure that your earnings are always bigger than your losses.

Because i've been only playing those via places like pokerstars and that's not a casino per se. Or are you talking about physical casinos in real life?Quote from: Blawpaw on November 27, 2022, 01:08:21 PMI consider myself an average player, as I've never charged my account and have earned a few bucks from it.

Spot on. My biggest failure on those games is the fact that i get bored. It takes too much time and often not much is happening in the game. It's basically grinding out worst players in the table. If you don't see that's happening, people are probably playing you out.But most of the time, especially in online games, it's quite boring. All you can read is the history of the player and what kind of hands they have chosen to play and if they have raisen or called. That tells a lot but not as much as body language. Some people can fake their body language but most can not. If they are not taken any medication, drugs or booze, they will react to cards somehow. And that's not boring to watch. But i need to be focused for a long time, not drinking or thinking anything else, and that's hard part.And the fact that i easily get frustrated if i am losing. All or nothing attitude raises in me and i lose. I figure that decent players can see that happening in me This has been my strategy. If i find out how to not get bored or frustrated, i would think i would be rather good in poker. Now i am not.",
