I‚Äôm just want to hear something encouring and confirm my assumptions. üôè I want to be someday (i hope that it will be possible in next bullrun) independent of money from my family. I‚Äôm since 2010 on wheelchair because of failed surgery and interrupted my spinal cord. I have multiple health problems, mainly resulting from paralysis. ¬†I have little chance of having a high paying job due to my health problems and unfortunately incomplete education. But my expenses are too high. I am able to invest 20-30 euros per month and I really want to believe that one day thanks to this regular investment I won't have to ask my family for help.

By the time the halving occurs sometime in April of next year, you will probably have twice as many, around ‚Ç¨700-800 in Bitcoin. The next bull run I suppose will happen more or less a year after the halving. Let's say you will have ‚Ç¨1,000 in the next bull run. If the price grows x4 in that bull run, you will have ‚Ç¨4,000 in Bitcoin. Is that enough to make you financially independent from your family? And for how long?I guess it's better if you continue to hodl what you have beyond the next bull run and forget wanting to be financially independent sooner rather than later. What you have will be a bigger help someday. You're working, after all. You can probably find another job online. I assume you're able enough to do some work-from-home jobs like virtual assistance.

      "body": "While it is late to be able to monumentally gain from a 20-30 euro monthly investment, it might make your life a little easier in the coming 5 - 10 years. Lets assume that the next halving takes us to $100,000 by the end of 2024, and the halving after that to $500,000 by the end of 2028. Let's also assume that your average accumulation price is half of the aforementioned peaks.There are roughly 18 months between now and the end of 2024, meaning you would accumulate roughly 360 - 540 EUR worth of Bitcoin between now and then. At an average price of $50,000, let's say you have accumulated 0.01 BTC. Between 2025 and the end of 2028 there are 48 months, where you accumulate another 960 EUR - 1440 EUR worth of bitcoin at an average price of $250,000 (which is probably too high, but lets say it for arguments sake) which amounts to around 0.005 - 0.0075 BTC. By the end of 2028, you have roughly 0.015 BTC to 0.0175 BTC, which at a rate of $500,000 would be valued at around $7,500 - $8,750. Let's not also forget that the average buy price between 2025-2028 would probably be lower than $250,000...so this baseline expectation might even result in a better result than projected by these rough calculations. It's not enough to make you independent, however it might make your life a little easier over time. If you have any opportunity to increase that 20 - 30 EUR per month investment, then do it!",
