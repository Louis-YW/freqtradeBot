  "content": "First of all I'm a small bitcoin investor, and I'm not too old to invest so this is the beginning of my investment. I have known about Bitcoin since long time ago and I have been interested in Bitcoin ever since. Slowly trying to learn about Bitcoin and interest in learning about Bitcoin introduced me to investing. At the beginning of investing in Bitcoin I felt different, I could not believe that investors invest in this crypto currency. While slowly trying to learn about investing and at some stage of trying I got a rough idea about investing and from then on I started to believe that investors really invest in this platform. It was okay for others to invest but I couldn't bring up the courage to invest myself because it seemed too risky to me. Although it seemed risky, since a curiosity was working in my mind, I took courage and decided to withdraw money from my savings account and decided to invest that money in Bitcoin.  At the time I invested in Bitcoin I clearly remember when Bitcoin was worth around $25K. To be honest, I couldn't sleep well until a few days after investing, I always felt that maybe I had invested my hard-earned savings in the wrong place. Although it was bad for a few days, I was able to adjust myself with it later. After a few days of my investment, I felt that something good must be waiting for me, because since that time the price of Bitcoin has been steadily increasing and has reached its current level.  When the price of Bitcoin reached $38K I thought I would sell my investment but I didn't sell my investment yet hoping for something better. Thinking whether to sell the investment or not I thought I should share the matter in the forum and I will get the best solution from the forum that's why I am sharing the matter in the forum whether I should hold on to my investment or sell it now.  I don't need the money anyway, if I sell my investment now I have to deposit this money in the bank again.",

You should not handle your finances by random advises over the internet.This being said, my opinion is to wait. There's a good chance you've bought in a pretty good moment, you know that there are big expectations for the following year.Bitcoin halving tends to come with a bull run (or FOMO bubble) and a better strategy would be to wait until bitcoin price doubles (at least).At that point you can sell some to get back the fiat you've invested so you have the peace of mind you need and stop asking this kind of questions. This is important because, if you read back, Bitcoin history has its bull runs, its bear market periods and also its \"crypto winter\" months; then this peace of mind will be very important so you don't chicken out and sell, so you can enjoy the future bull runs too.Of course, I may be wrong; that's why you should decide for yourself.",

      "body": "From what you said, it shows that you don't have too much knowledge about bitcoin. So, first I recommend that you learn about the history and all the knowledge related to bitcoin, from there you will know whether you should continue to hold bitcoins or sell them. My advice to you, bitcoin is a very good long-term investment. The longer you hold, the greater the reward you receive, but holding is not simple because of its volatility. That's why I ask you to improve your knowledge about bitcoin immediately instead of investing without knowledge like today.",

Those two things contradicts themselves a bit, the rule for investment no matter what it is is to never invest more than you can afford to lose, seeing that you're losing sleep because of $150 in Bitcoin I would say neither investing nor trading is for you, sorry but this is the truth and I'm not going to sugarcoat it just for so I don't hurt somebody feelings.This is not how long term investing works, you must be ready for price swings, you must take a 60-80% drop with ease and without sleepless nights, you must not need that money at any point in order to not be force to liquidate in a bad position, and so on.If you don't need that money, just withdraw the coins to your old wallet and look at the price in a year or two from now on!",

Because you will definitely make a profit. But if you sell the bitcoins you have and the money goes back to the bank, I think it's better to just keep the bitcoins you have for longer. Because if you save the money you get from investing in Bitcoin in the bank, it will definitely decrease over time. Therefore, it is better to hold on to your bitcoin assets for a little longer. Because if you look at the time, the bitcoin halving and bull run market will soon appear. So it is better to sell the bitcoin assets you own when the bull market occurs. Because the market price of bitcoin will definitely be more expensive.",

I am a student and I have a part time job besides my studies from which I earn about 200 dollars every month that's why I dare to keep my investment for 5 years. During these five years I will not only hold my investment but every month I will try to add some amount to my total investment if I have a job for five years. That's why I will hold the investment in five year plan because after five years my graduation will be complete then I will try to do something good with my investment. Two weeks ago he was planning on hodling for five years and adding more each month, now he can't sleep at night after one week.Time and server diskspace waste!",

If you are able to take profit and gotten back your initial capital investment you can put it in the bank while the remainder is left in your bitcoin wallet.Thisnisnyhe one you should hold. And if you care to increase your investment you can just DCA. We are expecting a bull run and having no Bitcoin investment is not advisable.",
