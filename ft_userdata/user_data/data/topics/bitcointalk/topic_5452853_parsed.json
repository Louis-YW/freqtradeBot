      "body": "Unlike what the two fine gentlemen above mentioned, there are actually two known custom firmware for Whatsminer, Chipless, and Bixbit, the main problem with these firmware including everything else that might come out in the future, is there is actually no reason to run them and pay high fees.The stock firmware offers most of the features, you can overclock, underclock, set power limit, and submerge your miners using nothing but the stock firmware, and since using custom firmware requires a lot of trust, it's pretty difficult to find enough reviews from people who use those custom firmware versions, so most people are skeptical about using them especially that \"again\" there is really no use case.",

I have eight unitsÂ 2x m102x m304x m50all of them have hot exterior that is deliberately done.all of them are long with larger fansonly two fans that do about 310cfm eachwith the long length heat sheds to outside walls of the miner.If you want to reduce fan speed try two long heat sinks on the left and right outside of the miner.thus the ability to shed heat on those walls would lower internal heat.",

That's the problem with the latest units you can't downgrade the unit to the version you want unless the firmware is newer than the current version. You can try to flash the unit through SD card flashing just make sure to check the control board first for SD card firmware compatibility. You can download the SD card firmware from their download page below and then if successful, flash it again with the \"20240509.12.REL.LC\" firmware.- https://www.whatsminer.com/src/views/firmware-download.html",
