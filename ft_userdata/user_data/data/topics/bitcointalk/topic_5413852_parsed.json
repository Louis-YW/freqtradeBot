      "body": "More context about your current status could help. Information like:- Do you run a crypto project?- What stage are you at now?- Define your target audience?Without this info, I can give you some general tips that might be valuable. - Keep your community real: Don't buy fake members or use any black hat method. Intelligent investors can sense it.- Hype is fading, think about things that last: Many projects think only about generating quick hype around their sale, which helps them to raise money but once the hype is fading they have nothing to offer. Instead of focusing only on creating hype, also choose more traditional channels. Content and SEO might be the right choice in this case. Create a blog on your site and publish in-depth articles that bring great value to your target audience and invest in PR that supports your SEO effortsYou can find a lot of great info on the GuerrillaBuzz blog.

      "body": "If you're talking about projects with a token, I think the market's nature makes them prone to failure. Most of them are designed to be a cash grab, and if it is not, the community is so focused on making profits that it is almost unrealistic to hope they stick together when the market is harsh. Marketing is not going to help that much for them much. I've also seen a project with a focus on marketing fail soon after that since most people view them as a quick cash grab. Things might be different if you're launching a crypto-related service without any token, such as an open-source payment processor and so on.",

The actual product is the value of a project and is more important,• If you like the product, you then scrutinize the marketing strategy. There are projects which prioritize quantity over quality; such projects would encourage numerous spam posts about them around the forum (and internet), in the hopes that it gets them some traffic and users.This is more common on social platforms like YouTube and Twitter, with bots promoting several projects multiple times, sometimes in the same comment section,• Customer response is also an important aspect of customer relations. Do not only check out how a project tries to announce themselves to new users, also check how the interact with existing ones.",

Is there any warnings when it comes to investing in different projects that's related to how they market them selfs? Would love to hear from the community here what do you think I've promoted quite a few projects over the years and had varying degrees of success.  I've also been attacked by people as a result.  There's one guy on these forums who lost a bunch of money gambling at an online casino I was promoting years ago (not Stake) and still to this day blames me for his losses.  The crazy part is that his losses occurred BEFORE I was hired to promote the site and when I heard his complaining I stopped promoting for the site within a week or two, leaving money on the table and cutting off my agreement early.  Yet to this day he still holds a grudge and tries to damage my reputation at every opportunity.So be careful what you market.  People who do dumb things will always look for someone else to blame when it goes bad and they have no sense of honor, truth, or personal accountability.",

Would love to hear from the community here what do you think What i have learned with the years is how this forum is the best place to promote any crypto project. The re are 2 options: the signature campaigns and the forum ads. Both have huge impact but aren't cheap options. If you are thinking about promote any crypto project on social networks or search engines maybe you get some nice traffic, but a lot of that traffic will come from people who haven't ever use a crypto coin, that's why isn't effective as the forum.",

ICOs have become something of a black mark on the crypto community.That's true if you're project is not that big spend your own money or create a private sale for people you know, if you want a long-term project, be sure that you are transparent, there are a lot of loopholes launching crowdfunding you will be targeted, investigated, marketing is easy if the platform is something that the community can benefit, everything is all about usage, and if you want to create a token for your project to sustain it, be sure that you are transparent, and your project complies with all the regulation from the authorities also if you can, let them know who you are, because if they know who you are they know you are proud of your project.",
