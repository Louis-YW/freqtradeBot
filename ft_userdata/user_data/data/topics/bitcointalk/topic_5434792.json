  "content": "The Chief Executive Officer of SFS Capital Nigeria Limited, Patrick Ilodianya, in interview with Temitayo Jaiyeola, examines how technology has been impacting investment in Nigeria. In the interview, he talked about cryptocurrencies along some questions answered.https://punchng.com/investors-will-lose-crypto-assets-in-coming-years-sfs-capital-ceo/QuoteCrypto investments have gained ground in Nigeria. A lot of Nigerians are investing in crypto. Why do you think this is happening?Cryptocurrency is an exciting innovation supported by blockchain technology. Generally, Nigerians are very adventurous, and some people believe it provides a hedge against devaluation. Unfortunately, cryptocurrencies are unregulated. And this is a major problem. Due to the lack of regulation, many people would lose the bulk of their investments in the coming years.In my opinion, putting money in cryptocurrency now is not investing; it’s more of gambling. So, many things can go wrong. The crypto exchanges basically act like banks, fund managers and trading exchanges, all in one without any regulatory oversight. There will be many problems in the future. I believe enthusiasm would deepen massively. But I also believe when regulation catches up and regulators become actively involved, the abuses would reduce and the attractiveness would increase.He deemed cryptocurrencies as gambling. Some members on this forum on general board including myself deem most altcoins as gambling. One of the reasons I consider many altcoins as gambling is because they are shit coins, they devalue more during bear market and they may not attain all-time-high after bitcoin has attained all-time-high. During the recent bull market that got bitcoin above $20000, many altcoins like Filecoin, Solana, Gala, APT and many other pumped almost or over 100%, but also can be their fall.I consider cryptocurrencies to be under-regulated, not unregulated because the government are trying ways cryptocurrencies can be regulated.I can not consider exchanges to banks because banks are safer unlike exchanges. Fiat can be kept in bank because it is the safest place to keep fiat, or the use of eNaira wallet but which its adoption in Nigeria is very low as Nigerians are not using eNaira. Exchanges are not safe to keep your coins, the safest place to keep your coins are on noncustodial wallets (like cold wallets or hardware wallets which are the safest) where you have the full control of your coins, unlike on exchanges that can even be hacked or exchange owners misappropriating your money, like FTX.I will against if it is about bitcoin, also as the market is still not in the bull direction in long term yet, in coming years (2024/2025), we should expect bull run, but I will consider it correct too because some people will prefer to invest on shit coins that will make their investment to be in the money loss direction.",

Altcoins investment are pure gambling. You can never know which coin go pump or dump. The only thing wey you fit do wey go help you small na to follow where the money is going. Example if we dey Defi season, best thing to do na to invest in Defi projects. If you go dey claim stubborn head thinking say you be one expert like dat, market go just show you shege.Same thing can be said about memecoin season, if no be e season avoid investment in them as e go crash your own portfolio to zero. Now if you dey invest in altcoins make sure you understand which season dey on board and always take profits. No get married to any project in the sense that when people dey sell, you go refused to offload your bags, na mumu you dey be be dat. Even though you over believe the project, take profits as e go give you better chance to acquire more bags during the dip.At the end of the day na for you wey dey find ur belle to use your head, Patrick Ilodianya fit sit-down dey advise say make we no invest because him get food to chop but wetin the local man go do. Just no put all your eggs in one basket. Make him statement no discourage you from investing in Bitcoin or cryptocurency entirely but use your no 6.",

      "body": "Nigerians will lose crypto assets if they are investing wrongly and storing their crypto assets wrongly. If you as a Nigerian purchases crypto that has no utility and shouldn't be held for the long term, thus you are prolly gambling, and if you don't sell before the coin starts to dump, you'd lose your crypto. Same thing goes for how you store your crypto assets, if you store them on crypto exchanges, or leave your seed phrase exposed, then you could also lose your crypto assets.Having said that, i for one do not consider Bitcoin to be gambling, or to be synonymous with pump and dump schemes, if you are patient and make zero mistakes whilst storing your Bitcoin, then you wouldn't lose it; investors have to choose the best and safest option if they are to make the most out of the network.The crypto network is more of a 'be your own bank network', so it is different from the traditional banking system, as its users are meant to protect themselves by being their own bank. But even the traditional banking system is no longer as safe as people think, there have been numerous cases of people's naira vanishing from their bank accounts: https://www.legit.ng/business-economy/money/1513978-nigerians-drag-zenith-bank-n4-million-vanished-ladys-account/ thus maybe more attention should be directed at the security of traditional banking than on crypto and crypto regulation.",

According to Patrick Ilodianya many people will loss in cryto investment because it is unregulated but i don't see any issue with the unregulated nature with cryto currency abi na me no understand am well. Fiat bank wey be sae goverment dey regulate wan kill pesen for naija like dis.

Regulation go good for some aspects of crypto no be lie, especially crypto exchanges, though most of them don they regulated small sha, if crypto exchanges they unregulated, them go dy carry people crypto play and if them lose am you no go fit sue them or do anything.

How do you know that pple will lose investment in next year? Please can you give us your statistics of agreeing with Patrick? My brother as for me I see progressive progress in next year, cryptocurrency investment will boom next year, so I see the opposite of  Patrick. Though I don't know the algibra used by Patrick to determine the investment outcome of next year. But I used the 3 M to analyze the outcome which are Mean, Mode and Median to forecast the future.",

Because looking at the rise in crypto adoption in Nigeria, if only we can invest our assets rightly (i.e by only purchasing Bitcoin and no other shitcoins that have a high tendency of losing their value very quickly), and store our crypto assets rightly (i.e by storing it in a non-custodial wallet) just like what \"Charles Tim\" said earlier, definitely, the rate at which people will lose their funds in the coming years will be reduced to the lowest minimum.Because, what people need now is the right orientation about crypto security, and the government is not giving enough chance for that",

I believe that cryptocurrency knowledge is becoming more solid now than before. In the past, a lot of people preferred altcoins because they felt they yielded a higher ROI, but I think many are now realizing that Bitcoin is more solid than other cryptos.Although no one can tell the future, I think if Bitcoin is persistent, the only people that will lose their money to cryptocurrency in future are those that fail to understand the it's risk, probably those that store on CEX, those that don't store their assets on hard wallets but instead choose to have them on some centralized wallet like Trustewallet, and those that invest in shitcoins thinking it is a diamond. Yea, it's safer to store fiat money in the bank than in CEX, but bank frustration most times can just trigger that evidence of doubt in someone. What is happening in the bank these days is terrible. I feel that in time to come, either banks will increase their security or people will adopt the e-naira, or people will stop saving in the bank. I saw a video clip online of a woman weeping bitterly in the bank; she was lamenting that \"all the while she has kept #300,000 at home, no thief saw her, but just recently that she deposited the money in her account, the money has disappeared from her account.\"The bank needs to increase security for some specific spending limits.",

It was because of the regulations and centralized nature of the fiat system that this industry was created in the first place so what good does it bring if that purpose is destroyed by introducing centralization into the industry through regulations. The scams are all part of the system. Both the real world and this world experience same scams. Here security is placed in the hands of the user and not a centralized body therefore you're responsible for whatever outcome that results from your decision.We have to be able to protect ourselves from the scams all over the web, they aren't that hard to locate. Coins like Luna and FTX that crashed had clear signs of them going down the same path form their creation bit lack of research made many investors to trust this project with their funds. These aren't the only altcoins that were created with flaws from the begining but our greediness won't allow us to see through this project. We just have to research more and not blaming the scammers.",

Exchange is a market place where you should not keep your assets for too long because it is controlled and vulnerable to attack.. back to your question if an exchange get hacked the size of the loss can vary depending on the exchange's size and security measures. The exchange may have insurance or other forms of compensation to reimburse affected users in some cases, but this is not always the case. Some exchanges may also try to cover the loss with their own funds or by asking other exchanges to chip in. However, not all exchanges can compensate the victims so most of them prefer to appeal in the court and pay compensation to the government and that's all....",
