Nice having you here. I checked your website and it is alright. I saw were you demanded for $50 membership fee for vendors and if I may ask you this question were you asked to pay any membership fee as you registered here? This platform is very much bigger and well recognised than your site with lots of job opportunities, people learning and also imparting other members here free of charge. People are also hired here and paid for their services. Lots of skills are learnt here, people get educative materials here, connections and other important information Al gotten here free of charge. What if someone does as it is written on your website and does not get anything in return what would be the outcome as I am not convinced with what you have written here.",

      "body": "You should have chosen a better domain, this .xyz sounds like not serious honestly and that's why we barely see those real marketplaces that have this domain. Moving on, if someone sees this $50 bond thing, they'd definitely going to flee away from your marketplace. Even if you say that it's refundable. Someone who just seen a platform that has this amount of charge for freelancers and employers will definitely choose the other platforms where they don't need to have such bonds to avail their services.",

What if someone does as it is written on your website and does not get anything in return what would be the outcome as I am not convinced with what you have written here.Let’s take a look at some examples to understand this better:Example 1: You want to list a PR campaign service and charge $1000 per PR campaign. You pay the vendor bond of $50 to list your service. After you pay the vendor bond, you realize that there is a huge market for your service. You make your first sale and receive the full $1000. Then, you make your second sale of $1000 and receive 95% ($950) because your vendor bond is fully refunded. When you close your account, you will receive $0 as your vendor bond has already been refunded by giving you    $50 discount.Example 2: You want to list a shout-out service and charge $100 per shout-out. You pay the vendor bond of $50 to list your service. When you make your first sale of $100, you will receive the full amount instead of being charged the market fee of 5%. If you don’t make any sales after your first sale, you can close your account and get the remainder of $45.Example 3: You want to list a logo design service and charge $100 per logo design. You pay the vendor bond of $50 to list your service. After you pay the vendor bond, you realize that there is no market for your service. You can close your account and get a refund of $50.",

      "body": "The service is 1 day old and asks for a $50 guarantee to post every offer, I don't know if that's a good market for scammers to exploit early, the only questionable reputation is the marketplace itself.As a freelancer on several other platforms, I actually want to register but am just waiting for the time. Just wanted to hear the first evaluation from the owner after a few months on whether this policy will result in a thriving freelance marketplace.Goodluck.",

We understand that this may be a concern for some users, but we believe that it is necessary to maintain a High quality platform.Paying fees to prevent misuse is an ugly excuse, and even for well-known services, membership fees give distinctive conditions, such as the ability to pin a post, publish in a specific board, or some paid features, but most of the features must be free, the first of which is publishing a job and/or wishing to list your service.Start with free service and paid features. The exact opposite happens in our world today, as services attract customers by paying them fees.",
