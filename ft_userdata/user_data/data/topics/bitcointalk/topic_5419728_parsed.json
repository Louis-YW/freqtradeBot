Fan tokens4. World Cup related memecoinsSure but i will not even hundred percent believes if those tokens will be pumped during the world cup. The sense scenario is the hype will be disappeared due to the bearish market. World cup is something that doesn't have any direct cooperation. The project like algo was only paying for promotion purpose only. I don't even thing such marketing will be so effective to drive the price to increase.",

Many people missed this opportunity due to a lack of knowledge where they don't even know that these coins existed. But to be fair, this is not 100% sure this is of course just speculation, and anything could happen otherwise. If you already have these coins, it's better to hold them and if you don't have any of those, you might better check which one has the potential to grow with the current World Cup and avoid any excessive investment which will lead you to lose all of your money when the coins will fall instead of rising.",

OP is being very optimistic with all of those coins that listed above. he doesn't even know if sometime the participation of crypto project to be a partnership or sponsor for the world cup can give nothing at the end. My main concern is algorand is not a good blockchain. This blockchain has less and less users since it was not able competing with another new blockchain that keeps coming to the market. I guess those projects were wasting their money just to be a sponsor for the world cup. I never take it as a serious effort. Fan token was actually pump and dump token. It's fine sometime it can also be pumped by the whales but it's not with algorand. I don't even think meme token would be affected by world cup. this meme token was just useless meme token.",

I am not even familiar with any of the projects on this list... I guess these coins could be pumped in the upcoming months, and maybe there can be some profit in buying them now, but that also can lead to a loss of money! Not sure how to say it, but following hypes is not something advisable... there can be some money in that, but in most cases, it's a road to nowhere.In the end, it's the world cup in soccer... it takes a lot of money to get involved. Except for crypto casinos that are sponsoring some teams (BC.Game is an official sponsor of Argentina), I am not sure if is there any other crypto service mentioned and connected with the world cup, Qatar paid that with hard cash probably.",

I also have some Fan tokens on binance and also I am interested and monitoring CHZ as one of the World Cup related tokens. when all coins are crashing as they are right now including Fan tokens, this is a great opportunity to start logging in and holding them until the world cup is over. Convinced that there will be a drastic price increase for Fan tokens when the world cup is held. choose your best fan token and hold it until it gives a profit.",

Such speculation is always used by the token community and attracts listeners thereby automatically increasing the volume of purchases, but there are already people ready to make a quick profit.However, from the names of the tokens above, there is a correlation when they become world cup sponsors. With various speculations could potentially increase, But not completely sure it will 100% pump up significantly. If you have some research it will be good enough and stick to what makes you feel confident about going to the moon.",
