      "body": "If you want that kind of power you would in most cases also get a specific contract with your power supplying company. You can't just simply hook up your miners with a standard household contract. In this contract it would also be specified that they deliver up to X amount of MW to your location and at what price. In some cases it could be that it is not getting cheaper the more energy you need. Maybe the infrastructure can only provide a specific amount at low cost.",

One of the place in U.S which is Texas has some of the lowest kilowatt hour prices in America. But in terms of transformer they used, I had no idea what it is?",

But they also have a rising anger about mining operations, because of the high power draw and also the loud noises that come form mining facilities. So you should also consider that you may be not extremely welcome if you want to build a large operation.",

Only fools would ban this wealth creation activity, compared to other industries it is far more clean.",

Assuming the location can be serviced with such amount of power.Apart from just getting the transformer from the power company he can also do well to get into an agreement with an electricity company (they could set up every requirement needed) on how much power they could supply to hi. It could be on a cost effective rate based on their MOU.",
