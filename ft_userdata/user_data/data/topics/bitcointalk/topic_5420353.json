      "body": "There's no reason why unlocking solana should lead to the crash of bitcoin, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I know you are implying that FTX is the backer and owns a large amount of Sol but that doesn't mean it will affect bitcoin as well. Most likely they will dump sol to save FTT and their own exchange and that will be Sol's death. What we should care about today is the CPI will be released tonight and not other events, the CPI will decide the Fed's interest rate this December, it will determine the year-end trend of the market.",

Central Lake’s exchanges are too opaque and do too much evil. Although SBF says it takes responsibility, how will he take responsibility for so much money and users? The most is to sell us again.",

      "body": "Whenever a project faced a bug or problem that causes it's whole blockchain to shut down they always fix the issue and it will never repeat itself again which makes sense if a new project wants to grow..Bit it's a different case with Solana, the same old bug keeps repeating itself and it never got fixed, I used to ask myself how this project is still alive after so many failures but now it looks like I get my answer.Even if Solana goes all the way down to 1$ I am not buying, cheap transaction fee isn't the case anymore, many new projects have this already",

But I believe that bitcoin's value will drop a lot in the future, and I also believe that it won't drop below 10k$ each. In my analysis and understanding of that matter, the bottom price of bitcoin can be around 10k$-13k$, and this is also what some experts in the crypto industry said.All I can say is that this bear market that is our future is an opportunity to buy potential cryptos that can give us a good income.",

And to be honest, I'm not able to follow Solana's news regarding this unlocked or something. In any case, the market is already at the edge and maybe another negative news, it will plunge the market again.But as you have said, perfect, another good time to rebuy and to DCA until such time we enter into a bull run.",

Not sure about that. Bitcoin market still holding even though it has its weekly lows. Im sure that there are some time it will recover. But in the case of solana, possibly that it could short huge since the private tokens were gonna release and assume that Sam has tokens on it including and since they needed cash for the payments surely they will automatically sold their bag.",
