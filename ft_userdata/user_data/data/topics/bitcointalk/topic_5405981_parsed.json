  "content": "i am of the opinion that if you have been holding BTCitcoin for years and want to understand everything, then you should also try mining yourself and at best practice it yourself in order to understand all the interrelationships (hardware/software) in this topic that's why i have dared the first small steps with my usb antminer u2 at the beginning of this year and now I want to dare another bigger step and treat myself to a few GekkoScience compac f 200-400 gh/s to be able to operate them on the gekkoscience 7port usb hub - a rpi 4 with 8gb ram is also ready to go that's why i created this thread to maybe find some honest and trustworthy sellers who might be able to make me some good offers. preferred is the eu region to save any customs fees",
