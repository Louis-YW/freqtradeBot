I see no problem in the game itself, and I had fun when I ran my own one about two years ago. Regarding the participation of all members, deadsea33 could add the same rule I had back in the day. I gave Newbies and Jr. Members a 24-hour head start to play the game before other ranks could chip in. Doing it that way, they had more time to get some merits. Thinking back to when my game was active, I should have introduced an anti-cygan rule as well but never did.  Seeing that no one wants to guess, let me try just for this round since I got tagged in the OP and saw the game.2. _ _ l _ _ t   _ _ c _wallet hack4. _ _ l _   _ _ r _ _ _bull market",
