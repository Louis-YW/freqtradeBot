I expected more resistance from BATE Borisov but Konyaspor played perfectly. In the first match, although 10 people remained away, they scored 3 goals and they won. BATE Borisov was completely disbanded. Konyaspor played excellently in both matches.This is how Turkish teams played in second qualification round. They must pass the next round as well. We should see both teams in the group stage.",

Villarreal, West Ham, Basel, AZ Alkmaar and Fiorentina are the best teams right now and probably the biggest candidates for championship. Basel achieved to go next round winning against Northern Ireland team Crusaders. I will follow Başakşehir here as they can also surprise people with good squad.",

      "body": "What is interesting to me, when I look at all the results of the second qualifying round of this competition, are the surprisingly good results of the clubs from Malta and Cyprus and the disastrous results of the clubs from the countries of the former Yugoslavia.On Thursday, almost all the clubs from this area, which played, 11 or 12 clubs, were eliminated from the European competitions.In the past, clubs from the area of the former Yugoslavia won European competitions a few times and always played at least in the semi-finals or quarter-finals, but today they cannot beat rivals from countries like Malta and Cyprus, which tells me that their clubs and domestic leagues are less and less competitive in Europe, with the exception of Zvezda , Partizan and Dinamo.As for the competition itself, I am glad that UEFA started it. Even before 2000 we had 3 different club competitions in Europe and that turned out to be a very good decision.In this way, a chance is given to small clubs and countries to achieve some European success and earn some money.",

If you don't want to have a self-moderated thread for UEFA discussions then so be it and at least locked the other same thread with no replies or delete it if you can delete it.

Even though it was seven minutes extra time Vaduz closed down well and the match finished as draw. Konyaspor should've won this game but at least they got this draw in away game so next week they can pass Vaduz at home in Konya. There is a big quality difference between these two teams, Vaduz count themselves lucky to get this draw. I expect a very different game in Konya. Any score other than Konyaspor win would be very surprising.",

Other than that, the defeat of CSKA Sofia was a surprise and threw my coupon away. There were not much surprises and either the favorites won or the game ended as draw. Making choices accordingly in the second matches of the tour will make our job easier.For example Rapid Wien lost away but will win at home. CFR Cluj drew, they need to win too. Of course, what the odds will be is also important. We'll see that next week. I may stick to teams I know better.",

They conceded 2 goals in 3 minutes and closed the first half behind. They couldn't produce in attack and in the second half they gave a deficit in defense. They conceded 2 more goals. It was a great disgrace for Konyaspor to conceded 4 goals at home from a small team like Vaduz. Their defense wasn't that bad actually. It's hard to understand how this happened.From now on, only Başakşehir will be able to continue the tournament among Turkish teams. Fortunately, there is no problem in their match.

Furthermore all credit to to AZ Alkmaar player’s for the way they totally ripped apart Dundee Utd player’s, and now I feel that if they can maintain such good form then they’ll be one of the contenders to reach the semis at least.",
