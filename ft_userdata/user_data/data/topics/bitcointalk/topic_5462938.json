The cryptocurrency market is extremely volatile, and it is impossible to predict which trading or investing strategy will be most effective. It is better to select the one with the lowest risk and the ability to endure loss when it occurs. Loss is unavoidable in cryptocurrencies, especially when investing for the long term; how you control the risk of loss relies on the market strategy you choose.Quote from: Cuenta Alternativa on August 11, 2023, 04:23:09 PMAlso, with those strategies you are trying to time the market, when the best is time in the market with bitcoin. Buy a good lump sum and forget about it for a couple of cycles. Or do DCA if you have modest personal finances. This is without a doubt one of the finest strategies to manage big losses and maintain an upright mindset in the face of market turbulence. While not everyone can trade and earn, anyone can buy and hold for a cycle to reap the benefits later. This is guaranteed for bitcoin and not for any other coin.",

But when it comes to the Bitcoin market, you just need to know when the bears are here and when the bull will be back. That's all you need to know about Bitcoin investment. And if you are in Bitcoin trading, that's a different scenario. Depending on your trading style, you will need different approaches and strategies. Now that's a whole new story. But if you are into investment, buy low and HODL for a long time. That's all. Even if you buy in the middle, you will be in profit if you are able to Hodl for a long time. Try to avoid buying the top. Even if you are unable to do that, just hodl till it breaks the top too in the next bull run.",

      "body": "NO DOUBT, as these are the two most used method or techniques to master the BTC (only) because other than these most people prefer to do holding but even if it is about holding or trading, these two techniques will be used and I can not agree more on this. But, sometimes, even we do try to time the market, it can not be. Because we all know market is unpredictable and highly volatile. So, for one it is slight difficult. But, these techniques makes everything easy to some extent.For example, the DCA help us to cover the loss that we might are facing due to taking wrong entries at wrong time at wrong price. So, DCA will help us to decrease our loss. And in the same way smar trading or smart way, whatever you are calling it, is also a good strategy to long and short the trade in BTC. But, if we are here talking about smart trading (long and short). Then this includes, future trading and we all know for a newbie future trading becomes so difficult and loose necessary. So. i suggest we should avoid future trading if we are newbie and just started to invest in crypto/BTC.",

Thanks for the correction, edited and corrected my post.  Yeah, I agree that it is harder to implement this thing but if a trader happens to be familiar with the Bitcoin cycle, he can easily follow the pattern and take advantage of the knowledge of how the price fluctuates.  It indeed needs a lot of experience and exposure to the Bitcoin market but once learned, it will be very beneficial.  For beginners, it is a good thing we have this forum.  Even though there are lots of conflicting ideas, with proper filters and research, this newbie will be able to learn and adapt to the Bitcoin market.  I do hope they stumble on this forum so that they can be guided by our forums gurus and geniuses.",

Well said. Indeed, it's important to prioritize security when managing crypto assets.
