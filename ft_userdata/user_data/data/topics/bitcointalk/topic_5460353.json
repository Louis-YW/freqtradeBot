Indeed it is something which shows quite of an advancement in this industry but we, in this industry, have known such thing for years. It's biggest advantage over traditional gambling platforms is being safe from taxation given that withdrawals and deposits would be done through blockchain but other than that is exposing bigger risk. You are not only at risk for gambling but also with market price changes, therefore not all things are in a positive direction with web 3.0. Gas fees are sometimes high as well. With regards to privacy, KYC is also being implied to many crypto gambling site, so what's your take? Is it still a pro or not?",

However, do casinos take this into consideration?The reason I ask is because there are some Sportsbook or crypto casinos that have offered to advertise on my website. However, the majority of our readers have limited knowledge about this. They understand how to enable a VPN and how to send and receive BTC, but that's the extent of their knowledge, with exceptions on both ends of the spectrum. I am hesitant to advertise for casinos if it could potentially lead our readers into problematic situations.Of course, it's impossible to completely eliminate the risk of \"trouble\". However, I hope my point is clear?Thank you so much.",

They can even wait til there will be new developments like the metaverse which can also make gambling a hell of an experience.But I can't believe I opened that link. 5th is You gamble with mBTC, not BTC lol what does that mean?",

It will be easier for them to shift to gambling when they already learn how to use wallets and understand blockchain...I think you are right. If someone wishes to take the best from crypto gambling he needs to know a lot of stuff about blockchain, several chains... and there are many wallets around. All that looks simple to us here, but some of my close friends don't understand anything when I start talking about mining casino tokens by playing with some coin other than BTC. Quote from: Freedom4All on July 19, 2023, 05:43:45 PMWhen individuals engage in BTC casinos, they may encounter a message indicating that the games are not available in their country.I see that message in every crypto casino, Pragmatic is one of the providers I can't play in most crypto casinos... but there are a few where I can play it without VPN. I don't use VPN for a while, so I simply play games that are allowed for me... it's one of the reasons why I play in more than one casino.",

Well cryptocurrency is a new invention in the world which inculcated to the casino space. Sportbooks just accept cryptocurrencies recently into their systems. The process of depositing and withdrawal of cryptocurrency from gambling sites are always different from the normal Fiat Currencies. Because cryptocurrency uses blockchain while Fiat uses banks so they are of different categories.But really I have not gotten your message in the thread.",

I don't even get why you're doing this cause you're clearly advertising Nitrobetting which in our knowledge is a cryptocurrency gambling site yeah? And then instead of actually giving us the benefits and edge that your site has over other casinos you go here telling us about the history of cryptocurrency like you're some Ancient Aliens by History Channel spokesperson or something. Of course we already knew about this, of course we're aware of what crypto has gone through we're literally at the ground zero of it. If you're really out here hoping to sell your product I suggest you let us know about it sincerely and genuinely. Don't give us stuff like this.",

Any newbie to crypto gambling has to be aware of this danger especially if they are already the type that lack self-control with regards to the regular gambling. If you know that it will affect your ability to keep your bitcoins, then of course it is not compulsory to begin gambling with crypto, you can continue with the normal money that you use.",

While they don't want to take a risk from doing so, whenever the profit comes out from the people who tried, that's the catch that they don't want to miss because all they want is to have the same but do not want to take a risk.

Anonymity2. Ease of deposit/withdrawal options3. Lots of variety of gamesIm not saying that Fiat casinos doesnt have these things but nothing beats out even with that instant withdrawal thing on which you cant really be able to have on a fiat casino in most time specially if its really that withdrawn directly into your bank which it would be taking up some days.Unlike that we do have on crypto that it would really be instant. The only cons i do see on this is on the time that the company or owner would be tending to ran their users fundsthen there's no chance for it to be getting it back due to that anonymity thing which it is really that also one of the cons specially if the casinoisnt that regulated but well its a matter of personal choice in the end of the day.",

So before using them it is very important to read first the terms or the TOS so that you will understand it clearly from the start.

And besides gambling has always been a thing, even in the pandemic gamblers only kept going up instead of going down. While I do acknowledge that crypto gambling is something good, it's mostly because it uses crypto so really, its a discussion that should be about crypto and not gambling (since as I said, it's alway s been a thing).Additionally, crypto sportsbooks/casinos also have issues with KYC since they basically almost do the same thing as any other traditional sportsbooks, especially in recent times. Even if crypto can be used as a method for (pseudo) anonymity, most casinos bypass that by asking for KYC itself at registration or at first withdrawal.",
