      "body": "hello friend, Your account just got registered last year, IMO, and from my observation, I think you still need some time in the forum to establish yourself. Some months ago, I asked a question about trust ratings (here), and from the reply I got, trust is earned when you make a successful business deal with someone in the forum, or maybe you offer a service, and the person that receives the service thinks you are worthy of trust because the deal was handled as expected.Also, mate, there is a difference between being a reputable forum member and getting trustworthy feedback. You can be a reputable member in this forum without having any green time; it all depends on how long you have been here and how well you provide quality replies to threads and not just spam. A few weeks after I registered my account, I also felt it was good to have that kind of gree tage because only a few people I saw then had it, but now I don't feel it's in any way special; I just aspire to be a reputable forum member now.",

      "body": "There has to be a reason why someone can trust you by sending you green tag or including you on their trust list. Mostly green tags because you actually manage to make seamless transactions with forum users, be it trading or whatever makes them believe you can be trusted. Some users send positive tags because of contributions, it's like you sent to 5 different users according to your profile.Make some successful trades with forum user, I think you will get it sooner or later. But even if you do, you may not be able to be trusted forever even if you have made successful trades before. I mean, it just depends on how good and honest you stay in the forum after that.",
