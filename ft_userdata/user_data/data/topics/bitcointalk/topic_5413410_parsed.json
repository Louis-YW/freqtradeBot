The price of the order insurance is specified by the customer when creating an application for additional insurance. For example, in the case of ordering the delivery of a bouquet of flowers with insurance of $5, an amount of $5 will be deducted from the courier's account for the duration of the order, after completing this order, the courier will return it $5 and our commission for the completed order will be deducted 10% of the delivery amountWe do not create bitcoin wallets for couriers, we do not store them. Bitcoin is used as a way to deposit money into our system, to insure parcels. Now we are creating a FAQ for a better explanation of how the Bringa courier service worksI see Churkin account recently woke up, and one more issue I noticed is that domain is registered from Russia, so I would be very careful with thisI took a short break after our last project development (I publish all my startups here) and have now returned to give community something new and get feedback from the communityThe system is completely secure and I think it's easy to check.I will wait for more feedback, and will be back soon with an interesting update",

They don't mention any thresholds in their Courier FAQ page and since they talk about flexible schedules, it wouldn't make sense having such limitations. The work isn't flexible if you need to respect certain working hours. You work when it's ok for you. The company takes a 10% commission from each delivery.",
