  "content": "I think that maybe this question might have repeated over time but still I was Saying that I have seen that when we loose almost 50% of our portfolio in loss than we get nervous and we don't know what to do. As we work hard and make our lives better but we end up loosing our money. So I think these cloud be main symptoms. And these are listed below as these are according to me. 1. First things is that we want all in all to cover our losses in just one bet. 2. We use leverage that is more than enough to blow account in matter of minutes and that is very bad.3. We don't know what to do.4. We get addicted to gambling and that is bad.5. We become frustrated and some people end up loosing their lives cause they don't have any choice. By the way don't Roast me ðŸ™‚ðŸ˜œ",

There is no such thing, if there is maybe 1% and the 99% are gamblers who always lose playing games. Remember that all types of casino apps online are programmed to only consume the money of gamblers, that's the truth.So when you are addicted to gambling, this is a big problem for you as a gambler because it will be difficult for you to get rid of it for sure.",

You will just be nervous if losing certain percentage of your bankroll whenever you are playing a bankroll that is too huge for you.Quote from: Maxre on April 03, 2023, 12:00:58 PMSo I think these cloud be main symptoms. And these are listed below as these are according to me. To summarize those symptoms. You can simply watch for yourself if you are already betting in uncontrollable manner. I always stop playing whenever Iâ€™m already betting more than twice of my original bet when I start betting. Increasing the original bet amount to an insane amount is already a clear sign that you are losing your self control.",

Virtually every gambler loses a large sum of money and it is good when with this kind of experience comes responsibility and understanding that gambling can only be done with money that would not be sorry to lose. If a gambler does not learn any lessons from the losses, then he had better stay away from gambling, because gambling will bring him only frustration (of course, if he does not turn out to be the lucky one who will win a big score).",

Players who focus on winning alone could get disappointed along the line and make wrong decisions when they fail to win. Other attributes to losing in gambling include failure to study the game and not knowing when to stop gambling. Before gambling a player should dedicate time; 1-3 hours to gamble, and once the time elapse they can stop gambling and do other things. It'll help the player to take their stakes serious having in mind that they have a limited time to play, even if a playing is winning with good discipline they'll stop once the time elapse and play the next time. This also allows a gambler enough time to think over the game and also study different strategies that worked during the previous game.",

      "body": "People get lost in the process of gambling because they don't know when to stop and when to continue. You see, it is necessary to have discipline and self-control in gambling because if you don't, you'll eventually go overboard and chase winnings after winnings because of the profit or chase winnings after losses to get even and earn back the funds you've lost. If you become obsessive in playing to the point where you no longer can distinguish what you have to do, then it's a clear sign that you are slowly getting lost and being consumed by your desire to gamble whatever the motivation behind it is. Betting what more than you can afford to lose and going beyond your boundaries such as money allocation for gambling and time spent in gambling are mostly the first signs. in this case, you can still redeem yourself by removing the bad habits and talking to a professional for help to avoid being addicted as time pass by.",

When you lose at gambling, it would be better if you stop it regardless of how much the loss is because if it continues, it is emotion and greed that will haunt you, which will only make matters worse.There is still tomorrow and we don't need to rush for it because thinking calmly is actually one way to stop losing. When you gamble and do points one and two it's not worth it because the goal is no longer to have fun but more to take revenge for previous defeats and this is what will lead you to a greater brink of loss.",
