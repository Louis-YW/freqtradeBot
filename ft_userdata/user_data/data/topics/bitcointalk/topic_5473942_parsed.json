[NEW]Entertainment zone: A place to talk about movies, video games, cricket and stuff. 5g is penetrating in India, cod-m was a huge success, warzone mobile is approaching, we could have gaming tournaments, who knows? Winnings paid in crypto  [Rename] Altcoin Announcements in hindi: Bounty translations posted here Deals and Offers zone INR: similar to desidime, a place to interact about deals and offers going around in India [Stay] Mining [Stay] Marketplace [Remove] Regional languages: let's stick with one language for entire board (ie. English)[Remove] Press and News: imo, whatever is posted here can be discussed in default board [Stay] Off-topic: whatever doesn't fit elsewhere can be posted here. [Remove] Buyer and seller reputation - topics posted there are complete haywire of what that board was intended for. Let's have few boards, easy to track, more discussion will be there. Right now, there doesn't seem to any structure here whatsoever.",

Hope that does not become a problem.Ah I dunno how that would be a problem, whoever takes work of hindi translation, he should post it in that board. Or if you misquoted the regional language point, then I'd say let's not divide further. I think most people can do English, and there are plenty tools online to get native language translated to English. It's easier for reader to understand, and feel like part of discussion even if translation may not be proper.",

I would have loved it if Altcoin ANNs were announced in English, everyone would be happy. But we have some users who have been translating and we need to keep that alive including the Regional languages translations.Translation jobs are pretty much in demand in the forum and those who are participating in them should be allowed to continue their avenue of making money.",

Winnings paid in crypto  I think this comes under off topic and we can discuss it there.I think entertainment world is huge, and everyone is living for it these days. it deserves it's own section. Off-topic has that aura that useless posts go there, so I don't think so, even wc cricket discussion is posted in default board, if it was posted in off-topic section, I think it would be having less visibility. I don't remember checking off-topic last time myself. QuoteQuote[Rename] Altcoin Announcements in hindi: Bounty translations posted here This should remain the same and ANN threads in English should be posted here.We could have Announcements as main board where users can post anything altcoin related and they should be in English while this sub (Altcoin announcenents in hindi) specifically for translations, or may be we could post regional language translations, hindi and every other language available, so sub name should be like, \"Regional language translations\". Latter sounds better to me now, but users should only be allowed to post in their language there only, rest of board English. QuoteQuoteDeals and Offers zone INR: similar to desidime, a place to interact about deals and offers going around in India Interesting idea but do we really have a lot to discuss about offers so that we can have a separate child board ?I'm sure there are plenty, and Indians love offers. QuoteQuote[Remove] Regional languages: let's stick with one language for entire board (ie. English)I think this should be there and further more it should have child boards forb altcoins ANN and off topic.So that people can post ANN threads in regional languages and discuss off topic posts in their languages.I have said above comment replying TheUltraElite why I want one language for entire board, I don't want to part of sub where I feel like an alien. QuoteQuote[Remove] Buyer and seller reputation - topics posted there are complete haywire of what that board was intended for. I think this should be renamed to Scam Accusations instead.I don't know what that sub is for if I'm being honest but I'm pretty sure topics there are irrelevant. People may not know about crypto but some of above sections will help them familiar with the forum,I think that should be our first goal to make this sub lively.",

But to make the section more lively, we need more users to come in, hopefully the contests will help draw attention and the uptick in the local board activity should make an impact.",
