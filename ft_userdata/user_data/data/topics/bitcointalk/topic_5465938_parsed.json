      "body": "Japan's choice to release treated water from the Fukushima plant into the sea stirred up a lot of debate. They say it's safe and meets global standards, but some UN experts aren't convinced. They worry about the potential impact on the Pacific region. The UN can make recommendations, but it doesn't have the power to force Japan to change its decision. They can only issue recommendations, resolutions or sanctions, but they cannot compel states to comply with them.",

It's legal but it's also a concern from my country because we're just down from their map. There's a lot of argument about it but they've said that it's been treated but it's still nuclear waste for sure there are substances that remain unremoved. UN stepping in is like what we're seeing in the movies and despite that they're playing an essential role to the nations and concerns like this, it seems that no one will stop them and it's already on the go. They're like dumping the waste into the sea waters a little by little but it's a total of 1 million metric tons radioactive waste but said to be treated already.",

      "body": "Japan Dumps Nuclear Waste Into Sea Before Fukushima nuclear power plant leaks, enormous amount of waste spills into ocean As a result, no animals were born in the sea for several years, let alone fish. This is a terrible nuclear accident of the century.We can see that Japan is playing with nuclear waste, but there are many other developed countries in the world who are dumping nuclear waste into the ocean in various ways, but we don't see any action against them.How to take action because those leading the world are throwing these wastes into the ocean, it is not harming them because they have the means to protect themselves from it, but the countries that are close to the ocean are poor States are the most vulnerable, with a wide range of diseases spreading and natural biodiversity being severely damaged, resulting in major damage to the planet that is likely to occur in the future Those who come will suffer, and the world already knows how terrible nuclear waste is Therefore, the United Nations should initiate a major negotiation process to counter this and question whether Japan can be dumped elsewhere, particularly with respect to the return of their nuclear waste If not, Japan will have to take the resulting damages.Japan says the clean water from the nuclear plan is not releasing any nuclear waste, but it should be avoided because many experts say it has dangerous consequences Nuclear waste is coming out the role of the UN is ridiculous Japan does not take any action they continue their activities independently who are the permanent state of the UN policymaker they are silent So how is it possible to take any action against Japan, so everyone should come forward to protect the world ahead and help the littoral states so that they are not harmed.The nuclear waste that Japan is dumping into the sea is definitely illegal, not only Japan, not only the developed world, many countries are dumping this waste into the sea, it is definitely illegal, and the UN is only recommending against it and sit back and watch the joke Also, what can the UN do because the people who control it have good relations with Japan, so no country says anything against Japan because if they talk, their secrets will also be leaked.Finally, many laws have been passed regarding nuclear waste, none of which are effective Then we will be saved from this danger and every state will be aware of nuclear ban and make measures against it by making laws through convention.",

You did not include a link to your topic, so searched for it. I found out that this news is not new and is even more than two years old.Japan to dump wastewater from Fukushima nuclear disaster in the oceanThey claim that the wastewater is being treated and they will spend two years in treating it before releasing it out and will cause no harm to the environment, but we surely cannot trust that they are saying the truth or really know the truth and the long-term effect it will have. I think that there will surely be consequences in some ways.",

The people who would get a disease that would be treated by radiation, wouldn't even get the disease any longer.Doctors and governments who back them just might see a reduction in profits if there aren't as many sick people any longer.",

      "body": "Japan discharged nuclear waste into the sea after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. The accident resulted in a large amount of radioactive water that needed to be stored and managed. The decision to discharge the treated water into the sea was apparently based on the belief that it had been sufficiently treated to meet safety standards. As far as I can see the United Nations do not have direct regulatory authority over these matters. The International Atomic Energy Agency which is an independent UN agency provides guidance & recommendations on nuclear safety. The decision to discharge the water was made by the Japanese government taking into account technical assessments and consultations with international experts.",

Anyways...Also, radiation in water is not like putting fluorine in tap water so people is less likely to get cavities, otherwise people would add uranium ore into their water and drink it to treat their tumors.You should seriously watch some actual medical videos on introduction to nuclear medicine and what are the mechanisms which are supposed to be used against malignant cells.I have got the impression you have a bunch on misconception on what even cancer is and how it is supposed to be treated.",

To sum it up, i think it is legal to discharge nuclear wastes to the sea or ocean. I think that's even some of the best practices so far, if and only if, the necessary safety precautions and the guidelines provided by agencies like the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) are met. In the case of Japan, who's a member state of IAEA, the organization issued an approval to the plans to allow Japan release its tons of treated nuclear wastes to the ocean. Since IAEA is an autonomous organization created within the United Nation system, it is enough reasons to show why UN didn't stop the move.The organization stated that it took them two years to assess the plan before giving the approval since it has met the international safety standards.
