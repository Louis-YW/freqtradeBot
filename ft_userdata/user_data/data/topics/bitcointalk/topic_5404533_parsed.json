Will you count an address that was holding a few tron as active users as well?  I remember when this blockchain has claimed to be the one who have so many transactions in the network but the fact that if the price was going decline and it's not the same like another blockchain which was having good traffic. I have learned a lot of how many users in the blockchain didn't matter if mostly of these users were passive.",

You cannot just leave TRON behind especially with their current teams. They can use this news as a tool to prove themselves and make a good comeback in the market again.

On the same day, TRON Mainnet celebrated its 4-year anniversary since network independence.  This is just useless news. How exactly did they end up concluding that there were over 100 Million users on their network?For example, I do have almost a dozen tron accounts which I created back in the day when I was checking out the network, but I stopped using them a long time ago when I realized that tron is just another centralized POS shitcoin. And then there are spambots that keep sending useless tokens over the network to make it appear as if the network is so busy.I believe each of the \"accounts\" were counted as each user on the network... lol.",
