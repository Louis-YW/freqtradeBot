Do you mean if someone asked the mixer where somebody's deposit goes? I think mixer and exchange have different priorities. An exchange, most of the time, needs government approval if they want to continue their business, so they don't have the incentive to keep their user's privacy. Mixers on the other hand value privacy more, although most of the time verifying them is hard. At the very least, I can see them simply closing down and opening a new one if the owner believes he can do it.Relying on one or two services is also not a good idea IMO. If privacy is your goal then just use a coin that was designed around that. Or, mine your own coins if you really want them. CMIIW.",

Since the seizing won't stop and they're likely going to go through with other mixing services in the near future and will take them down, I guess this is the safest choice if you want to keep yourself anonymous from any transactions that you do and that's just to use privacy coins. But just as these mixing services, there have been reports that local exchanges have been instructed to delist privacy coins for the same concerns that they've got against the mixing services. It's even scarier if soon the law enforcement themselves will create a trap in the form of a mixing service and will track down users that have trusted it.",
