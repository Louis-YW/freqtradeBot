  "content": "Hello. I am not a crypto trader or something similar. I only want to send money to my forex broker and it allow capital wallet for payment. I will be using USDT (because I will use it as a payment vehicle and it is stable). What is the best method to purchase USDT via Mercury Bank in USA (I will also have debit card and can make also make wire payment). Which service do you advise me to purchase USDT? My Binance account is for Turkey and I did not see email or support of Binance. Which service can I use other than Binance?",

Do you need to make an account there and deposit funds? or you're paying for a service that uses Capitalwallet as a payment processor?Now regarding your second question. If you're from Turkey, you can just make an account on OKX, and buy using your card.

According to your involvement I guess capitalwallet is not trustworthy. They work like this: Broker shows me ther USDT account number linked to them - I deposit USDT to that account. There is no need to open an account as far as I know (Because it shows me a spesific USDT address). Does not matter where I purchase USDT from - it is what I know. With account I mean USDT address.",

I haven't tried them myself so I could definitely be wrong, but it's just the way that the user was promoting them.But the way you described this whole process sounds like the service you want to deposit funds to, is just using Capital wallet as a payment processor so I don't think you would have any issues in that case (if you trust this broker you're referring to)",
