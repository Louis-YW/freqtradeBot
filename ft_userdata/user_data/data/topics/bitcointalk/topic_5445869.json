I suggest you to create a video where you show an example usage of the website.Finally, I have seen people selling goods on the open web using bitcoin and lightning. In fact, I have bought from them multiple times. Why did you choose to put it on the deep web where it is much more difficult to find?",

My app is hosted on umbrel and I don't know how I can deploy it to clearnet which I admit would be most ideal. I promote this marketplace through my social media but I haven't done any full-length video.",

You need to send the watches to a third party to verify that they are original and not imitated or a high-quality copy, or the user is forced to disclose some personal data.Shipping requires some personal data, or is your market available for all kinds of watches, and then the processes of returning watches and making transfers may require a long time for shipping, checking, and making sure that they are original.",

I have some questions about your project.Why do you use TOR? there is no reason to hide a legit service and is no sense to use tor if the buyer has to give their real address to get the watch. And another point is, if I pay for a watch on your site, how I know that I will not get scammed? i mean maybe I get a fake Rolex.I mean, a service like this is a high risk for the customers and from my point of view, there is a high risk on the customer side to lose their money.",

Also, definitely should post some watches on there for sale, even if it's just something cheap, just to get the site flowing. Then, we can see what a product page looks like, see that people are actually listing things for sale, etc. If you don't even list a watch for sale, my first thought would be \"Why would I sell on this site if the founder himself doesn't?\" And again, it doesn't have to be a super nice watch or anything, just something that helps fill the space. Most forums start the same way, it's pretty much just the founder talking to himself for the first 6 months with 200 different accounts, and Airbnb started with the guys listing their own apartments for rent. I'm sure a Google search would verify this, but I'd bet the founders of Uber were driving their cars in the early days as well.",

I only have one watch in my personal collection but I might just buy some more to resell there. I also might add others items for sale as one other commenter let me know that site might be too niche for it to scale. Thanks for your input.",

Why did you choose to put it on the deep web where it is much more difficult to find?Probably to sell more than just watches, I mean that's the only thing that really matters when you are setting up shop in the dark web right? I mean there's the fact that OP's basically just selling watches then why sell them at the part of the web that's difficult for a normal Internet user to access? So the only conclusion to this is either there's something more going on that OP let's on or OP is an edgy high school script kiddie that wants to look cool for his friends because he's got a website in the deep web.",
