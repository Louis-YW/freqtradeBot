      "body": "So I just did some basic search because I'm also curious about this. I'll use the US price for the panel installation. It seems like you need to pay around $13K on average to install a 6kw solar panel. Since you need to buy a miner too, you probably need to spend another $3k at least to buy a 100+ TH/s miner, something like S19. That means your cost on average is around $16k. If you use the calculator shared by Bitmaxz to calculate this, you'll need around 2 years to break even. This assumes the difficulty decrease by 7 percent each month, the BTC price stays the same, your panel doesn't break, your miner doesn't break, you constantly mine at 110TH/s, and so on. Do calculate on your own though, since there are a lot of assumptions here and I'm probably wrong about some things (the rig choice, price projection, etc).Here's the ref link that I use to find the data for the calculations:Code:https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/calculatorhttps://news.energysage.com/5kw-solar-systems-compare-prices-installers/https://modernize.com/solar/panel-cost-calculator",

Electricity costs, room temperature levels and other supporting tools also need to be considered in the process of mining, mining power will not be maximized if you don't have the power of tools as a support.QuoteBuy a BTC at 16k and wait, if BTC goes back to 59-69k again then you will have enough to build yourself a mining farm with solar panels.

If financial strength is sufficient, it may be true as you say, Asic is a tool that can be used in mining, but there are many other tools that can help people to mine, most people who mine individually and independently have difficulty meeting targets from mining results, let alone talk about the number of mining tools we have and the timeframe for producing bitcoins.Mining power is largely determined by the quality and number of tools used, when the capabilities of the machines we have are not balanced, then mining will produce little value.",

But my suggestion to you, is don't get into that if you don't have enough knowledge about bitcoin mining.The OP had realized that buying Bitcoin is financially better option for him.So much depends on the power company and if you can grid tie at fair offset rates.Our largest field for mining does 280kwatts. we burn 60 and offset 220. We do 5-6 hours a day yeah days last 19-15 hours in New Jersey but first 2 and last 2 hours are lower. So it comes to 5-6 hours depending on season.So 5.5 year round. thus 5.5 x 230 = 1210 offset.and 24-5.5 = 18.5 x 60 = 1110 pay back when it is \"dark\" So we gain 1265-1110 = 155¬† kwatts a day. this means¬† mining the gear is negative cost of 155 kwatts which is squared up on April of each year. The warehouse complex use other power so that 155 is spent.this was an 800,000 build with a 27% tax credit from Feds first year. so 800,000x.73 = 584,000¬† after 1 year.and state of NJ offers addition credits¬† of 10% so 584,000-80,000= 504,000 after first year.you still get the 10% from NJ for 9 more years so 80,000 x 6 = 480,000 . thus in year 7¬† 504,000- 480,000 = 24,000 on the loan.This does not count the mining this does not count interest on the loan for the build. they are close to the same. unless there is a bull run.So by year 7. the loan is done to 24,000 you still have 3 NJ credits coming for a grand total 240,000 over 3 years.The gear is insured and warrantied.But this is small scale commercial and it is good for NJ, USA as NJ has good programs for solar.",
