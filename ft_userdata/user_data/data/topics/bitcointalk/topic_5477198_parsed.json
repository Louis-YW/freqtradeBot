Are we going to witness price correction or bear market now ?

But what triggers this massive increased that we are seeing right now that everyone thinks that we are in a bull run is obviously the news about Spot Bitcoin ETF approval. We haven't heard or seen this in the previous years that's why December right looks very bullish.As for the price correction who knows, the real test is that what will happen after the block halving next year in April? Will we see the pattern repeat again in 2024, that this is going to be huge rally and then seeing the price in 2025 to be at the 6 digits? For me this is a big possibility and that the pattern will not break. I think there was a discussion about this, they call it super-cycle like 2 big cycles that is going to happen before all time high, but I disagree to that theory.",

What happened last 2017 was a legend, as everyone did not expect that bitcoin will suddenly reach an all time high and those who have taken advantage of the bull season might have gained life changing profits and have been living comfortable lives these days. My point is, everything will still be possible with the current position of bitcoin. Who knows actually, as bitcoin is really positive these days and it's not impossible if we can see an early ATH since there are also no negative news that affect the market.However, there are also chances that we will see the opposite from 2017. The market is so much unpredictable. We can see bitcoin on the top these days, but after tomorrow, I guess we will witness another price then.",

Maybe this is just new for us because of the effects of the supposedly SEC imminent approval of Spot ETF and so everyone FOMO this last quarter of the year.So I'm not seeing a major price correction that will trigger bear market for this month. Maybe just some minor decline, but I think the bulls are going to push the price to as close as $45k to $50k target this December. Which means the bullish sentiments of investors are at a high right now.",

I am more confident that this time there will be a difference with what happened in 2017 in Bitcoin even though I also haven't thought about the ATH that will happen directly this month because it is more unlikely that it will happen.And for the increase in altcoins that is now starting to be seen, this is only because there is still the effect of the increase in the price of Bitcoin, causing the urge to buy more in some of the better cryptocurrencies after many people saw Bitcoin starting to increase its price this month.",

At least having these kind of charts will really be telling us that there's really a significant pattern but there are people who dont believe on patterns on which it is true because no one really knows on what would happen ahead whether it would really be following on the same path or not. Thing here is that we are going near with the halving event and it is really just that there are people who are really that being too positive on the things that we've been doing specially on accumulating on the coins that we are believing that it would really be shooting up its pricewhen bull run hits. Although it is really just that too early considering it would be on 2024 Q4 - 2025 the rest of it then it is really that too far off. For me then im waiting for the last dump or correction into the market on which i have been that trying out to save up some USDT for me to be able to get in when that time comes. If ever there's that last dump then it would be an advantage for me, but if there's none then for sure you would really be losing that bull run train again.",

      "body": "There are some reasons why I doubt the 2017 trend will be different; Bitcoin was much cheaper at that time than it is now -- $900-$20,000 -- so it was easy for the coin to have an enormous pump all at once. When the last bull run started, it took a long time to pump and many corrections before it reached its peak. A difference from 2017 is that this started before the halving took place. I feel the trend this time is likely going to be like the 2021 with similar regular correction while it climb and no one will be able to know when we get to the peak for weeks untill the dip hard",

I feel even if the price of Bitcoin goes through correction still it can pump back right after the Halving which is a positive sign this time as Halving is happening after the mini bull we could call it for the period we are going through right now. I guess any correction if it may occur should be considered as great opportunity for accumulating before the halving for post halving expected bull run.",

People could speculate, but be careful to use the speculation as it might not be what would eventually happen. You can see what happened already, it's a gradual deviation from what people expected, who knows if what would happen afterwards will be a deviation as well?Regardless, with my technical chart studies, Bitcoin is bullish and the bullish trend is strong at this phase, therefore extreme caution is needed for the Bears, and if possible, the Bears should just go and sleep for now. Otherwise, the bearish movements might be either fake or negligible to earn them any tangible amount of success. Mind you, December is going gradually and almost half is gone, we should endeavour to only sell when we see the 1D and 1W charts confirming the bearish pattern altogether, especially when there has not been at least two consecutive daily and at least weekly close of the candlestick.Above all, follow your chart, charts don't lie if you use them correctly.",

If you compare Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â these days, Bitcoin has lesser volatility which can't hurt the price so much if there were huge selling pressure.Support/Demand Zones: This an area or levels where small investors and institutions are likely to buy.
