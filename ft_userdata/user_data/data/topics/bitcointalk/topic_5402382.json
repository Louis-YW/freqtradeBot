      "body": "Electrum wallet will have to sychronize with the blockchain and needs internet connection. Even if you use Electrum server and run your own node, you will still have to make use of internet connection (like while connecting to Tor) to run your own node. You can not access your coin received without internet connection.But for only receiving, you do not have to connect, internet connection is not necessary, if the sender send the coin already, you can even check that on blockchain explorer without connecting your wallet online. But you can not spend unless you have active internet connection.Advice, to make your private key remain offlineYou can setup a cold storage and watch-only wallet, you can setup airgapped wallet only and make use of blockchain explorer only if you are not spending from the cold storage wallet anytime soon (use Tor for the blockchain explorer tracking). Or, you can buy a reputed hardware wallet.",

But assuming someone called me that he has sent me bitcoin to a known address, and I am not with my Electrum wallet at the time, I can easily just use Tor to anonymize my connection on one of the blockchain explorers to check if he has truly sent the coin. So, to check if the transaction is successful, Electrum is not necessarily needed to connect online. But I get your point, you are right.",

      "body": "Quote from: KaKeKi on June 13, 2022, 09:21:47 AMIs it possible to receive funds (BTC) via an Electrum standard wallet without using an internet connection?Absolutely. The receiving address or wallet does not need to be connected to the internet in order to receive coins.Quote from: KaKeKi on June 13, 2022, 09:21:47 AMWould you please advise about the pros and cons of such an option?It depends on how you have set up your wallet. If your Electrum wallet is on your main computer and will connect to the internet when you open it up, then there are literally no pros or cons. Whether or not your wallet is connected or not at the time makes no difference to receiving coins or the security of your wallet. If, on the other hand, you are talking about setting up a cold storage Electrum wallet which is permanently airgapped (i.e. on a computer which has no internet connection and will never connect to the internet or other devices, ever) then the pro is much greater security with the cons being the requirement for a second computer and it taking a bit longer to make transactions as you have to move them back and forth between your main computer and your airgapped computer.Quote from: KaKeKi on June 13, 2022, 09:21:47 AMWould you do it?Yes. A hot wallet (Electrum on your main computer with an internet connection) is not very secure. The extra time and cost involved in running a cold wallet (Electrum on an airgapped computer) is definitely worth it for the additional security.",

Create a \"watching-only\" wallet version of your offline Electrum, there, you can see the balance and transactions. The correct answer is you can't check and verify that you received a transaction without an internet connection. Let's not talk about Blockstream Satellite. Whether its a watch-only or a regular hot wallet, it needs to communicate and receive transaction info from the servers, so an internet connection is a must.",

Which venue is faster to authenticate and more reliable, to send someone your wallet address or several public addresses?It's not entirely clear what you are asking here. I think by public addresses you simply mean \"address\", and by wallet address you maybe mean \"master public key or zpub\".In general, if someone is trying to send you bitcoin, then it is better to send them a single unused address from your wallet. They can use that address to pay you as many times as they want. Alternatively, they can use that address to pay you once, and the next time they want to pay you you can give them another unused address from your wallet.Your master public key can be used to generate all the addresses in your wallet (but not spend any coins). If you give someone your master public key, then they will be able to see all the addresses in your wallet, which will include any payments you receive from other people or any transaction that you make. You will therefore have zero privacy.Neither is faster or more reliable - in both cases the coins will reach your wallet with the same speed and security.",
