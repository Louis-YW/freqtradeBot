  "content": "Bitcoin v0.1 released on Sun, 11 Jan 2009 10:22:14 -0800https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg10152.htmlQuoteSatoshi Nakamoto writes:> Announcing the first release of Bitcoin, a new electronic cash> system that uses a peer-to-peer network to prevent double-spending.> It's completely decentralized with no server or central authority.>> See bitcoin.org for screenshots.>> Download link:> http://downloads.sourceforge.net/bitcoin/bitcoin-0.1.0.rarCongratulations to Satoshi on this first alpha release.  I am lookingforward to trying it out.> Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins.  It'll be distributed> to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half> every 4 years.>> first 4 years: 10,500,000 coins> next 4 years: 5,250,000 coins> next 4 years: 2,625,000 coins> next 4 years: 1,312,500 coins> etc...It's interesting that the system can be configured to only allow acertain maximum number of coins ever to be generated. I guess theidea is that the amount of work needed to generate a new coin willbecome more difficult as time goes on.One immediate problem with any new currency is how to value it. Evenignoring the practical problem that virtually no one will accept itat first, there is still a difficulty in coming up with a reasonableargument in favor of a particular non-zero value for the coins.As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful andbecomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then thetotal value of the currency should be equal to the total value of allthe wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide householdwealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of computetime may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 millionto 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim,are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about...Hal---------------------------------------------------------------------The Cryptography Mailing ListUnsubscribe by sending \"unsubscribe cryptography\" to majord...@metzdowd.comSeveral hours till 15 years anniversary of Bitcoin v0.1.Bitcoin blockchain went far than the last row of next 4 years in the mail.Next cycle, it will be 8 years from that and there will be only 164062.5 more bitcoins in new supply.Controlled supplyBitcoin Equivalent Network TimeSatoshi Nakamoto was responsible for releases of Bitcoin Core v 0.1 till v 0.3.18 (links from Satoshi topics[/url]).v 0.3.18v 0.3.17v 0.3.15v 0.3.14v 0.3.13v 0.3.12v 0.3.11v 0.3.10v 0.3.9 rc1v 0.3.8.1v 0.3.8v 0.3.6v 0.3.3v 0.3.2.5v 0.3.2v 0.3.1v 0.3v 0.2From Bitcoin Core v 0.11.0, it's available therehttps://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/QuoteBitcoin Core 26.0Bitcoin Core 25.1Bitcoin Core 25.0Bitcoin Core 24.2Bitcoin Core 24.1Bitcoin Core 24.0.1Bitcoin Core 23.2Bitcoin Core 23.1Bitcoin Core 23.0Bitcoin Core 22.1Bitcoin Core 22.0Bitcoin Core 0.21.2Bitcoin Core 0.21.1Bitcoin Core 0.21.0Bitcoin Core 0.20.2Bitcoin Core 0.20.1Bitcoin Core 0.20.0Bitcoin Core 0.19.1Bitcoin Core 0.19.0.1Bitcoin Core 0.18.1Bitcoin Core 0.18.0Bitcoin Core 0.17.1Bitcoin Core 0.17.0.1Bitcoin Core 0.17.0Bitcoin Core 0.16.3Bitcoin Core 0.16.2Bitcoin Core 0.16.1Bitcoin Core 0.16.0Bitcoin Core 0.15.2Bitcoin Core 0.15.1Bitcoin Core 0.15.0.1Bitcoin Core 0.15.0Bitcoin Core 0.14.3Bitcoin Core 0.14.2Bitcoin Core 0.14.1Bitcoin Core 0.14.0Bitcoin Core 0.13.2Bitcoin Core 0.13.1Bitcoin Core 0.13.0Bitcoin Core 0.12.1Bitcoin Core 0.12.0Bitcoin Core 0.11.2Bitcoin Core 0.11.1Bitcoin Core 0.11.0",
