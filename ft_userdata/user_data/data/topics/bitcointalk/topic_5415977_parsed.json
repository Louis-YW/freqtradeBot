      "body": "I'd advise comparing prices between sage deposit boxes and self storage (self storage is probably about as secure - especially if you're using a passphrase stored elsewhere or multisig between multiple places - attacking them is also less lucrative as safe deposit boxes mostly have things that are expensive to everyone and self storage often just has things the renter won't want to replace).Additionally, in case you're weary of where you've placed everything, they might be faster to access too. The security likely also depends on you not telling anyone who knows enough about you where they might be too.",

I see less of a problem with the latter than the former.If you have a lot of capital and only one house I think the best solution for you would be a multi signature wallet where you need 2 private keys out of 3 to be able to manage funds. 1 is held by the company but with that key alone they can't do anything. Another key you have at home, and the other in a safe at the bank. If you have a second home, instead of leaving one of the keys in a safe at the bank, you leave it in the second home.",

I actually remember no less than the popular Bitcoin preacher, Andreas Antonopoulos, admitting that one of his backups is safely stored in a bank safe. To me, this is indeed an option. After all, robbing a bank is much harder to do than robbing a house without a single security staff.But forget about owning a couple of houses just so that you could safely keep your backup in another house. Each house is as vulnerable. So that's ridiculous. Not to mention the cost of building that other house. That's more absurd than keeping your wealth in Bitcoin but storing the private keys in a bank's safe.",

Natural disaster, robbery don't understand that word. Whether it is kept in the bank or at home, the priority is to keep it safe, I don't see what decentralization got to do with that, it is not that they will open to see what is inside.

Banks not as secure as people think. They may look like they are secure but there is a big flaw which people fail to see. Banks will always do what they are told by the government. If the government comes up with a law to seize the money of everybody, the bank will have to comply.",

My uncle has a bank deposit box for 40 years almost and lets me use it as well as he only stores some documents in there. He lives 15 minutes away and his bank is in my city which makes it very convenient for me to access it. You only need to a key and visit the bank to opening hours and you can access your deposit box. It's kind of like a the deposit boxes and the train station only with more security. So far I haven't heard that there was any heist on vault deposit boxes in a bank in my city, they seems fairly secure. Not sure how much they cost though, my uncle had all his business accounts at the bank and I am sure they gave him the deposit box very cheap. It really comes down to how much money you have invested in cryptos and if this extra layer of security is worth it.",

The best choice is to secure the private keys in one or more places, because even if one is lost the second one will help. Even with the bank's secret vault service there is high risk. That means, we agree to the terms and conditions in which if the secret vault gets into any accidental loss then the bank won't be responsible for the vault holdings.",

If it's related to crypto funds, you don't trust anyone with it even if they're a known service and reputable one. One of the main reasons and good reasons why we own crypto is because we're holding our own money and there's no need for any third party to hold it for us. Having that said, if you're trusting others to keep your hardware wallet that has your funds inside, you're endagering your funds with it and not just it but also your life.",

I certainly wouldn't trust a safe in a bank with my private keys because, well, an employee can just read it and take the money, and then it'll be basically impossible to prove it's the bank's fault and especially find out who did it. Also, that would mean needing to go to a bank to access funds, which IMO is very inconvenient. So private keys should be stored somewhere at home. As for the physical device, I still feel like there's no need for a bank safe and that it's safe at home if you find a good place for it.",

Perhaps the biggest irony in everything is that Bitcoin exists, and many do not understand what its advantages are compared to fiat.",
