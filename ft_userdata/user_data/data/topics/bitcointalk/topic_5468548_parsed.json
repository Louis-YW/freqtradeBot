  "content": "Sup folks! Yesterday when I woke up i was gonna pay a bill so I started my bank app on the phone but when I did I got this message on my screen. (I put picture in the bottom)I only had two options, to delete the Exodus app if i wanted to continue using the bank app or close the bank app (that of course won't work, I need to pay my bills.  )I been using Exodus for a couple of years and never had this issue before, I tried to restart the phone several times same thing came up.Have anyone else had the same exp before? It's strange that it's just happens after a year of using the app, and the app is also downloaded from Google Play. Maybe Exodus have some issue at the moment with their Android App? Or it could be some issue with my phone. Or my phone got some shit inside it, witch I highly doubt since I never share anything or download any shit at any time, never.But it was a bit strange and a little bit nervous to see the warning message first, I wonder why it arrived there? How can a app get infected just like that.  First I thinking that my wallet was hacked, but all the bitcoin was still there. If you using Exodus on your wallet, I recommend you to check if you have any similar issues.Anyway! The most important thing was that no bitcoin was missing, but anyway I instantly moved the bitcoin I had there to another wallet and deleted the app, then I tried to install it again and everything was back to normal, but I did not reset that wallet, I created a new one....And yes I know that a cold wallet is the best option, but been 100% without a hot wallet is impossible for me.This thread should not be about what wallet is the best and safest, just about this particular problem at Exodus (or my phone).Sorry for bad English and other stuff, I am not from a native English speaking country so I did my best.",

Are the results still the same?If you are still unsure about this wallet, then use another wallet that is more recommended.",

Like me for instance there maybe some app I will download and immediately my antivirus moves them or remove it from my system automatically, what I does most time is to switch it off and get those app installed before turning them on. From what I sense on your issues seems like your wallet needed to be updated but you didn't update it at the required time so it has to malfunction for you to update it but you didn't instead was to uninstall it, well it's fine now since you said it's working very fine now.",

Transfer your funds first to more safe platform temporarily for the Binance or your hard wallet or even in the hot wallets other than that so you can clean it up first. Dont ignore just simple warning its preventive measures better than higher risk of loss.",

If yes, try to add another well known one and see if the banking app gives you an error on that one too.Also, at least here in the US Exodus was updated on Sep 25, 2023 so it's possible they changed something and that your bank does not like what they did.-Dave",

If you continue to report errors, it is likely that the Exodus application is having problems and you should contact the developer directly to get the most accurate answer. By the way, checking for updates to the latest version of Exodus is something you should also not ignore. As long as your bitcoins are safe, I don't see anything serious here.",

So I'm not sure what's going on with it, as a replacement I would prefer you to use the Trust wallet but as you are quite experienced it should not be your choice, For that, I'll recommend using the Electrum Wallet. I think OKX or Kucoin one of them provides the Custodial wallet as well you can take a look there.Hmm, that's also highly possible there can be a bug in your banking app, so testing it first can be an option rather than changing the wallet. I saw a topic a few days ago that never merry a project so it's better to implement it here as well never mery a wallet, especially Hot Wallet.Hmm, In the end, I think this topic doesn't belong to Bitcoin Discussion.",
