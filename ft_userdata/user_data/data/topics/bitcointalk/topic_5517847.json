      "body": "Almost every crypto currency has a base unit for calculation. It's mostly common for those with high value. The point is to be able to calculate easily with it when dealing with small fractions just to avoid too many decimal zeros. Take bitcoin fees for example, it's  measured in sats/vbyte because it's more convenient to say 3 sats/ vbytes than to say 0.000000003 BTC/vbyte.There are a couple of other units bitcoin is measured in the most common ones are:  Satoshis( sats) which approximately , 100 million SATs = 1BTCmili BTC (mBtc) 1000 mBtc is simply 1BTCOther units like ( micro BTC, nano BTC, picto BTC and many others) you may find in different articles are just simple 4th grade conversions.",

NOTE100,000,000 satoshis (sats) are in one Bitcoin. Which also means that one satoshi represents 0.00000001 BTC, technically, making it the smallest possible unit of bitcoin.",

I can't see that happening in the future because i'm not from the future, and i don't think any of us here comes from the future either. We are in the present, and i want to believe that we've all been enjoying the past few days. The only thing we can all certainly guranatee is that bitcoin will continue to grow. We are currently waiting to see bitcoin hit $100K(maybe in the next few weeks if possible), but thinking about $100M that can give us a $1 equivalent when compared to its least unit(1 sats) is very far from my imagination.Edited:I'm not saying that it's impossible, but believe me when i say that it's going to take yearsss..., with some 50/50 doubt of possibility.",

      "body": "In my opinion, the max number of bitcoins was set too low.The problem is that if Bitcoin gains worldwide adoption, then the value of a satoshi will be high enough such that fractions of a satoshi would be necessary for everyday trade, but Bitcoin does not support that. Imagine that there are no fractions of a dollar and everything must be priced in whole dollars.Now, this problem has occurred in the past and people found ways around it. For example, the term \"pieces of eight\" comes from the fact that the old Spanish dollar could be physically split into 8 pieces, giving rise to $0.25 being referred to as \"2 bits\" in the U.S. and the cheer, \"two bits, four bits, six bits, a dollar, ...\".It has been stated that fractional satoshis can be implemented in Bitcoin with a soft fork, so I guess that will be the solution. Or maybe fractional satoshis in Lightning and other protocols will be sufficient.Regardless, the easy solution would have been to increase the max number of bitcoins by a factor of 1000 or so (up to 92 billion), but that ship has sailed.Also, this has nothing to do with the value compared to other currencies because their values trend to 0, and they will be irrelevant in the end.",

If this is the case then we may still not need to do anything about it.",

The price traded today shows how important it is to own Bitcoin in the future, now almost most retail investors are starting to pay attention to Bitcoin because the potential for price increases is very large. The uniqueness of Bitcoin which can be divided into small units (Satoshi) makes it very easy for anyone to have it, the increase in greater adoption will be more widespread in the future, the price will slowly increase, although we never know when 1 Satoshi is worth $1, but the direction towards it has already begun.",

In that sense, we could eventually see 1 satoshi equating to a dollar or even more.

Bitcoin is not just an asset that's known for it increase in value overtime. Apart from that, Bitcoin is designed to serve as a potential payment option for users accross the world  which literally means that Bitcoin has the ability of performing the same kind of role fiat performs most expecially relating to it usage as a medium of payment.It is because of these that we have smaller units of Bitcoin that's known as the Satoshi which makes it easier to quantify Bitcoin in smaller units. Maybe because of the way a lot of people are currently investing in Bitcoin and holding it rather than trading it the narrative might have changed a little but the fact is that, for the transactional usage of Bitcoin, the sats still serves as the a good and considerable unit.",
