Nigeria has less financial systems supporting businesses and our bad road, insecurity and power supply, has affected our productivity in the likes of getting farm produce or raw materials and this has been a discouragement to foreign investors while South Korea does not lack in any of this lack of proper education, corruption and bad government has been among the major decline of our economy while in South Korea education has a really high standard and the corruption there is not like ours while the government are still alot better than ours. QuestionWill the increase of the value of naira makes the country ore stable or except this problem is solved our will continue to devaluate?",

Just as in economics that the higher the demand in a commodity, the higher the price as well, our dependency on foreign products is too much because inasmuch as we give more values to things imported into our country, the more we are giving that country's currency to gain strength over our own currency. It is important for us to value things we produce in our country rather than always importing things from foreigners, even if our products ain't in the best standards but we can reason together and find a way to make them better and of good quality. We need to reduce our high rate of importation instead we should export more of our products abroad.[/list][/list]",

The transportation people go first increase there price And then market people go join and before you know everything don top price. We know say the difference between dollar and naira done de too big and e seriously de affect goods when we de bring come from the outside country but if we really wan de truthful to ourselves we go know say apart from petroleum product when in the real sense na we de export am, we no really de import small small items when d average man de use that much from outside we country. Wetin de even vex me na the way local producers de make things expensive for the country but when de carry the same goods comot from this country them go reduce price for those people. Our problem just plenty and most of them na we de take bring am on ourselves.We no even get much of this local companies, even the ones when de in existence done already turn the business to a monopolistic one and e de very difficult for small startup to enter into business so when these monopolistic companies decide to increase price, we no get choice that much than to just flow along with them.I believe say no be to just focus on the problems we de face be the main thing na how to take solve am na him we suppose de reason.Personally I think say if we put more effort into producing more of our local goods by ourselves, we no go too de depend on good from outside country and this also go reduce the price of goods for the country. Enough emphasis too need to be placed for the agricultural sector so we fit produce more food know say na other things wey we no fit produce we go de import.Our schools also need to change the kind of things dem de put for there curriculum. E go make sense Make we really identify wetin be our problem and make sure say we train the younger ones on how to take tackle this problem, you go see say we go begin experience serious positive change for we countryE de pain me to know say we de import things when we get the ability to produce on a very serious note. I know wan de reason go the part when we de export crude come de import petrol. God go help us",

The curriculum is not the main issue, in fact the curriculum is still working fine, the main issue here is theFrequent strike, lack of proper amenities for research, hike of school fees, exam malpractice and corruption.There have been various reasons aside ASUU why most schools go from strike lately while this year in some federal and state university students have been on riot all because of the school fee hike.We can say we are taught the theoretical aspects in Nigeria universities and it becomes worst when your course of study is more of practical than theory like those studying biochemistry, microbiology, chemistry and other highly practical courses. The course outside Nigeria are highly respected but in here they have little or no value even most studying didn't choose these courses they where transferred to it and they continued with the mentality of make I just get bsc and then start a business or do something else while those who are able to further will be grateful to God if they can study outside the country because even if you get PhD in these fields your knowledge will still be vague simply because of inadequate research facilities.Exam malpractice and corruption has been the worst in academic, malpractice in common entrance (primary 6 exam), malpractice in junior waec(JSS3 exam ), malpractice in SSCE (waec and neco), malpractice in jamb and post utme and then malpractice and blocking till they graduate or to end the hassle someone can just go buy a certificate from the school. Imagine someone who did graduate like this what does he/she has to offer the society.  Funny how we criticise governments on buying results when we do such that also.those not meriting a course will be given admission even with their low grades simply because of connection the ones with the cut off mark will be turned down is part of what affect the education system in Nigeria",

This is a great point right here. In Nigeria we import almost everything. Let me start with the obvious. We have refineries in Nigeria but we import our fuel. In fact if you have ever thought about using a locally-made item you are seeing as a poor person. There is a sort of classism wheat importation. What I mean to say here is that you are considered a rich person if you have an imported item in your possession. Made-in-nigeria goods are seen as inferior and substandard so instead of the government to patronize innoson vehicles, Nord vehicles they prefer to import Toyota and all the foreign companies. We have more goods coming into the country and empty containers leaving the country. These and many more leads to a weak naira",

Intact naira devaluation na di effect of all dis things dem wey una mention so, because e no de gree me comprehend why we be oil producing country, wey even get excess to de export to oda countries, still we de import di finished products wey be fuel. Because our refineries don turn to artifacts for museum, wey im only usefulness na to de view am, instead of am to de refine products optimally. I believe say corruption follow do us for Nigeria, dat na why refineries, power sector, local manufacturing no fit work, because if e work, di corrupt officials dem no go see opportunity embezzle money again.So if dem kill of minimize corruption in high places for Nigeria, hopefully di naira, go gradually de gain strength again, because if people wey dey for government go make our refineries to work, power sector to work, create enabling environment for investors, encourage local manufacturing and so on,  di economy go de beta.",

I don't know whoever brought up that idea to devalue our local currency but trust me the idea was the wrong one. However if you want to build a strong currency, we will need to increase our export to gain more Forex into our economy and also to increase the productivity and to expand our economic hub. Like Peter Obi will say, we need to move from consumption to production, that is the only way we will give our local currency value.",

Imagine a politician who is elected into public office prefers to choose his allies and loyalist as his cabinet members leaving behind people that are intelligent to give him right opinion on how to govern the people and profer solutions to problems. This mentality has really aided in taking us backwards over the years because inasmuch as you employ or appoint incompetent personal to take charge of some government functions you will find it real difficult to manage the affairs of government because the way you reason may not be the way they reason, they have nothing to offer. We should know that appointing people that are not competent just because they are our loyalist will rather cause us more harm than good. We should say no to favoritism or nepotism as trying to please people who are either our friends or relatives can jeopardize ones reputation and integrity because since they are your friends and relatives, some certain decisions you would have taken on them when they do wrong, you may not be able to take it again due to the fact that they're people that are close to you.Again what baffles me in this country is that as soon as their is an increase in the price of a goods or commodity, you see the price of every other thing increases. This has also been a major problem we have is this country. Imagine when fuel price increases, both traders, transportation, services and other things increases after everybody will start pointing fingers on the government, I don't know if government is the one selling your garri for you. I want us to understand that you and I are the government, so we should be more focused on things that will bring about positivity to our environment rather than be involved in things that will disintegrate us because at this hard time we all need each other to make things right is this country as there is a saying that \"a tree cannot make a forest\" so our leaders can't do it on their own without you and I being involved so the growth of any country begins from her citizens so we should be more focused on things that will unite us.",

Isn't it ridiculous to say that python swallowed government money like I don't even know if this people have conscience at all.

A country that was once swimming in economic growth now is struggling in the international market. Isn't it shameful that we have someone as the director general of the world trade organization yet we ain't making any progress in our dear country.Government that is suppose to serve in the interest of their citizens are now taking decisions on their own without considering the effects on the masses, all they know is embezzling government funds in the form of projects, awarding contracts to incompetent personnel. Not rendering good and quality service to the public, our schools, health centers are in dilapidated situation. No quality industries and factories that will aid the youths in gaining employment. The rate of unemployment is on the increase, so many jobless graduate on the streets. Tell me why people will not get involved in crime and fraudulent activities in other to eran a living. Until we rise up and look for a solution to this lingering economic crisis, the better for us because if we still continue in this nature, then am afraid the rate of crimes will be on a high note. Instead of the country seeking for disintegration I rather prefer resource control, let all state manage their resources and give revenue to the federal government, let the states be autonomous as these will bring government and other benefits closer to the people",

Most of the product here are being sent outside the country for little touches or refining and when they bring it back here they wiill increase the price of the goods yet we will still buy them. The thing that hurts me the most is that we dont value our produce. We see it as lesser products and those imported outside the country are the Original product. This alone has made some local manufacturing industries to shutdowns after they have lost the zeal since they are not patronized. We have our local rice and i herd its very tasty but how many of us do eat it lest be sincere?Once we start appreciating what God has gifted us with then we that is when we start seeing it as something valuable and make good use of it to the country's advantage.",

Dem need to learn from the dollar saga, fuel wahala and do things right. If dem do the necessary things the economy go stable and the Naira go rise without the government having to manipulation the price.

E get people wey dey our government wey dey benefit seriously from all this things wey you don mention, even the value of naira sef I no sure say dem go ever gree am rise because dem plenty wey dey benefit from devaluation of the Naira so if naira add value dem go loose for their business days why dem no go gree to push for the price of naira to go up at all instead dem go just allow am to fall dey go.If you dey talk about to import and export especially when e concern technology, e go hard before dem go wan stop am or say dem go wan reconsider am, because most of our big men dem na dia business be dat, na dem be major share holders, one good example na for generator business, e get wan gen dem dey call MIkANO the biggest share holder na Nigerian, and him na politician so dem no go gree make we get light because e go spoil market for dem. So many others dey too, I think dis our government jus need overhauling if not na so we go dey complain dey go. Naira devaluation na least of our problem, if all dis tinz dey fixed naira go get strength automatically but if not them go only temporarily give naira strength after which e go fall again.",

When a country has net importation than the exportation, what they have at the end of the year is trade deficit and that is what is happening in Nigeria. You see south Korea, as of last year they exported about $683.9 billion of items and the reason why people are buying there products is because there products are cheap, look at Samsung phones and other product, the electronic circuits and many more are been produced and exported to other countries at cheaper prices, there product are affordable and that is why their currency is lower and hence a stable economy.As for Nigeria, we have lower exportation of $5.3 billion in total, now do the math with South Korea that has about $683.9 billion, isn't that a shame to us as country. Now, let us compare the population of Nigeria, we are roughly worth more than 200 million people in Nigeria where by South Korea are just about 52 million. With quarter of Nigeria population in South Korea, they produce and export more than Nigeria and you there compare our currency to them, no they are way ahead of Nigeria in this comparison QuoteCommodity imported to Nigeria is greater than the commodity exported out of Nigeria and this has caused inflation in our country, our focuses has been more on exporting oil which is affected by the Russian war, the price of oil is volatile while south Korea focuses on exporting technologies like electronics, machines and others. Nigeria has less financial systems supporting businesses and our bad road, insecurity and power supply, has affected our productivity in the likes of getting farm produce or raw materials and this has been a discouragement to foreign investors while South Korea does not lack in any of this lack of proper education, corruption and bad government has been among the major decline of our economy while in South Korea education has a really high standard and the corruption there is not like ours while the government are still alot better than ours. Nigeria have a lot of work to do, all the sector need to be fix, the power sector need to increase so that industrialization can strive better, road need to be fixed, pipe line security need to improve because the rate at which this vandalizers steal crude oil is alarming and it is affecting our throughput, they need to improve agricultural farming, they need to fix everything because all sectors in Nigeria is not properly. If we can fix all this problems, exportation will increase.QuoteQuestionWill the increase of the value of naira makes the country ore stable or except this problem is solved our will continue to devaluate? One of the mistake past government has done is not allowing price regulations to be effective, on a norms Nigeria local produce are suppose to be cheaper so that it will compete with international products, increasing local production will also reduce importation if the products are up to standard because just imagine other countries are running after Nigeria products, that will make the country better but local goods are even expensive than imported items, I hope you seen the problem?Whatever any measure the central bank want to use to fix the stability of Naira, if they don't fix these problems, we will have this problems till another government comes into power.",
