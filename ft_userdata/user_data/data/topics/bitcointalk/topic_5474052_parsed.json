  "content": "Hi, I'm a graphic designer who has been working on an NFT project for the past year. However, I recently found myself in significant debt and don't have the time to continue working on the project or handle the programming aspect. Instead, I'm considering selling my designs.The concept was creating a playable trading card game in the style of Yu-Gi-Oh. The project includes 113 hand-drawn characters and back - front card designs in my unique style, featuring 100 human cards (60 men, 40 women), 9 vampire cards, 3 wolf cards, and 1 alien card. I've also designed a logo, banner, landing page and additional characters for future social media ads. All drawings are made with krita, Logo with Ä°llustrator, Cards with Photoshop. All source files are available in the stated Formats.The main idea was to create a TCG, Sell these Cards in packs with a specific chance distribution based on supply.Here is an example of the front and back of my Cards:https://i.ibb.co/Lvv0SYZ/backside.pnghttps://i.ibb.co/Ht2Pcth/Adolphus.png",
