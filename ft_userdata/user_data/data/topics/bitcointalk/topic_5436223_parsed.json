If talking about altcoins, I will only invest in ETH and BNB, in addition to ADA, DOT, ATOMâ€¦ I really don't appreciate and don't necessarily invest in too many altcoins, too risky for our portfolio. You should focus mainly on bitcoin instead of choosing altcoins, altcoins can offer bigger returns than bitcoin, but the risk is too high.",

I think there are a lots of difference between eth and dot but since dot has a newer technology, it has some disadvantage over eth since adoption has more seen on eth and we all knew that many have been there for eth since day 1.",

      "body": "Ethereum is already stable as one of the top projects in the crypto market. Even though this is an unpredictable market, we can say that at least for now that it's one of the strongest altcoins that you can have. I also hold ETH and I'm not telling good things just because I also own it. But that's based on the idea that I'm looking at it because it's visible. Very firm and remained in the top 2 for the whole market for a long time and we can't remove that fact. What I just don't like is when it has become a POS. Yeah, that might affect its fundamentals but market-wise, IMO a good option.",

And additional to that, if you are not yet aware, Gavid Wood (CEO of Parity before) steps down from its CEO position, but he is still part of Parity a blockchain infrastructure company which also focused on Polkadot/Substrate development.",

But it's a good idea to do your own research on which coin to choose. If I were you, I would still invest in Ethereum but also in PolkaDot because the price is still low. I feel the DOT could go up again, even though I don't know when that will happen.But again, that's just my opinion and you don't have to follow it if you have any doubts. Like my suggestion, you should look for more info about DOT because you already know how potential Ethereum is in the future.",

I personally don't see parachains that interesting that i would want to put any money on speculating the value.ETH on the other hand has the network effect, most talented developers working all sort of stuff in layer 2 solutions. It has lot to give in the future and i can see potential with it way more then most \"eth killers\". And i don't think most people see what kind of mountain they have to climb to be anything like eth is building. The code is a huge beast.",

ETH is growing and getting better as they slowly solve the issue of their network, while DOT is also making progress.

However, in the next bull run, we never heard about it, some of them didn't even went to a new all time high. And this could be the case of DOT though, as we go to the eventual bull run in 2024/2025, maybe those who have enjoyed a good run in 2021 might not replicated their success again, just saying. And this could include DOT and others altcoins.So it's better to stick to Ethereum, as a prime mover, you can never get wrong this this investment.Projections could be in the 5 digits in the next bull run.",

I also thought I will invest some of my money in MATIC after I invest in Ethereum but I think maybe someday MATIC will gain popularity like Ethereum. I don't like DOT much because of DOT.Â  I don't want to make any investment.

For the future of the two coins, ETH would still be at the top, but no one will say that DOT cannot compete because it has many great features compared to ETH. It's more scale-able, but if we are going to only look at the parameter at hand, the price of it, DOT would only be able to compete for a short time.",
