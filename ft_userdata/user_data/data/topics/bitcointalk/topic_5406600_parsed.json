  "content": "Before anything else, I would like to define Blackjack as a game of skill or skill-based gambling game.  Means we have more grasp on winnings the more skilled we are in this game.  With this I happen to read an article Titled: The Three Best Blackjack Betting Strategies.  I was somehow surprised when I see that Martingale betting strategy is one of the best betting strategies for Blackjack, I was kinda hesitant to believe it until I realized that BlackJack isn't a game of chance so it is sensible that Martingale Betting will give a better percentage in winning a gambling session.  Here is what the article explains about this strategy.QuoteMartingale Betting StrategyThe Martingale System is a negative-progression blackjack strategy rooted in the idea that you, in theory, will always win eventually. In this strategy, each time you lose, you double your bet. And before you leave us here, hang on. Successful play of this riskier strategy could pay off big.Here’s how it works. Say you started with a $5 bet and lost. You would then bet $10 on your next hand — and $20 on the next if you lost again. Eventually, after progressively making higher wagers, you are more likely to win, leaving you with a much higher payout than if you had bet a consistent amount.Caution: this approach is best reserved for high rollers though. In blackjack, it’s not uncommon to have a losing streak of ten or more hands in a row. Without a large bankroll, continually doubling your bet to that degree could leave you with a wounded wallet.I am still hesitant about this betting strategy but my rationality thinks it is possible, at least martingale on blackjack is way better than martingale on any luck/chance-based games. How about you what is your thought on Martingale betting strategy used on blackjack? Is it effective for this type of game?[1] https://kiowacasino.com/the-three-best-blackjack-betting-strategies/other references:https://upswingpoker.com/the-best-blackjack-betting-strategy-basic-explanation/https://www.casinoreports.ca/blackjack/best-blackjack-systems/",

Even with blackjack, if the player is lucky he'll get the right cards after shuffle as well as while making a draw. So, there are more luck factors that decides the winning/losing. This happens even when you play well with good skills and strategies.",

I did not see any argument in favor of the fact that the Martingale in Black Jack is in any way different from the Martingale in other gambling games.There is a simple rule: if you have a winning strategy, then it works without Martingale. If you have a \"winning\" strategy based on the Martingale, then you are deluded about its winningness and in the end you will lose all the money.",

This strategy should be almost exclusive to the professionals as it's application at a stage where you are not confident in your skill level to turn out an outcome favourable for you can mean a loss of your money even more than you could have predicted.

It could be blackjack based on skill but it is also more than based on luck upon dealing the cards. If you are not lucky enough it could be your cards will be in a bad situation --though you have enough skills on it, it is useless. All I can say perhaps OP was very lucky by getting the right card when it was shuffled and that is perhaps actually happened.So for me --that strategy will not work.",

It is still very much a game of chance though, the house will always have an edge, and no amount of skill or strategy will remove the house edge (unless you are able to card count, which is obviously impossible online or with a continuous shuffler as many casinos now use).Quote from: lionheart78 on July 17, 2022, 10:10:02 AMQuoteEventually, after progressively making higher wagers, you are more likely to win, leaving you with a much higher payout than if you had bet a consistent amount.This sentence is absolutely nonsense. You are no more likely to win after a streak of losses than you are to win on any other hand. This is the classic gambler's fallacy. And you never get a \"much higher payout\" on Martingale. All you ever get is break even plus your original bet, which in this example, will be $5. Doesn't matter if after 10 losing hands you are now betting $5,120 and you win $10,240. If you add up all your bets prior to that win they come out at $10,235, meaning you've just risked $10k to win 5 bucks. Quote from: lionheart78 on July 17, 2022, 10:10:02 AMIs it effective for this type of game?It's not effective for any type of game, but if you are going to use it, then all that matters is finding the game with the smallest house edge.

Honestly, I don't even think it matters that much, Martingale isn't a strategy even for actually profiting, it's just for breaking even at most imo.

You are NOT likely to win imo, chances always reset to 50/50, and as o_e_l_e_o said, the big win at the end would only ultimately cancel out the losses you needed to reach that win, it's not a profit that would be worth it imo.",

The main issue with Martingale is that it requires an extremely large bankroll.To illustrate this, consider our pervious example where $10 was the opening wager. In this situation you’d need to bet $640 as your opening stake after just six losing hands. This is obviously far beyond the finances of many players and the main reason why this betting strategy doesn’t really work in reality.Of course, I can conclude, if the Martingale system is in fact what I quoted, it means that the risk is greater and what many people say does not fully work the Martingale system, contrary to what we have heard so far.I might stick to my strategy as usual, if I'm playing blackjack and roulette.",

Also depends on the bank roll itself, obviously. So there's no perfect strategy as others say, really depends on how you are going to manage your bankroll. If you win base don this system then good, but it's not going to be like this always, sooner or later the house edge will caught up on you.",
