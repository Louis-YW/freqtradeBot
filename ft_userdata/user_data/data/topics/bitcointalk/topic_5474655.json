I don't know much about this altcoin in discussion, but if you've already made some profit from it, then you won't be at a total lose if you sale now.Altcoins are tricky and risky, it's like being on a titanic ship, you don't know if it'll hit an iceberg, because if it does, it'll sink with every assets in it. So it's better to exit when your mind tells you to, especially when you've made some profit in it.I wouldn't so much depend on the hype of new projects, I'll only buy into them if I feel like I'm up for the risks involved.",

And what's the possible price scenario before Christmas? Because I want to make good money before Christmas...The best way to get all that information about a token is to read through the road map of the token from the whitepaper from there you get insight on a lot of information such as the token supply,  stages of development and when they will enter the market so all this are covered in the whitepaper and this will cover you up as to how long you going to wait and what to expect from the token development per time. But also be aware that,  some fake projects can copy other people's whitepaper and taking their whitepaper to mean a blueprint of what to expect may also lead you to a whole load of disappointments so it best you try to also do some form of research also at some point beyond just the white paper. ,",

Most of the projects that have that name also with Bitcoin are just bunch of projects that made the pockets of the developers bigger but not their investors. So, if you're keeping that enthusiasm on this project and you think that you're projecting such value and whenever you want to sell, you do it. Because as long as you are seeing the price and value of it, make sure that you're aware of the consequences in investing into one. Not all projects that are named after bitcoin are going to be the same of what it is right now, mostly with the pricing.",

They only have some targets concerned about the bull run that is to come soon so while making your investment always be smart enough to sell when it seems to have to more positive move otherwise you could be left worthless tokens.",

Developers are free to copy the code of bitcoin as it is open protocol and create their own coins, which they have been doing. But coming to influence the people that a particular coin will behave like bitcoin will not attract the community. It is bitcoin or Altcoins, nothing like BTC-Altcoins sandwich.However, every coin has chances of growth this coming bull run.",
