This took place as a result of more cryptocurrency exchanges starting its service in India.2017 - During this time period RBI announced that virtual currencies weren't considered legal tender, because there happened a good increase in the usage of cryptocurrencies as it is the beginning days of Indian population moving towards digital payments.2018 - By the beginning of 2018 draft scheme was submitted for the ban of cryptocurrencies and this came with the banks stopping the cryptocurrency associated transactions. This caused a big fall in the trading volume on exchanges.2018 - End of the year #IndiaWantsCrypto became a trend. This campaign was started by the WazirX founder and during the month of July, 2021 the campaign crossed it's 1000 days. More Crypto enthusiasts joined the campaign during those days.

      "body": "Happy 75th Independence Day to India. I hope that at the age of 75th independence, India can become a better country and continue to develop. especially in economic sectors such as cryptocurrency regulations that must be clear and the imposition of taxes that are tailored to crypto holders. I believe India is able to make regulations that don't burden anyone, because the cryptocurrency platform allows for several innovations that support India for various sectors of the economy. cryptocurrency should not be banned because this is the future of good payments if managed properly and correctly.Once again Happy 75th Indian Independence Day.",

With the general population of the country climbing and its reputation as an industrial nation, the adoption of bitcoin as an official legal tender is definitely of age.

The poverty rate and hunger and crime rate will drop drastically because one can with digital access, mine, trade, and earn on the systems platforms. I do believe that if tax is imposed, it won't be as heavy as fiat. Happy 75th independence day great India.",

And hopefully India will become a more developed country and also a country with more cryptocurrency users next year.",

But that does not it change anything about the legality of crypto in India. I always like crypto adopting counties, India is one of them. Happy independence day to all Indians on this forum.",

This could've been celebrated as a prison release day. The country have wealth, manpower, diverse culture, and so many things that attract the outsiders. Maybe this is true with some people.Apart from this certain group of people have an understanding that if Brits haven't invaded India, we couldn't have developed ourselves good in education. Maybe I'm wrong, because not everyone accept this. Myself have heard it from old people, and many people say we've got better education system than theirs. I'm among the one who believe that education is good because of Brits.",

This relationship was both exploitational and beneficial as India became better at some things. There with the Brits expulsion, India felt what it was like to be sovereignt and independent wich makes the celebration valid at that point.With the focus of the thread centered on cryptocurrency, noting the phases of crypto developments in India. It could be drawn that a time would come when the notion of freedom just as a free IndiaÂ  we have today would be the case for crypto enthusiast in the nation. Independence is freedom and freedom is bitcoin.",
