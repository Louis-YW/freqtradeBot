  "content": "On reading through this thread made by ,rachael9385 I came across a puzzling statement that has left me wondering about the privacy of personal messages. In a response by Solosanz  it was mentioned  Quote from: Solosanz on August 16, 2023, 03:17:34 PMPersonal message is private and AFAIK only the administrators can view every users' personal message, since he's not an administrator, he can't scrap personal message. This statement raised several questions and prompted me to initiate this thread. I delved into some research and found a few older posts where moderators weighed in on the matter. According to a post by Quickseller Quote from: Quickseller on October 09, 2017, 04:37:58 AMAny administrator has the ability to read arbitrary PM's between users, even if they are not reported. It has been said this will not happen without the consent of at least one of the parties of a message, and I have not seen evidence that contradicts this.  I also came across another reply by hilariousandcoQuote from: hilariousandco on October 06, 2017, 08:28:26 AMNo, we can't directly read PMs, just ones that are reported directly to us. You can send your ref link if it's warranted, but if not and they report the message you'll be banned for unsolicited pm spamI don't think members have ever taught about this before which I why I decided to raise this thread. Although I recognize that the intention behind granting this access might be to counter spam and fraudulent behavior, I personally find the idea of reading other people's private messages invasive. PMs are meant to be personal, and it's troubling to think that anyone apart from the intended recipients or sender can access them.I know this thread might not make much of sence,  but I understand the need for this discussion and hope to hear from moderators or individuals who can shed light on this matter. (Please refrain from unnecessary responses.)",

      "body": "Being an administrator is different from being a moderator, and their access is also not the same.As your quoted moderator has already stated, Accessing the message is only possible when the person you send the message to reports it over to the moderators for any reason (scam or privacy violation). Reporting a message to the moderators will definitely give them a preview of the message reported so that they can pass a proper judgment on the matter.But on the side of the administrator, I think he has access to almost everything, unless this forum is not built that way. If not, administrators have access to whatever information they want. But this forum might be different since privacy is highly respected here on the forum, and the Admin is also too busy with other things to go through users personal messages.",

Because reasons is, i do not have anything personal to share on PMs that i should avoid to send. If i have to give some contact of me then i prefer to use TG and we all know how secure they are.But, few days back I had an encounter in my Local board where our board moderator Xalolex edited one of ours local member's post and i was stunned to see that but Xalolex is a nice and friendly moderator he edited the post to correct the mistake made by the member and he also gave whole clarification of the matter after asking. Because I got curious so I asked him/her and he replied politely i am really impressed.Well, coming back to the discussion, he said, yeah we have permission to read and modify user's posts but he did not mentioned any PMs details but i doubt that these moderators are given the access to PMs because PMs access is something personal and it would be in the hand of Administrator only which is Theymos and I do not know anyone else here who would have access to PMs.",

      "body": "Yes, the administrators can access anything on the forum because they have the access to everything. The administrator can read private messages between two users and he/she can also access those messages even if a user deletes those messages after the conversation. The administrator is the most powerful entity of a forum or site and he/she has access to all the permissions and functions of a site. The moderators might not have that many privileges and they may not be able to access the private messages on a forum, but that also depends on the structure of a forum if the admin of a forum decides to grant such permissions to moderators then they will also be able to access those private messages between two users. In most of the forums only admin is the central authority that can access or change anything in a forum without anyone's permissions while moderators may hold high privileges than other users, but still they have limited permissions as compare to an admin.I would still recommend you to avoid sending any messages that may violate the rules of the forum because sending of such messages isn't a good act and if admins may later found such messages then they may take strict actions against such users who violate the terms and conditions of the forum. There are some strict rules of this forum which every user has to follow despite of their status or activity level, and anyone if breaks those rules then those users may face hard times on this forum. But, if a user follows the rules and doesn't do anything that's against the rules of the forum then there won't be any problem for such users.",

What is there to discuss, really? No type of plain-text communication is actually created with privacy as a priority. Even if it were somehow technically impossible for the forum administrators to access private messages, there would still be a range of potential man-in-the-middle scenarios to worry about. Your local network administrator can intercept communication, as can your ISP, your VPN provider, CloudFlare, hosting provider, server administrators, ...
