What do you think we all know elon this might be another business Strategy right In the end all humans and including us in the forum must get used to every job being replaced by robots and especially in several countries this has been tried on several vital aspects that force humans to evolve with existing technological sophistication. I have no reference at this time regarding Elon Musk's move to try to sell platform X which initially had quite a large number of users and whether the bots he used to replace employees have become more effective or not.One thing I know about Elon Musk and he is one of the rare species because every time he makes noise in online media there is an impact and even his marketing skills are not in doubt. So let's see what references are trying to be issued at this time and why he dared to take such a big step that some people might think is an inappropriate step in doing business.",

Employees were supposed to take care of the stability of the platform (I did not notice any damage), filtering inappropriate content (I noticed an improvement). In my opinion, laying off 80% of employees is essential when taking over such a large corporation, because it usually turns out that they were spending most of their time in work by drinking coffee and there was no one to supervise it.One day in the life of twitter employee",

But what went wrong Twitter usage is really going down I think the app is more boring . What do you think we all know elon this might be another business Strategy right In a direct answer to your question about \"what mistakes did Musk make in Twitter?\" I can answer you simply: The biggest mistake Musk made after the platform purchase deal was that he appointed himself directly as its CEO. All the decisions that followed were because the owner of the platform imagined himself capable of running it despite his lack of the necessary experience. And if he really intends to sell the platform today, then this may be the wisest decision, confirming his inability to continue management without the necessary experience.",

But what went wrong This is part of the challenges of Twitter. Elon musk to me was hasty to try to cut down cost by laying off old hands whose wisdom and expertise was highly needed. He wanted to introduce himself as being capable to run social media with bot system just like his background of SpaceX and Tesla. So he needs to retrace the all business idea to make profit rather than the primary public interest of Twitter, before Elon musk Twitter was barely known with all the financial news around it. He needs to take a clue from Mark zugerberg on this.",

As it is now, many people writing there are doing so because they do not have a choice, Twitter desperately need a viable rival. Threads could have done this but Mark Zuckerberg did what people see as \"too cheap,\" it's nothing to me but forcing people to have an Instagram account before they can access the app made me uninstalled it from my gadget. I don't like people making things look like a compulsion for any reason.As for X, it might continue to fail as a microblogging app under the ownership of Musk, but it might be a good earning source for him if he eventually turns it into a financial app as intended.",

The platform is now boring and seemingly lacking the main purpose for which it was bought doesn't make for enough reason to sell. The billionaire has been known to be impulsive when it comes to his business and if one begins to question where he went wrong in his purchase of Twitter? For me it would be trying to think he can control public opinion and freedom of speech. The thing with most of these billionaires is that there's a certain peak they'd attain, they'd begin to view others as worthless. According to one of the reasons he said he bought Twitter for was to fix it. I'm sure he meant in a negative way because honestly Twitter has been struggling to be as interesting and free to use as when it was under Jack Dorsey",

Twitter Blue is a premium subscription service that offers features such as undo tweets, ad-free browsing, and custom emoji.On August 24, he tweeted that he is \"considering adding an edit button to Twitter\". This has been a highly requested feature by Twitter users for many years.On August 23, he tweeted that he is \"looking into\" ways to make Twitter more profitable.On August 22, he tweeted that he is \"excited\" about the future of Twitter.But I can't see what he said on Twitter because there are many Elon Musk accounts, and I can't determine which one he's really using. All I know is that he is doing everything to make Twitter apps transparent to the communities here.Maybe Elon thinks that when it becomes more transparent to people, he will be more embraced and trusted in this matter, so he thought of this style that he is planning. And if there is something that Hel did wrong, perhaps it was the subscription for every Twitter user, in my opinion.​",

      "body": "Twitter has become even more boring after being acquired by Elon Musk. I never imagined Elon Musk would dare to take a policy that seemed too forced, firing most of the employees and then replacing them with Bots was not a good idea. Bots are not able to think like humans, bots are just human-made robots that are no smarter than humans. The main thing that is the most boring in my opinion when the logo (Blue bird) which is very iconic with Twitter is replaced with the symbol or the letter \"X\", I feel there is something different with Twitter after the logo is changed.Major changes that occurred on Twitter to make user interest in Twitter began to decline. If Elon Musk doesn't try to restore Twitter to its pre-acquisition identity, then he will feel the failure of the strategy implemented. Elon Musk must not be selfish with the rights he has on Twitter, he must realize that without using Twitter he cannot develop. So, comfort and convenience must always be prioritized so that Twitter users increase. That's how to do business properly.",

Couldn't be just build a better company from scratch with such kind of money? Anyways now he owns that huge company that is only losing money for him and Zuckerberg is trying to build the new company. Firing a lot of staff, cutting down cost and trying to rebrand the company seems like the equity 101 on how to make a company profitable and sell it on. However, the big investors usually keep the companies 3-5 years to really turn them around and sell them. It takes time for the financial statements to reflect the new situation and also for growth projections to be improve. I don't think there is anybody interested in buying Twitter right now at a higher price than what Musk paid. He is probably stuck with it for quite some time.",

Also, his plan of not allowing users to block others would only discourage regular users to spend more average time logged in, nobody wants to use a social media where there is no control on what you want to see or ignore.",

He has dismantled large parts of what made Twitter great, because he overpaid for it without having a plan. He was a rich billionaire that used twitter to spread whatever ridiculous messages he had day to day. Sometimes they took moderation action that went against him and only by owning the platform could have make sure that would never happen again. He put an offer out there, not expecting for it to be accepted, but because he overvalued it so highly it was. At that point he took several steps to backpedal, but had no legal way to back out of the offer and would have been forced to buy it from that point on. So now he is stuck with a platform which is probably worth less than half what he paid in the last year and is just running random experiments on it at this point - like it's his personal project and not used as a valuable communication device around the world.",

For example investing in Twitter or memecoin which is often manipulated. There is no benefit whatsoever that we can get other than being a victim. We have to be aware from the start that if you are not a player with big money, don't go into the assets they hold. Regarding the workers who were fired and replaced by robots, don't you see that they have eliminated many jobs, maybe some are still unemployed because of their policies. Like it or not, Elon Musk doesn't care as long as he is still profitable and can control his desires, then we are just puppets.
