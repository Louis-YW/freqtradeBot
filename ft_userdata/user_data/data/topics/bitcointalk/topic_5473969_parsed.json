  "content": "Personally was going through some sales of mine in the past and the worth of the BTC I had spent few years back today. Thought about it, until I came across of a twitter influencer who also sold his products for bitcoin. And he mentioned he didn't hodl those bitcoin. But he worked strides ahead to build his business such that he'll hold every single bitcoin he made through sales. Same thing I linked to other people who sold products for bitcoin, many didn't hold their bitcoin. But, that's not the issue or problem. The question is what are the possible means of securing our businesses and at same time saving the bitcoin made through the services we render? Mainly I crafted out a new skill out of me that earns me local currency; fiat. Yet building a fresh business from scratch isn't easy, most often, I still use bitcoin to invest on the local online business. Still keep me yards back from achieving my goal of hodling bitcoin made through online business. Contribute your thoughts and personal experiences. As the influencer didn't elaborate how he made his possible.",

      "body": "For those that are accepting Bitcoin from their sold products, I think most of these merchants are using third party that automatically converts their Bitcoins into fiat. Easily, you've got the option if you want to accept them and convert instantly or you get to hold that if you can for the sake of your investment. There's the boundary between being a businessman and keeping your store rolling with the profits you're making from those sold products and as well as being an investor from holding Bitcoin. Most businessman knows about that thing. Or if it's the opposite, you sell something and you get paid in fiat, you're also free to use a portion of that profit that shall go and will be used for buying Bitcoin.",

      "body": "QuoteHow do you work toward hodling bitcoin?Quote from: Accardo on November 13, 2023, 08:13:36 PMThe question is what are the possible means of securing our businesses and at same time saving the bitcoin made through the services we render? For me, it's simple: working towards holding Bitcoin means you need to have another income source that you are earning from, and then you will have no need to spend your Bitcoin if not just to hold it. Second option is, while spending your Bitcoin, never spend everything, always learn to save some and hold tight unto it. Like the guy on the OP who said he sold his product for 14 BTC, meanwhile he could not just save up 1 or 0.5 Bitcoin out of the 14 he received as payment. There have been threads where OPs were asking what people would do if their salaries were paid in Bitcoin. The answer to that question is also simple. Perhaps, let's assume that Bitcoin has been accepted globally and salaries are paid in Bitcoin, the truth is that not everyone is going to save up their salary. We will still have the poor and the rich, those who will earn such a great salary in Bitcoin that they can satisfy all their bills and still have some Bitcoin to allocate to their safe (holding or portfolio). There are also the middle class and the poor who can receive a small salary in Bitcoin, and they will spend it all on all their needs.Based on the above points I have made, and to answer your question, for one to be able to hold his or her bitcoin, they need to have a budget for their spending and also have self-discipline to save. Because if you earn in Bitcoin or sell some products in exchange for Bitcoin, you definitely have needs to spend those Bitcoin on, but the ability for you to only spend some of the Bitcoin and save some for the future is what helps you hold the Bitcoin.I don't know if you get my point.For example, if you have a business and you accept payment only in Bitcoin, perhaps that business is your only source of income, which means you will feed from the profits you make on your business and you will still pay some bills from the profit you make in your business. For you to pay those bills and settle your needs, you have to sell some bitcoin. You cannot hold all the bitcoin you earn forever if your business is your only source of income and you depend on it for survival.Let me give another example. Imagine I am working for a company and my salary is $400 per month, which is normally paid in Bitcoin. From my salary, I have bills to pay and financial responsibility to handle, which can take up to about $390 worth of bitcoin. That means in that month, I am only able to save $10 worth of bitcoin of my salary for that month.The question is, what if my salary of $400 worth of Bitcoin is not even going to cover 50% of my needs for that months? That means I am going to spend all my salary and won't hold anything.So, the solution is that, while earning in Bitcoin, you need to cultivate the habit of saving some portion of your earnings and don't spend it all.If you are running a business and receiving payments in Bitcoin, and perhaps you are scared that the price of Bitcoin is too volatile, you can equally covert your Bitcoin to Fiat, but before you do so, make sure to keep some Bitcoin fraction that you wish to save in your portfolio. If you keep gathering in the ban, before you know it, you will have a full ban.",

Seeing as you spend more on your local business compared to Bitcoin, I reckon said business isn't mature enough to provide its own profits, generate a part of that for improvements, and generate another part for other investments. Nothing wrong with that imo, it just shows how young the business is. If you really wanted to push profits towards Bitcoin though, then you have to convert said service to a point where you can provide for it yourself alone without the need for external sources, say something like a graphic artist (at most, costs would be for programs/software used) Btw this considers bills and money for daily necessities already removed/paid for in the picture. I wouldn't recommend the latter though. The former may be more expensive now, but in the long run, it can be a method for passive profit without you needing to do anything. You only need to sit and wait for the money to come. Meanwhile you offering the service yourself without any external help can bring in more immediate profit but it only relies on you. So if you stop, there's nothing that would come in.",

I think this way is more logical for me than forcing to create a business and accept bitcoin paymentsIt's not a problem when you sell your product outside of your country, because you can accept and use Bitcoin for global payment. For example today, you have received a payment signature with Bitcoin even working in the Indonesia area, right? So with this situation, I think it's not a big problem so far, except if you sell your product on an online shop where you are restricted just use payment Rupiah. I have a friend who has been selling digital products since 4 years ago, he is fine today, not been banned even he only accepted payment PayPal and bitcoin. Because he sells in outside the country. but even if not accepted his local currency, he still pay tax after he exchange his bitcoin to local exchange. he can still contribute to his country.",

They can have that business because a few years ago, they benefited from the Bitcoin bull run and altcoin season. Some of those profits were used to create new businesses that are still running today and provide profits from fiat.Meanwhile, a small portion of the profit from the business is used to invest in Bitcoin until now. Oh yes, they made another big profit from Bitcoin's last ATH. They use these profits to expand their business and keep other profits as savings. Meanwhile, they can meet their daily needs from their profits and their business.From that, they can continue to invest in Bitcoin while they also have a business to generate fiat and meet their living needs. Some friends work in offices and companies. The salary they get every month exceeds their daily needs because they are very frugal and calculate every expense in detail. They do not disturb their Bitcoin investments because they have other sources of income. And some other friends are still trying to trade in crypto to make a profit. Some of them are successful in having daily, weekly and monthly income.From the stories of my friends, they are really lucky to be able to have their business, to be able to make big profits during the Bitcoin bull run and altcoin season, and to be able to grow their business from the profits they get from investing in Bitcoin and altcoins.

In my opinion, you can only take a small portion of the Bitcoin payment for you to save, while the larger portion is still used to develop the business and as your business grows, the opportunity to get more Bitcoin will become wider so that your Bitcoin savings will also increase. My guess is that you feel the need to save Bitcoin for future profits and that is true, but focusing on developing the business using existing income is the key to success in business.",
