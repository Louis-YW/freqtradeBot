      "body": "I'm a little confused on the site with what all the data means. The information as it currently is presented is unfortunately just not that clear. For example:Code:Signal Time :03:05Is this the time that this signal was first announced? What is the timezone? What is the colon before the 03? All the coins seem to have the same signal time, so I get the impression that the AI bot only updates once every hour or so? I take the position that any business in crypto is a good one, and I want you all to be successful. If you're able to take in a lot of data and crunch it well, then it would be a shame if all that work was held back by a confusing website, so I just wanted to put that feedback out there.",

      "body": "data are estimated on the basis of annual information. Our current version is alpha. We open transactions in the light of this information and publish them in the Experiments section. We can also give our signals instantaneously, but we noticed that the accuracy rate of instantaneous signals has decreased. That's why we continue to work on instant signals. However, the signals given can be long-term and valid. We also make profits using these signals. We continue to train our system day by day as data comes in so that you can benefit from it.Cryptodroid.ai is a website that provides cryptocurrency trading signals for its users. These signals are generated using complex algorithms and technical analysis to help traders make informed decisions about buying or selling cryptocurrencies.To keep users up-to-date with the latest signals, the website displays the time at which the most recent signal was generated, as well as the validity period of that signal. This information helps traders determine how current and reliable the signal is, and whether it is still relevant for their trading strategy.In summary, by providing the latest signal times and validity periods, Cryptodroid.ai aims to help cryptocurrency traders make more informed and successful trading decisions.Note: As a time zone, our system simply shows the signal times according to your time zone over the country where your ip is located. This is just 1 line of code.If you have noticed, the Greed / Fear index on our site shows differently from those on other sites. The reason for this is that our tilted data is based on volume and whale movements, giving you the opportunity to make more accurate decisions.Thank you for such feedback. You ensure that our system will be more stable in the future. I think you can try small budgets to test it. We are still testing.",

At the same time, you build on the rest of your business, but you can build a good following by being the #1 or #2 in a very niche space. It strikes me that perhaps the greed/fear index is a narrow, defined space where you can stand out while you continue to build your data set and refine the AI model.Think about it from the perspective of an outsider. The outsider only wants to use the AI site that has the most data and has a long, proven track record. With no history to your name, and just being honest here, but I would be skeptical to put my money behind your AI site when it hasn't proven itself yet. However, I am intrigued by a different way that the fear/greed metric is calculated. That really strikes me as an opportunity for you to focus on, something to make your #1 feature while you continue to build and expand your AI. Once a year has passed, your AI has been around for a year and has data, has undoubtedly been refined, and begins to become more trustworthy.I do some web design work and I'm in between projects right now. To add to my portfolio since a lot of my past projects are confidential, I'm looking to contribute to a few projects on a small scale basis. If you ever wanted to beef up the web design related to the greed/fear index, I'd be happy to volunteer my services at no cost, provided the work would take just a week or so. In exchange, I would want permission to add my designs/work on the site to my public portfolio.You'll also find that as you build a community, you'll come across many others here in the crypto space who are happy to volunteer in smaller, well-defined tasks.",

      "body": "As a matter of fact, our site is just a front-end consisting of simple html/css codes, but unfortunately the sites in the background do not appreciate it so complicated, that sharing every data can create negativities for this project. Our team (Economy / Algorithm) includes people who improve themselves academically. For this reason, we continue to develop as a closed group. We focus on improving the accuracy of our algorithms rather than visuality. To be more clear, as we said, I have mentioned the least basic areas for the Greed / Fear index. We include quite a lot of metrics outside of these areas. Actually, it was not a project built on signaling. Our idea here was to revolutionize the field of estimation of economic metrics. We are considering stopping member recruitment after a certain period of time. The reason for this is that we know that the signal system unfortunately affects the person-based trend. Therefore, our primary goal is to prove our thesis over control groups. As we have stated on our site, personal opinions and actions taken will be communicated to us, which will help us to develop this ability of foresight and foresight in different areas in the future.Thank you for your interest and support request.",

If you are someone who likes to read, I can recommend you to read the explanations and rules after logging into the site. The results we have obtained in our own tests are available on the site. We conducted tests with a large group of traders and our own success rate is 100%. After you become a member of the site, there is no situation that will require you to pay any money. You can do your own tests for free. Look at the time of the signal and the entry price as an example. Check your profitability accordingly. Perform thought experiments before investing money. It will be helpful for you to have an idea.",
