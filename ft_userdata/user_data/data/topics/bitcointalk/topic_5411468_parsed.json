  "content": "On August 8, 2022, the FBI, pursuant to a search warrant, raided the home of the legitimately elected former President, Donald Trump. This was an unprededented event and was clearly motivated by politics. It appears that the DOJ intended to \"prosecute\" Trump via leaks to the friendly press by leaking either inaccurate information or information that is taken out of context. An example of this to date includes leaks to the Washington Post suggesting that some of the \"classified\" documents in Trump's home were related to \"nuclear\" secrets. From the looks of it, the dispute in question appears to be a document dispute between Trump and the National Archives. There is no evidence presented to date that suggests a search warrant was necessary. The unredacted version of the affidavit that was used to support the search warrant on Trump's home contained no information that suggested evidence of a crime would be found at Trump's home. Prior to the DOJ being ordered to release a redacted version of said affidavit, both Trump and Republican lawmakers have been calling for the DOJ to become transparent regarding the investigation and the case. After the affidavit was released, with its heavy redactions, many continue to slam the DOJ for their lack of transparency. All of this comes after the DOJ described angry parents who were critical of the Biden Administration's allies (the teacher's unions) as \"terrorists\". What do you think? Has Biden weaponized the DOJ against his political opponents? Has the DOJ and FBI lost all credibility?",

FBI whistleblowers are bringing this into the open.The Start of the Unraveling of the Trump Mar A Lago RaidQuote from: https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/08/start-unraveling-trump-mar-lago-raid/It started with the Judge releasing the sealed search warrant and the affidavit that provided the predicate for the search. Now, it is true most of the substance was blacked out, but the documents revealed that this operation was done at the behest of the Washington Field Office.Well guess what? The head of the FBI's Washington Field Office, Tim Thibault, was removed forcibly from his office by other FBI agents last Friday. That news just broke today. It comes in tandem with other news that some of the documents taken from President Trump's residence were covered by Attorney/Client privilege. The FBI violated Mr. Trump's Constitutional Rights. Or, to be specific, FBI Special Agent in Charge of the Washington Field Office, Tim Thibault, violated Mr. Trump's rights.Details about Mr. Thibault’s criminal activities over the last five years are likely to emerge in the coming weeks. For example, Mr. Thibault obstructed justice in the Hillary Clinton case. And he reportedly played a critical role in Cross Fire Hurricane, operating behind the scenes. Thibault was the one who ensured the Hunter Biden laptop never saw the light of day. He helped cover that up. And he has allegedly been involved in other chicanery intended to discredit and destroy Donald Trump.This is more than rumor....",

I'm not saying Trump is better than Biden or vice versa.In the end, I think it's a media war.Here is the answer to why so many are against Trump. The straight forward answer is simple. But the working of it is more detailed.The direct answer is this. Trump wants to make America great. World big-money people want to make America part of a world government that they control. It will take a bit of thinking to understand how world control works, with all the nations being equal to each other. But that's how it works. No nation greater than any other. And the people dumbed down enough to not realize what is happening.Trump, himself, isn't much. He's overweight, and not a man I would want to be physically or mentally like... necessarily. The thing that is important is that he is broadcasting freedom for the masses. And as President, he was carrying it out... at least in appearance.But imagine that behind Trump's freedom show was really a plan to enslave people. To enslave, you have to dumb them down enough that they think they are free, but really aren't. I mean, give the people the illusion of freedom, but don't really release the chains (Putin). Trump wasn't doing that. He was really giving freedom. You can see it in some of the deregulating he was doing, which Biden reversed as much as he could.You can't take the freedom away from truly free people. How far can you go giving the illusion of freedom, without finally giving true freedom? True freedom, when you think about it deeply, is a form of enslavement, itself. When/if the world is all truly free... when all the nations are totally free as individual people... then they are enslaved to their own ideas of what freedom is... even if it is something that is not free. Big-money doesn't realize this, and so they are against the one thing that will make people slaves... true freedom.Why is Big-money missing this? They are impatient. They want it now. After all, it has taken hundreds (or thousands) of years, and they haven't gotten real control, yet. And the reason why is their stumbling point. They always act too soon... like they are doing with Biden.The point is that they hate Trump because he appears to be taking away from their plan of controlling the world in their lifetime. And they are using every tool they have to destroy him for this... even getting the people to hate him for almost no reason at all, and for far less reason than people would hate Biden.",

Does he have different goals or does he want to get out of control? I don't know, but such things happen completely in secret and it is difficult to judge.I used to see Trump as a businessman who seeks to achieve his personal interests before achieving the interests of his country.",
