Following the tweet many users commented that money was also missing from their wallets. This incident has affected a large number of users and Atomic Wallet is still investigating whether the issue was caused by a scam or a hack.User Report:Cointelegraph Report:Atomic Wallet app users have reported the loss of their crypto assets and claimed their funds disappeared from decentralized wallets. Atomic Wallet has taken note of these reports and is investigating the situation. On chain investigator ZachBTX also weighed in. The incident adds to a growing list of frequent crypto hacks affecting current targets such as DeFi app Jimbos Protocol and crypto mixer Tornado Cash.

We may be too suspicous about it but we never know. Things usually get ugly every bear market and a legit company can sometimes snap.I'd like to believe they still can be trusted though and provemthe public its really a hack from the outside to clear them.",

Based on what I've seen on Twitter and Reddit, it seems that over $20 million has been reported as stolen so far. However, it's highly probable that the final total will end up being much higher.According to the information I've come across, it appears that the attack originated from hacking their official website. The attackers allegedly released a malicious version of the software disguised as an upgrade. But this is all unconfirmed at this point and should be taken as speculation.Quote from: CYBER_COWBOY on June 04, 2023, 11:00:17 AMThis is kinda worrying news if something like this can happen at atomic, it could happen on another wallet provider to, and with that said... to hold bitcoin is no longer a safe thing.Life changer. Hope I wrong.You are wrong. You know, Atomic wallet is actually closed source software, and that makes a big difference. Moreover, to the best of my knowledge, it has never really been endorsed or recommended by the Bitcoin community, if you catch my drift.

Should I be worried?Honestly, I do not know much about the Exodus wallet. I haven't really looked into it or tried it out myself. But from what I gather, there does not seem to be any connection between the Exodus wallet and the Atomic wallet. So, I reckon this might not be the ideal thread to have a discussion about it.If you have concerns regarding the security of your cryptocurrency assets, I recommend doing thorough research on best practices for implementing a form of cold storage. One popular option is to consider hardware wallets, which offer enhanced security measures. However, there are other viable methods as well. For instance, you can explore the option of setting up a reputable open-source wallet on an offline (air-gapped) device.",
