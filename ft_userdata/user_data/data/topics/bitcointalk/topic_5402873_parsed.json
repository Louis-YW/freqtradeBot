  "content": "Hello dear crypto friends,It has been a couple years since I last posted on this forum and I am sorry for that to begin with. Recently I started to become very active in the crypto space again and there is this one thing I just don't get, which should probably be very easy: getting HBAR (Hedera Hash) from Kucoin to MyHbarWallet. As we have seen the whole debacle unfold with Luna and Celsius, I am a believer of self-custody. I am now and have been ever since I bought my first crypto many years ago. Anyway, long story short: I have a MyHbarWallet, I have HashPack, I have Hedera on my ledger, but for some reason when I type in either the public key OR 0.0.0xxxxxx account ID as withdrawal address at Kucoin it says: adress format invalid. The only thing I can think of that I possibly did wrong or didnt do yet, is activate my MyHbarWallet. Now the thing is, how can I activate it without funds in it when I cannot send funds to it to activate it? It seems really weird and I have been trying to get this work for quite some time now. I would highly appreciate it if someone maybe knows what I did wrong or what I should do in order to move my HBAR from Kucoin straight into MyHbarWallet via my Ledger so that I am in control over my coins rather than Kucoin. It is not that I don't trust Kucoin I just like to be in control of my own coins, especially as we aren't talking a few pennies. Anyway, that was it. Will start lurking around now a bit and see all the new cool stuff y'all discussing",

It would be best if you ask directly to Kucoin customer services regarding your issue, you will surely have better responses.Either way, you might want to check out this article from the Ledger itself: Create a Ledger Hedera (HBAR) account via HashPack.",

      "body": "Thanks for the reply. I did everything in that guide and even started a live chat with a Ledger employee this morning. It seems I have set up everything correctly as per the guide you mentioned and I should indeed contact Kucoin as per why they don't support withdrawals of HBAR. I find it a bit rude/weird of Kucoin to state ''invalid address'', confusing me for quite some time, whilst they probably just don't support withdrawing the token to external wallets.",

Directly contacting Kucoin customer service will surely give you assurance whether there is something wrong from their end or not. If there is still no luck, and the CS didn't help you enough. The last option would be to join and ask the Hedera community group: https://www.reddit.com/r/hedera/wiki/index/links#wiki_discord.But you should know the drill, be careful when you publicly ask for help, some scammer might lurking around in that group.",
