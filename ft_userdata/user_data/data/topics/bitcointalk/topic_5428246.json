I'll bet you a McDonald's Happy Meal that if you add a $2000 (or $1000 or even smaller) Amazon Gift card to your account it will be closed within a couple hours and any order placed will be cancelled. Â  Escrow is meaningless with ANY gift card deal because by the time the account is closed escrow will have been released and the buyer will be SOL.",
