All the rising tensions are just geared to the election and nothing more. Which makes the fiat vs bitcoin comparison to Biden vs Trump not really in place. Pardon me to say that Trump is sort of clamouring for cryptocurrency because he see that as a strong to gather support from all crypto enthusiasts in his ambition, am sure if he was to be in Biden's shoe he would have done same and Biden would have also done the reverse.",

Words are cheap, especially during election season.  As far as the veto is concerned, I think any private institution that wants to custody Bitcoin should go through the eye of a needle for approval. Banks and other financial custodians have been amiss in their responsibilities. People should rather take effort to learn how to self-custody than let incompetent third-parties keep their money for them. Anyway, as has been my observation, Trump commits before he thinks through it. He says one thing today, takes it back the following day. It's no biggie for him. In which case, his words don't mean much.",

Not saying that is wrong, since that is what any candidate has to do in order to gain the votes he needs, but we must take anything being said by Trump or Biden with a healthy dose of skepticism.After all, the most recent polls still puts them at a very close position relative to each other, so any votes that may be won by either candidate, may be the difference between winning or losing the upcoming election.",

They are politicians who want to get the most votes so they can become leaders in their country.Trump here is trying to restore his trust in the public because previously when he was in office there might have been mistakes after mistakes that were considered failures.For me both are the same. Don't want to judge them badly, but when it comes to Bitcoin I don't trust either of them. Actually, my thoughts are quite simple on this matter, namely that they are politicians who are trying to secure their business.As long as the American people accept one of them then he is worthy.",

Both of them use Bitcoin and the crypto world for their campaign purposes. They only intend to gain sympathy from pro-crypto voters, and once their goal is achieved I doubt that they will stick to their promise to provide the best for the development of crypto in the US. Because whether Biden or Trump, when they are elected, they will continue to regulate Bitcoin and Altcoins, and perhaps more strictly. And I suspect that of their many promises to crypto, at most they will only realize 1-2 promises, and the rest they will just leave it at that.",

This topic has been talked about multiple times in the forum and we have multiple times also said that this whole thing is nothing but for election.I wish crypto enthusiasts don’t hope too much on Trump after the election.

We all know politicians can do anything to achieve their goals, especially American politics is notoriously messy and there is no trick they don't dare to do. I disagree when you call Trump is bitcoin and Biden is fiat, because whoever becomes president will represent and have the task of making the USD stronger.

It will be such a waste of vote if someone votes for Trump just because of his stance on crypto just for him to not actually do anything in support of crypto. But people have already grown a dislike to Biden for what he has implemented concerning cryptocurrencies.

Don't easily get fooled by a politician which is been skeptical on bitcoin before so don't expect a lot on Trump since we don't know if he's true to his words and will fully support Bitcoin. But if the case that They are facing each other with Biden which is totally an anti bitcoin then maybe its worth to try what Trump could do if he could able to fulfill his promises or this might be just another trap for people just to get a vote on upcoming election.So hopefully we can see a open minded leader could take the seat which could able to support bitcoin and other thing that can benefit their people also can eliminate something that protect the institutions or oligarch interest.
