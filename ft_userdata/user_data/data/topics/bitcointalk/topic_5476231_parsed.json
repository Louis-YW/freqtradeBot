So I suggest that all discussions concerning the mixer announcement be made under theymos's post. In order to make this more effective I suggest the announcement also be pinned in the meta board also till the deadline (Jan 1st) just like most important posts on the meta board.

      "body": "I also believe, keeping all discussions in a thread will make the forum a bit clean from spamming as a result of topic repetition. And then again, some of the topics, which I have seen, that was created, are a little kind of different, which, if they get the discussion under that of their own, might make the discussion go a little off topic, which many don't want.Â Â In relation to the same topic being discussed, maybe anyone creating such threads probably might not know the first one exists, or they are just trying to create some sort of awareness, which is literally not necessarily, beside we all can see the pinned message displayed on the topic of the forum, just as Bitcoin Core Release News is always displayed their.",

From your post history you seem to be an altcoiner(shitcoiner) who cares less about the interest of Bitcoins . Just stay away from such Bitcoin discussions and stick with your shitcoins.

ThanksJust a friendly suggestion.It looks funny because till your post I have seen many other posts saying the same thing in many other sections, even if the topic name is different the context of their posts is the same, either they are worried about a signature campaign and even I am, or either they wants to know what is going to happen like any compromisation. But your topic is just another one to that category.Even if it has different concerns related to this forum's safety of avoiding spamming forum with such topics. That's a good thing, we all should care about the forum and should contribute to its success and I like you are agreeing with theymos even if you are not very new to the platform. I have read many posts of yours that's why I said you are still new and not so old at the same time.The thing is, those other members have the right to create their topic just like you did and your topic might not stop all of them but it might stop some to convey their message using your topic, but the best way to convey your message towards moderators and administrators or other members is to create a new topic.",

Some of the mixer related topics are best suit in the service discussion thread. So, it will not make sense to push all to meta.As Cantsay noted, the announcement is already at the top most left side of the forum where other announcements such as pizza contest are announced.",

Anyway, don't worry yourself stiff. All these will soon wane out. You didn't see how so many endless threads sprang up once the merit announcement was made by theymos in 2018? It's the same pattern I see here. I don't see anything wrong in it. We can't gag members or coax them into silence or sitting on the fence. Be sure to see discussions on this issue linger till after the deadline this December.",

ThanksYour suggestion will go with the wind because people will continue to create new topics to discuss about the same thing, again and again.Because of many reasons such asThey don't spend time to read titles of 20 topics at a first page of each board, simply create their topics.They don't spend time to search for available discussions about that issue.They abuse topic creation to cheat campaigns to avoid the rule, posts after page 5 will not be counted. Okay, they go ahead proactively by creating new topics, again, again, then their posts will be very fitted with the campaign rules.To fish merit as well",
