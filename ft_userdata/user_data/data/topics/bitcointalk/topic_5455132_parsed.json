That's why until today, there was no blockchain game that can compete with some common games out there that are easy to play because most blockchain games don't have any idea to reduce the gas fees once they rise.",

Able to earn some shares or crypto from it is just not gonna work long term so, if the gameplay is fun at the same time there's a worth it reward for everybody, it's worth it for most.But as I've said, real gamers will come to your game if the concept is amazing and the fees aren't bothering if there's a need to transact.",

People loves a good gaming ecosystem, the only drawback youll face is the transaction fees. Why? Its getting heavier and saturated on the eth network. So if your game got boosted, theres a lot of possibility of increase in fees. You could definitely use other chains that has supported scalability for games. Even though there are lots of options, buildung a game to monetize it on chain are now dropping due to scandals of play to earn last bull run. Well at least make a game first that wull be useful and see how to scale it on money matters.",

You future gamers will suffer heavy gas fee prices and this can be the reason on why would they avoid in playing your game. I personally think that Crypto games still has a chance to shine next bull market but you as a developer should consider the problems that happened last bull market where people suffer from high gas prices, weak tokenomics, unsustainable way to make people way to stay in the game and yeah bad quality game that only attractive if the reward token value is high. You should choose gas friendly blockchains as I guess your game will use a lot of gas fees.",

I hope you get good backing for this project.My experience with polygon was on a high level, the project was big, with a great studio, a demo, and everything, we worked directly with the team, but in the end, they just used us to make the polygon looks good for investors, I don't want to get to the details, because the project is still on hold, we may revive it later on ETH chain, but from experience, polygon is a graveyard for web3 projects.Yesterday's dinner didn't go as expected, but 2 of 6 people agreed to back me up, is still a win at this stage, the next important step is the prototype on testnet, once it's done, I will create a proper announcement post for the game.In case you want to get notified when the testnet is live, use this form (mailing list) to join the mailing list, we won't email you until the testnet is live.Also, I will be posting progress updates here.",

It's true that many blockchain games have faced challenges due to the increasing gas fees, which can deter players from engaging with the game. Example case, if game need some token to play it and users has token token to buy first, this is problem if users buy a littlebit minimum token to play this game, because gas fee ETH is high. I suggestion to research and consider using Arbitrum. For now, Arbitrum solution for Ethereum that aims to reduce transaction fees and improve the network's scalability. You may be able to offer your players a more cost-effective gaming experience while still benefiting from the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network.",
