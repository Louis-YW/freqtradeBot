  "content": "So I discovered a bug affecting a mode of play at OwlGames casinos that results in certain games rewarding more money than they should.  I tried to report it to OwlGames but was told that they have no bug bounty program and to \"enjoy the bug\" (not kidding).  (of course their docs say that any \"exploit\" can result in not being paid out, but it's not an exploit if it's simply how things run under the given conditions - not that that would stop them from screwing someone over I'm sure)Their poor attitude certainly doesn't do much to make me want to help them out anymore although that was my intent.  But since it is only certain games, from 1 provider, should I try to contact that provider instead?  It's possible I imagine that it's not just OwlGames that might possibly lose money to the issue, though I really don't know.I guess since these are casinos, losing a couple hundred to a few players every few days that would otherwise not have won anything maybe is just a drop in the bucket.  But I found it so strange that they immediately just alerted me that they have no bounty program.  Aren't casinos supposed to be pretty protective of their money even if they have a ton of it?  Anyone else have any experiences of trying to report issues like this?  I want to be rewarded for my time verifying the issue without taking advantage of it and alerting someone about it, too, so I'm also just worried about giving the info out and having them come up with some excuse like \"oh it just needed a restart it's fine now, that's not a bug.\"",

Did you try contacting the third party provider?It seems they have been having issues with support anyway, since they locked the thread saying to be \"re-arranging its strategies to offer the best support\".",

Anything else that happens outside of that, whether they take note of not shouldn't be your responsibility nor should you even mind it in the first place imo. Now if it was a bug bounty program then that's a different thing, but it isn't anyway. Quote from: owlbugreporter on January 21, 2023, 02:08:01 AMI guess since these are casinos, losing a couple hundred to a few players every few days that would otherwise not have won anything maybe is just a drop in the bucket.  But I found it so strange that they immediately just alerted me that they have no bounty program.  Aren't casinos supposed to be pretty protective of their money even if they have a ton of it?  Anyone else have any experiences of trying to report issues like this?  I want to be rewarded for my time verifying the issue without taking advantage of it and alerting someone about it, too, so I'm also just worried about giving the info out and having them come up with some excuse like \"oh it just needed a restart it's fine now, that's not a bug.\"I reckon it's to clarify things? I mean it's better to sooner tell someone that they don't have bounties for it than let them do it for nothing, could be a drop in rep if known after all. As for bug bounties, Casinos would probably tell their users, or at least have an ANN sort in their local forums (if it has one) or public social media if they ever have one. And as I've said before, anything after than that, whether they fix it, or \"think\" that they fixed it, or leave it alone, it's not your problem anymore.",

I guess the bug is still not fixed since OP will not gonna think to report it on the game provider if he already told it to Owl and they just didn't take action on it. I mean he can simply abused it if Owl knew the existence of the bug and didn't solve it.",

The sad part is someone could be actively exploiting this right now and draining away active player funds if it is profitable like you suggest. It's not normal and most casinos would jump at the chance to plug any gaps for all sorts of reasons. Definitely a good idea to stay away as a player if it's true.",

If the management team doesn't respond to you properly and instead they dispute your report, it's better for you to remain silent and let them work on their own rather than end up being disappointed yourself. for not being given a good response.Very few gamblers care about this and instead they use it to play games that are experiencing bugs in order to win large amounts.That's why I applaud what you have done because indirectly you want to help casinos that have a bug problem in one of the games in it.",
