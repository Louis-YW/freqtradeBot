  "content": "The other day I've found this interesting blog about someone in Europe planning to retire early by converting a fixed amount of their monthly salary into Bitcoin.He started doing this in the bull market of 2017 and keeps doing it every month, no excuses. A specific amount, 500 euros, is always converted into Bitcoin and stored away in cold storage.This is how his strategy looks like:As you can see, the BTC stack in orange always keeps going up, making it a personal ATH for him every time.In a black dashed line is the actual total invested in fiat, which simply increases by 500 euro every month.And in green you can see the value in fiat(euro) of his current amount of Bitcoin. This one of course varies a lot depending on the current price of Bitcoin.You can clearly see that it has been an incredibly great savings strategy so far, obtaining a lot more value than simply saving in fiat.I'll leave you guys with the url of the blog: https://er-bybitcoin.comIn the end, perseverance seems to be the key here. He's not putting an incredible amount of money down every month, but still he has managed to obtain a lot of Bitcoin, 4.47 BTC from his last update.Have you tried something similar?, maybe now thinking about doing it?, I think it's a great idea.",

      "body": "This is a perfect explanation of how Bitcoin is the best crypto currency to withstand inflation. Many a time people are told to invest not save but they seem to get confused. Investing overtime brings about profits which in turn covers losses caused by inflation. Now Bitcoin currently is the best digital currency that could serve both as an asset and a peer to peer currency.Someone who saved $42k in fiat would find out that in a 3 year period of time $42k won't be worth as much as it used to. However someone who bought Bitcoin worth of $42k about 3 years ago will find out that due to increase in value of Bitcoin, that amount would have been over 46k which would cover for both losses caused by inflation and still leaving  an extra amount of profit. Bitcoin is a win win investment asset for both inflation and profit.",

I think people use the word \"retire\" in different ways.For me at least it means having the option to do whatever you want, which usually would include working, just probably not for the type of organization that pays enough to cover living expenses.I would be so happy contributing way more to open source projects, and creating interesting things that don't necessarily need to have a positive business plan.Most people in this forum would probably never really \"retire\" in the sense of stop working. I see retiring as a way to use my skills in interesting projects, independent of the pay, which might or might not be there.",

Whether you live in a first-world or third-world country, that amount is already significant and way back even higher than before this crazy inflation came. What we can learn here is that the accumulation through DCA is always going to be worth it. People may find the strategy to be lowkey at the beginning but that's the purpose of it, the effect will be seen in the long term and that's why it is important that someone has a long term plan or if not, a short term plan. But anyway, the majority of us here have already decided to stay in the long run.",

Of course, this does not mean that the method is not good and everyone can adapt it to their needs - so let's say someone does the same thing with 100 EUR per month, he would have five times less, but he would still be very close to having 1 BTC. What is now clearly visible is that this kind of investment is very profitable in the long term and can be much better than relying on pension funds.",

Dedicating some money from your salary to buy Bitcoin every month is a very smart idea. I was doing that since 2017 but my strategy was a little different, I was putting all of my money into Bitcoin and only withdrew money that I needed to spend on food, rent and transport. That was good, and immensely helped me to live a good life but the negative side of my attitude was that sometimes I had urgent cases to get cash, there were moments when I had to withdraw when the price was low and that negatively affected my balance sheet. Overall, if someone can invest 500 euros monthly in Bitcoin and doesn't plan to touch it, then it will really help the person to retire early.",

There's no other secret than ro be consistent and to follow your plans from the start. If you planned to just hold then do everything that it takes to hold even with times of huge decline on market prices. Inconsistencies are always expected when it comes on Bitcoin's price movement however, with investor's mindset, it could be not. Many investors had the same goal but eventually was forced by circumstances to sell early even with loss. It is a common mistake caused by lack of concrete plan. Well, to those who experienced such thing, re-investing is always an open choice to everyone. Just invest and avoid giving your all into it to avoid being pushed by life circumstances and financial needs.But I uite disagree with early retirement and focusing only with Bitcoin investment through holding no matter how big that amount is. A multiple stream of income is way baetter than sticking with a single one, even if you are profitable of it. If you can still work aand be able to enjoy life, then I think it would still be better to have your work with you because it would be a huge help with one's expenses than to solely depend with investment profit which is not consistent in the first place.",
