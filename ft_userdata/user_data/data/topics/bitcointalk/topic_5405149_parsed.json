  "content": "The application of blockchain technology has gone widespread across several industries as many of them now make use of the advantage in cryptocurrency to increase the performance of thier businesses and enterprises using the technology in their services, the economy is doubtlesslly not in dark towards the advancement of the crypto adoption and its relevance areas of application.Among those embracing this great opportunity is the \"Fashion Industry\", in collaboration with different brands are working closely to overcome areas of challenges in the industry with the application of blockchain technology.QuoteLuxury giants LVMH, Prada, and Cartier joined forces to launch the Aura Blockchain Consortium, a non-profit platform to create a digital twin for their fashion items. The platform leverages blockchain technology, which has the features of transparency and immutability to ensure that consumers of the brands are buying original copies.https://beincrypto.com/crypto-can-save-the-fashion-industry-despite/?utm_source=thecryptoappIt is quite obvious that cryptocurrency is not only applicable to the use of digital currency for an exchange or store of value assets or for an investment but also the technology in blockchain has various applicable means it provides solutions into the economy, one of which they find secure to enlist all their brand products on the immutable distributed ledger while thousands of products and brands have join in this together.",

It can help in keeping a good log in the library or it can essentially be used in any other MNCs as well. Banking, healthcare, log keeping, all these places does need a little bit of help from the Blockchain so that they can be more secure, since it can be extended to cyber security as well !The best part is they are creating a ' non- profit' organization as well ! Therefore it can be used for small business organizations and make things way more international.",

Where the production and distribution of THC products were recorded in a blockchain ledger to verify their legitimacy and integrity.These apps are on private blockchains to deter unwanted 51% attacks.It would appear blockchain technology is well suited for these types of applications.

It's actually one of the usage of blockchain in having that intact record for the customers if they have the actual and legitimate brand and is not a copy that they've got in the market.Sounds good and this is just one of the use that these companies to have with blockchain.",

Cryptocurrency is strictly for digital currencies using cryptography. You are actually referring to blockchain in this context which has cut across different sectors of the world even down to our political activities either in a permissioned  or permissionless  blockchain setting. The beautiful setup of Bitcoin has you pointed out is the immutable ledger and the choice of making this ledger public to enhance transparency. blockchain so far remains the future",

Though it's not totally the crypto that they adopt but it was its technology which is blockchain. Still both have a relation and those people will soon find out about cryptos and they will think that it will be a good idea to adopt it as well. I think the main feature of blockchain is transparency so yes it is perfect to use on the financial system which is why it's the first to be used on cryptocurrencies.
