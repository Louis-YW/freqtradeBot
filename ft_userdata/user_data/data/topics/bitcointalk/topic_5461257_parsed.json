They have created many impressive tools before, so it wouldn't be a big challenge for them.Personally, I'm happy using the web browser to view the forum, and I don't see any need for an app. There is an addon made by fahbil Bitcointalk Mobile Friendly App for Android that works like an app if you so wants to try it, but it may not be working properly since its developer has been inactive since 2020. Good luck if you decide to use it, though!",

Just my suggestion.Just like everyone here in the forum said, this way already discuss for a very long time here in the forum, And I think everyone is going to agree that this forum didn't really need something like a mobile application anymore because the forum is actually great even on mobile use with just using the mobile browser, I mean there are maybe some issue if your phone has a very small screen but that was the issue of your smartphone but it would still work since you could easily zoom in and out using the mobile browser.It was probably great to have a lot of stuff here in the forum but it was probably the preference to make the forum simple and if we are going to put a lot of stuff, features, etc it would probably just gonna take more space, I mean there are already a lot of threads here in the forum for sure that is taking a lot of space to store that data. Using the forum on a smartphone is great since its portable and you could access the forum anywhere but I just don't prefer using it since I prefer posting on pc.",

Perhaps, due to my ignorance, I have never seen an application for forums; how do you imagine that?No, that's not quite accurate. Mobile apps don't necessarily need to be \"bound to the phone.\" In most legit apps, you have control over what information the app can access on your phone.There is no problem using the forum through the phone's browser. However, as already mentioned, the problem lies in the fact that this version of SMF is not optimized to look good on all devices due to the lack of responsive design. Unlike, for example, the new forum software - EpochTalk - that was developed with responsiveness in mind right from the start.For mobile apps designed specifically for online forum communities, you can check out:Tapatalk Discourse RedditQuoraQuote from: libert19 on July 28, 2023, 05:05:35 AMQuote from: ImThour on July 28, 2023, 02:42:12 AMI am sure this has been discussed a few times here on the forum and I am against it as the forums work perfectly fine in the browser on your phone.It's an Old SMF Forum however the mobile responsiveness is there.

Is there demand about it?Since we are fine with old software and this is so user friendly so for me this is much better rather than they spend a lot of money just to maintain that app suggestion. For now we don't actually need it since many like the existing forum. And no need to to have an app since anyone can access this forum by using their chrome browser at any  time the want also its still easy to use like what we do on our computers.",

We've got email addresses linked to everyone's account (goodgle account) and that, for any reasons could be used for proper identification.Secondly, just like FORK said, you have full access and permission over whatever app controls your device.. maybe except a SECURITY PLUGGINGS. aside that, from your app settings, you can restrict any app at your will. I understand that most applications don't work well without some certain permissions, but that could certainly be a reason why Theymos has taken alota time - I believe he doesn't wanna have this interceptions.Sandra 🧑‍🦰",

Though this may be the case, the forum is good as it is. Its simplicity is what drives it more efficient and convenient to use compared if you implement it on different features.

Also creating a mobile application for this forum can bring the forum to the attention of more scammers and make things easier for them, just like the creation of application for forums like Reddit, Quora, Discourse increased the number of scammers there with fake profile looking for ways to lure users from the forum to other places where they can settle down and deceive them. With just the website, the forum is less attractive to scammers.",
