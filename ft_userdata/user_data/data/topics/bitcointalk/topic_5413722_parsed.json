The food index alone rose 11.4% over the past year, according to the latest consumer price index figures — marking the biggest 12-month jump since May 1979.The food-at-home index, a measure of price changes at the grocery store, increased 13.5% — also a 43-year high.In the face of higher prices, consumers have been cutting back, according to Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. However, “food, at its basic level, is not discretionary,” he said. “That’s the challenging aspect of the circumstances we are in.”Prices for staples like eggs, milk, cereal, bread and butter notched some of the largest increases, further straining household budgets.Inflation has also led many food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, to raise the prices on drinks and packaged goods. Some are also making their packages smaller — also known as “shrinkflation” — or swap in less expensive ingredients, a tactic now termed “skimpflation.”“Grocery product manufacturers know that while most shoppers will immediately notice a price increase, they are less likely to catch a reduction in a product’s net weight or a switch to using cheaper ingredients,” said Edgar Dworsky, the founder of Consumer World, who has been tracking the downsizing of popular products, such as Charmin, Quaker Instant Oatmeal and Honey Bunches of Oats.The Federal Reserve has already taken aggressive steps to fight surging inflation, and a survey released earlier this week by the New York Fed showed consumers are growing less fearful about rising prices — although they still expect the inflation rate to be 5.7% a year from now. “Consumers are prepared for high prices to persist in the foreseeable future, but there’s also a tendency for people to think that things might return to normal,” Hamrick said.In the meantime, “it’s prudent for individuals to continue to be cautious with their household budgets,” he added.To that end, savings experts share their top tips to spend less on groceries as food inflation shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.“It’s belt-tightening time and has been for a while,” Hamrick said.5 tips for saving on groceries1. Scrutinize sales. Generic brands can be 10% to 30% cheaper than their “premium” counterparts and just as good, but that’s not always the case. Name brands may be offering bigger-than-usual discounts right now to maintain loyalty, so it pays to pay attention to price changes.2. Plan your meals. When you plan your meals in advance, you’re more likely to just buy the things you need, said Lisa Thompson, a savings expert at Coupons.com. If planning’s not your thing, at least go shopping with a rough idea of what you’ll be cooking in the week ahead to help stay on track and avoid impulse purchases, she added.3. Buy in bulk. When it comes to the rest of the items on your list, you can save more by buying in bulk. Joining a wholesale club such as Costco, Sam’s Club or BJ’s will often get you the best price per unit on condiments and nonperishable goods.4. Use a cash-back app. Ibotta and Checkout 51 are two of the most popular apps for earning cash back at the store, according to Julie Ramhold, a consumer analyst at DealNews.com. The average Ibotta user earns between $10 and $20 a month, but more active users can make as much as $100 to $300 a month, a spokesperson told CNBC.5. Pay with the right card. While a generic cash-back card such as the Citi Double Cash Card can earn you 2%, there are specific grocery rewards cards that can earn you up to 6% back at supermarkets nationwide, such as the Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express. CNBC’s Select has a full roundup of the best cards for food shopping along with the APRs and annual fees.https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/15/how-to-save-money-as-food-inflation-jumps.html....Although I consider myself an optimist. I hope I can still identify as much in thinking this sounds serious:QuoteThe food-at-home index, a measure of price changes at the grocery store, increased 13.5% — also a 43-year high.2022 - 43 = 1979. So it seems the previous record was made in the 1970s. We're breaking records. Although not the type of records we would like to be breaking.How do we turn things around? Is there anything constructive we can do? How do people address these types of situations on a personal level?While growing food may not be feasible for residents of cities. Is it possible to lease land in rural areas on city outskirts for purposes of food growing? Perhaps rural land near cities can be leased for city residents to house chickens, goats and livestock on a timeshare or communal basis?High food prices have to be a concern for many. Which one might think would cause people to seek alternatives or devise solutions.",

In the current situation, to beat inflation can be done in two ways, saving, as you say, or increasing income above 11%, which is the preferable one in my opinion.In other threads I have commented that a year ago, which is when inflation began to be noticed, before the war, my income increased, and this has meant that in spite of this inflationary period I have been able to spend more and save more.It is not an easy thing and not everybody can do it. If you can't increase income, cut back on expenses, yes, but at least try, think about increasing income.",

Raising crops and growing animals for food entail responsibilities which I'm afraid many of the working people in cities couldn't afford to take.

      "body": "The problem with inflation and consequently the price of food is not something that affects all people in the world equally, so there is no universal solution. The most affected will be those who live in urban areas and belong to the lower middle or lower class, because their purchasing power is constantly weakening, and they are not among those who have the opportunity to cultivate the land/keep livestock, and they are not even in the category of those who have savings.All the others will somehow adapt, and will that mean that we will eat less or use cheaper products? Probably the latter, but I also know that the majority will still decide that food (enough food) is a priority, and that we will have to give up some things - alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, going to the cinema, pointless car rides... Everything we save can be redirected to food, and I don't see any other way in terms of a short-term solution.In the long term, the only solution would be for people to turn to self-sustainability as much as possible, but that would require radical changes in the way we live. When we look at the fact that the majority of young people run away to the cities and do not want to do hard work, then we cannot expect things to get better today.People who wonder why a product has increased in price by 100% or why it is not on the shelf at all, should know that all these products are not created by magic but by hard work - less labor force, poisoned and barren land and supply chain interruptions are just the consequences of global orientation of the world in the wrong direction.",

I'm no stranger to high inflation rate. In my experience, making lists of things to buy, paying attention to discounts and planning meals in advance are all good things. But it's also important to stay open-minded. Maybe the product you used to buy very often is now much more expensive. You should look around the shops and see if there's something cheap that you haven't tried before. Do your research on that, and which meals can be cooked with something you haven't tried before. Also, don't be afraid to look at what used to be those very expensive things you normally didn't buy: there's a good chance some of that out-of-reach stuff isn't that expensive anymore, considering how much the prices changed for other things.And yes, you'll spend more money that you used to, so you should think about where you can earn more money or where you can reasonably cut down spending. But it won't be as devastating as you initially assumed. Especially with such a low increase as 13.5%.",

With a little creativity, you can bring good and healthy food to the table without spending a fortune. Probably, you would likely spend $6–10 on food preparation for the entire day.Buying whole foods that are very filling, like sweet potatoes, is another pro tip. Not only is this a healthier choice, but it may also enable you to eat less throughout the day. Additionally, we have a wetmarket where food supplies are much less expensive than in a supermarket.Again this is pretty much a workaround from a 3rd world country, the food prices and the availability of the products in other countries is highly likely different.",

You will still spend some money before you can harvest them for some consumable products. Local farmers should also be compensated well because they have the proper knowledge in doing those stuffs to raise it properly.People should learn how to go back in the basic, like having their own little farm in their backyard or learn how to redo or reinvent leftover foods. It’s right that farmers should be paid right and be supported by the government to supply the need of their country and to not rely in the supply of other countries. If people can’t find way to increase their income flaw better they find ways or alternatives to the high cost ingredients.

Although not the type of records we would like to be breaking.Yep, that was before my time and before the times of many members here, I'm sure--but I know about that period and what happened with the stock market once the inflationary crisis was over.  This time around, however, we're having a spike in inflation along with a stock market that's been on a bull run for well over a decade.  That hadn't been the case in the 70s.  The massive bull market that followed the inflation started somewhere around 1982 and continued up until 2000, when the NASDAQ (and subsequently the other indexes) crashed.  If and when inflation decreases to acceptable levels, I'm not sure what's going to happen to the markets, including crypto.  It's kind of scary.Another thing is that in the 70s, interest rates were much higher than they are now, IIRC, so people could actually hedge against inflation somewhat simply by opening up a savings account at their local bank.  That hasn't been possible (at least in the US) for a long, long time.  I'm not sure how people have been trying to hedge, if they've been doing so at all.  Precious metals?  Maybe, but that market has been relatively stagnant since 2011 when it peaked.  Stocks?  Probably, which is why the bull market has lasted this long.  But man....the result is that most stocks right now are overpriced, and I've been predicting a massive crash for a few years now.  I still think it's coming, and it's going to be brutal.The best way to fight food inflation IMO would be to stock up on as much food right now as possible (nonperishable foods, obviously).  Everything else is a crapshoot.",
