In other words a wallet is something private that contains multiple keys that may not have any connection to each other.The only thing you can measure is number of addresses being used and their balance (which is not something you could do using RPC calls or a regular node for that matter). The problem with this is that one person/wallet can have multiple addresses so the accuracy of the results regarding adoption decrease.The only way to do this is to run your own modified node so that it indexes your database based on addresses so that you can search and analyze it.Quote from: dademagorgin on October 02, 2022, 09:39:48 PMAlternatively, do guys know of any online services that already provide this information? What do you guys use?Block explorers like https://blockchair.com usually have this kind of data which is usually found among their charts.Like this: https://www.blockchain.com/charts/n-unique-addresses",

No offense, but you seem to need that.As said, the blockchain doesn't tell anything about wallets, also a \"new\" address is not registered anywhere, so nobody knows (except the owner) that it's created.And if you have missed this, I expect you'd be missing other info too, getting you into various mistakes or even paying big money for a cloud service that won't help you.So: learn more, it may save you money.",
