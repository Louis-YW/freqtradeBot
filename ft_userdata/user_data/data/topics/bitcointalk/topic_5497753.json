No one can knows but you can reduce your risk by choosing trade partners with good past successful trades in both number of trades and trading volume. It can reduce risk to trade with new accounts with money from dark sources.It is only kind of carefulness and prevention but can not be perfect because if that senior trade partner is from a dark group, who knows what will wait for you. When you trade peer to peer, digitally, you take risk already.",

I agree with your explanation, but the P2P transactions done on exchange doesn't incur tax deduction from the receiver of the fiat, because from my experience, the fiat it's mostly transferred from the bank account of the person you've been paired with by the exchange, so it's basically like a normal cash entering into your bank account, except from the OP's country they deduct tax from any money entering into his account, which I strongly doubt of that kinf of situation.",

You don’t have any problem if you are from 3rd world country since bank system on country like mine is not strict when it comes to transactions. You just need to declare as “personal” and bank will consider it as friend transfer.On the other hand, country like US will not gonna give you a chance to undeclared any transactions since IRS is very strict while the penalties is insane that makes it easier to comply rather than dodge your tax responsibility.",

Exchange in exactly the same way, but in reverse order: bitcoin  - for money and no one will have any questions for you (unless you start throwing banknotes around ). Fiat money is 100% anonymous (a financial product of the traditional monetary system) so take advantage of this. Use the services of a well-known exchangers aggregator, because they had the direction of exchanging bitcoin for cash (and vice versa).Quote from: kotajikikox on May 25, 2024, 12:31:14 PMFirstly, you are going to need to use a centralized exchange here.

If Bitcoin is legal in your country, then proceeds from Bitcoin investment sales is a good reason for the sum you would be receiving into your account. You can also exchange in installments, so you don't get one huge sum at the same time;For example, in some regions, amounts above $10,000 will be queried, but not $9,900 done twice.Remember to document the txid from when you bought Bitcoin and when you sold.About tax authorities you may need to speak to an advisor who will guide you on how to fill your tax report. Tax laws vary from country to country and even within states in the same country so you'll need to have accurate information on your tax obligations and possible loopholes that allow you spend less.",

Unless you are an entrepreneur who has run a large business and has booked a special customer card from the bank with a large turnover in your account on their platform.If our people are ordinary people with ordinary account activities, it will be very strange if once money enters our account immediately fat, for example 1 BTC directly. That's pretty big. I think, if the existing exchange is legal and can get permission, I think it's easy because there is a limit on the level that can be withdrawn daily and for ordinary taxes have been deducted directly when you process the sale of your BTC.",

Selling through P2P is a perfect way to avoid tax, but we need to know that the traction can be tracked if the bitcoin in question was also purchased from Coinbase before the bitcoin price pumped up and there is a little profit gained from that purchase. If it's in the US, where bitcoin and other currencies are taxed just like other properties in the US, if it's purchased from Coinbase, there will be a capital-gained tax attached to it. You might think you have escaped the tax system until the regulatory authorities request your details from the exchange. As Coinbase has been known to be a good complainant, if the regulatory authorities are released, the person will be forced to face tax evasion charges.",

Then after that ask your relative to sign up some accounts and do certain verification to increase your withdrawal limits so that you can successfully take out your bitcoin balance and you can separate it to multiple accounts so there will be no problem will occur on your side. I sometimes do this on my local wallet providers and so far I didn't encounter any issue especially on the regulations implemented by government to those financial institutions.But just make sure that you didn't exceed on the limits and take it slowly so that there will be no question or other suspicious activity will happen on your end and the wallet provider might ask some requirements to verify your transactions. Just do proper planning into this but you can always choose what's more convenient to you since after all there's a lot of suggestion can be used provided by a lot of people here.",

It's through that there're certain amount of monetary transactions that may occur in a bank account which could attract the attention of the banks management. Literally it's usually huge amount of money that may have not been a usual to that very bank account.This is a very critical issue but some of us may not know about it. I've heard of so many bank accounts being frozen by the authority because a transaction made of it seems strange and suspicious. So while some governments are being against bitcoin, it's a risk of Investors to sell such huge amount of bitcoin and get the money sent to their bank accounts because it could trigger monitoring of the account which the investors would be questioned. And in such case, the Investor could be in trouble.So Op, if the government isn't against bitcoin, I don't think if it'd be a problem if you tell the bank the source where the money came from while the clue to escape that questionable fact by the bank is for the Investor to trade the amount of the huge bitcoin sequentially without running the transaction at a one spot.",

A kid's bank account, which could accumulate a highest amount from. #10 to #100,000 Naira, with a daily transaction limit of #10,000.2. A teenager's bank account, which could afford amount from #100,000 to #1million Naira, and lastly 3. An adult or business bank account, which could accumulate from #1million and above (i.e unlimited). So if by mistake you happen to send money to either a kid or teenager's bank account which has limitations of a certain amount it's likely to accumulate, then in that scenario, you are likely to be asked to come do account upgrade. Which is why here, it's always good to send huge sum of money to these business or corporate bank account. So as to avoid bank managers questioning where the money came from. And this may vary from country to country, so you just have to figure out what works in yours and apply it.QuoteThe thing is that many years ago i bought my bitcoins from a person in cash and he transferred them to me in my presenceHow can i make sure that this money is transferred to my bank card without any problems?Fiats are unlike Bitcoin that could be checked on the Blockchain, which is why it's always good to use p2p market place, where you only release your coin after you have confirmed payment.",

Banks have stopped using the terms; Kid's, teenager and adult account because some people who opened up their accounts when they were teenagers forget to go for upgrades on their account to increase their bank limits when they turn into adults. Banks now call them \"tiers\" or \"levels\". As someone who has a bank account you should know the account level your account is on so that you know the restrictions and limits on your account. If your account is not on a level high enough to accept a big amount of money and you do not want problems you can simply just get someone trusted who has a company account or an account with a higher level or tier so that you can receive your money without any bank challenges or problems. @OP, the person you are trading with also has to be careful with the description they use in the transaction.",
