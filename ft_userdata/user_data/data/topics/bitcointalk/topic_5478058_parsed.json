I believe you know that you can still buy BTC now because, the price has fall down to $41k but it will not take a long time before it will rise to $50k before you can sell if you are satisfied with the price.There are many tactics or system you can use to monitor the market price but the easiest one is through chart and, it will allow you to follow up till you are well convince that time has come to sell your coins you have been hodling for long.",

Therefore, rumors spread easily in those sources, and you will not find a service that provides you with appropriate news at the appropriate time.

There are some reasonable limits within Bitcoin is likely to stay, but there can also be events like the pandemic, unpredictable in advance, that drastically change the price dynamic.So whether you do follow-ups or not is rather a matter of individual preference. What can be really helpful as a reality check is to look at price charts and 'cycles' pointed out by others to see how differently the same data can be interpreted. Also, scale can affect perception a lot.",

Our success depends on evaluating these charts carefully and acting quickly.Bitcoin, for instance. Information on investor mood, regulation, and technology is incorporated into its price chart. We see supply, demand, fear, and greed in Bitcoin's chart, not just lines and patterns. We follow up? Being proactive and anticipating how fresh news will affect these patterns is key. Like detectives, we use chart and world clues to plan our next action. The combination of chart analysis and aggressive follow-up offers us an edge in this volatile crypto market.",

If you watch only charts, you are aware about the effects, but if you watch news and global events, you are going to be aware about the causes of market's oscillations. It allows you to predict with more accuracy what the tendencies of crypto market are, which ways it is going to take. On short run it's hard to predict anything correctly, but on long term we have some good predictions based on news and events. The best example so far is the halving. Having knowledge about this event, gives us the notion a bull run or increasement in prices must happen close to its date, so you prepare yourself for this previously, without a hurry.",

Because crypto market does not follow both sometimes and that's why we can't predict the market 100%. Things are not that easy as they look.Currently we are seeing people making huge profits while we are not and we intend to make profits too by trading and in that sense or hype we forget to know the basic rule of when to trade and when to stop. I have experienced both and made loss too therefore if I have to categorize between both as which should be given first priority is then it will be when to stop or book profit. Same graphs and knowing fundamental are not fully necessary to make profit but it increases our chances to make more profit and decrease the risk involved.",

Because just by going through chart is like investing in any shit coins as we have observed positive trend for FTT and USTC or LUNC recently but we know these are abandoned project and regardless of chart or pattern they will fail.

Before, if they heard a bad news related to crypto they all get panic selling their assets which really hurt the price. Now, if we received a couple of bad news related to crypto it won't affect the price, instead of dumping the price, the price continue to go up. People know that most of the news were just a manipulation. We can identify some of the upcoming manipulations in the market in this site: forexfactory.

Also if you do make out some trades without trying to make use of technicals then you would really be just like a blind person on who cant really be able to see everything and making up trading decisions without any basis is really just that simply a gamble.When it comes to fundamental analysis then it would really be just that normal that you should really backing up with fundamentals on which it would really be strenghten up the possibility of having a good or winning trade but of course every move would really be not a guaranteed thing but somehow applying these things is much more better rather than on making a decision or step without any basis.",
