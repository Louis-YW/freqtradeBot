I know, I know that there might be some who will be against me, but I don't want to judge things very early. I'm not saying that the project is a scam though, but at the same time, I don't want to say that it doesn't because... who knows. I mean I still remember when the term NFT has been called a scam at first because it's a new concept. This project isn't a new concept though because it's all about DAPPs base on their website. Nevertheless, we investors always have this kind of thinking that whenever we see a new crypto project, we always think that it's a scam even though we don't have any evidences to support it.Overall, there are many better projects out there OP that's already established. It would be better for you to put your money there.",

It shows that you don't easily trust a random project that just pop up in the corner like a mushroom. I thought all newbies are only about being a shill.For us to be sure if a project is worthy or not, we should always do our research first. It's only free of cost. It's just that it can only take some of our precious time which others may not like because they are either lazy or busy but they shouldn't gamble instead. It would be better if they will only invest their money in the good and well-known coins because their chance for them to profit are always high on those coins.",

A project with Twitter not up to 1k isn’t serious to me, and also they have noting different to offer so what will make them stand out? Probably nothing . As a newbie stick to well known projects it will help u a lot. Most of these new projects won’t survive long in the Market.",

You must know that 99% of those projects are already dead. So if you have so much money and you investigated the potentials of this project and you're convinced, spend a very little amount for it. But for somebody who's got very limited finances, stay away. It may not be a scam but probably not good enough to succeed big-time. In other words, not worth it.",

I believe, there are favourable projects in the community you can invest now and have something good to achieve before the end of this year but you have to carry out your research to see those favourable projects in the community. I think, there are still old projects you can invest in this season and you will be safe for such project, because their teams are very strong to make things happen for the favour of their investors and for other investors to show more interest in the future.",

But you could ignore or research is. Sometimes a gold can be found on these but make sure to review all and not just put up money. OP's post about the project is nothing special as Ive reviewed it and sounds very simple and same with previous one. Not sure if its a scam but typically not a project you are gonna go and put some $100 to $1k bucks.",

Not a financial advise, but we are just talking about the experience we had, just saying.Quote from: Bitcoin_Arena on October 10, 2023, 11:20:15 PMI have just read through their homepage and there is nothing special they have to offer. Just one of the so many copycats of Ethereum and so old blockchains. These projects are just created to grab money from you newbies in exchange for useless tokens.Since the boom of projects in 2017, we have seen a lot of copy cat Ethereum projects, even some of them are being back up by the Chinese. So yes in the beginning it was good, however, majority of the projects died already. And then the cycle continues, 2019-2020, there was another boom of projects trying to compete with Ethereum. Maybe some of them still exists today. But it doesn't mean that they can really topple Ethereum or even if they are better that Ethereum right now, I think Ethereum will still take the top spot as the best altcoins in terms of investment.",

Unless it is ready to lose then I will not have a problem with this but for me personally I will not try things like this because in my opinion this is not worth it even though I do not judge this project bad but still to be in altcoins or tokens like this I will not do it because what I do is investment not gambling.",
