      "body": "I have 4 or 5 different styles on file. Here is a picture of probably one of the rarest pieces in physical crypto. Its a Caribbean Treasures 1/2 oz silver round with a mintage of 20 with numbers on the rim, but only 1- 3 funded with XRP. I didn't keep a detailed record of how many were funded with Alts, but its very low. Most were bitcoin. The Mary Ola and the Puerto Rico pieces were designed to be funded, used and then you could rebuild them with any of the physical cryptos listed on the back. The hologram was designed to be generic so you could use any of the cryptos without the confusion. You would simply rotate the coin so whatever one was at 12 oclock would be where you would apply the hologram and would signify what the coin was funded with, without scanning it. The picture provided shows that at 12 oclock is BTC. So the placement shows that this wallet was built with BTC keys. Hope that makes sence. ¬† The PR piece has been sold out for awhile and the Mary Olas DIY are still available at $150. The Mary Ola can hodl 11 cryptos listed on the back. They are BTC, LTC, ETH, DASH, THETA, XMR, ADA, XLM, XMR, DOGE and LINK. All funded Alt pieces are rare. The other ones are mainly customer request. They don't exist in large numbers. Very Rare",

      "body": "Thanks! As a collector I love the Altcoin stacking as they are some of the rarest available. As more and more people collect physical crypto pieces, dead alt pieces will be the hardest to find. If people asked me to build it and I was able to, i'd try to make it happen. I think I have a LUNA \"from 100 to 0\" silver tombstone laying around somewhere ¬† . ¬†I always say, even if a crypto goes to zero, a physical piece will never go to zero. Its a piece of history and might even increase in value after death. Here is a few other pictures I found. Enjoy.",

As far as I‚Äôm aware, wasn‚Äôt it just a scam pulled off by Ripple which was propelled to massive value by Bitcoin‚Äôs increase in price and their having a ton of them they shwindled with lies early on?",

XRP is ISO 20022 international messaging standard compatible. Making it compatible with the current financial system that will allow the shift and transition of monetary power into the new. bitcoin acts as the digital alternative to the coming CBDC control grid. Although with transaction monitoring and applied algorithmic transaction tracing paired with KYC the ideals of bitcoin have been corrupted. Satoshi had the vision of an anonymous, decentralized, trustless currency. These three pillars have been undermined significantly. Be warned. Yeah, I've read something on this speculation and I think that is definitely their long term plan. Ripple the company has done a great job forging those relationships as they relate to utilizing XRP for instant settlements globally with big financial titans.On the other note, thanks to Caribbean Treasures for sharing all of those awesome coins/bars! Glad to see there are at least some. I have to agree with you CT, I think that those alt coin pieces are going to retain value whether they go to zero or not simply because of their place in history and collectability",

The article I read said they were centered around cloud mining and trading major cryptos. They over promised and promised gains. People would put money in and they couldn't get it back out. Thats about all I know. I wasn't an investor other than buying their bars. I like them. They look good. I would trade one for a Joan of Arc Alitin Mint piece",
