  "content": "Recession is simply the reduction in economic activities either goods or services. It can hardly be eradicated totally by a country, but its severity can be minimized. Part of its major effect are unemployment and reduced income, with both leading to citizens of the affected country left in abject poverty.Some governments have continuously been looking into ways or passing laws to help reduce the recession or even avert it. Some of these policies have either made help reduce it or most at times worsen the situation. Some of these counter measures are:1. The government instructs the central banks to either print more money or reduces the interest rates just to allow its citizens spend lots on goods and services. This particular measures had backfired in such a way that the countries local currency loses value against foreign currencies since it is in excess circulation.2. Some government results into either reducing the rates of tax or ridiculously increasing its own spending.3. Some government sends out bailout money to help institutions from closing down due to its effects.These policies can have effects on citizens that have there savings in local currencies due to its devaluation. Some local banks even go to the extent of charging depositors of there long time savings rather than paying them for there interest growth.BITCOIN AS A SAFE LANDING AMIDST RECESSIONBitcoin which has viewed to contribute positively to the economy of a nation ranging from creating opportunities for countries with low Banking services, to low cost of transactions within and outside the country of trader, its relatively high transparency during transactions, its ability not to devalue against any foreign currency. With some of these advantages, here are some reasons why bitcoin should be priorities amidst recession.1. Its Diversification: Bitcoin does not have any difference of value when compared to foreign currencies like Euro, pounds and dollars. Its value is same all around the world. These could help the investors/traders not to lose their funds when their respective countries encounter recession and there government implements measures that devalue their local currencies2. Resistance to Inflation: with the continuous printing of money by government which has lead to the devaluation of the fiat currencies, bitcoins total circulation is fixed at 21 million BTC. Inflation hardly affects money at a fixed supply its valuation only increases proportionally to rise in demand.3. Bitcoin's Value: although there are altcoins like Ethereum, bitcoin is best suited to perform better in terms of recession due to it's less volatility, scarcity, safety. In comparison to stock its effectiveness booms and busts the economy due to technical advantages, ability to grow, financial discipline, great community or decentralization.With recession lurking around some countries, bitcoin could be lifeboat for people looking for safe landing without it been influenced by government policies.Although there is fluctuation in bitcoin's price, some as a result of government recent policies on its mining, Its value guarantees less risk for savings than any other coins or fiat currency. 1btc remains 1btcReferenceswazrixfinextra",

It depends very much on people and their finances. Bitcoin is great if you afford to hold for many years.This usually doesn't happen in recession times, since the recession can bring higher prices, loss of jobs, ... forcing people spend their savings (including the bitcoins).So yes, Bitcoin is great for people wanting to have 100% control on their money, if they afford to HODL. But recession complicates the things \"a little\".",

Hopefully BTC will decouple from speculation trends to revert to former trading patterns. In the price of gold we may see the same hedge fund speculation which has caused bitcoin price trends to derail off track.In designing future cryptocurrency amendments might be made for insulating assets from market speculation of the largest investment institutions. That could be a necessary element for maintaining stable market prices which are purely influenced by fundamental market trading mechanics.",

I agree that Bitcoin is still a good investment in the future but if you want to make more profit, better to buy at a cheaper price and sell at a good price, repeat this strategy until bull market, you can have more. For people in most developing countries bitcoin is a very secure source and a reliable investment in this recession season. This is because even if bitcoin drop in price, there is still hope that it would rise again. But when most currencies in developing nations lose value, they never grow to recover their loss. That is why Nigerians prefer to save thier funds in bitcoin than saving it in the naira. The Nigerian currency has lost almost 80% of it's value in few years and there are no speculations or predictions that it would become strong In the nearest future.",

This doesn't mean that it’s going to be very tough, it just means that we are going to see the crashes and that’s going to upset us of course, who wouldn't be upset with the price crashes on their investments, but to know that it is going to be fine is our luxury.I know that the price crashed, and it is a sad thing, I rather see it 100k today, but I have the big advantage to know that it’s going to be 100k eventually one way or another. That type of feeling is the reason why I suggest people to buy and hold bitcoin at all times.",

Many are already preparing for this scenario, with Bitcoin they see this as an opportunity to store their money and wait for the market to recover. I can say that Bitcoin are more safe than to hold fiat money especially if there’s already a high inflation rate in your country, Bitcoin seems to be more stable. Don't expect for stability Don't expect for being safe havenDon't expect for it to be a savior in times of recessionThe best thing to be done is to make yourself find out lots of ways for you to get another source of income.Its true that it would be better not to make your fiat savings do being stored on a bank but rather make out investment that could generate some income on which this could really able to patch up whenever we do face up some difficulties in living.",

But there is a difference between bitcoin and national currency, once the inflation is over, bitcoin will surely rise again and there will be strong rallies but for fiat, it is very difficult to revert to the pre-inflation value, most likely the value will stay the same as in inflation. That is why it is said that fiat loses value over time. All are affected by inflation but holding bitcoin is still more profitable in the long run.",

Because basically every decision is made by each of them, it is based on research and very careful consideration on every thing that might happen in investment. For example, such as risk, because it clearly exists even though it can still be avoided by every investor and for the direction of investing in Bitcoin I think only people who have believed and also certain who dare to make steps and attitudes to investment.",

Their goal is to be able to bring the interest rate to 4.6% by 2023 and now after 3 rate hikes, the interest rate is already at 3%, that means the Fed will have 2 more high interest rate hikes to achieve their target. If they still maintain the view of raising interest rates to control inflation, the world will definitely have a recession, things will get worse in 2023.
