  "content": "Crypto markets are currently doing numbers that have not been seen in the last two months after the entire market cap tanked below $1 trillion, a far cry from the previously recorded $3 trillion. The trend in several coins, especially over the last 24 hours indicates an uptrend. Global crypto market cap currently stands at $1.16 trillionAccording to CoinMarketCap, global cryptocurrency market cap recorded over 6.63% percent increase over the past 24 hours which shoots it to $1.16 trillion, a level that has not been reached in the past 2 months.The market has also been largely green over the past day as BTC crossed $24k, trading as high as $24,660, a significant 6.41 increase, before reverting back to $24,460 as at press time. Second largest cryptocurrency ETH, also rallied 12.72 per cent.ETH’s price increase is attributed to the success of the Goereli testnet merge, the increasing anticipation of the main merge which is just a month away and positive cues from CPI data. ETH crossed $1900 in the last 24 hours but currently trades at $1884 per CoinMarketCapMore Info https://coingape.com/cryptocurrency-market-cap-records-new-2-month-high/amp/",

When we do talk about indicators or technical ones then we can say about correction on being over but we've been indeed moving sideways for how many months now which really makes way more harder to predict on where the price could possibly go.Even though we've seen that we are bit far on 17k support price or all low but still not an assurance that we wont really begoing down on that level thats why im not really that much a fan on following indicators but who knows if this one is the start of recovery or change trend?We are still in month of August which they said as a ghost month and we might be seeing some good movement in next month i suppose.",

But we can't still be very sure that such situation will happen. Remember, we can even see dramatic change over 24 hours. But in any case, you can always prepare yourself what to do today if you believe there will be upcoming bullish run. We are just merely waiting what will happen next to the crypto market. One great news and we may be seeing uptick in the market, who knows?",

This might not be enough but if we see more green candles then that is the confirmation that this market is about to rise again and will soon enter into a bull market. Indicators can tell what’s the trend right now and since we are able to break the first resistance, we can assume that correction is over but a short pull back can still happen before we see the bull trend. Confirmation can be seen by using indicators, analyze the market well and you can be more profitable, don’t be afraid with the correction since its a good opportunity to buy again especially those who miss the drop before. BTC is slowly getting better, let’s see if it can be more consistent this time.",

This implies that the bond markets were correct going back to late June in predicting how much the fed will actually hike. Since crypto follows stocks, this is why we are also rallying. However keep in mind if we get bad news such as surprise hike or high CPI next month then things can quickly reverse.",

      "body": "If the market gets a big green candle, it doesn't mean the bears are over and will be replaced by bullish ones because BTC is still looking for a good and stable position to go higher. At the moment, it looks like the bitcoin price has stabilized at $24k because several times after the increase, the price has returned to its original price of $24k. But we still have to be careful because there is no guarantee the price will stay at that price or go back down deeper.Likewise with ETH but ETH is still trying to stay at the current price and if the price goes down, it won't be too deep. This is also the case with BNB and if this condition persists and BTC is still up and crashing the $25k price, it could mean that ETH, BNB, and other altcoins are about to start a new rally. I hope the scenario is like that",

We couldn't shoot in the dark because the target was completely invisible so there were always two possibilities between going up and going down. This means that any analysis and predictions that others say do not fully guarantee results and you still need to do your own analysis and weigh all the risks.I would say yes if the hype about bitcoin is once again exposed to as many people out there as it was in 2020-2021, but of course this will only last in the short term as we can always expect a correction. Stay alert and consider something good for your investment, and we always say invest as much as you can afford to lose so people realize that risk is always there.",
