  "content": "Can someone please translate and explain to me what writer wanted to say?If I understand correctly, member CoinPayCard.net  is saying that Bitcointalk forum is going down the hill because of me and users like me.He claims that companies don't want to advertise here because of people asking them questions like me.But I am part of 10% of forum, and 90% are good users, but 10% is making forum go down the hill.90% of my posts are worthless and bring no value to forum.He also said I am a bit of delusion?!  He claimed that I ask the same questions 100 times.I can only conclude that CoinPayCard.net is saying that I am the main reason for destruction of Bitcointalk forum, but miracle happened and CoinPayCard.net  came to save the forum from evil.Quote from: CoinPayCard.net on December 31, 2022, 07:31:57 PMYou are a bit of delusion, it thinks. I have answered your question more than clear i this topic: shorturl.at/mxELN[/b] Your question had also absolute nothing to do with the service we provide. And this is what your private message state, as you refer to it. Nothing of significant. If you gave us time, we would have responded to your request to test our cards for free.But unfortunately, you just post random stuff and giving a neutral (negative) feedback because you expect different answers. It's unfortunate, because if I go true your comments on this platform, I see that you do that a lot. 90% of your comments have absolutely no value to bring this forum up, and I believe because of users like you that this forum is going downhill. Because slightest things can trigger you asking the same and same questions 100 times and making your own unfounded opinion that something is not good, untrustworthy or simple not possible without doing any research at first. This is the same reason why companies also don't see this forum fit to advertise, because of your continued negative attacks on anything people post.It is absolute good to question tings, but when you personally are not satisfied with the answer giving, you keep ranting random things. I'ts unfortunate because 90% of the users here are great, giving good options or questions and do research before commenting 100 times on a topic. Your personal message.\"Hi.Do you know when Bitcoin and Litecoin willl be added onCoinPayCard.net website?I am interested in testing when this happens.Cheers.\"Sorry everyone for being so strong to bring down this forum with my 10% evil fellow members.I hope things will be better for good companies in 2023, and they don't have to answer any questions at all.Note that all spam, off-topic, consecutive posting, and all other posts breaking forum rules will be deleted by moderator.",

Here you go:Quote from: CoinPayCard.netYou seem to be deluded, in my opinion. I have already clearly answered your question in this topic: shorturl.at/mxELN Your question had nothing to do with the service we provide.As you mentioned in your private message, you requested to test our cards for free. If you had given us time, we would have responded to your request. However, you have been posting random things and giving neutral (negative) feedback without any basis. It is unfortunate, because based on your comments on this platform, it seems that you do this a lot. In my estimation, 90% of your comments do not contribute any value to this forum, and I believe that users like you are causing this forum to decline. Your tendency to ask the same questions repeatedly and make unfounded opinions without doing any research is causing companies to view this forum as an inappropriate place to advertise.It is important to question things, but when you are not satisfied with the answer given, it is not productive to continue ranting about unrelated topics.On the other hand, 90% of the users here are great, providing valuable opinions or asking well-researched questions.Did you get it now?

How do you not know that they should be able to do whatever they want without any accountability or scrutiny?",
