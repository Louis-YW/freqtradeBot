Creating and listing a token is very easy but is how to secure their token from hackers and other attack that may come when the tokens start againing momentum because I know too well members wouldn't mind putting all they have in that project having the mind that since is from church or our church it's a reliable coin to invest. And again have they also consider the implications if the tokens or coin fails because whatever that happened to coin actually affect the church since christian body's may fully devote their time to put huge resources in that coin. Well, my advise to them is that the members should try their best not to put all trust in that coin because this is cryptocurrency and anything might happened along the line that may bring a enemity across the body's.",

I just hope it doesn't happen that way.I am not against that idea as long as it is not just for some selfish interest; after all, Christianity is supposed to teach believers how to also excel in life with good ideas.

But if the church go de transparent for the business, me I go support the idea of them going into cryptocurrency business. At least the business go de generate income for them.But wetin I don learn here for this thread as a new person wey want to enter bitcoin be say e de possible, for people to create dem own coin.

I like as them launch their own coin. After all it is not against the law of God and man to do something daring and of benefits. Sometime back we witness how the Islamic coin was launched. Am not saying this is religious disparity, am saying everyone is welcomed to partake of the technology of the times. If social media Twitter can be linked with Doge coin, why should even a football club or even a beer barn or liquor store not launch their coin? More than just launching these coins should also be the consideration of market volatilities taking its toll. Will it crash over time, or remain stable for long like Bitcoin? Only the strongest will survive finally.",
