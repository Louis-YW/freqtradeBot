      "body": "You can buy Bitcoin at any time using the DCA method, if your goal is holding Bitcoin for the long term then you don't have to worry about what will happen in the next few months, it is probably going to keep having more value because it is more in demand now compare to years ago. Yet I still believe that understanding the cycle of this market will net you more Bitcoin than just throwing money into Bitcoin at any time, but for someone who can't tell the difference or maybe new to Bitcoin they can start buying using DCA at any time, on the long run it will still yield some profits. Any DCA strategy is acceptable, you just have to choose one that fits your income from your job or business. My advice is that buying Bitcoin through the DCA method tends to be easier for someone who has a steady income/job.",

      "body": "Sometimes people find DCA is less emotional because if you buy and later it drops 10% then you don't feel the pain as much as if you'd purchased in a lump sum.  Of course if it goes up 10%, you don't gain as much, but people feel the pain of loss more than the pleasure of gain.   If your holding term is long enough then it doesn't matter all that much.  Years vs days or weeks for example.  For the most part, anyone who has purchased (or mined) at any time since 2009 with the exception of a few months at the end of last year is ahead of the game.",

Before you know it in few years, you will have some good amount of bitcoin in your portfolio. Bitcoin price waits for no man, likewise time. I believe that the price of bitcoin will increase overtime because bitcoin is still in her early days.",

Many more?I think every investor has their own way to do their BTC accumulation for a long time, but what is often discussed here maybe some of us are mostly with the DCA method that's what I do.At least by buying once a week - once every two weeks or once a month depending on the money available.",

I have always thought that the most important aspect of investing is understanding your financial capability as an investor and choosing the best option that matches it. This should determine whether you DCA, invest a lump sum, or use a combination of both methods, depending on your strategy, investment goals and risks tolerance. I just started my Bitcoin journey, and DCA is all I can do for now, not because I am scared of investing, but because that's my financial strength for now.",

With DCA strategy you can budget a little amount of money from your salary or your business and buy, I think most of Bitcoin's investors use the DCA because you can buy at any time that pleases you with any amount you can afford.",

It’s important that you don’t limit your portfolio to what it’s always being as, stagnated growth isn’t really growth. Bitcoin might increase in value as a result of you having to hold what you’ve got but then, you would get even more should you continue to buy.DCA method to Bitcoin investment is always advices because it in a way ensures you keep buying. It’s more like you having to set aside a portion of your income for Bitcoin investment and it disciplines you to keep at it rather than, wait on a certain price or a lump sum.",

It is damn stressful to invest your life savings in one asset and then wait. That’s not the healthiest and smartest way of making an investment.Ideally, you want to dca and have a diversified portfolio of assets. So even dca’in on btc alone isn’t enough if you don’t want to get shaken off during market downturns.",

DCA is popular because most people live from paycheck to paycheck so to lump sum buy they'd have to either sell something or get a loan, which might be scary for some of us. This method allows you to get a few bucks off your monthly wage and turn it into a long term investment.If you're one of those lucky people with some savings in fiat, just spend some of that to by. Many current bitcoiners used to be stock traders, holders of precious metals and government bonds. If you're like that just convert some of that into bitcoin. In other words: broke -> DCAwealthy -> lump sum to get some exposure and then either buy the dip or DCA.",
