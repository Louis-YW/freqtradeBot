I do gamble at work yet I think it is super bad luck when doing so by playing slots,at least that happened to me while I am not caring much about the amount of money my company pays me,they pay me the minimum amount to stop leaving the company not a cent more,it is a dream shatter,the salary is the drug they give us to stop following our dreams as they say,so I only not play at work because of bad luck.I do in fact gamble at work and it is only to place sport bets,I analyse a bit and then place those sport bets in a short amount of time.As for the loan it is always the worse possible thing a gambler can do.",

If you waste these hours for gambling, it is a bad habit. This depends on your type of work and how much gambling can impact your job. I don't see how spending ten minutes to place sports bet will affect someone working as backoffice staff in a servicing company whose job is routine and not pressing. For people handling critical operations that requires  high psychological focus, gambling may be discouraged.

It is a very bad move and can even produce life threatening conditions in future when loan recover agents knock your door. This is the worst thing any gambler should do. There is high chance such funds will be lost. I have tried it several times when I was less experienced and it never always end well. Gambling should be done with spared funds, money one can afford to loose. No one can afford to loose borrowed funds (money they do not have). To add to what you already suggested,  gamblers should learn to take a break after series of losses or after a major win. This is good for the psychology.",

Although this is not advisable, for me, as long as I can pay the loan and I would gamble only what I can afford to lose, I guess it's okay. We have different ways of managing our funds, and I believe what's bad is if we don't know how to handle our loans.",

It is a very bad move and can even produce life threatening conditions in future when loan recover agents knock your door. Gambling is always risky no matter where or how it is played. It is very important for a person that gambling should be taken only for fun and not as a means of earning, so that gambling cannot harm or make him addicted. Both loans and gambling are very risky and if these two happen together it becomes more risky.  So one should never gamble with a loan. And if you gamble at work, besides causing problems at work, the chances of gambling losses are high, so it is definitely not a good idea to do either.",

The suggestion that I would consider reasonable for people who are not addicted to gambling is simply to view it as a form of entertainment, whether offline or online. Don't expect to get rich from gambling games because the few people who are considered professionals in this field will not encourage people to play regularly. Perhaps because I live in a family with a tradition of gambling for many generations and witness tragic situations, I don't want to become an addict.",

It gives you this rush of excitement and makes you feel good, at least in the moment and then you reflect on it and think… what the hell did I just do that for right? You can try NAD+ IV therapies which can be administered with an intravenous catheter which significantly reduces symptoms for relapsing back into addictions. Nad+ is a part of the cells that make up our body and when those die, we age. So a simple NAD+ boost will change your life forever and can help greatly reduce addiction recovery and relapsing.   The downside is that you have to be aware not only about the emotional triggers but also about geographical locations and settings (Las Vegas is a place I will never go). After it all it takes one moment of weakness, which I have daily, one moment of letting your guard down and you’re back to square one. Be prepared to deal with relapses as it will happen treat it as a learning moment, but be honest and try to avoid the situation in the future.",

People should avoid playing gambling no matter what cravings he is experiencing if he doesn’t feel well or not in the well physical mood because your sense of decision making will become dull no matter how good you are on self control during your normal condition.Also playing while you have other things to do is on my list since this will make your attention divided that will give you confusion while playing which is very dangerous on gambling.",

A common mistake for most gamblers as they don't know much about the game but still continue to try, resulting in an expensive mistake. Better to focus on the game you know more and have experience and build up a strategy using your experience. Aside from that, avoid ignoring the bonuses given by the house. Gamblers should know the importance of the bonus money and how they spend it to know about its potential. Make it possible to be eligible for the bonuses, make use of it, and enjoy the benefits of your bonuses.",

If you waste these hours for gambling, it is a bad habit.Yeah, gambling while performing your work functions is against the work ethic. It doesn't only lead to loss of manhours but it could reduce productivity. It will lead to distraction or loss of concentration which can lead to a reduction in work performance. Lack of concentration could also lead to costly mistakes or even industrial accidents. But if it is not against the work rules, it can be acceptable to bet doing free time or break. It will not be out of place to place or check a bet during break especially if you are gambling responsibly. Quote2) Do not take loan to gamble: Some young guys are so irresponsible that they take loans to gamble. It is a very bad move and can even produce life threatening conditions in future when loan recover agents knock your door. The number one rule in gambling is to gamble with what to have and can afford to lose. Gambling wins are not certain in spite of an accurate analysis or uncommon skills. Gambling is not a business that one can seek loans to establish or expand. If you don't want to be a chronic debtor gamble only with the money you have. Taking loans to gamble is a clear indicator of gambling addiction and such a person should seek professional or medical help. Let me add that we shouldn't gamble because we are chasing losses. Gambling should also be avoided when one is sick or intoxicated by any substance. When one is busy or occupied with some important activities, gambling should be avoided because it could lead to costly mistakes.",
