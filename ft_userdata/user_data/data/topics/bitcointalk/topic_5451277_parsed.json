Can he bad the actual cause of a huge financial collapse? Of course, the SBF is not the cause of the huge financial collapse, it is simply the first victim and the weakest link in the chain that could not withstand the pressure of the Fed's monetary tightening. Raising rates is the real reason. In a decade of extremely low interest rates, banks have become too relaxed and accustomed to a policy of abundance of cheap money. Now they have to pay for it.",

There is no link between SBF and his former FTX with what is happening in banks and financial institutions that are not related to crypto or had dealing with him and his former company. This could only affect the crypto space, and of which its effect has been weighed since months ago.This is practical, and what is happening to banks is as a result of their poor management and regulation, they were not overseen well. The US government and FED have exposed some of these banks which is what is leading to ripple effects.While a few want to use the bailout funds to restructure and strengthened themselves, so they reveal their condition easily. This is shameful, US banks are not to be trusted.",

The total size of SBF and FTX collapse is around $10B. But a lot of that is air-inflated shitcoins.

Let's not forget the failures of the past, and most recently, the economic crisis of 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers. This is correct. If you want to measure capability to cause a global financial crisis, take the total assets of an entity and subtract them by the liabilities. This applies to private companies and entire countries. Countries obviously have large debt issues so they bear risk of causing global financial issues the most. It tends to happen when their economies enter recession. The only players that actually matter are the U.S., China, and EU. If any one of these regions have issues, it can create a domino effect. FTX isn't enough within itself to affect the global economy on a level that'd be cause for concern.",

He may have caused a lot of changes in the crypto market, but I don't think it's that severe that even the big banking institutions around the world are gravely affected. The banking industry falling apart is, IMO, more of an internal issue on how the banking system works and not really about crypto gaining prominence all over. What I cannot comprehend is how these banks lose a lot of money but still are capable of operating and not getting behind bars. A lot of banks have gone under in the past but are still saved somehow, whereas other businesses are just left to rot with no aid whatsoever from the government.",

Maybe it was all a coincidence. On the surface, FTX might seem correlated with the upheaval of massive bank runs prior to its closure. But in essence, bank systemic risk exposure contributes greatly to the extent its contagion is widespread. I think what I can speculate besides the obvious systemic risk is that FTX does greatly contribute to the panic that initially going on within the banking sector, also do in mind, the recent technology industries slowdown and macroeconomic condition. In the first event of the Silvergate and SVB worrying conditions are happening at almost the same time, so it is expected the public was indeed panicking. It does correlates but does not become the main factor of the collapses.",
