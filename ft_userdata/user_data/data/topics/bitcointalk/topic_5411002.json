  "content": "Hi everyone, One of the main reasons I love Bitcoin is having peace of mind knowing that my money is safe.Throughout the years, I have gone from using closed source hot wallets like Coinomi to using hardware wallets, running my own node and generating my own seed using dice.Lately I've seen several users on Twitter that oppose hardware wallets heavily. They claim that the wallet manufacturers can eventually rugpull everyone and there's nothing we can do about it.The argument is that there is no way for users to know that the firmware signed by the maker is the one that is actually running on the device (only that the device claims that its running that).In addition to that, we might be leaking our private keys through our signatures because of malicious nonce generation. This means that everything appears to be fine to the user, but the attacker can scan the blockchain for signatures generated using these nonces and could potentially figure out our private keys. This is explained here: https://shiftcrypto.ch/blog/anti-klepto-explained-protection-against-leaking-private-keys/ and here: https://medium.com/blockstream/anti-exfil-stopping-key-exfiltration-589f02facc2eI am no expert in these topics so this is why I came here.Are these worries warranted? What are the chances of losing our bitcoin even if we do everything right: buying the wallet from official website, running our own node, generating our own seed, checking app signatures, etc.If all of this is true and COLDCARD can suddenly rugpull everyone, what hope does Bitcoin have? If using Bitcoin Core on an airgap device with Linux is what's needed to keep your money safe, how will this ever be adopted globally? Are these FUDers being overly paranoid? Or are we all dumb for trusting hardware wallet companies?",

But this doesn't mean the HW are unsafe; as I said, they've passed the test of time and the companies seem to indeed care more to sell their hardware (and keep a good name) than stealing from people.",

We all want to have that \"our keys, our coins\" mantra in our lives. Providing air-gapped computers would be more expensive and a hassle than a hardware wallet. It would help if you made sure of the official site where you are getting your devices because this is where hackers can step in. I believe you need to be still careful every step because that's where they usually strike.You know that the private keys won't leave your device, that's on HW, and that's the practice. It's a little secure device made for that specific purpose, and I think trusting the right companies that deliver exemplary service is crucial.It's not overly paranoid, but it should still be investigated if there's something sketchy about it.",

You are watching to much sci-fi movies and Coldcard has nothing to do with someone having hope for Bitcoin, it's just nonsense.First, you have hardware wallets with open source firmware code so anyone can inspect and see what is happening, there are no hidden stuff for Trezor, Codlcard, Keystone, Passport, etc.For Trezor you can even identify all hardware components and make your own DIY device, but they are also working on new prototype secure element chip, that should improve security a lot.Coldcard is not exactly open source anymore, but you can still verify it's code and I don't think it's dangerous to use it, unless some major bug happens.Closed source hardware wallets like Ledger, Safepal, etc are much more dangerous, and you could never know if they have some secret junk inside, so I would stay away from them.Speaking about open source firmware, you should be aware that almost all laptops and computers have closed source bios, so it's much bigger chance of something leaking from there, unless you have coreboot or something like that.Intel and AMD are constantly sending information and they have whole hidden mini operating system inside with Intel Management and AMD equivalent.Now, keeping laptop offline can help, but it's not perfect protection at all.",
