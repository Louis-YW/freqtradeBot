  "content": "A little bit about Bitcoins future. Hope this will be helpful for those who are new at crypto.# When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin he put its supply at 21 Million. And already 19 million Bitcoin has been mined. For this limited supply the purchasing power will increase day by day. Bitcoin follows the low of supply and demand. when the demand for Bitcoin increases, the price increases. Now Bitcoin is accepted as currency in many places. From donating to a church to buying a Lamborghini, everything can now be done with Bitcoin. That means its acceptance is slowly increasing. And its good for Bitcoin.# Bitcoin follows gold. Like Gold has limited supply on earth and its becomes harder harder to mine new gold. This is why gold has been able to retain its value for more then 6000 year's. And same as gold Bitcoin mining will be harder then before because of the halving event. And If we look at the previous chart of Bitcoin, we can see after each halving event bitcoin break its previous high. So it is expected that bitcoin will break its previous high again after the next ( May 4 , 2024 ) halving event.# We moved from using Web 1.0 technology to Web 2.0 technology. Still using Web 2.0 technology. The biggest advantage or feature of Web 3.0 is the integration of Blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is all about cryptocurrency in the transaction process. So the future of Bitcoin is bright.Even if the market is in a bad state right now, it will be okay. There are many other good points which may not be mentioned in full here. If anyone wants to know better about these things. I am giving the link of some articles from where you can know more details.Full details about Bitcoin = https://time.com/nextadvisor/investing/cryptocurrency/what-is-bitcoin/About supply and demand = https://river.com/learn/how-is-the-bitcoin-price-determined/About halving = https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-halving/#:~:text=The%20Bitcoin%20halving%20is%20when,counteract%20inflation%20by%20maintaining%20scarcity.Forgive me if i say something wrong. And tell me if you like it, Then I will try to come up with something better. Thanks for reading.",

It seems that the days of the \"wild west\" in the field of cryptocurrencies will sooner or later come to an end. An example of this is the story with tornado cash. Therefore, it's certainly great to inspire new arrivals, but you also don't need to lose your head and be aware that any outcome is possible with bitcoin. Despite how much people would like this technology, it is not known how it will all end. It is important to consider the risks and not become a blind fanatic.",

Regardless Bitcoin isn't how it was 4 years back and beyond, the topic on Bitcoin is far broad and I read that we would also be seeing more billboard showcasing more about Bitcoin.Also I must stand to differ with your comparison on Bitcoin and Gold. Gold is a natural resource from the earth crust, and even the most experienced Gold miners can not determine the maximum supply or availability of Gold, but Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million. They also differ in their system of mining.",

Gold is a natural resource from the earth crust, and even the most experienced Gold miners can not determine the maximum supply or availability of Gold, but Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million. They also differ in their system of mining. Wow... 21 million of a digital asset as you call it that's already suffered countless hacks, most of which people are completely unaware of. Exchanges, as well as the most experienced individuals having their digital currency stolen or seized by hackers and governments. Public ledger - I can see exactly where  vs. you not having any clue about where my precious metals are. 6000 years of a physical hard asset that you can actually hold when the lights go out that has lasted through every collapse known to the world, vs a 14 year old man made invention. And if history is any indicator of who's going to be correct, let time and experience show you yet again.Lastly, you won't see anyone using bitcoin or any cryptocurrency for that matter unless computers, phones, mining equipment (which require those natural resources from the earth's crust) in order to work are used in that equipment, so in that aspect the precious metals are used constantly to supply you with computers, and ALL electronics equipment. Without gold & silver being used, you have no bitcoin - as simply put as I can explain. Those precious metals are what make your crypto-currencies possible. Pay attention to the bigger picture, and not just some narrow minded view because you want to see bitcoin move a certain way.No Gold & Silver = no electronics = no bitcoin. So lets review whats more important here. Precious metals are limited, but what we do know is that they are constantly used and dumped and can never be re-mined. Which means those precious metals are gone forever. Opinion: I prefer to hold and feel something in my hand vs looking at on a computer screen, if my internet, power, or miners have problems good luck transacting.Gold and silver are only formed when a star explodes, lets see a person try to replicate that. The universe determined that's what actual money is. The governments and banks know this, every situation in history the government always wins against their populations - so why wouldn't you do what they do? What do you see them hoarding and buying in record numbers now more than ever?",

Better than your insight into the direction crypto-currencies are heading. It's ponzi scheme. Try beating trading bots and miners, or how about those government regulations that are crippling the digital space... Have fun at the bottom of the pyramid where they will put you when all is said and done. Your wallets will be hacked and taken in the not too distant future. Mark my words. The NSA is going to take everything. You ever played musical chairs? This era we are heading into will teach you a potentially valuable lesson.I'll be the guy telling you \"I told you so\". - Not fear mongering, I don't care if you have bitcoin... Keep it, sell it, doesn't matter to me. I'm not invested so I'm not biased like 99.99% of people posting here.",

You are 100% correct. The mentality here is \"I'm going to ride it up, then sell to someone at a higher price than I paid\"... Let's see how well crypto's age vs inflation, hacks, unknown exploits to the general public, the NSA's involvement in bitcoin - already reverse engineered, people think their online funds are safe, sad mistake that the herd will soon realize - if you don't hold it, you don't own it!...  Some people are about to learn a hard lesson in economics. If bitcoin is worth $1 trillion each, lets see the look on peoples' faces when a loaf of bread is $20 trillion...All I see here is the FOMO mentality, possibly from poor bastards that lost everything in their pension and/or stocks and are $1 away from committing suicide.The only REAL MONEY is outlined in our constitution - Article 1 Section 10. Pretty sure it doesn't say bitcoin or cryptocurrency, so to the advocates, good luck re-writing history!https://ibb.co/dLSX52r",
