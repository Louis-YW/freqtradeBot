And as you can see we discuss about fee per vByte, not per total.So the total fee depends on addresses used and the size (in vBytes) of the transaction.If you want to have very low fee you have to:* use pure segwit address for both input and output* use only one input* have only one output (i.e. no change, i.e. entirely spend the input for the output + tx fee)As you can see, this kind of transactions don't really have many use cases (apart of sending to self and maybe donations).",

Regardless of what nodes will relay, as long as the transaction is valid, if a pool is willing to include said transaction in its found block, it has the potential to be confirmed, if the pool is aware of the transaction.

Still, nice catch!I think pools will eventually start selling their block space (off chain) to large consumers of blocks space (for example to exchanges) via long term deals. Today, pools sell their block space (off chain) to retail consumers, often at a huge markup, however the required tx fee is currently so low, that most likely, few need to do this.",

In other words they could just pay a higher on-chain fee in first place.

The high fee is really more for technical help than for including the tx in a block.Pools could sell block space well into the future to companies who expect to need a lot of block space in the future. This will allow both the pool and the consumer of block space to have a more predictable revenue and expenses. Today, transaction fees to get transactions confirmed, even on a next-block basis is very close to zero, but this will not always be the case.",

The point of entering into these types of arrangements is to ensure that costs/revenue are predictable over long periods of time. The \"pool\" could sell something similar to what we know today as a 'cloud mining contract', or the pool could own the hardware for its own account, or was in some other situation in which, this type of arbitrage would not be possible.",
