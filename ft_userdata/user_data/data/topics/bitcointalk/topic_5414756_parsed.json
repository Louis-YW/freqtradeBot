He has had such unwieldy, unchecked power for so long, that people will ALWAYS follow his advice, even though it is always wrong! Somehow plebs being plebs means they will never catch on to this... he can continue it forever. He's been consistently wrong for almost 15 years! Its remarkable.",

It’s funny to see a token like this since we already know how he fails on most of his trades but I don’t think creating this kind of token is a good idea, if this token will accept money from investors I think this is wrong. Any other information about this token?",

So you can ride with them.  Considering it’s current volume, i guess many are having fun to be part of this new pump and dump token and ready to take the risk despite of a possible rug pull because we know, this token is just created for one purpose to correct the speculation of Cramer. Well, you can enjoy dealing with this token but I suggest to be more careful, the volume looks attractive but it’s too risky.",

I mean just look at its name and its description but thanks for the link, its useful for those who didn't know the origin of the coin. It gives them an overview if they will like to support this coin or not but for if you are a serious trader or a long term investor then I think meme coins like this should be avoided as they are very risky.",

If this gains hype, it can give some really nice profits but if it fails, you will lose all money if we invest in it.",
