  "content": "In terms of current miner prices, availability, hashrate generated, and miner longevity. Which of the two systems makes more sense when it comes to getting the most Bitcoin rewards?The prices of the T19 Hydro, including the Antspace, are far below those of the S19 XP with immersion cooling system. With the S19 XP could be generated by custom MinerOS/PSU significantly more Hashrate. However, this would make the S19 XP equal or even more expensive in terms of power costs. Then there is the problem with the thermal paste that is washed out with immersion cooling over time and leads to more maintenance. Furthermore, the T19 Hydro uses water for cooling, which is always available. With immersion cooling, a special liquid is needed which also leads to extra costs.",
