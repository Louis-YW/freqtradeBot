You will have to get yourself ASIC to mine bitcoin, like S19 Pro, taking note that they consume more electricity which you have to calculate to know if you should mine bitcoin or not, or to just invest instead.",

      "body": "I wonder why some users ask questions like this. I'm pretty sure I've seen a few threads asking whether they can mine BTC with their CPU/laptop before. Is there a trend on social media where people share how they mine Bitcoin with their phone or something? Sure, lucky/lottery mining exists but using a laptop is probably a bit overkill, especially if your device consumes a considerable amount of electricity. Might as well consider buying BTC regularly or look for other alternatives OP.",

The laptop doesn't have enough fans or a way to cool down the CPU and GPU of the laptop so it's impossible that the laptop will make your profit on mining. It is way more better if you apply in a captcha job to earn bitcoin than mining.",

      "body": "Even though you can do Bitcoin mining using a laptop, we don't think this will have any good results, instead it will have a negative impact on your laptop device, basically making the GPU / CPU work full time without stopping it makes the laptop problematic, the components that the laptop has will not stand the imposition of continuous performance, besides the laptop fan is not able to keep your CPU cool while working hard and full time, this means that the work of mining Bitcoin with a laptop or other device related to the CPU / GPU is not effective for mining These bitcoins.Op, don't push this too much, we don't recommend it, and it's back to Op's decision.We recommend suggestions from us. If you really want to do Mining, you can do it with the help of ASIC, but this ASIC performance requires higher electricity, maybe you should pay attention to the cost of electricity in the area and calculate it with the results to be obtained, it requires a good strategy here and decide whether to mine Bitcoin or not.",

So what i want to tell you that is never try mining on a laptop unless for educational purposes  buy bitcoin and hold it think is better",

I can't comment if it's profitable or not, because I don't have any info on where you are located, what is the electricity price in your country etc. Any old CPU/GPU have far lower energy efficiency. It's safe to assume it's not profitable, unless electricity price on your location is extremely low.It is not only about if it is profitable --the question is how long his laptop will survive, it perhaps blow your laptop away on hashrate to mine that requires high power. I don't think you can even mine 1 sat in a day especially if your laptop has lower specs. It should be proper mining rigs that have a cooling fan that blows on the GPU. Your laptop will overheat, the consumption could be 300 watts of power which I think your laptop will not last long even 1 day. However, just try it --it could be in altcoin but not on bitcoin.",

A used Ebit E12 with 44TH now costs roughly 270$ to 290$ which I believe your laptop should be able to cover. But electricity-wise, make sure that you have a cheap electricity bill in your home. There is also the Innosilicon T2T turbo with 37TH but costs more than the E12, the lowest I got mine is 450$.",
