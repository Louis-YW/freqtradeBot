  "content": "This post is best suited in Bitcoin Discussion Board, But I decided to make it here so that it will reach more Newbies and they can learn from it.I found this Bitcoin Address \"1DarkStrRagcDjWtsPGxkav4WG3poLXzDS\" which belongs to DarkStar_.I also found this Bitcoin Address \"1NinjabXd5znM5zgTcmxDVzH4w3nbaY16L\" which belongs to TryNinja.Initially, I never knew it was possible to incorporate a username or part of it into an Address, the addresses above looked very cool, unique and outstanding to me, so I wanted one of such but I didn't know how to go about it, I didn't even know what such an address was called, I went into research, and through google search, I found an article on one of this news outlet sites which brought be back to this topic on the forum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25804.0.From this, I discovered such Bitcoin address(es) are called Vanity Address, and if you also took notice of the date the above post was made which dates back to 2011, it is evident that such addresses is almost as old as Bitcoin itself.I am interested in having my own Bitcoin Vanity address, but the procedures of getting one (according to the thread I mentioned above) seems a bit complicated to understand, and since the thread dated from way back 2011 and we are currently in 2022, I want to assume that by now, there might be new and updated ways to get such an address that is less complicated.EDIT:- I Feel I Should Add This.What Is A Vanity Address?A bitcoin vanity address is the crypto equivalent of a personalized license plate, with a portion of its 26-35 alphanumeric characters closely mirroring the name of the wallet’s owner. For fundraising, collecting tips or soliciting donations, having a bitcoin address that’s synonymous with its owner can be advantageous, despite the privacy trade-off this entails.Definition sourceDo you have any idea?, lets discuss and learn together.",

But the same goes for any other address. Anyone can create an address that is identical to someone else's in the first few characters. Even so, I still think that such addresses are cool, for example for accepting donations or using in online profiles.Quote from: Fivestar4everMVP on July 17, 2022, 09:30:01 PMIs there not a way to make it completely impossible to create another vanity address that bears the same initials with one that's already created before?, like it is when you get an error like \"this username has been taken\" when trying to create a username that matches with another username in a forum .

This might be a case of it depends.If used for payments there are ways to make things memorable - people like finding patterns from what is said about trading so why not make them?If you can find a few stand out symbols then it becomes a lot harder for people to replace your address with another. (you might have to make a few addresses for this to work well though - and use the one it works best for).3 letter words are often fairly easy to find in addresses and would make them harder to believably replicate for users paying attention to what they're doing.",

The chances are slim, but still possible.The only thing that could've made that address generation possible would be perhaps an email address I used because I had to tie 2FA to that wallet. That's the only plausible explanation I would've for that. To be honest, I'm sure I wouldn't have even noticed the peculiarity of that address if I hadn't read and known about vanity address to be somewhat customized like number plates. It would've passed like any regular address before me if not that I often take note of the first four letters and last four of my wallet addresses in order to check for any malware changing wallet address from clipboard. Well, I guess (I'm thinking, anyway) Blockchain did that to say a little thank you to a loyal customer like me.",
