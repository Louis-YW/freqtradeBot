Ah wait, Craig is satoshi. So he has lol.Don't take it seriously. Craig can never prove himself as satoshi because he isn't satoshi",

It seems the guy really had some mining interest and was working on a project in the domain bitcoinpays.com. Everything is clear that at some point he got into greed and started thinking ways to fake himself satoshi ðŸ¤£Where is bitcoin SV?

He didn't had account connected to his name, like some Bitcoin developpers. But nobody can't know whether he had account with other username.Don't know why, but I was sure that he had account here. But actually, same things like about Sassam can be said about Faketoshi. But you can try to contact Dr. Wright and ask him about Bitcointalk account .",
