Also you should not trust anyone online to open your wallet or exchange just to recover because you are just giving them permission to scam you more. You are easy to convince and using unknown exchange. You should start changing yourself by using only trusted platfor and avoid giving away your account info.",

Being totally in charge of your funds and managing it as to how you see fit remains the idea. The cryptospace is mainly enveloped by trust and reputations. With both ends focused on keeping there bit but not scammers. This is why it's best you use the secured sites for your downloads and tradings.When your not sure at OP, ask questions and don't jump to seek too good to be true profits by staking.",

I never heard about an exchange name Hantec. Where do you get this kind of exchange and are you not familiar on Binance? I suppose it's Hantec Markets, it's a FCA licensed fx broker, but I wonder if  OP used them and not a clone, or someone impersonating them, it wouldn't be the first time:https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/regulation/fca-issues-scam-warning-as-hantec-markets-site-cloned-twice/",

Thats why they gave u another details entirely. If you are used to using CEX instead of DEX. Stay away from investments of cryptos. If you check old exchanges like Binance, MEXC Global and Huobi, you will not find any kinds of investment there. What you can see if Defi staking or Liquidity Mining. Normally, I do Defi staking on MEXC and its been safe for years now.Quote from: Blisszi on February 10, 2023, 01:25:22 PMIn another occasions, I was trading quietly on Hantec when I decides to involved myself with their investment platform where they offers me a lot of interest, I was so excited that it was keep coming, so I summoned mind to increase my investment on bitcoins with them, I put both my capital and all the interest I have earned from them, then after a while an issues system glitch came onboard, from that I was able to access my account, before I could realized the site is shut down.Honestly, I dont even know that any exchange like Hantec once exist. This show that you were really obsessed with high interest rate from a Ponzi website by an unknown group of people. Im glad you now understands at least a little. But the deep truth is that. There is no such thing as investment platform. Its either ponzi or scam.",

So far, people have been victims of scam sites with huge percentage benefits upon getting registered and when they do register they get blinded by the give away and quickly make deposit without any proper research on the where they have made deposit of their funds. After such mistake and funds gone, they would start complaining and shouting scam site when they had failed to do the needful and due diligence on where they are are making investment. Yes names you have mentioned here are likely not known. They are not popular to say  and their bonus percentage is shabby to hear about. As an investor, there are level of percentage benefits that should warrant you to conduct a findings in respect to where you want to invest your funds in but it seems doing that is a waste of time on your part.Well, u believe you have learnt from your mistakes and are smart now. You can now be able to detect scams and genuine investment. This should be an eye opener to all.",
