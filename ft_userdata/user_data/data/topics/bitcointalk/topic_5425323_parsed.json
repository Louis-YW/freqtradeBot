      "body": "That is a unbelievable price and it’s huge sale looking at the minted NFT for this show. I mean 2000 NFT sand price for each of them is around 350 bucks. That is 700k USD man!! It’s insane how huge amount of money is flooding into the crypto market all the time. I’m especially jealous of Bored Apes because they are making noise everywhere and investors are actually following their trends. This is so simple strategy. They have Cool brand name now and they have valued themselves to the moon. So whatever price tag they will put it’s gonna be liked by investors. These days investors would think 350 buck is nothing but collectively its huge pre sale for these companies. Wondering how far they gonna get with this NFT stuff.",
