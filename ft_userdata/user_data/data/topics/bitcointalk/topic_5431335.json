I wouldn't put 10k all in 1 hand, but I would be playing $50-100 hands to start and see where the session takes me. You could go more risky and try spinning some slots for large amounts per spin but you might not do so well that way. You have less control on slots.",

      "body": "I'd stick to sports betting and just wait for games that I know fully and bet on them. IMO it's way safer and the risk can be handled even better on a lot of matches. Also, the bet amount that I will be using is conservative if the game that I placed a bet on is something that I'm not a 100% certain, whereas on games that I am confident about the outcome I can go ham and bet as large as I can. Sports betting is, IMO, the only safer way to get that 10k btc further towards the 65k btc mark. But then I can always disagree to do that on behalf of my friend.",

It'd probably take months for me to do so unless I go crazy and did a really big bet when I'm feeling lucky. If possible, then sports betting is also an option as well, but then again I'd only ever bet on big tournaments of Apex lately, which is still in June (I only watch the championships most of the time).  On one hand, though, I'm more likely to make it 0 than even double it based on my experience.",
