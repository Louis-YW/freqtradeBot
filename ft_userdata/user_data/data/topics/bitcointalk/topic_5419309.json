  "content": "The recent tremendous bullish momentum BTC experienced has really given many persons some relieve, cause the strength it gained at about $20600 above was something we didn't look out for within the very week it did, based on how the previous months has been nothing short of a rough epileptic and boring time for BTC price ranging around $19,000 which drastically affect many other coins values especially when it hitted $17,600 sometime ago.Analysing the BTC price some days ago on the daily chart in reconciliation to the bull momentum it enjoyed within the past few days and still fluctuating around $20300 and $20600 the past few days, for many persons, the impression of buying long wouldn't be a bad idea as BTC value could hit at $22,400 presumably above by January or February  2023 based on personal speculations. What do you think? Do you also see the BTC  promising price future am seeing irrespective of the great role  volatility  plays in the market, and shouldn't be undermined as price can go south at any seconds or am I just the only one seeing it.",

      "body": "Obviously, the price will gonna rise in the future because there are already lots of things happening with bitcoins and so far, it's more positive news than negative. The closer we are to bitcoin halving the more we see a roller coaster price in the market just before the next bull runs. That's why it's better to invest after you make sure that you can hold long enough until that happens. The short-term investors happened to get used to it. When you have already been in this market for too long, you will be able to earn even though the market is not looking good at all, it's just based on long-time experience and some little luck too.",

      "body": "Something good will surely happen in the future, since the bear season is still flowing in the market for those that missed it to use this bear period to buy and hold for bull market to come before they can sell. Many researchers has predicted that the price of Bitcoin will surely make a massive move in this month of November, which there are some signs in the crypto market that, show that bull season is very close to bitcoiners to enjoy in the community. If you are still waiting for Bitcoin price to decrease more than $20k in this month of November before you can buy, I guess, you will miss the opportunity because the price is preparing to increase higher for both traders and investors to experience bull market.",

Anybody can predict anything, he has a fair chance to be right  We will know for sure only after \"the moment\" has passed.Clearly with every day passing we're getting a bit closer to the halving, hence to an end of bear market, hopefully.Quote from: franky1 on November 03, 2022, 03:21:44 PMenergy prices increaseI am hoping for some months the energy price rise be visible in bitcoin price.

It didn't happen, or at least not in an obvious way (maybe that's why we didn't see lower lows?).the lowest lows. are miners that can still mine for profitthe average underlying(value) cost was about $15k. but the market price did not touch that pointthose mining this month are still on contracts of prices of 2021+ energy costs thus they have not been impacted yet. and thus the underlying value cost has not hit muchi personally am still locked into a deal of 2021 prices. its the hashrate competition that has hit those low laying miners that can afford to mine. not the energy price(this autumn quarter the underlying value cost is about $16k)however layers above that are the less efficient miners. the ones i prefer to call hobbiests with higher costswhen their energy prices went up. yes it affected their mining costs and yes they would have been more willing to bu at the $18k market price. but their real life fiat inflation demands meant they had to concentrate on covering real life costs so their disposable/excess fiat income had to pay for fiat lifestyle stuff.. so they were not ready to put that fiat into cheap coin... until more recentlyim in the UK and i have had discussions with many uk bitcoin hobbiests. and spring summer they were spending fiat on lifestyle stuff. but with UK government payouts to households to give credit to energy companies means they can now afford winter and are looking to re-invest excess/disposable fiat into bitcoin. energy prices means they dont want to mine this year as it costs more to mine. but they are happier to buy while its cheap. sentiment is moving back to investing rather than fiat prepping",

In fact Bitcoin price is always showing this kind of price behaviour before and after FOMC meeting on releasing the interest rate for US citizen. This movement is not a big deal because it always multiple times and a great indicator that whales is just playing around this event and price area. Right now the price is dull and no buying anymore which means there's a high chance for a potential sell off again.Chart is a friend to know what's really going on rather than just reading some random post of social media shillers about any price movement which probably this post came from.",

Bitcoin is still in a consolidation phase , you could see that nothing has happened yet, the price is just moving side ways $18k-$20k, and no one knows which way that the market is gonna take after this accumulation, it could be up it could be down.

This is my own analysis on market and I think one bull run won't be enough for the push. But recent popularity and many countries accepting BTC will be a huge break for BTC. Throughout this year we continue to see erratic downward movement of bitcoin and of course this is a bit of a fear for holders, the FED decision to continue to raise interest rates is one of the biggest reasons bitcoin prices continue to decline, so when there is a small bull that occurs like right now, of course, at least it can give a smile and also enthusiasm for us to see the bitcoin market, I think we should remain grateful even though the current bullish movement is very small and hopefully the current bullishness will be the first step for bitcoin to get bullish again which will last a long time.",
