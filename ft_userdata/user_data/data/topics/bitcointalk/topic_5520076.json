It's the same as saying that your bank account is 99.9% anonymous or private, just because \"only\" the bank and the government knows about it.Quotethe future is from bitcoinSure, but there is apparently a market emerged from actual use of privacy coins. Evidently, people need them. Privacy in bitcoin can be protected with coinjoin, but it'd be foolish to think that it's private otherwise.",

I wouldnt even call this privacy.  The exchanges know where all your coins are coming from, but you got no clue who they might be sharing that info with.  Especially some of those sketchier ones.  Nowadays most big exchanges make you do some kind of KYC stuff and  so really, doing it your way you would probably lose privacy compared to just paying straight from your wallet.  Basically you are giving up actual privacy for for a false sense of privacy.  Sure, it might look on the surface like your wallet is hidden if you use them.  But you are really trusting some other company with all your personal data and  who knows if they will handle it right? Privacy coins, on the other hand, offer true privacy by obscuring the sender and receiver of transactions. Thats a way better way to keep your financial business private.",

What else are you hiding, and who are you hiding it from?  If you want to remain private, the best way is to hold your coin in a non-custodial wallet. You can hold the large amount on a separate wallet, which could either be a hardware wallet or an open-source wallet that you will be sure of your coins being under your control.  If your fear is about linking your holdings with a public address where you want to make some purchases, that can only happen if you want it to happen. You are not limited to having only one wallet, which means you can fund one particular wallet with a small amount, which you can consider as your spending wallet, and each time a store tries to track how much you hold, there will always be little to nothing in that wallet.",

Sure, if a lot of people buy them it means the market is big so the pump can happen anytime, but the reason why those coins get dumped is usually because exchanges are forced to delist them, which means their goal is achieved. If you only care about the pump and price increase, I don't think you'd look for privacy coins in the first place.Anyway, if your thread title is your question there are decent learning sources shared above.

If the exchanges and the government know your balance, it is similar to a bank. Yet, I consider Bitcoin more safe than banks.

      "body": "You have to take privacy into your own hands. Monero is ideal, but in terms of Bitcoin, privacy is a nightmare unless you take proactive measures.I never talked to Satoshi, but I'm pretty sure that he didn't intend to create banking 2.0 and its subsequent monetary ecosystem requiring humiliating selfies for KYC laws and approval from banking entities, just to open crypto accounts and withdraw funds. Bitcoin users certainly haven't helped in this regard, as they've chased profits over any remaining cypherpunk, anti-bank ethos, but this is to be expected.The Bitcoin devs, however, have always been in a position to do more. They pay lip service to privacy sometimes, but they've made it clear that they have taken the path of least resistance and abide pretty much any banking regulation, no matter how draconian or unjust, rather than create a privacy-respecting ecosystem outside of the banking system. They could have implemented privacy-centric features into Bitcoin Core if they really wanted to, but that ship sailed long ago. No one expects them to go full Monero, but they've had opportunities (native mweb, native coinjoin, etc) to increase Bitcoin privacy, but they are content to create banking 2.0 instead. They have not supported privacy advocacy within the law. They have not pursued lawful means to circumvent privacy-invasive analytics and regulations.So it's up to you. And you have to learn it on your own.You can always use mixers as explained here: https://bitmixlist.orgLearn how to safely use Tor (and i2p), the Tor Browser, and familiarize yourself with using onion links. For example, here's the onion version of the bitmixlist.org site: http://kmzvdt7443fqisu27xw3saxv7rn2pmgx33zd2cy54ev2mbba2xjoziqd.onionTails OS, which has a Bitcoin Electrum client built in, routes all traffic through Tor (but it won't help you if you're dumb).For any cryptocurrencies you use, its best to run your own node if possible.You can use exchanges and services that don't require AML / KYC information: https://kycnot.meAlso keep in mind that chain analytics isn't just about IP addresses, but also patterns like timing, amounts, and other correlating data.And as most users know, avoid address re-use whenever possible.Also keep in mind that you need to be cautious on this forum, too. It's been hacked before, with user names and password exposed, and high-profile members both in the past (such as Gavin Andresen @gavinandresen ) and present ( forum admin Michael Marquardt @theymos ) have cooperated with law enforcement agencies that actively profile users and engage in blockchain analysis. There are also a lot of shady dealings that newer users might not know about, such as infamous donation scam with Slickage Studios that theymos himself participated in, scamming thousands of Bitcoins from unsuspecting forum members. I know I'm mentioning security in terms of privacy, but there's a lot of overlap between the two. Further, it's worth considering that some accounts change hands easily, and you need to be extraordinarily careful whom you trust. Remember, above all else: not your keys, not your coins.Edit: Bisq is great for exchanging Bitcoin in a decentralized way without the burden of AML/KYC getting in the way.",
