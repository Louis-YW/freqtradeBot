The only 'small' hope of that happening is that Salim Ramji was with Blackrock when they were applying for a BTC etf, he left for Vanguard before the U.S. accepted the etf proposals, but he was part of the process before he left. So maybe in the near future if the company has a change of heart about it, he will support it, no?",

It was AI previously and every functionality imaginable for man to add up to any product, now it's Bitcoin and how everybody changes their views and mind about it, then - it would be something different.Of course, I hope for everybody to see through fud and invest in BTC - but it wouldn't be the end of the world for anybody.

I think its only a matter of time before they succumb to the fact that Bitcoin is thehottest investment tool there is otherwise they may lose their position as the second biggest fund management company to Fidelity who could  see further investmentsin their Bitcoin ETF, or at best Blackrock will open a larger advantage over Vanguard.Maybe Vanguard will become a haven for investors who share their sentimentabout Crypto investments and over time that cohort of investors will become less and less",

Well that pretty much clears out the fact that they are still making calculated risks and most importantly they are making investments to secure their spot and ROI in their investments. Sometimes I don't take the declarations of firms like this as the full details because it's very possible they own a ton of bitcoin sitting in a wallet even before this bull. Vanguard's decision not to offer Bitcoin ETFs seems kinda counterintuitive given the growing demand for cryptocurrency investments. it appears that Vanguard has not changed its stance on Bitcoin ETFs since Morningstar's John Rekenthaler argues that Vanguard made the right decision by not offering Bitcoin ETFs because of bitcoins speculative nature.",

Yes, I remember this declaration but to me it makes little sense at this point, I feel like this is more like an excuse. At the end of the day I don't care whether Vanguard approves or not a bitcoin ETF, it bothers me more the fact that bitcoin is still called \"speculation\", like if behind all the other financial assets there was no speculation but just good intentions",

Yeah but here’s the thing, no one is being forced to buy it. Also, it’s not like any retirement plans will be adding Bitcoin or Ether ETFs, so it’s a niche investment, let people do what they want.What’s amazig to me is that they offering their funds in products like Bonus Annuities (which are 100% a scam), as well as in Dark Pools etc. Yet they won’t add btc. so even if they know oil/bitcoin are real assets, they prefer to double bak their investmentsi can easily see warren buffet/vanguard eventually offering an index of crypto institutions, rather than an etf peg of crypto itself[/quote]Warren is a dinosaur who knows NOTHING about tech and especially bitcoin (which he’s admitted before).

Salim Ramji who was the former head of BlackRock oversaw the application and approval of the company's Spot Bitcoin ETF process has in-depth knowledge of the crypto industry but his hands are tied by the philosophy of Vanguard. The $8.6 trillion in assets management firm is just watching while competitors are making a fortune from the ETF.

Well, hindsight is 20/20. We can say that all of the other funds are doing the right thing by adopting Bitcoin ETFs because Bitcoin has become more valuable relative to when they were first launched.Bitcoin isn't the first asset or commodity that they have foregone. It definitely won't be the last. For speculative assets, its pretty obvious why funds are not as enticed to invest as say something that generates constant and relatively safer returns. It probably doesn't matter much to them, nor to us.",
