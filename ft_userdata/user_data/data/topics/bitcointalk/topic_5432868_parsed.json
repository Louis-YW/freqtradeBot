  "content": "Pic collected Looking at the chart of Bitcoin price every year we can see that every 3 years after 4 years Bitcoin price has been dumping a lot. Bitcoin price was up from 2011 to 2013. Bitcoin is down in 2014. Again from 2015 to 2017 Bitcoin is up and in 2018 Bitcoin is down again. Then Bitcoin went up from 2019 to 2021 and Bitcoin dumped a lot in 2022. After analyzing the year 2023 from here, it is seen that Bitcoin will rise. But do you think bitcoin will be up or bitcoin down in 2023?",

Also, we don't even know about the next month and next day so talking about the next years is a bit more than impossible, all we can do is check what happened in the past bitcoin halving cycles and then try to use the history to know about the future however this cannot be sure and we cannot be sure about it.",

Although nobody is certain when or at what price the price of bitcoin will climb, it is feasible that it may do so this year (2023). The price of bitcoin is fluctuating at over $16,000 at the beginning of the year. According to speculations, bitcoin will soar to $30k or higher before the year is through. Although nobody genuinely knows what the price of bitcoin will be this year.",

The hype is on for bitcoin already and I think the new year is going to blow a fresh breeze on the price of bitcoin. Before the ending of the year, bitcoin was a little resistance to reach bottom and that has continued in the first week of the year, maybe it may be a stronger resistance against buttom that we can see bull at the end of it all.",

In terms of the cycles, it's proven that it goes like that.The pressure will eventually come out and then will create a new buying trend that will make the demand higher prior to the halving. And that means, the price will be up again but most likely it's after the halving.Well, it's another long way to go for the entire year and I think that we might see some good moving trend for bitcoin for this year.",

However, that's an amazing discovery, I also notice this before when I was commenting on a thread of predictions which is every four years will pass, and Bitcoin will dump the price.",

I'm more hopeful that we'd be seeing up this year, not by much still but relatively better than what we had the last year. I reckon as long as stuff like the FTX/Luna fiasco doesn't happen, the market wouldn't take any sudden dips and would just do a steady sideways move, maybe up to $25, or $30k. It's still going to be a waiting game though. If you were deciding to invest, I mean, most would say we're already at or close to the bottom, so I reckon it wouldn't be that bad to put some money into it. Any possible losses would be bearable compared to investing in the past year anw.",

However, always look at the other side of the story and always think that the past performance doesn't tell its future performance. What might happen in the past might not happen in the future.As for me, I'm a believer of cycles especially the 4-year so I expect Bitcoin to go up this year or at least higher than its price before entering 2023. On the other hand, even though I believe that it will be going up, I'm always ready if things will not go the way I expected. We might see Bitcoin going down in 2023 and that will break the pattern OP has shared.I believe that 2023 will be much better compared to 2022 but that doesn't mean that the worst is over. We might see more negative events that will affect the whole market this year. We don't know so just be ready.",
