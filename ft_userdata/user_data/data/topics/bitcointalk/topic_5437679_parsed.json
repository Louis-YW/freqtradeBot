The major reason why we should avoid the hype and concentrate on potential projects that have long-term value traction and market value that make it impossible to be manipulated. Because most of that Defi hacks and scams are insider jobs, the majority of them are perpetrated by the team themselves, in the form of exit scams.",

Most of the DeFi hacks were perpetrated by the team of the project themselves, and in order for anyone to not be a victim, they better think thrice before investing their money into similarly schemed investments in the crypto space. Honestly, I don't find PoS risky, only if you have the funds yourself in your own wallet. But the moment you hand them over to someone to 'multiply' whatever you have right now, that's the time you have screwed up and there is a high chance that the scam is going to happen any time soon.

In any case, I still think 3.8 billion could be a bit of a wrong number, it could be a little lower than that, but I believe its still a very important part of crypto we need to be careful about, it can't be really good for everyone in the market if we keep getting hacked like this.",

The problem is how are you supposed to know which one is safe? Everyone thought Terra Luna was a safe bet until it crashed and went to zero. You're basically gambling on these altcoins. 99% of them are unregistered securities. They are controlled by a small group of insiders, they had an ICO with VC venture capital investors, etc. The point of bitcoin is that it isn't controlled by anyone. There was no premine or ICO. Â Bitcoin has stood the test of time. Proof of stake is a new and unproven technology. No one knows how secure it is or isn't at this point. But the consensus among the experts appears to be it is significantly less secure than PoW. Which is why I never understood the hype around FTX and Bankman-Fried who was promoted in the media Â as this amazing new face of crypto. This guy just came out of nowhere, with no track record Â to speak of and all the sudden he is the new king of crypto? I never trusted him because I don't know him, he has no history. At least with Binance and Coinbase, Kraken, etc. these are established players with a relatively good reputation. So SBF probably bribed the corrupt mainstream media to promote him as the God of Crypto. It's very suspicious.",

When a custodian such as Blockfi or Celsius goes bankrupt you lose all your staked assets including staked ethereum since you have no custody. Staking in the context of PoS and centralized crypto lending has two different meanings. When you \"stake\" with companies like BlockFi or Celsius, you're simply lending them your crypto assets. This means that the company holds your assets and as you mentioned, it exposes you to counterparty risk. However, in the context of a PoS blockchain like Ethereum, in very simple terms, staking refers to holding onto a certain amount of coins to validate transactions. In this scenario, you are in control of your own coins, acting as a network participant, and incentivized to maintain the integrity of the network.",

For me it was Ethereum with it's introduction of smart contracts that made crypto as big as it is today. If we would still only have Bitcoin today, then the price of one Bitcoin would probably still be way below 1000$ because Bitcoin alone would have never reached the masses and mainstream adoption.Of course when a product or a software has a lot of functionality and different applications then this also means that hackers have multiple possibilities to try to get access to those software.
