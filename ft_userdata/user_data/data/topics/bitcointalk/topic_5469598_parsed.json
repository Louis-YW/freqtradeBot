  "content": "Does anyone have one of these laying around that they would be willing to part with? These were in gold, silver, and copper colors. I really loved this artwork tbh, and the two conjined cards for this i just thought they were so cool for the \"halving\" cards. I figure I better ask before everyone throws all of these out or cuts them in half or whatever everyone has done with their old cold key stuff. What have you done with yours?? Will you keep yours? Will they be worth something someday? My guess is that if he was ever brought to justice maybe they would be worth something? That is debatable lol.",
