Yes, that's right.And a better approach is, to invest only in those assets that you know and don't do random investments that has becoming a trend during the bull run.Even if you've got no idea about the asset you'll be investing and crypto to be specific, you'll still invest. That's a wrong approach and it's proven to make more people broke with that market strategy.",

I always use the word only invest what you can afford to lose, in fact, its one of my mantras on investing and gambling, it's hard to manage your risk when you want to make a profit from the coins/token that you've invested so for your peace of mind only invest what you can afford to lose is the right word that you should adopt, always remember the market is very volatile so you should refrain from chasing your losses, and you will not do that if you only invest what you can afford to lose.",

The first thing that everyone should know shitcoins is scam at the beginning, no one ever suggest you to buy shitcoins. It's your own decision to invest on shitcoins that can make instant profit or instant lose depends on the manipulation.",
