  "content": "As the quest for global adoption of digital currencies due to the high rate of inflation in traditional papers money keeps surging, attention has been shifted to cryptocurrency as the hedge against the inflation and economic recession that is ravaging the global economy,And those of us who are early to adopt Bitcoin and seek to build knowledge as regards the technology is seen as the most smartest set of people among the general public.But one of the major set back against Bitcoin's global image is the presence of other coins who are centralized and highly vulnerable in term of volatility rate and price stability occasion with uncertain events that happens within other centralized cryptocurrency platform.Even with all this, Bitcoin have remain untouched and it users are the only one who are safe in this time of crisis most especially those who store they bitcoin in their private wallets.So in conclusion: Bitcoin is the blanket cover for what cryptcucrency and digital currency stand for and only those that hold Bitcoin should be seen as the smart people, not those holding and gambling with shitcoins.",

For example, some people were quick to say don't buy bitcoins because of the stories about FTX and Sam, they have generalized every problem with cryptocurrency to be a problem with bitcoins, and it is misguiding them. We have to let as many misguided persons as possible know that Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, but not all cryptocurrencies are bitcoins.",

I don't understand why you separate altcoins and Bitcoin in this way?? What's the point of that?? Does it look like you're trying to separate a huge part of the market from bitcoin?? By a huge part of the market, I mean altcoins! I believe that altcoins are very important in the cryptocurrency industry, and for some unknown reason you are trying to separate them! Of course, bitcoin is more reliable, of course, it is the main one, but it doesn't seem quite right to separate it from altcoins so categorically! Because these are all cryptocurrencies, and they cannot be divided among themselves!!",

You use the Terra luna coin for a case study you will notice that it pumped high and people got lots of income and this lure more people to invest almost there life savings in it and then the crash happened.
