For higher amounts we require 6 confirmations.Step 3 After deposit and got confirmed, you will be able to step 2, in this moment because have a small deposit, 0.002, I am able to withdraw all chip with freeStep 4 on the step 3 page I got a private key which I can import to electrum wallet.after importing, my electrum wallet showed full 0.002 BTC in new address. this means my BTC is mixed and free.Step 5 on next step, I have to destroy the session.everything is done in only 15 minutes.if anyone is still confused about how to mix with free, don't be shy to write in comment",

      "body": "Your tutorial could have been expressed in one sentence: in order to save on mixing fees, you need to make a deposit proportional to a minimum chip size, which is 0.001 BTC. Something like that is already written in plain English in their FAQ:QuoteMinimum deposit is 0.001 BTC - lowest chip size. If you deposit less then you have to deposit missing amount to receive a chip.Second minimum deposit is 0.002 BTC. If you deposit between 0.001 and 0.002 BTC you will receive only 1 mBTC chip and rest will be autodonated. So, to avoid part of your funds getting \"autodonated\" to Chipmixer, you will want to send exact amounts, nothing more, nothing less. However, the problem with this reasoning is that for this saving strategy to work, you need to have prepared UTXOs which will be slightly bigger than the size of a typical chip. Upon preparing these specific UTXOs, you inevitably create \"toxic\" change, which, if combined with your mixed funds, may destroy your privacy. The goal of a mixing process is to enhance privacy by getting rid of these toxic leftovers, but when you try not to pay additional fees to Chipmixer, you only make things worse by creating dozens of undesirable outputs. Don't do that on purpose unless you fully understand the possible implications.",

Firstly out of honesty, and secondly because otherwise, if everyone did the same, the business would eventually have to close down.It's also worth pointing out that donating increases your privacy. If you deposit an exact amount and then withdraw the same exact amount, then you have lowered your anonymity set. If you deposit an amount, donate some of it, and then withdraw a different amount, you have a much larger anonymity set.Quote from: tranthidung on August 30, 2022, 07:44:27 AMHonestly if you use a non custodial wallets and don't have Bitcoin from illegal sources or you don't want to avoid tax ie., you don't have to seriously use mixer service.Implying that the only people who use mixers are doing something illegal, which isn't true. We've know for years that a very small minority of coins which are mixed are linked to illegal activity, and by far the largest source of coins entering mixers are directly from centralized exchanges - i.e. people simply looking to regain some privacy from the ever increasing surveillance conducting by centralized exchanges and their blockchain analysis partners.",

You want to buy some things from me. You try to pay with cash. I say \"I cannot see the full history of this cash, so I refuse your money\". So instead, you tap your debit card. I say \"I cannot accept this money without knowing the full history of it\". I demand access to your bank account so I can see where all your money comes from. You leave and come back with your bank statements, but I don't like what I see, so I refuse payment. You then try to pay with PayPal. I demand access to your PayPal account so I can see where all your money comes from. You unlock your PayPal account on your phone and hand it over for me to look at. This PayPal money looks OK to me, so I accept it. You then leave the shop and start telling all your friends \"Make sure when you shop there you have all your bank statements with you so the merchant can look at them, and make sure none of your money comes from anywhere except your employer, since they can't trace those funds.\" Your friends all look at you like you are crazy, and then simply choose to shop with the merchant next door who doesn't do any of this nonsense.Whenever this situation comes up, with the discussion of centralized exchanges and privacy, it always seems that the default position is \"Sacrifice all your privacy and let people spy on you so that you can use a centralized exchange\". In any other financial situation that would be seen as utterly crazy, as I've just shown above, but for some reason with bitcoin people just accept this nonsense? The problem here is not mixers, or coinjoins, or Monero, or any other privacy technique - the problem here is centralized exchanges. If you don't want a centralized exchange to seize your coins, then don't use a centralized exchange. There are plenty of decentralized exchanges to choose from.The logical position when faced with entities which are stealing coins is not \"I should bend over backwards and sacrifice everything to hopefully mean they don't steal my coins!\", but rather to simply not use the entity which is stealing coins.Quote from: Timothy SnyderMost of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. In times like these, individuals think ahead about what a more repressive government will want, and then offer themselves without being asked.",
