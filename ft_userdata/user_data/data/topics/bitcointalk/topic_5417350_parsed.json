They offered same things, same --or even better-- transfer time, and... less fee. I'm not exactly sure how will this fee appealing, 5% for remittance is quite taxing, especially as your token is leaning toward remittance, not investment tools, which means they're designed to be used for transfer and then immediately converted to other currency.",

I would love to see the math and formula behind this statement. How long will it take exactly for such investment to reach 100%? And how does those number achieved in reference on the statement quoted above that those return were gained from the aforementioned 'high fee'.",

The actual number is yet to be proven as you're not launched yet and after that, the 1M daily volume would still highly dependent on the popularity and mass adopti of your token. By the way, your website said 20%-100% ROI, not 10%. A honest mistake or were you forgot the number you wrote there because well... that's just a random number you threw, you forgot them immediately.",

Wow, such a big error, don't you agree? It's a huge margin difference and possibly mislead people into interest.I'd also like to know about your plan to be Canadian AML compliant, i see this on the \"Legal\" section of your whirepaper, but why doesn't anything about it mentioned on your roadmap? Does the compliance planned foe a very very far future that it's not covered on the roadmap?",

If you reasoning that they typo is excusable because 20% falls in between 10 and 100, I can't understand your logic in basic finance. And you want to propose an invest product? 20%-100% means people would expect at least 20% annual profit, as you advertised on your website, they didn't know that it is a typo, and the lowest expected return is 10%, half of what's advertised. When their annual return is 15%, you've successfully misleading them.Quote from: AdvantageBlockchain on December 29, 2022, 05:02:04 PMAs for KYC AML we plan on hiring a 3rd party professional company to integrate with us.

Where people can easily access? It is bound to happen anyway, as I think it is rather inconvenience and less appealing when someone wanted to remit their money through you and wanted a sense of security by knowing to whom they hand their money to, and what they get is, \"come to discord and meet our member.\"Besides, I've took a quick look at it, and it's not much. Literally zero added info about the team. And do I understand correctly that you're in the middle of cwowdfund to kick start your wallet, for 10K USD?",
