  "content": "Introduce Since 2009, A lot of blockchains have been released with the same concepts: Designed to be inflation or deflation only. Bitcoin is deflation by design, Ethereum is inflation before the Merge. I propose another concept: The total supply of the coin will be determined by supply and demand, when the demand is too high, price goes up, miners get more profit and more miners come to mine Canxium leads to hashrate/difficulty goes up and more Canxium will be added to the market. Because the higher the difficulty, the greater the reward. Same thing happens when the demand is too low. I also introduce a new mining concept: Offline mining.Who is Behind Canxium?Canximan -> Founder, developer and researcher.Road map2023: Start the pow chain, block mining algorithm is Ethash, set contract creation fee to 100 CAU: Done2023: Support offline mining using Ethash: in progress2024: Hydro harkford: remove 0.25 CAU block reward.2024: Support more offline mining algorithms: SHA256, X11.2025-2026: Switch consensus from pow to pos but offline mining is the only way to make more coins, no staking reward. Validator earn transaction fee and 2% total offline mining transaction reward included in the block.2026 ->: More offline mining algorithms.LinksWebsite: https://canxium.org/Stats: https://stats.canxium.org/Explorer: https://explorer.canxium.org/Github: https://github.com/canxium/go-canxiumPaper: https://canxium.org/pdf/whitepaper_v2.1.pdfTwitter: https://twitter.com/canxiumchainReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/calciumchain/Discord: https://discord.gg/SbxSPJ8FkDHow to mine: The hard way1.
