People get greedy, when big money enters the space, big money gets greedy too.If big money enters the space, lots of people will either sell or buy off that news. No one with a large investment will sell it on the open market all at once unless they've got a vendetta because it'll mean they've made a loss from what they could've made.There's a lot of people who hold the coin because they don't understand the technology, don't understand the markets or because they're worried they'll never be able to buy for the price they sold at. When big money enters the cryptospace I think a lot more derivatives and lending will be done between players so they can stay invested or they'll only come with tiny parts of their portfolios to gain the maximum exposure with the minimum risk.",

When the market is on the bullish part it is good to just enjoy the trend than going in depth analysis and miss opportunities. If the market gets manipulated by the whales we should have the ability to hold, because the market that's been manipulated will bounce back at some point.",

You can't have a market where it's all 100% retail investors with small-mid amounts of money; especially when talking about bitcoin — something that's supposed to be more distributed.Everyone has the right and freedom to buy, own, or sell bitcoin. Whether you like it or not. The market will continue to work normally, by being moved by typical buy/sell offers and executions.",

When someone buy Bitcoin it doesn't mean Bitcoin price will increase and when someone sold Bitcoin it doesn't mean Bitcoin price will decrease, it depends on the market. If the market are scared because there's huge Bitcoin transfer, actually it's stupid and no any relation with Bitcoin will dump.",

What's the community's take on this? Bitcoin is based on ideals of freedom, if the whales want to buy massive amounts of bitcoin no one can stop them, it is undeniable the more popular bitcoin gets and the more bitcoin is bought by the whales that it becomes easier for them to manipulate this market to their convenience.But it is not as if they are not doing the same on every other market, and we have whales already anyway, as the early adopters managed to collect a massive amount of bitcoin and they can manipulate the market too.",

This means they won't pull out of the market in any way that could cause a big drop. Same way they don't enter it in a way to cause a big rise. This is why we see accumulation phases where price is low but the \"Big Money\" is buying in while everyone else is ignorant. What has always caused the big jumps and big dumps been weak hands who panic sell and panic buy into bitcoin whenever they see price already reaching a certain level. This is why we still don't see them buy back the bitcoin they sold at lower prices despite the bullish momentum. They probably buy back after $30k is broken at a panic just like how they panicked and sold their bitcoin below $20k.",

This has also happened in the past when bitcoin reached new highs, others sold off, and the price fell. It is not only in bitcoin but all in the market; this is the cycle, and why are you scared? It was the opposite: those who left behind or continued holding are the stronger hands, as they continued holding no matter what, unlike those who sold earlier, and for sure they will be buying again.",

What's the community's take on this? That's how the financial markets work. If you are against the way financial markets work, just don't bother and pick another job or hobby.Can you figure out a way to stop \"big money\" from buying BTC and entering the Bitcoin market? I don't think so.Bitcoin would've been way more boring and uninteresting for the vast majority of the traders/investors, if the price was less volatile and there weren't any \"big money\" in the game of crypto trading. The stock markets also have a bunch of whales, who are buying low and selling high(and they are probably manipulating the prices). I don't see anyone complaining about the stock market whales.If you are a crypto trader and you are failing at timing the crypto market, you should blame yourself, not the crypto whales.",

What's the community's take on this? I like the opposite of your idea, when a large amount of money is pushed into the market, the market will have strong fluctuations from which there is a chance to make more profits. In addition, we want bitcoin to grow and become big and solid, we need a large amount of money because small amounts only make the market slow and more difficult to develop. I understand what you are trying to say is moving towards a stable, sustainable market, but bitcoin is still a manipulated market, and it is still a game, there are winners and losers.",

Additionally, some believe that large investors can have a negative impact on the market by using their significant resources to manipulate prices, while others believe that they can help to increase liquidity and improve the overall health of the market. Ultimately, the impact of large investors in the cryptocurrency market will depend on the specific actions of these investors and the regulatory environment in which they operate.",
