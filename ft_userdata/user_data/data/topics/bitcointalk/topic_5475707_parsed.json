You may fail to clear up the multiple debts in time and mess up your account, which isn't something good.",

You may fail to clear up the multiple debts in time and mess up your account, which isn't something good.You are right. I discourage making any deal if the payment method is reversible (eg: Paypal) and taking any loan. Whether the amount is a single dollar. When I see any type of such activity I will negatively tag it without thinking twice which has been mentioned on my lending terms.Quote from: xLays on November 27, 2023, 10:07:50 PMYeah, and that is my second time asking for a loan that Shasan granted.

No need to worry.When I grant a loan or multiple I am aware of the risk but while there is an active loan with me and taking a loan from others or trading any reversible payment I may not be aware so if any activity, like that I must tag. You should lock the thread immediately. You may check the terms number 3.",
