But it can also be a scam if the person that tell people to invest in the project is part of the people behind the project. But I have seen friends telling friends something like this in a way all of them will be scammed together. Lack of understanding about crypto caused it. DOR is very important.Quote from: Salahmu on June 27, 2023, 10:47:07 AMthe first thing was research google to learn more and also the risk involvesNo only about the risk, but to seek for everything need to be known to avoid scam and to make a successful investment that will be profitable. You can use google but be careful too because google can give you false information like bitcoin wallet to be coinbase.com, Trustwallet and other wallets that are not good for bitcoin users. But making research by asking questions on this forum can be very helpful.If someone can be patient and not greedy, investing in bitcoin is better, instead of investing in fake and shit projects.",

QuoteI may not be the right person for investment advice that's why I'm asking everyone to share their advice, views and knowledge incase something like this should come up, so people could learn and no what must be done before going into investment. Share idea? You should first of all realise that not all strategy work for everyone, but the best I would give a newbie is; Learn, practice, continue learning, keep practicing and even if you get a hang of the investment process keep learning and try to sync with latest news and lastly don't stop learn... Afterall there's a reason why \"earn\" is present in \"learn\".",

It is wrong for someone who has no knowledge about bitcoin to buy bitcoin and looking for advice from people for help. I think people who invest this way without having any knowledge are just desperate to get rich from bitcoin. It is looks so unreasonable for someone to decide to invest on something that is unknown and without any understanding, that means the person just only care about profit  and not about bitcoin.   Someone who is really Interested to invest in bitcoin will go after knowledge first before proceeding of buying Bitcoin to  invest. Without knowledge buying Bitcoin is a waste because it will look so complicated to the person when their is fall in the market. Knowledge about bitcoin is not just about investing but how to use the right wallet and also helps to give good Understanding in securing the seed phrase.  No matter the amount used in buying Bitcoin, no bitcoin if their is no knowledge on how  to invest because their can't be magic to end up with a positive result by the end of the investment.",

We can learn it and practice it with a full market cycle with bull and bear times.Getting profit is difficult but possible, and a harder task is keep your profit and your capital safe. When you have profit in hands, you will be less careful and will more easily to lose your profit and even initial capital.",

No one will be responsible for losing $20k in an investment, it is a risk that will still be borne by yourself. I saw that thread a few days ago, but in the opinion of many, the story of the man who has 20k dollars and needs investment advice from others is more of a scam than a fact. For those willing to invest large sums of money, they would not foolishly turn to strangers for investment advice. Unless his intention is to scam rather than seek real advice.Returning to this topic, I agree that having knowledge before investing is necessary not only with bitcoin but in every field because knowledge will always be the key to our success.",

Actually in addition, I want to let us know that bitcoin is not only investment option we can invest on, bitcoin is a investment that any other person can partake in cryptocurrency investment, but the process is that many left other investment and focus on investment, what you portray here is real for the process whereby people after investing in bitcoin they began to regret of the investment due to the nature of the market, bitcoin investment is good when someone want to invest for long term, and also when someone is not curious to know what the market of bitcoin is all about, that's while we do advice people to invest with their spare money or invest with what they can afford to lose.",
