  "content": "In the passing days there has been  disruption of lives, movements and also with destruction of public properties  across  major cities in France. This happening has hampered negatively on the economy of the country forcing the French president to abort one of his supposed diplomatic trip in light of the ill-fated situation.The story line talks about, a 17 years old teenage boy that was killed by the police. This singular act has given birth to series of protest and riots that has affected, and created unrest in  major cities of the country leading to the arrest of more than 700+ protesters.A lot of people have complained about the activities of police across the world, Because the George Floyd issue, the Arab Spring and a lots of activities of the police that has lead to protest that has resulted to unending riots, carnage and destruction that is caused by the excesses of the police across the world.All the major cities in France is currently shutdown, economic activities are seriously under threat as shops owners are losing their goods  unabatedly, as the security force are overwhelmed with the situation.I think is high time the Government of the world looks into the activities of police before they cause a volcanic eruption that will consume us all.https://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-europe-66073728",

I laughed back, they were offended It turned out I was right... I beg to disagree with you on the issue of \"benefits from the immigrants\"I think to a large extent, France has benefited immensely from immigrant population, ranging from a young protective work force. Take a look at  France national football team, it depicts to a large extent to which they've benefited from immigrants. However, there might be one two Judas within the immigrant population, but that doesn't make the problems squarely lie on them.",

They should have supported the police when these happens and let the police deal with the policeman through their own disciplinary committee and deal with the policeman that shot that boy but foolishly for Macron, he has lost the police and the masses, and find himself in difficult position. I do fear for Europe, why don't they want to have children and they keep importing people of different culture into their country at a very high rate. The future of the continent is very bleak, why they are doing this I don't know, instead of using these money to support immigrants, use it to support your own people to give birth to more children this is how you survive the future.",

This goes way back too, which was evidenced by the fact that France has been in the headlines for quite a while now, and the existence of previous threads about this issue. It still all boils down to dissatisfaction with how the government is being run for the interest of the few instead of the many, and the ongoing police brutality debacle. If there's one thing about France that we should know of, it's that they don't take these things lightly, especially if it causes massive disruption in their way of living, I mean, their Marie Antoinette was parted from her head for a reason, and so was their king. So yeah, you fuck with the French people you'll get the horns. That's pretty much it, and Until they are satisfied with how the government works and the dissolution of the current police system in place, this is gonna carry on for a while.",

Police misconduct is gradually becoming a national problem that needs to be addressed, controlled, and those in uniform reoriented. There are ways of doing things peacefully without causing harm to any of the parties, but when peaceful protests are going on, the same people who they are protesting against will still be the ones sent out by the government to come and arrest protesters. In countries like Singapore, where crime is almost zero, people have been adequately managing their people to avoid such incidents of police and citizens colliding. Others can still do it; it's just a matter of re-strategizing and educating them again. Anyone who is guilty should not be spared but should face justice.",

This problem was caused by a lawless youth that refused to obey a simple instruction. If he had respected the police officer, this crisis would have been averted. The police officer also acted unreasonably because the boy didn't pose any form of danger. Now people believe that the killing was racially motivated.  It is also unfortunate that criminals have capitalized on this unfortunate incident to cause havoc. Businesses have been looted and commercial activities have been greatly distorted. The most important issue now is to stop the protest, investigate the killing and implement measures to avoid such occurrences in the future. Businesses that were affected should be compensated by the government so that they can recover the loss and start operations as soon as possible. One lesson we should derive from this incident is that without order or peace, economic activities will suffer.

I laughed back, they were offended It turned out I was right... Respect Sir DrBeer. Just because there are groups of lawless immigrants shouldn't be enough reason to generalize that immigrants have no economic value. Many immigrants are contributing positively to the economy of European nations. With the problem of an aging population and low birth rate, most economies in Europe might face many difficulties if they fail to bring in immigrant workers. Recently Germany and Canada are coming up with policies that will create room for more workers from developing nations to migrate to these nations easily. We should come to realize that we need each other to survive instead of always pretending that we are doing a certain group a favor.",

Moreover, there is always punishment for every crime that happens within the jurisdiction so definitely the police who did the wrong doing will have to face the charges for what he did. I don't understand where is the law now and why the emotions are breaking in wrong direction. We are democratic society, we should follow the ethics nd rules to keep it as democratic.

We can do better by putting our sentiments aside and discuss on amicable ways on how such police killings could be ended irrespective of who's the victim of such act instead of trying to heat up the polity.Stating that immigrants are uncivilized, and adding no benefits and value to their country of residence that you claim gives them shelter is not true and clearly express how tragic and concise your humanity is limited to your immediate environment alone. (No offense).Hopefully,the unrest in France won't have much negative effect on the French economy for long, as there has been calls throughout the country for calm and normalcy has returned as the government has taken control of the situation.",
