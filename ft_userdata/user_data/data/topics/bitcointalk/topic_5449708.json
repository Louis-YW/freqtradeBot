  "content": "I was sending a few satoshis to a Binance exchange but they got delayed and the reason was the sudden hike in transaction fees. I did apply the fee suggested by my wallet and still, this happened. This situation led me to check whether Bitcoin LN is supported by Binance and I found out that it does not. Then it led me to think why would Binance not integrate LN wherein they support multiple non-Bitcoin blockchains for transfer. I went ahead and did some Google searches and found one recently updated article on Medium. There was a list that had a handful of known and trusted CEX & DEX that have integrated LN into their infrastructure. Known CEX that supports Bitcoin LN:BitfinexKrakenOKEx Known DEX that supports Bitcoin LN:RoboSatsHodlHodl If these exchanges can integrate Bitcoin LN then why big exchanges like Binance & Coinbase do not support Bitcoin LN? If these two exchanges integrate LN then it would help everyone and also promote Bitcoin LN. As we all have an account on either of these two big exchanges.",

      "body": "Adding to what OmegaStarScream have said . The reason is; Because they don't want their fees cut out, If they initiate the lightning network today on their exchange (Binance in particular), everyone who knows how cheap and fast the network is will probably want to use it. Instead, they will want to suggest an alternative to you, which is the pegged token, which they also call Bitcoin under the BSC chain, which they will say has a fast transaction speed and a low transfer fee; sometimes they even offer almost free transfers. This is because they want to hold down users' real Bitcoin and give them their pegged token, which can be depegged anytime and will be worthless if the real Bitcoin still stands.",

They prolly look at Bitcoin being decentralized and imagine that they can't really gain anything promoting it, thus they would choose their shitcoins over it everyday, they can play around with them for profit, something they can't do with Bitcoin.",

Binance charges  0.0002 per user per withdrawal.Now, assuming their last transfers from hot wallets, both initial deposits batching and then payments they've paid for a total of 50 outputs this:0.00183416 and 0.00041664 BTC, which is 0.0022508 , while charging 0.01 BTC.So over 50 users, a 0.0078 BTC or some 200$ extra.

Lightning is not the same as segwit. But the reasons Binance do not support segwit could be because of the money the exchange is making from bitcoin withdraw and also because of the altcoins which some people thought are bitcoin but not bitcoin, they are only pegged with bitcoin. Yet both lightning network and segwit were implemented the same year:Quote from: https://www.kraken.com/learn/lightning-network#:~:text=The%20Lightning%20Network%20was%20originally,released%20in%20its%20alpha%20stage.The Lightning Network was originally envisioned in a whitepaper written by Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in 2015. Its testnet was released in May 2016 and, by January 2017, Lightning's first implementation – lnd – was released in its alpha stage.Quote from: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SegWit#:~:text=Initially%2C%20most%20bitcoin%20transactions%20have,from%2014%20July%202017's%20%241%2C835.Initially, most bitcoin transactions have not been able to use the upgrade. Segregated Witness was activated on 24 August 2017. The bitcoin price rose almost 50% in the week following SegWit's activation. Lighting network was existing six months before segwit.Quote from: OmegaStarScream on April 25, 2023, 11:11:23 AMQuote from: mk4 on April 23, 2023, 04:23:36 PMI'm going to play devil's advocate here and say that maybe it's because LN-related deposits/withdrawals simply doesn't have that much demand as of yet.

See how segwit adoption increased when more wallets and exchanges supported it to the point that more than 80% of bitcoin transactions are from segwit addresses. As more wallets and exchanges are supporting lightning network, more people will prefer it. But what I do not like about lightning network is that if it is not your node it is not your your coin, most people are using custodial lightning network wallets.Quote from: Woodie on April 25, 2023, 12:54:02 PMBut this fee you say they charge, from my understanding this fee goes to the miners and not them(coinbase) Are you using any exchange at all? If you are and also making transaction on noncustodial wallet, you will see how exchanges are charging exorbitantly from bitcoin users.",
