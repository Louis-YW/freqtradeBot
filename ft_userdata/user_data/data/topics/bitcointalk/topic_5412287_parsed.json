No, it's not leading digital currency of anything. That's just a lie. Fan tokens serve no point what so ever and this was pointless money grab L2 project without any real use case. Now they are keeping this pointless shell company running because otherwise they would be sued if they didn't even seem to deliver anything. Now they can literally do anything pointless until they ran out of their money.I am betting that they have hired layers to teach how to launder this money more for their own personal use.",

This is a good investment if you are a real sports enthusiasts because this project value is highly dependent on the sports fan demand to the fan tokens. We know that Fan tokens became popular since its new and people wants to incorporate everything into crypto for profit opportunity but once this industry becomes dull then tokens like this will slowly die like what’s happening on NFT, DeFi and P2E projects that is now dumping hard on this bear market.",

Even an existing blockchain project/company suffered a lot due to this, I can not imagine how bad it is going to be.",

In recent days amidst the ongoing bear trend of the market there is good growth with Chiliz. The market gained good when the entire market is on the red indication, gaining around 40% growth. This is quite good for the ongoing market. As stated there'll be assured bullish move with Chiliz when the market completely takes a bullish move.",
