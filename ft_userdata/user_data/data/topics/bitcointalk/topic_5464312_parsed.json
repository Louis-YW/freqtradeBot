  "content": "Hello, so with the whole ledger recovery service that was introduced not too long ago many people went to other hardware wallets. I did not, I wanted to wait and see what happens. I thought people were blowing this out of proportion and now the dust has settled it seems it may be the case. What is your verdict? Safe? Avoid? I believed they lied about not having a back door and now found out they do. And also being closed source who knows what can be taken by them. But any hardware wallet service can deploy a new software update and take your keys as most people do not know how to verify the source even if it is open. And if people do find out they will do by other people who have checked it and by that point a lot of keys may get stolen if something or someone decided to go rogue at the respective hardware company. I believe this cannot be applied to all hardware companies due to the design of the device. All help and views are appreciated thank you.",

Ledger does not also care about users data. It is one of the wallets you can go for if you are not bothered about your privacy and your coin security and safety.For bitcoin only wallet, go for PassportFor bitcoin and altcoins wallet, go for Trezor. Note that the coinjoin in Trezor is in association with Wasabi. Wasabi coinjoin are censoring UTXOs and working with chain analytic company to spy on your coinjoin transaction. Do not use Trezor coinjoin.",

You can distribute these shares to different locations or trusted individuals. To recover your wallet, you need a certain number of these shares. If one location or person becomes inaccessible, you can still recover your wallet using the remaining shares. This method gives you control over your recovery while providing redundancy.",

So, the best choice is to remain anonymous and decentralized. As many other members mentioned to avoid it but I would not say it is not totally safe because every person has there own set of rules to accept or reject something so you must also have some rules or requirements in your mind which you want to be included in your specific hardware wallet.I suggest you to avoid spending money on Ledger wallet and instead go for other options. If you do not know what wallet is good for you. Then I have seen a website here on BTT which comprised all the hardware wallets with good comparison options. You must check it out too. https://www.crypto-hardware.com/",

Well, up to some extent, you still have to trust your hardware wallet provider and there are plenty of manufacturers that did not BS'd their way like ledger. In short there are better options. I do hope most of the community haven't succumbed back to ledger as that wouldn't send a good message. It's safe to assume other manufacturers are also watching the scene unfold and imagine if ledger recovered + gained more market especially on their cloud backup side business, what does that say?",

I dispise the way they did their marketing on \"security by obscurity\" and lying about \"your secrets can't leave the secure element\". Well, it turns out that's only true as long as they don't program it to be able to leave the secure element on purpose. Trust us, we (Ledger) are the good guys! Sure, f*** u!!The corporate executives look to me completely nuts with their decisions and public behavior, before and after the \"Ledger Recovery\" desaster. I wouldn't use a Ledger even if they'd pay me for it. Don't buy, support and use such crap. My opinion, period. You do yours!",

Some people prefer to use Ledger because it offers invaluable security and helps prevent your digital assets from entering the wrong hands and also it's affordable and convenient for use. My advice? It's best to avoid it. You can try some of the options other users suggested tho.",

You have to trust those entities that they won't leak pieces of your seed or do combined shady things to steal your seed and your coins.It is unsafe even they claim they are using Shamir Secret Sharing Algorithm and I don't trust Ledger as they had some data breaches [1] and they are closed source.[1] Ledger Wallet Customer Info Hack (2020)",

Your seed phrase should be private and only known to you but entrusting your seed phrase to third party agencies for safe keeping is risky. Also, subscribers of the Ledger recovery service would need to give up their privacy by undergoing KYC, all these raised security concerns. This is not some firmware update, this is different. The fact that many persons have come out to speak against it should clearly tell you that many heads are better than one and they cannot not be wrong. The dust hasn't settled yet because sooner or later people who still have trust for Ledger will suffer for their choices. I would advise you look for a recommendable hardware wallet like Trezor or Passport, as Ledger is not safe.",
