      "body": "Is this source code for a normal program or for a cryptocurrency project?Because crypto projects have specialized auditing requirements, much different from normal programs. Not only do you have to check for security vulnerabilities in the software, you also have to make sure there are no monetary bugs in the software that could break the project (if it's some kind of financial asset), and ensure that there is not even the slightest possibility that some component of the application can be abused for this purpose or for theft.",

They have coinjoin and advanced feature of mixing bitcoin. The audit job is to try to track back the mixed funds.You all must be familiar of coinjoin so nothing new to explain.Their advanced feature is to mix your bitcoin with XMR and then from XMR to bitcoin. You don't need to do it by yourself, when you chose the advanced option then the system does it for you. At least this is what I understood. I guess now you have better idea.Please response again and I will share the thread with my client so that they can receive your input to accept your suggestion or even give the job to check things.Cheers,",

      "body": "So not code auditing as much as funds traceability. Still can't give an answer without more details. Since, there are 2 parts to the question. 1) Can someone de-compile the code / app and figure out how it works and trace things that way and2) Can you just follow the funds.If it's just a website, #1 does not come into play. If there is an app then it does.1a) would be if it's just a website has anyone audited the back end code for issues that could be exploited to trace the funds1b) would be if it's just a website is there any back end code that pulls from other places that need to be checkedSee: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/pl/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-walletsand2a) Would be who is controlling the funds. i.e. if you send to this app and it sends to exchange A and then triggers a conversion and then sends those coins to exchange B and then triggers a conversion back and sends the coins, since the funds would be out of their control for a period of time it all becomes irreverent since we would never know what the exchanges are doing.-Dave",

While code auditor play role on that job, i think what your client actually need is expert on digital forensic/forensic analysis which have experience on cryptocurrency field.

Optionally, you can repeat the above step with additional wallets/accounts for greater anonymity. 4.

If you are tracked one way or another you will get caught.",
