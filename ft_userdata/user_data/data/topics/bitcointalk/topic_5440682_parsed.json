      "body": "Saving in bitcoin provides advantages that fiat saving cannot and I would say you are in the right track to save on it. But just like Charles-Tim said, do not look only at saving bitcoin just to earn profits because that would cause you to sell off easily when a dump starts to happen. Rather you should look at saving in bitcoin as a store of value that hedges against inflation and your money will remain same no matter how long it takes. Again I don’t know how much you earn but 50% off your salary is too big if your salary is your only source of income. Try to save maybe 20 to 30% and hold the rest in fiat so they could be use for emergency purposes rather than running to your bitcoin savings when you’re faced with an emergency.",

At some point, you may be the loser, as bitcoin is volatile and no one knows the dates of its rise or fall.I prefer to set aside 10% of the budget for investments, 60% of the budget for the necessary things for life, including food and rent, and 30% for entertainment, because I don’t think it’s reasonable to deny yourself in today’s life, hoping for tomorrow.",

Is the other 50% enough to meet your needs during the time you get your salary back? in terms of investment you also have to calculate well because you will feel a loss if you sell bitcoin when the purchase price is higher and your situation is urgently needed to sell your bitcoins, I suggest you divide and you are more detailed about how much your expenses are for one month and prepare funds emergency so you will find out what percentage of money you will put into bitcoin, I don't blame what you are doing but it would be nice if you have good arrangements for your financial and mental stability because bitcoin is quite volatile.",

Like in my country, I do not have confidence in naira (our local currency), it depreciates over time more than expected, that leaves me no option than to not save in naira, although I still go for dollar backed stable coins because of naira depreciation. Yet in last year, as worse as naira was to us as it continued to devalue as usual, it is still better than many other fiat as inflation hit more countries more and they devalue their money more than anything.",

There is nothing wrong with investing in bitcoin, but I think you should still have some savings in the bank as it will help you in life emergencies. Because investment is not always profitable, and in particular, bitcoin is an extremely risky investment. I don't care how much you invest in bitcoin, but I want to remind you, investing in bitcoin is very risky, and you should only invest the money that you can lose. Don't just greedily look at the profit it will bring us but forget the risks we face.",

I think you only want to say you prefer to hodl your money in bitcoin because I don't see any reason you give not to keep money in fiat bank only that it is difficult for you to do but excuse like third party withdrawal or deposit process would have been a good excuse. So you only saying you hodl your money in bitcoin. For knowledge sake, hodling money in bitcoin is more like investment because of the volatility and risk attached to hodling and not like fiat which is more of savings for some needs. Investment in bitcoin is not the same with saving of fiat and on the long run if all things were good, the government use the savings for provision of social amenities as investment, so it is also important and good to make such money available through savings.",

It sounds made up to me because of what I have put in bold. Unless you mean it's harder to spend the money you have in bitcoin, which I could understand, but I don't think there's much difference, because if you can buy bitcoin, you can exchange bitcoin to fiat in the same way, using the same method but in reverse. On the other hand, if you can save 50%, it means that you are paid very well and/or have few expenses, but I would always keep something in fiat anyway, the absolute minimum one month of expenses, although it is always recommended between 3 and 6. Once you have that, you can put everything you have left over into bitcoin.",

Banks aren't really a place of investments, they do offer investments like bonds and time deposits but the percentage of profit isn't expected to give that much satisfaction for someone who's looking for greater interest rates.If you're for saving, the banks are the way but the value of your deposit will sooner or later be lower in value due to inflation. Before you commit of 50% of your monthly salary and buy it with bitcoin, look at your situation if it's doable as you're the only one who can tell that if it's possible or not.",

As the latest news shows - any bank can freeze your funds, so I have always not considered the option of keeping money there. And deposits do not have time to overtake inflation with their profitability. Therefore, you made the absolutely right decision to invest in cryptocurrencies. I understand that you can't devote even half a day to trading, or studying new altcoins, so I advise you to invest most of your income in Bitcoin. This is a truly reliable investment.",

I hope what am doing isn't a bad idea for not saving funds? hmm 50% is really a lot.Quite a lot of risks you get,in two months you fully invest your one salary in Bitcoins.It is important to understand what goal you are pursuing and when you are ready to sell.I'll give you some tips: don't keep everything in one place in case of hacking/losses you will incur big losses.If you store your bitcoins on the exchange,do not forget to put a stop loss so that the coins are sold at a price that is not yet critical and you do not worry once again about the price and its fall.",
