  "content": "Greetings Bitcointalk, We are BNB Strikers, we're new here and we will be active, it's actually annoying i did this as our token because there are a lot of discussions on here i'd like to get involved in. I guess i'll just have to create another account as well as this one. Anyway, BNB Strikers is BSC token with a FPS game as it's core utility. The game itself is a fork from MFPS by https://www.lovattostudio.com/en/ but we are actively making improvements to the overall game and have already created a couple of custom maps. We will be launching the game on the 11th May 2022. The token has been live for about 4 days, mc is sitting around 27k atm with an ATH of 110k. Most of our communication is on telegram although we will likely move to discord as gaming projects seem to do well there. The TG is: https://t.me/bnbstrikersThe contract address is: 0x0a19b4f4fcea9cd72e145585301f4c6eb1d46368Our tokenomics are 12% buy and 12% sell tax. We are currently heavily taxing on LP to ensure we have a bit more price stability as we gather more investors. The breakdown currently is:5% LP5% marketing1% team 1% rewards (BUSD) When we improve our LP to mc ratio sufficiently we will change the breakdown to be2% LP5% Marketing1% Team 4% Rewards (BUSD) If you have any questions about the game, the team or the project in general please comment below of send me a message. More than happy to answer any and all questions.",

Like this one I quote below, is one of your alt you use to... make a lot of discussion?Quote from: kamelbendali on May 10, 2022, 03:59:41 AMOkay",

The TG is: https://t.me/bnbstrikersYou'll need a tg group to make discussion for your community, a channel is only to get news update. Some people might want to ask directly about things.So much important thing that still missing, you should really prepare everything, before your game launches. I don't even see the website address for this BNB Striker. However, don't do anything unreasonable. People are very conscientious here",
