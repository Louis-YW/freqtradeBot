Being transparent about it will help people decide to buy the domain and site  Coingecko ask unrelastic amounts for their api's. i don't think is worth my time on it given the api prices are too expensive. also is more competitive than i thought i want to close the site. if someone think he can make money with ithe is welcome. i remove the site  anyway in few days so is last days to buy it if you want before I shut it down.",
