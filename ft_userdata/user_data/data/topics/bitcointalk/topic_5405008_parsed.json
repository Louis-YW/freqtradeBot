  "content": "Hi ,First started crypto in February this year so am new to all of this and the current bear market we are going through. I have so far invested £4,500 and my portfolio is down 45%. I have not sold any of my positions and have kept buying at these low prices with the intention of holding until the bull market comes and I can cash out some nice profits. I have been dollar cost averaging the last 5-6 weeks since we had our first real crash in May which means I now have pretty good average buys for all my holdings so hopefully when the bull market does come again it will take no time at all for me to be in profit. I understand none of us know exactly when the next bull market will be here but I am just wondering if anyone could give me their experience with what it was like during previous bull markets and how fast we can expect our investments to grow again?",

If using leverage, know that the risks are higher than it no leverage is used. Dollar cost average can help instead off buying all at ones. If you are losing 45% already, it will be better not to panic and sell, continue holding if you can do this for long term. Be expecting a slight bull and bear market in 2023 but be expecting a massive bull market in 2024. You have said it already, no one knows when the next massive bull market will begin, we are only predicting based on analyses of past price volatility but which may be accurate because bitcoin has never failed in long term bull prediction before.",

      "body": "During bull runs, Altcoins typically have extreme volatility.  Particularly Altcoins that only serve as a meme.With that being said.  I can tell you there will be a few scenarios you will probably be living at the time your coins start going bullish.First of all, most of them will get you big profits and chances are you will not sell, they will decrease substantially and then you will start waiting for another bull run which may or may not ever happen again.  Keep in mind some coins have gone forever after one or two bull runs.If you are lucky to be one of the few selling at high prices.  Then good luck not missing the highs.  It happened to me too many times to have overnight bull runs that I completely missed due to .. sleep.Then you have coins that get longer bull runs.  Maybe days or weeks long.  These are great and you have enough time to take the right action with your investment.But what happens most often is.  You get a coin with a good average, the bull run begins, you get the false feeling of possibly becoming a millionaire and the coin starts dropping.  Then you just hold in greed because you did not sell higher and then you end up losing more money.This is how Altcoin investments typically go for the regular person.  If you get to listen to your gut feeling rather than emotions and greed, you will do VERY well.  The main thing is.  Try to keep everything under control and take your time before taking decisions.  And stop following trends and social media.  Follow social media just to keep up to date with your coin's development and all of that.  But do not invest in coins just because everyone seems to believe it will turn you into a millionaire.  This is the worst mistake you can make.-Regards,PrivacyG",

      "body": "Lucky for you, you didn't panic like many who sold most of their coins even at a loss, although it's certainly not easy for you considering that instead of £4500 you now have cryptocurrencies that are worth half as much. You are right when you think long-term, but regardless of whether we can assume that history will repeat itself, we cannot be sure whether the new bull run will start after the halving in 2024, whether it will happen before that or perhaps during 2025.Be that as it may, you need to arm yourself with a lot of patience and be persistent if you want to achieve your goal no matter what it is. This is my third bear market and I've already gotten used to not looking at it as something negative, regardless of what the media and disappointed investors keep repeating - but it's nothing I haven't heard before.",

      "body": "Looking at recent history; 2017During the 2017 bull run, the market started moving upwards very slowly at about April, before then, the price hovered below $1k, and even below $500 about a year before (2016). The price run up to over $20k took till December, which is about eight months total. Then came the steep decline in 2018 as the price gradually climbed downwards.2021Following the above bull run, the price slowed down and bears took over with Bitcoin dropping to about $3k.There were momentary spikes in price in middle 2019, but it wasn't until September 2019, few months after the halving that the value of Bitcoin really started to pick up, and it took about 7 months from there for us to reach the value of $63k in April, after which came a sharp decline. This however was not the end of the bull run as Bitcoin still reached a new all time high in Nov, 2021. So this bull run lasted about 13 months.Note that this is no indication of future price actions, and you could be waiting well last 2024 to see the next bull run.",

Thanks but I only started investing in Bitcoin 2 weeks ago when it dropped below $20k. I felt it had always been too expensive until recent weeks and am glad I waited hopefully it can stay below $25k for a while so I can accumulate a good amount to hold long term. I don’t understand why people sell at a loss and I would rather hold. Being 45% down right now is not ideal but I want to hold for 2-3 years at least and by then should see good amount of profit, especially if I keep buying at these lower prices which I plan to do.",

For example you can look at the charts during the 2018 bear market and the subsequent rise from $3000 to $10000 in a short time to see the speed of the rise after reaching the bottom for bitcoin.If you are bag holding altcoins, then things depend on that altcoin because majority of altcoins will not see any \"bull market\" ever again. Just like those that died in 2018 and never went back up. For example ETH dumped from 0.15 in 2017 and was never able to recover it even after 5 years.",

Don't expect your investment to grow sooner this year or even next. Bull cycle is where people are very euphoric because many crypto are going parabolic and is able to pump 10x or even 100x. Self proclaimed trading gurus are very active during that market season. They hype different coins that will attract many newbies to buy it. What you 've been doing is the best strategy now as long as you will be able to hold it until the next market cycle.",
