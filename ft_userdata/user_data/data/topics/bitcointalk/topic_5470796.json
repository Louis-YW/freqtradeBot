This means it is not a discussion thread but more of a sales advertisement.We do have a marketplace section. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=75.0I think it belongs there.",

Initially i though you make comparison about Bitcoin full node software (such as Bitcoin Core, gocoin, bcoin and many more) along with available feature, implemented BIP and others. But it turns out you mix hardware, software bundle (such as Umbrel) and full node software (such as Bitcoin Core) which is rather confusing. Anyway, i think moving this thread to Service Discussion board might be better choice.",

Right now I added the more popular options, but I plan to increase that list. The nodes you mentioned could be added in the future. Regarding the features to compare, I just added some of them, but adding more is the idea. Adding a section with all the BIP implemented is a good idea.",

I hope you don't mind with my sharing for people to set up their Bitcoin node with small basic cost under 50 bucks. As you said many services can co exist and if they can contribute Bitcoin network, its decentralization better, it's good generally.",

I'm with ETF on this, the table looks more like comparing between apples and oranges right now. Some of the parts that say \"no\" for something like bitcoin core should say \"not applicable\" such as the entire hardware or payment method (to buy) section which proves it is comparing apples and oranges.Also I quickly looked at bitcoin core column and a couple don't seem to be right. For example year should be 2008-2009 since it is the continuation of the original software released by Satoshi. Also in the \"BACKUP / RESTORE\" section, if you mean BIP39 or mnemonic it should be clarified before saying no, otherwise bitcoin core supports creating a backup and restoring the wallet from it.P.S. Why did you choose Parmanode as the only alternative full node in the list? It is brand new (~6 months old) and very unpopular.",

Some of the parts that say \"no\" for something like bitcoin core should say \"not applicable\" such as the entire hardware or payment method (to buy) section which proves it is comparing apples and oranges.I decided to put all in the same table, so you can compare the different options you have to have a bitcoin node. The \"-\" in the cells indicate when the item is not applicable.Quote from: pooya87 on October 20, 2023, 04:41:28 AMAlso I quickly looked at bitcoin core column and a couple don't seem to be right.

Also in the \"BACKUP / RESTORE\" section, if you mean BIP39 or mnemonic it should be clarified before saying no, otherwise bitcoin core supports creating a backup and restoring the wallet from it.I know that the original software wasn't named Bitcoin Core, but I think is valid to use 2009 as the launch date. I fixed that. Regarding the backup/restore, I mean \"Support to backup / restore all the node configuration\" not related to BIP39. I added contextual info on the category to clarify that. Thanks for the feedback.Quote from: pooya87 on October 20, 2023, 04:41:28 AMP.S. Why did you choose Parmanode as the only alternative full node in the list? It is brand new (~6 months old) and very unpopular.No answer for that. I try to always add the more popular nodes, wallets and seed backups solutions to the website. But is difficult to include all of them, that's why I open sourced the metadata.",

Regarding the features to compare, I just added some of them, but adding more is the idea. Adding a section with all the BIP implemented is a good idea.I strongly disagree with you. Software and hardware is very different. It's especially confusing when MyNode offer both software and hardware. And FYI price of MyNode community edition (sofware) is free[1] while MyNode premium (software) is $99[2].Regarding the prices, in the case of Raspberry Pi devices I added an estimation of the cost to buy them. In the case of MyNode premium I display the cost to build the Raspberry Pi + the premium software. I have that clarification on the contextual menu (clicking the cell): \"Estmated price to build a Raspberry Pi 4 + MyNode 'Premium' for a one time fee of $99 which enables extra features\"",
