I might be new in this forum but not new to crypto. Advice is no a course. We are here to learn and if topic is raise people look into it and see what dey can learn. not the other way round.no body is an iland of knowledge and learning never end. Thanks though! for the informative link sheard. It will also go along way to our line of discussion.You will always get this reaction from the community when you create common topics that have been discussed severally. If you are not new in the crypto industry then you have to write on novel topics that have not been over-discussed in this forum. At this stage, it will be better to keep learning before considering starting a thread. Another key characteristic that will help you learn more is to accept corrections without offense. Many newbies left the forum because they were not teachable.",

There thing like centralization, inflation and governance that needs to be understood. Then if you try to understand about Bitcoin it will be easier than directly venturing into Bitcoin. The reason why Bitcoin was created was to challenge the existing financial system. I mean without knowing the problems how will understand the solution. For me the best resource was to read the whitepaper of Bitcoin. It has everything you need to fully understand it's capability.",
