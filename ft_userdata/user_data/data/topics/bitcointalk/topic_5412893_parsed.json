  "content": "Over the past months, the world has been ravaged by inflation and people are losing their purchasing power due to the high cost of goods and services. So many sectors of the economy are in a deep recession that has resulted in business failure. The pet sector is also suffering from inflation. In June 2022, pet food inflation in the U.S. reached 10.3%, Canadian had 8.1% and Europe has 8.8%. But when it is expected that during an economic crisis, people would pull back on spending on their pets, it turned out the opposite. According to  research  by Edge by Ascential, the pet industry is forecasted to reach $281 billion by 2023. Many economists believe that the pest industry is recession-proof. In the past two recessionary dips of 2001 and 2008, pet spending actually grew unabated each year by 7 percent and 5 percent respectively. Moreover, it has followed a steady trajectory of growth over the past 30 years.  It's rare to find a sector that offers both growth and defensiveness in recessions like the pet industry.Reasons for the growth of the pet industryPets are now part of the family: There are now around 108 million dogs  in the United States– roughly one dog to every three humans. In the U.S., 70% of all households now own a pet (an increase from 56% in 1988), which means there are now more households with pets than children. The bond between pet owners and animals is getting closer. Everyone is treating their pets like children.  Thirty years ago, dogs couldn’t come into the house, then they were allowed in the bed, and soon they will have their own room. With pets increasingly viewed as members of the family (even often taking the place of children as millennials wait longer to get married and have kids), spending on pet-care has consistently grown.Animal protection laws: Countries now have written laws that protect pets against maltreatment and suffering. These laws are really enforced in developed countries and not in Africa where pests are exploited. Hence pet parents must ensure that these animals are not maltreated. Therefore, expenses on their medical, feeding, housing, etc are a very important part of the family’s expenses. Sometimes the government subsidizes pet products just like other basic needs. Generation Z loves pets: It is now fashionable for the younger generation to own pets. The millennial generation already makes up 32% of pet industry consumers as they see their pets in a whole new light compared to their parent's generation. Millennials are now three times more likely to be pet owners than they are to be parents. Investors, founders, and analysts in the pet industry stated that while other sectors are suffering, the sector is bullish about its ability to withstand the worst. Part of this is because pet owners love their pets a lot. A recent  study by Consumer Affairs surveyed 1,000 pet owners and found that 57 percent of participants aged 27 and 42 love their furry friends more than their siblings. The study also found that millennials’ romantic partners come second to a pet for 30 percent of participants.In the UK, 3.2 million new homes adopted pets. People under 35 accounted for 59% of new pet owners, while 56% of those buying a pet for the first time had children at home. In the U.S, the numbers are equally staggering.  With the current trend of humanization among Generation Z, pest owners are not tightening their purse strings when it comes to everyday staples like good quality nutrition.  Covid-19 Pandemic: Stay-at-home orders created a perfect environment for pet ownership. Long hours spent in the office that once discouraged potential parents from adopting were replaced by the possibility of being present while working remotely. For the first time, half of the people employed pre-COVID-19 have been working from home, trading long commutes for quarantined conference calls, clearing social calendars, and yearning for emotional connection, which for many, has been filled by their pets. Consequently, animal adoption rates skyrocketed more than 110 percent, and fostering grew 197 percent comparatively year-over-year, according to Pethealth Inc. For existing pet parents, the stay-at-home rules offered a chance to spend more meaningful time and invest more deeply in their pets. The pandemic has made people become used to pets.",

The supplies will be more basic, non-brand items... there will be less buys and much less spending in superficial or optional things. The medicines and food staples tend to be the go-to items when trying to shell from a recession - these are classic defensive assests.",

People do tend to buy a lot more from stores now too, I think most pet ownership has been widespread for centuries in the UK and probably a lot of Europe but the difference is the trend that they'll buy things from stores for them (but there are limits to this - dogs can use human things and might need to - like repurposing an old duvet into a bed).Gen Z buy a lot of human toys for their pets too instead of buying things intended for dogs as they might be better quality or more widespread (to be bough in places like supermarkets or department stores while looking for other things).",

They are reared for meat and stray dogs or cats are captured and slaughtered. African culture doesn't support keeping animals as pets. Most dogs are reared for hunting or for guiding flocks. This part of the world has some of the best-hunting dogs, that can kill rabbits and bring the meat to the owner without several bites.Some pet animals in some of these nations' homes are underfed and mal-treated. Where the majority of households are struggling to survive, how would pets have good lives? Also, there are no animal care or protection laws in most emerging countries. Pets are treated based on the owner's discretion. You would always see owners kicking, hitting, flogging, or starving pet animals.",

A future when one company grows so huge that they deal with ALL needs of a pet owner could literally be the next huge industry.The main reason it hasn't reached there is the fact that it is a growing industry and as the article says Z generation is a bit different, but someone will eventually do it, and it is going to change the industry and then it will definitely be recession-proof when it is digital as much as it can be.",

Except to mention that I remember the pet food industry being linked to slavery in asia years back. A good chunk of pet food comes from the fishing industry. Of which the fishing industry in asia is known to use slave labor on fishing boats. While most may not realize it, it is possible a high percentage of the goods and products they purchase and use on a daily basis carry links to sweatshops and slavery in foreign nations.While these circumstances may be sad and unfortunate. They might also serve as a buffer zone on the labor side, which prevents pet food from reaching unaffordable levels. I don't even know what to think about that.",
