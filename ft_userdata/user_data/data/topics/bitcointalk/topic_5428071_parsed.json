  "content": "Hi there,I'm part of a team developing a crypto/blockchain game that has big $$ prize potential. I'm doing some research and hoping this community can help. If you guys have any insight/thoughts on the following questions please share them. We are really trying to build something that is enjoyable for the crypto gaming/gambling community.- What are some current pain points in the crypto gaming/gambling space for players?- What would you like to see?- What makes one game fun to play -- more so than other competitors that have similar games (ex: why you enjoy playing crypto poker on X site rather than site A)?- Who are some absolute Degens in the space?- Aside from BitcoinTalk (this forum) where else do you get your news that you trust (which newsletters, sites, which Youtubers, any twitter accounts)?We just want to build this game the right way that players actually enjoy playing in addition to potential of winning big....  Thanks all.",

      "body": "For me specifically, two aspects of online gambling using cryptocurrency are important: 1. The absence of a mandatory KYC procedure.  2. It is desirable to have small commissions for transactions.  To do this, either use coins with a small commission (for example, TRON).  But specifically for me, the best of course is bitcoin payments through the Lightning Network protocol.  It may be difficult to implement it in an online casino, but it is convenient for Bitcoin users.  Here in a nutshell, what is important in my opinion.  Good luck with your project!!!",

      "body": "- What are some current pain points in the crypto gaming/gambling space for players?For me definitely KYC and especially cheating on KYC. Casinos that allow you to play with no KYC and ask for it only when you win and want to withdraw, then make you go through a number of obstacles before you're finally approved.- What would you like to see?I wish someone finally makes a good pvp game. I know it's hard but I'd love to play something like tekken or even as simple as scrabble gainst another person at a casino. What we don't want more (at least IMO) is another casino with dice and slots. - What makes one game fun to play -- more so than other competitors that have similar games (ex: why you enjoy playing crypto poker on X site rather than site A)?For some people it's going to be a site where they won a bunch of money, for others it's going to be their first casino that they like to play. I think that many people played on Primedice because it was the first site of this type that advertised so much on bitcointalk so it got a big group of players when there was almost nowhere else to go to and these people kept habitually playing there years later- Who are some absolute Degens in the space?Probably people who make money promoting scams like people with 1xbit sigs, unless you're asking about crazy gamblers who lose a lot of money and say they quit, but they don't quit but do it for attention.

I don't think a service can expect to do well straight away either, a lot of people here are skeptical of new projects, you'll get a lot more deposits a few years after initially opening if you keep a good reputation. Games with a bit of character are generally beter than those that aren't too, from something as simple as artwork to offering different rules to introducing completely new games that can't be played elsewhere are generally good places to start imo.",

I'd put the latter in a higher priority than the former, it's a serious pain in the ass if support doesn't answer you properly or just says the same thing over and over again for months.

At least if you say from the beginning that there is KYC in your rules, the players who will play on your platform will be aware of it. So that you don't criticize somehow.Second, I hope your percentage per transaction is not large. Then when it comes to sources of information about crypto gambling, one of the good sources is cryptonews.com, but I know there are others besides this.Then if the casino that will be made has faucets, I hope it will be unique compared to others, I mean it would be better for the type of gamblers themselves to promote it. So far this is all I can say. Good luck to you",
