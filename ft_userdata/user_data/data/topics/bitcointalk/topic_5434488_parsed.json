  "content": "QuoteA federal agency says a ban on gas stoves is on the table amid rising concern about harmful indoor air pollutants emitted by the appliances.The US Consumer Product Safety Commission plans to take action to address the pollution, which can cause health and respiratory problems.“This is a hidden hazard,” Richard Trumka Jr., an agency commissioner, said in an interview. “Any option is on the table. Products that can’t be made safe can be banned.”Natural gas stoves, which are used in about 40% of homes in the US, emit air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter at levels the EPA and World Health Organization have said are unsafe and linked to respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, cancer, and other health conditions, according to reports by groups such as the Institute for Policy Integrity and the American Chemical Society. Consumer Reports, in October, urged consumers planning to buy a new range to consider going electric after tests conducted by the group found high levels of nitrogen oxide gases from gas stoves.New peer-reviewed research published last month in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health found that more than 12% of current childhood asthma cases in the US can be attributed to gas stove use.“There is about 50 years of health studies showing that gas stoves are bad for our health, and the strongest evidence is on children and children’s asthma,” said Brady Seals, a manager in the carbon-free buildings program at the nonprofit clean energy group RMI and a co-author of the study. “By having a gas connection, we are polluting the insides of our homes.”The Bethesda, Maryland-based Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has a staff of roughly 500, plans to open public comment on hazards posed by gas stoves later this winter. Besides barring the manufacture or import of gas stoves, options include setting standards on emissions from the appliances, Trumka said.Lawmakers have weighed in, asking the commission to consider requiring warning labels, range hoods and performance standards. In a letter to the agency in December, lawmakers including Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, both Democrats, urged action and called gas-stove emissions a “cumulative burden” on Black, Latino and low-income households that disproportionately experience air pollution.Parallel efforts by state and local policymakers are targeting the use of natural gas in buildings more broadly, in a push to reduce climate-warming emissions (such as from methane) that exacerbate climate change. Nearly 100 cities and counties have adopted policies that require or encourage a move away from fossil fuel powered buildings. The New York City Council voted in 2021 to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings smaller than seven stories by the end of this year. The California Air Resources Board unanimously voted in September to ban the sale of natural gas-fired furnaces and water heaters by 2030.Consumers who want to switch from gas to electric ranges could get some help from the massive climate spending bill signed into law in August. The Inflation Reduction Act includes rebates of up to $840 for the purchase of new electric ranges as part of some $4.5 billion in funding to help low- and moderate-income households electrify their homes.The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, which represents gas range manufacturers such as Whirlpool Corp., says that cooking produces emissions and harmful byproducts no matter what kind of stove is used.“Ventilation is really where this discussion should be, rather than banning one particular type of technology,” said Jill Notini, a vice president with the Washington-based trade group. “Banning one type of a cooking appliance is not going to address the concerns about overall indoor air quality. We may need some behavior change, we may need [people] to turn on their hoods when cooking.”Natural gas distributors, whose business is threatened by the growing push to electrify homes, argue that a ban on natural gas stoves would drive up costs for homeowners and restaurants with little environmental gain. The American Gas Association, which represents utilities such as Dominion Energy Inc. and DTE Energy Co., said in a statement that regulatory and advisory agencies responsible for protecting residential consumer health and safety have presented no documented risks from gas stoves.“The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and EPA do not present gas ranges as a significant contributor to adverse air quality or health hazard in their technical or public information literature, guidance, or requirements,” said Karen Harbert, the group’s president. “The most practical, realistic way to achieve a sustainable future where energy is clean, as well as safe, reliable and affordable, is to ensure it includes natural gas and the infrastructure that transports it.”Trumka, who before joining the commission worked for a House committee in a role that included work on toxic heavy metals in baby food and the health hazards of e-cigarettes, said the commission could issue its proposal as soon as this year, though he conceded that would be “on the quick side.”“There is this misconception that if you want to do fine-dining kind of cooking it has to be done on gas,” Trumka said. “It’s a carefully manicured myth.”https://time.com/6245607/us-consumer-safety-commission-considers-gas-stove-ban/....Summary:QuoteNatural gas stoves, which are used in about 40% of homes in the US, emit air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and fine particulate matter at levels the EPA and World Health Organization have said are unsafe and linked to respiratory illness, cardiovascular problems, cancer, and other health conditions, according to reports by groups such as the Institute for Policy Integrity and the American Chemical Society.

To an extent, we have already seen this occurring. Aerospace engineers like space X have abandoned kerosene rocket fuel in favor of methane, which is more environmentally friendly. Biodiesel, ethanol and fossil fuels generated from waste products were popular for a time. Enough so that ethanol became mandated as a required fuel additive across US states. While this may seem like an abrupt move, it has been happening silently in the shadows for a period of decades before this article was published. It might also be mentioned that burning some gases like hydrogen can result in exhaust fumes mixing with oxygen to produce water as a major byproduct. This is a somewhat clean burning process, which was a proud moment for the space shuttle burning liquid hydrogen. While there definitely have been prototype stoves built to burn using hydrogen. I can't comment on how economical or feasible it is.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSshAaDWu3U",

      "body": "Perhaps the most ironic part of the article is the bit about the so called \"inflation reduction act\" offering an $850 rebate for people to purchase a new electric stove. If 40% of U.S. households use gas stoves, then is the government planning on stepping in and subsidizing millions of electric stoves? I'm sure spending all that money will surely reduce inflation.Just the newest priority of the Biden administration's, creating culture wars centralized around electric stoves. They aren't even that dangerous.",

They come in pairs and they are rectangular. The key is, the way the north and south poles are oriented. Put them together slowly and rotate them 360 degrees. If they stay together then they should work. Use electrical tape or zip ties to put them over your fuel line. There should be an even gap between the two magnets with the fuel line in the middle. Both pulling towards each other. Magnets put on a rubber fuel line will produce an effect much sooner than putting them on a metal line. The metal line can take a few months to see a noticeable difference, while magnets on a rubber propane hose should yield results the first time you cook with them. Every time the magnets get moved on a metal fuel line it resets the time it takes to work properly. Also saves on my fuel bill and makes the food taste much better with a lower taste of propane.

Seriously you believe?Magnets are used to clean the fine particle of metals that remain after a major gas pipe is cleaned in the interior, with a magnetic pig run usually, you putting a few 1$ magnets on top of a gas line has the same effect as rubbing gas pipe so the gas inside gets warmer and produces more heat!

Unless it's very strongly supported socially, meaning that those who can't afford a different stove or pay electricity bills will be fully supported from taxpayers' money, but the USA isn't strong on social welfare.I was supportive of abandoning gas stoves, even though there's something beautiful in cooking on gas (because it's kind of like fire, more natural) than on electric stove, until the rolling blackouts in Ukraine. Imagine not having electricity for lots of hours daily and having an electric stove, being unable to cook yourself anything in these time periods. I know it can seem distant and impossible to happen in the USA, and maybe the risk is indeed very low, but what about natural disasters or some other causes? In the world we live in, this kind of stuff must unfortunately be taken into account as well.Oh, and also, since natural gas and coal are major sources of electricity in the USA, the increase in using those following a higher demand for electricity if gas stoves aren't used and the pollution that will cause (along with associated health risks) must be taken into account as well.",
