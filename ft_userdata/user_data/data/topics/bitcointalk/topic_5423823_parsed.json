      "body": "The safest way, and also the way that the rich people have used when they lend money, is to do these two things:1. Don't lend the money until the borrower gives you some property, temporarily, that is worth at least 3 times the amount being borrowed. Of course, if he pays you back, be honest and return his property to him. You build your reputation that way.2. Make sure to get the property appraised by 2 or 3 reputable appraisers, so that you know the true value of the property. When I say 'property', I don't necessarily mean real estate. Property can be anything that you are comfortable with accepting.",

They get paid a HUGE amount without there being any interest. Of course, they get more with compounded interest. How do they get paid? Without the interest being included, these two ways:1. The first way is that they treat the loan paperwork that the borrower signs, as money. The get money from the borrower when they accept the loan paperwork. It is money. Then they give the borrower his green money.2. They get paid another full loan amount over the term of the loan, as the borrower repays the loan... because he doesn't know that he already paid it with the loan paperwork.Banks get paid at least twice on their loans.",

And if he is truly an honest person who has fallen on hard times, lend him the money. In addition, if he can't repay the money, don't demand it back.

Trust is not really working when it comes to lending money. You let them borrow your money because you trust that person, but it turns out that he or she will not pay you. It is really best to see if that person is capable of paying you back the amount of money he will borrow and also to be sure you can both sign two documents that he needs to pay it back (though the issue with this is that if you file a case against the person who is not paying you back, it will cost a lot more money than the amount the person borrowed). But always keep in mind that the borrower really needs to borrow money because he has reasons like they don't have food now, they need to pay tuition, etc., so in this case, I think we should just borrow them the money and just think of it as giving it to them as a help.",

Only probalem these days is compex taxation and just moving money to other wallets and back could get me in trouble if i couldn't remember that what i have loaned and to whom. So i would have to keep a journal of my transactions for several years after i've lended, which seems like a lot of effort for helping someone.

Lending money to someone can cause a lot of problems if the person fails to pay it back. I have had so many issues where people fail to pay me back the funds a lent to them. Currently, I only lend money to people I trust. Others would have to. prove to me that they are reliable before I can give them the money they want. If I don't trust the person, I would only lend the amount of money I can comfortably forgo. Lending a huge amount of money to someone that is not trustworthy would require collateral. And if the person has no collateral I would give the person a little amount that I can forget if the person fails to pay back. In don't consider relationships while giving a loan, but I rely on intregity and.past experience.",
