You should know that having more than one account here in the forum is not against any rule, the only time issue arise is when you start to use your alt account to participate in the same campaign that clearly stated that alts ain‚Äôt allowed. So I‚Äôd suggest you go login to your main account edit your report and state of those account cheated or not, and also explain how they are connected because right now all I can see is a bunch of different wallet addresses and images which I have no clue what they are about so do well to include an explanation as to how those account are connected and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get help from one or two DT members in tagging them. When I was actively trying to catch bounty cheaters I did receive a great advise back then and I‚Äôll just quote it here ‚Äùif you believe your proofs are strong enough then you can proceed to leave a red tag for those account you don‚Äôt have to wait for a DT member to do it for you‚Äù.One last thing before I go, if you read the rule of that thread you‚Äôll notice that newbies ain‚Äôt allowed to make any report there (I‚Äôm not sure if the rule have been removed) so next time just create a new thread and make your report there and after that copy the link of your thread and post in the main cheaters report thread that way you‚Äôll have members view your thread and give you the appropriate support that you need, and please don‚Äôt create a new thread for each report you can use one dedicated thread for all your reports.",

Newbies don't understand Alt detective, unless the newbie who made the report has been on the forum for a long time and has a high ranking Alt account, it's just that they don't dare accuse Alt of being connected to their main account, that's what often happens, hiding behind the scenes.2. Your report does not show valid evidence and the mistake is cheating in campaigns and so on, remember that you are allowed to have an Alt account on this forum, judge it based on valid evidence, You can't just use one piece of evidence (transactions). You have to look for other strong evidence that points to them really being deceptive/fraudulent.3. You have already made a report about the Alt account in this thread: Topic: Known Alts of any-one - A User Generated List Mk IV (2023 Q4) [MODERATED] üî¨, But you do not comply with the rules in the thread, which state as follows.Quoten Accounts Connected: (Note: Banned shown in red / Inactive in Blue / Active profile (in ordinary link colour))(Where possible put UID's in numerical order keeping these UID's on the one line) Username, Username, Username, (and so on).Proof:(your proof - Please provide substantial proof that the accounts you listed are owned by one and the same person.

And so on, report to the campaign manager, if you cheat, so they can take action.QuoteWhy allow newbie to register.* This forum is free for anyone who wants to register and join this forum, everyone here started from beginners, so what's the problem if beginners want to register and know more about Bitcoin and understand the existing forum rules, there is nothing wrong with beginners registering here.Quotebanned all newbie so you big member free,* This is not true, you are wrong in this case, try visiting all the boards, especially the Bounty (Altcoin) board, there are billions of beginners partying and it's safe there, your accusation in freedom for high ranking members statement is not true, many high ranking members here are helping beginners to be more sportsmanlike and genius.Quotecheck below and bann all account* It's not our authority, you read and understand these rules: Topic: Unofficial list of (official) Bitcointalk.org rules, guidelines, FAQ, before saying and ordering to block other members' accounts.I hope that what I have said above can be a basic reference for you, before making suggestions and making accusations.",

Even though it's a somewhat redundant and circular process, it shows who is dedicated to the forum, indirectly. It also:- Has large demand (unfortunately this is also the cause of the problem).- Creates posts in campaign threads and creates potential opportunity for catchers. It is favorable to allow posts, then ban them, instead of blocking new entry entirely. - Members of the community are rewarded for finding and judging these cheaters (rightfully so, they are cheating after all).- Campaign managers and advertisers award helping members for helping their interests and saving wasteful expenditure.While redundant and inefficient, interrupting this circular process with an additional barrier of entry on top of cloudflare and javascript captcha which can easily deter new, legitimate users. A way to automate the catching process would solve a lot of the inefficiencies proven by the way things currently work. I wouldn't be surprised if one or more of the great minds of the forum aren't already working on something.

That even means that such a person lacks quality posting and might be guilty of many atrocities like multiple accounts, plagiarism, senseless and AI posts. Once the problem is identified and the OP could change, there shouldn't be any problem afterwards. But instead, such continues to flood the forum with new accounts and meaningless posts and still blame the forum for it.",

Quote from: Igebotz on October 03, 2023, 07:12:41 PMThe OP is throwing mud at the wall and hoping it sticks.Multiple accounts is allowed, and off-forum transactions do not prove anything. Op may not know this. Have you bothered to check his claims? I did and what I found is that those 5 accounts indeed sent tokens to the same address (0x9759d20AaCA9fd385CE081D9C0181a032fe2eC4A) ¬†and 3 of them at basically the same time which means that they are most likely part of alt farm and chances are that more accounts can be found but tbh I got sick of that whack a mole game so not gonna bother finding them.Here's the evidence, since OP wasn't able to do it in a proper way. What he doesn't know though is that at best these accounts can be tagged for abusing bounty campaign rules and that's about it, unless there's some evidence for ban evading which I also wouldn't be surprised if someone finds.",

Couples of some junky bounty hunters may be victims of this without realising it; the most important thing is to determine whether these accounts also share social media links and whether they are abusing bounty job. If the OP wants to be taken seriously, he should put in some effort and present something that the mod can work with.",
