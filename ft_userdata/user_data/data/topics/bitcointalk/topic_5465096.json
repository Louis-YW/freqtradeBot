  "content": "Funding fees with bitcoin are lower than traditional funding methodsWhen we use our credit cards to fund our sports betting accounts, we often must pay a close to 10% fee. The 10% funding fee comes from our sportsbooks.To be fair, most online sportsbooks that primarily accept fiat currency are passing on costs to us, to their players. So the 10% isn’t always sportsbook operators gouging their customers.However, 10% is a lot. Not only that, but our credit card companies might charge a fee on top of the 10%. Fees we pay to fund our sportsbook accounts are transaction fees from where we keep our wallets, Coinbase, Cash App, etc. There is no true middle entity like Visa or Mastercard when it comes to bitcoin transactions.2. Bitcoin sportsbooks allow players to keep their privacyKeeping one’s privacy, especially today, is tantamount to maintaining one’s individual and digital life sovereignty.Bitcoin sportsbooks, true BTC books like Nitrobetting, ask for a single piece of info, an email address. Since all transactions are done in bitcoin, which means they’re peer-to-peer and anonymous, there’s no reason for a BTC book to ask for more of your personal info.3. Withdrawing winnings in bitcoin is usually faster than withdrawing fiat currencyWithdrawing in fiat currency has to go through numerous checks and balances before we can get our winnings. This makes sense because fiat currency involves centralized banks.Bitcoin is decentralized. So withdrawals happen much faster.4. Bitcoin sportsbooks provide fairer oddsBecause bitcoin only sportsbooks don’t charge deposit or withdrawal fees, they can offer fairer odds. The house edge is often lower for a BTC book.Money lines are often fairer. Handicap lines in soccer, the Asian handicap, are almost always more fair. As sports handicappers, the best we can do is ask for a fair line.In a lot of ways, that’s all we can do. Fair lines allows us to use our handicapping skills to find winning plays.Keep reading→ https://n2g.io/03a8562",

Lower or free withdrawal fees on crypto sportsbooks won't always encourage them to reduce the juice or house edge on their lines overall. They would even start to juice their lines compared to before because of how big they are and no one would mention it.",

With fiat  there is a traffic with 'orders' becaude each payments are being sent to your mobile banking but with crypto is thru exchanges. With odds, I think it is because of the volume of bettors which are obviously larger with fiat which creates differences on it. Let's be real; using crypto in online gambling has its own advantages and so do fiat sinply because there's a huge difference with overall adoption of these two. But if it is jist by concept then for sure betting through Bitcoin and other cryptos would be better however it is not as widely being used yet which creates limitations into it as well.",

Bitcoin sportsbooks allow players to keep their privacy- Not really sure though, I mean it's no longer just a bitcoin address for deposits and withdrawals, there are emails and worst players are being asked for personal information specially if the amount to withdraw is huge3.

As compare to fiat which can happen very fast.4. Bitcoin sportsbooks provide fairer odds- Isn't though that both fiat based and crypto based sport bookies have almost the same odds? It's because they could have the same handicappers from Las Vegas sports. And they need to be almost the same odds otherwise there could be players going to exploit it.",

But on the side of fairer odds in bitcoin sportbooks it's not always the case, there has been occasions where odds/games have been proven not to be provably fair among some crypto online sportbooks.",

For years, when Bitcoin wasn't yet known the mainstream thought that it was nothing but a scam. The sportsbooks that have made their business out of it were the first to benefit from it. Yes, the factor of making one safe with their privacy is one major thing before but this has also changed.

In paper, it's definitely way cheaper processing payments and fund transfers through bitcoin than any other cryptocurrency on the market. The only thing that really breaks this is the fact that there are crunch times that causes bitcoin's transaction fees to drive up. But for the most part, and I can say this with 100% certainty, you'd get the fastest and cheapest rates on bitcoin than with other forms of payment channels, so OP's first statement stands by a long shot. The fourth reason is also plausible. For the most part bitcoin casinos are provably fair, so they are very reliable and trustworthy when it comes to game outcomes and processing of eventualities. And while provably fair could be cheated with, it's so hard to do so that you might as well just use the model fair and square instead.",

I have been playing on fiat and crypto casinos for a while now, and all I can say is that crypto casinos have done withdrawals right, with a focus on efficiency and speed. Fiat casinos take quite some time to confirm withdrawals to your bank account or e-wallet, and the releasing of funds are also dependent on interbank agreement on whether the funds will be made available immediately or after x amount of business days. Honestly a lot better to get your funds available immediately than wait another day to use those funds for something else.",

Then, you should coinjoin your coins to protect your anonymity or convert your Bitcoins into Monero and deposit them on your casino account that way. if you simply send coins anywhere you wish from your main address, then you shouldn't think that you are acting privately.",
