  "content": "It seems that they have at least been able to send out reasonably pacific communicates, but nothing like a major line of common progress other than we understand each other and we agree we should not try to kill each other... just yet.QuoteChina severed military-to-military contacts with the U.S. after then-House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited democratically governed but Chinese-claimed Taiwan in August 2022. Restoring the contacts is a top U.S. goal to avoid miscalculations between the two militaries.I wonder what has happened in the backroom. Biden came out very serious and Xi did not ask for an Uber to the nearest brothel, so none of them seemed happy about the conversations held. Perhaps Xi is thinking on where will he now export the Fentanil precursors... (pleeease let it be Ruzziaaaa, the troops could benefit from it and the people would believe the propaganda much better).QuoteThe two sides also agreed to set up a counter-narcotics working group. Beijing has said it will curb the export of chemicals used to make fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that has sparked a deadly drug epidemic in the US.Quote“Planet Earth is big enough for the two countries to succeed,” Xi said. QuoteAsked by reporters how the talks went, Biden responded “well”And now we know you are lying...  Jokes apart, there have been several cases along history in which a powerful nation is no longer the most powerful nation. It tends to end in a massive conflict, but lets hope this time is different given the stakes.https://www.ft.com/content/580731f6-8500-4a94-b49c-217a1c95da4chttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/veiled-swipe-china-blinken-tells-apec-us-believes-free-region-2023-11-14/",

      "body": "Not sure how the curbbing of fentanyl precursors would actually work for both China and The United States at the same time, I say it because as far as I understand the situation Mexico is (because of obvious reasons) one of the countries which may be companies or individuals interested in importing those precursors from China, in order to further go on with the production of drugs, would be Mexico and China willing to meet as well for the sake of making things harder for cartels? Time will tell. Since we are talking about precursors which are legal substances/chemicals to buy in the international markets, it sounds rather difficult for them not to be replaced by other producer if China is willing to cut their export of them to USA or Mexico.",

Well, Biden is unknown to stay in the White House until next year and let's see the development from this.In order for China to continue to advance economically, it needs to continue to sell goods and services (specially goods) to the United States, that is one of the reasons China has managed to become the factory of the planet, because their manufacture industry is one of the biggest ones on the planet, they cannot even allow their currency to earn much value against the United States dollar, in order not to scare away investors who establish their factories in China. The more foreign factories are established there, the more jobs the Chinese people will have. On the other hand, because the consumerism which is typical of the North American culture, the United States capital will always try to find the cheapest source of workers for their brands, so the citizens of the United states can continue to buy and get themselves into debt for the sake of self-gratification.  It is a commercial relation which, if cut could mean massive loss of employment in China and increase of prices of all goods in the United States in the mid term.For now they both need each other.",

So that slashes to their economy if they will continue to act that they're against US and if US will also have the same impact if they continue to bark at each other.

The main character had to discover the plot and all that... but what was revealing was the Chinese ambassador speaking with the secretary of state and saying: We Chinese will take over the United States and all the world, but we will never ever invade you, we will reposes you.On the US problem with fentanyl... well, somehow the US puts always the blame on the people selling... they should understand first why is it that US is buying so much.There is no doubt that both of them need each other.

Since politically China is an autocratic country which wants to force the will of the ruling party over all citizens. If the United States wanted to move their manufacturing industries, there would not be many options on the table for them to replace China, the only and immediate option would be India, which is an allied country of the USA. Though, Unlike China the labor law and industrial Security in such country can be pretty bad. Last time I read about slavery and child labor, India was a country where government has not been able to get rid of those social problems yet. It would better if the United States could manufacture their own products, but the price for the final consumer would dramatically increase if they do so.",

Yeah, there's political reason on it and I think it all started with Tesla. Those countries that I have mentioned, they're likely the options of those US giant firms that have fled on them and more likely to be followed if both will not have a good economic relationship. It's still a win win for both of them IMO. They've got most interest to every country and they just have to agree with whatever benefits that shall they gather if it's shown that they have both interest for a country that they're both eyeing on.What I am thinking on this one is about maintaining peace for all regions that they're interested with. Get all of those economic benefits but they shouldn't startle another war.",

Get all of those economic benefits but they shouldn't startle another war.It would be easier for the United States and all those Republics in Asia to remain at peace in the long term and share economical benefits if there was not political tensions because of the status of Taiwan. That relatively small island is one of the biggest threats against peace between USA and China. The worst part is that it is all political and about keeping an image in front of the rest of the world (by China), because the Chinese Communist Party and such a giant country like China is, does not need Taiwan whatsoever to continue to thrive economically. If China gave up on Taiwan it would be pretty easier to keep the commercial exchange between west and east, without fearing an invasion to the island.",

      "body": "This meeting really made many parties worry about the secrets behind it. But I'm a little curious about the inability to find a unified voice between the parties. The BRICS economic bloc probably won't make the US worry more (because they already worry too much   ). But conflicts in other areas are still very fierce. There is a little speculation, and I also encountered some discussions about whether this is the beginning of a plan to take over Taiwan and show strength in the Southeast Asia region.But another speculation is a bow from China to the US when China is also experiencing an economic crisis and many major sectors are facing debt default.",
