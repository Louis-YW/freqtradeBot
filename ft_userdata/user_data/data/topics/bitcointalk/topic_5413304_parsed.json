Do you have any suggestions for me?When it comes to choosing which online casino to play at, there are a lot of factors to take into consideration. The design and the in-game experience are important, but you also need to know that the casino will let you actually take your winnings and that they will be paid in a timely manner. Ultimately, there's no one right answer, so it's best to spend some time reading reviews and finding out what their experiences have been before deciding where to play. These reviews will give you a good idea of how each casino works and if it's worth your time or not.By the way, I think this topic is better suited for Gambling board.",

You can try them all actually as they all have similar bonuses and rewards. Plus, this online casinos are generous to their clients and has consistent bonus events. It's all up to you now in which casino are you comfortable with in terms of navigation and website design.",

We don't play on a casino that has issues like withdrawals and KYC (although it seems to be mandated now by almost the majority of casinos now).I agree with your suggestion, many gambling places have implemented KYC but it's different from stake.com I see they only use a phone number to make withdrawals meaning this is for security that when something happens with a withdrawal or happens to your account then they will be easy to verify with a registered number for further checking, at least KYC like this I prefer than using a face because it is privacy and very dangerous if you have to use a face.",

There are slot games but they might not be the one that the op is looking for. This is why he may still need our help.Based on my experience, original slot games who produced by a gambling site would loads faster than the slot games that came from the providers but I think slots with different payouts and bonuses are also found on them. Some of us can recommend a slot game in the op but he might end up not opening it due to his slow internet connection. I think it would be better if he fix his internet problem first.",
