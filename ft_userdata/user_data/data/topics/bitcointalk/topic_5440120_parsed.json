  "content": "I'm looking to sell the following Titan physical bitcoins:(COIN 1) 1 BTC 1 oz silver(COIN 2) 1 BTC goldine (COIN 3) 0.5 BTC goldine(COIN 4) 0.1 BTC 1 oz silverAll of them come with certificates of authenticity.  Unfortunately they were redeemed due to the issues surrounding Titan's 2FA coins. Coins 1-3 come with clamshell cases, coin (4) comes in a nice pouch. All are redeemed and therefore have no bitcoin balance.  Do not fund after purchasing. Buyer assumes private key is compromised.Would prefer to sell as a lot.Payment in btc/ltc/xmr. Open to trades.Thanks!Asking .03 BTCPending Sale.",
