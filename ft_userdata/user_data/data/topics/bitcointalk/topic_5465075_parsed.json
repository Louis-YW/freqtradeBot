  "content": "Just early this morning some group of soldiers in Gabon declared that they had overthrown the democratically elected government in Gabon, Africa. President Ali Bongo Ondimba has been placed under house arrest and there are also celebrations on the streets of the capital  Libreville. Some observers believe that these coups in these former French colonies like the Central African Republic, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger is to reduce France's economic influence in Africa. Gabon has the largest manganese mine in the world and it is controlled by the French mining group Eramet. Manganese is a major raw material used to produce steel and batteries. The company that employs about 8,000 workers has suspended its operation due to this coup. There have also been concerns about the continuity of uranium mining by French-based Orano after the coup in Niger. Niger supplies about controlled 15% of France’s uranium needs. The argument from the citizens of these African countries is that France is only concerned about exploiting raw materials and doesn't care about the development of the local economy. Others are also stimulating  that these coups are sponsored by some external forces that want to replace France. What is the economic effect of the coup in Gabon on the global economy?",

Everything is happening within the country, not that the country is destroyed or anything bad happened to the country.Major raw material might not necessarily mean the highest quantity, it could be an important raw material in the production of steel.It is in the public domain that most countries in Africa are influenced by their former colonial masters. They are not directly in control of the nation but they influence their policies through a puppet government. Like a system global economy is interdependent and interconnected and dysfunctioning in a a country can affect the global economy.

The argument probably has a lot of truth to it. France is still the power it is today because of its relationship with Françafrique, where despite having accepted independence and emerged from former African colonies, the relationship since independence has often been labelled as neo-colonialism in which France exerts its influence over local leaders and profits from it. Although I see the effect of this particular Coup on the global economy as very limited. Gabon GDP is 20 billion USD while that of France is almost 3 trillion.",

I heard the news in this morning as well, and I was wondering who is next and I am praying strongly to God that let it happen in Nigeria. According to hose who has witnessed military government or regime, the worst democratic government is better than the best military regime. In this modern days I don't think so again. The way the civilian governments are doing in the African countries are getting out of hand. And one thing you said that captivate my attention was the you said, other world powers are sponsoring these coup so that they will take over the territories, and I believed that is sure, there is a fowl play here in these coups.And another thing that makes the military to take power is the bad leadership, there is no way a president of a country is doing well and a military personnels will just come and take over power. Even the ordinary jubilation of the citizens will tell you that the civilian governments were not doing well. Like now if military take over power in Nigeria, personally I will jubilate, even though things will not come down again I will jubilate. The problem we are facing in these continent is the interference of the colonial masters in the African economy. And what is happening right is the manifestation of the neocolonialism.",

Ali bongo has been the third president of Gabon since they were independent in 1960 and he came to office in 2009 which means he has been in office for 14 years while they are in a democratic government. Seat tight syndrome is one factor affecting the African governance system and until a democratic government becomes democratic indeed then this revolution that is gradually sweeping the shores of the west African will not abate. Apart from the natural resources in situ in Africa soil, the leadership is very much rotten and that is why they allow neocolonialism in their midst. It is unfortunate or fortunate that all the countries that have witnessed these coups, the people are in support of the military which is a signal that the people don't feel the presence of the government because they are not those genuinely elected but were forced in or rigged their way in.",

But what needs to be done needs to be done not minding sanctions that may follow thereafter.What the outside are pretending not to comprehend is that modern democracies is not doing the African states any better buy rather the leaders are abusing the democratic process and institutions to propagate suffering even in the midst of plenty (a country that has oil wealth that can be used to develop her economy still nothing tangle to show off in the standard of living of the citizens).IMO let a people be allowed to choose a system of government that's favourable to them through a referendum and if you ask me I think the people of Gabon are completely tired of the family rule of over 5 decades now.",

Again, the question is who is now trying to \"coshmarize\" the hydrocarbon and uranium market again ? I am sure that soon there will be \"rebels\" running around with flags of one distant country Or do you want to say that the population of Gabon, which as of 2023 is one of the richest countries in Africa with the fourth largest GDP per capita, has decided that everything is bad ?",
