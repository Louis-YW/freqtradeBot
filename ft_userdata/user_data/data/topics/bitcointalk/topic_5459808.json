  "content": "Of course, there are many forms of scams, and scammed people have different profiles. At first I thought people who were scammed were too naive or too greedy, but in reality scams are diverse. Perhaps we could list the different forms of scam and, if need be, tell our own story to help others protect themselves. Don't forget to report scammers in the dedicated topic (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0). Don't hesitate to tell me or correct me if I've made a mistake in my list.1. There are the naive scammed, who haven't read enough about how to protect themselves and will simply give their private keys to a stranger who claims to help them.2. There are the CEX scammed. MtGox, FTX etc ..., they can be beginners or experts.3. Greedy scammed. Those who were promised crazy returns without doing anything. (Bitconnect for example or Madoff in TradFi))4. Romantic scammed. A \"nice\" meeting on the Internet, some nice promises, and the romantic scammed are relieved of their funds.5. The tired scammed, drunk, drugged or simply distracted by the kids doing bullshit next to him/her. A bit out of his depth, he won't realize that he's on a phising site for example.6. The betrayed scammed. Whether a beginner or an expert, the betrayed scammed has trusted someone (friend, colleague, lover...) and lost his or her funds.7. The shitcoin scammed. He/she bought lots of shitcoins on an obscure Pump and Dump group.8. the sim-swap scammed (https://www.businessinsider.com/credit-card-phone-theft-sim-swap-identity-theft-investigation-2023-4?r=US&IR=T). Beginner or expert, the victim is deprived of all access from one minute to the next. The ease of the hack seems to depend on the country. 9. The  clipboard virus  scammed. In that case LoyceV explained that (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5190776.0) : QuoteHow it works1. You select a Bitcoin address, and press CTRL-C.2. The malware changes the address to an address owned by the hacker/scammer.3. You press CTRL-V and lose any funds you send.Even if you check part of the pasted Bitcoin address, chances are the first few characters are the same, and you still won't notice the address was changed.10. The social media scammed. A friend has his twitter account hacked and asks all the victim's contacts for money. Or a VIP has his account hacked and promises a giveaway (it's like you send me an ETH and I'll send you 2 back, it sounds crazy but some people believe it).11. The scam application scammed. (it's getting a little weird my inventions of words  ). Victims, attracted by the fear of having to pay a fine or attracted by a supposed gift, will scan a QR-code or click on a fraudulent link (classic phishing). Then, if the victim downloads a fraudulent application and validates the authorizations, then the scammer will take control of the smartphone and possession of the wallets and bank accounts. => https://upgradedtamilan.com/an-ordinary-cup-of-tea-cost-a-woman-from-singapore-1-5-million-rubles/Am I forgetting any?Has this happened to you or someone you know ?",

      "body": "First, this topic is not best suited for Bitcoin discussion as it's not entirely related to Bitcoin. To me, it's either on beginners and helping them reach out to Newbies easily or on scam accusations, where everything relating to scams is being discussed. I have only been a victim of what you called the \"shitcoin scam.\" I have a lot of the rug-pulled tokens in both my BSC and ERC-20 wallets. Those were when I came in new to crypto, and I literally bought anything that was newly listed or recommended by anyone because I believed one of them was going to pump and I was going to cash out huge, but all were just mere imagination, which made me invest my funds wrongfully. I believe one of the most common scams right now is romance. Where we have a lot of impersonators online pretending to be who they are not and going after their selected gender victims, convincing them into a romantic relationship, building trust with them I don't know how they do it, but it's common these days, and when they have convinced the person enough, that's when they will, in one way or another, start scamming the person out of their hard-earned money. This romantic scam also leads to some sort of investment scam. When you trust someone enough, they will use that trust to their advantage and introduce you to some sort of investment plan where, out of trust, you will have to hand your money over to them. The exploit will continue until the victim realizes themselves and separates themselves from the scammer.",

My neighbor is a retired civil servant, no longer young in age. There's a little story about both him and myself, where I might feel guilty about my presence in his life.So, when the pandemic struck, my neighbor suddenly came to my house carrying a smartphone and showed me that he had bought some coins and stored them in a wallet on his phone. Being unfamiliar with the name of the coins he purchased, I tried to ask him. \"Where did you buy those coins, uncle?\" Then he replied, \"There was a well-dressed person who offered me to buy these coins. He said that in 2 months, the price of these coins will skyrocket.\"I was immediately taken aback and suspicious of the prevalent scam methods during that time. I delved deeper into these coins' details. And it turned out that my suspicion was correct, the coins purchased by my neighbor were from a scammer. The scammer was very clever, targeting elderly people. The scammer invited the victims to have a meal together first. In the midst of these dining activities, the scammer offered his fake coins to the victims.",

I remember paying $2 - $3 back then to register for a site that pays out some of its users if they successfully refer others to the site but on the day of the withdrawal (the did set a particular day in which everyone will get paid, which was the first red flag of the site) after requesting for withdrawal and waiting for sometime without any response we contacted the admin and received an excuse from them claiming that the delay was due to the traffic and after a few hours the site went blank.   Mine falls under the ignorance on how to conduct proper research.",

It's unfortunate that scammers have come up with different ways to trick people and take their money. Just last week my friend's WhatsApp account got hacked, and the scammers used his account to ask all his friends for money. Some of them fell for it and it's sad to see how common these scams have become.I think the largest targeted medium for scam is the social media, and a lot of other means including crypto scams.We all need to be aware of these scams and be careful when using social media or engaging with unknown individuals, always  staying informed and cautious so we can protect ourselves and our loved ones from becoming victims of these schemes",

Before many people use to have their contact numbers as their passwords and their accounts usually get hacked easily. The hacker will now read all your messages and detect those you might be close with or those that you have done business with one time or the other. Then he will start asking the person for loan stating some pressing things he is going through. This loan is this in form of crypto since you can’t dictate the owner of a crypto asset like you will do in bank transactions. You end up sending funds to him. The easiest way to beat this type of scam is to through to communicate the account owner through another means, effectively through calls. This way you will hear directly from the person. Quote from: Becassine on July 14, 2023, 01:38:21 PMAm I forgetting any?I can’t see the telegram exchange group own: this one happens locally where you are invited into a group and then you will see them buying and selling cryptocurrency coins and tokens with a much better price than almost all exchanges then due to naivety and greediness you end up buying or selling to them. The group will have fake people in it and a self claimed escrow. They will ask you to send to the escrow first and once you do that you will just be instantly removed from the group.",

In addition, there's the experience of the past. Being betrayed personally by someone you know is different: it's your trust that's shaken. You can't expect that. It's a disappointment that can be profound and go beyond the loss of funds. Not to mention that for CEXs, there's a tiny hope of recovering funds.",
