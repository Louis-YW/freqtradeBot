Why not create your own account instead of looking for a way to buy someone else own, book maker is among many other casino which are KYC enabled which means buying the account you will also be buying the other persons identity, if you don’t want to do any fraudulent thing with it you can just create your own account and pass the KYC procedure that’s if you really want to gambling in their and you don’t have other hidden agender.",

Do you not think that making such request here alone tells someone your intentions for why you want to buy a KYC  verified  account. Ordinarily, mere looking at this request alone and looking at your profile here is enough for one to put you on ignore list as your intentions are not clear yet why you want to purchase such account.Anyone dealing should do that with caution as OP is likely not saying his or her intentions for the purchase and this has to do with a KYC verified account OP is looking at to purchase.",

Obviously this offer looks strange though. If you think OP has one of the above issues at least OP should have mentioned to give us hint on it and why the purchase but I just can't imagine someone selling their KYC verified account to OP for no tangible reasons. I think it is very risky to get involved in such a deal without knowing OP intention.",

PRIVACY & PERSONAL INFORMATION3.1 As part of offering its services, BookMaker stores data on all customers including your personal information, financial details and wagering history. Information stored by BookMaker is held completely confidential and will never under any circumstance be shared with outside parties. 3.2 Upon opening an account with BookMaker, you must provide personal details such as your real name, email address and phone number.3.3 Details such as your mailing address may also be requested for the purpose of completing deposits, withdrawals, or other account activity.3.4 In some cases, additional documentation including (but not limited to) a copy of your photo ID, copies of your bank statements, or copies of utility bills may be requested.3.5 By entering into this agreement with BookMaker, you must provide full and truthful information in respect to all details and documentation, and you are obligated to update such details if any of your personal information should change.source: https://get.bookmaker.help/hc/en-us/articles/360002265797-Terms-Conditionsas you can read in their TOS everything is very clear, they don't want liars, they want real customers, people who create accounts and put real information and on this site people go through kyc, so a person who goes through kyc, delivers their true documents, and sells accounts, then this person is not in the right place. because you can buy an account from this person who did kyc on this website, then you commit money laundering, something like stealing money from a website and sending it to that website, then withdrawing it to make it look like it was honest money, but this website discovered it and reported it to police and the police will obviously see the identity of the guy who sold you a bill, the police will also see the address of the guy who sold you a billand based on this data, the police hand it over to the court and the court will call the interpol who will soon locate and arrest the guy who sold you the bill and see that even if the guy who sold you the bill cries, begs and explains that it wasn't He was the one who stole the money, he wasn't the one who was using the account. no one will ever believe it, the guy who sold you the account will get more than 30 years in prison, with the added bonus of having to be extradited to the USA if dollars are involved and the money that is stolen is money from US citizensNow think if this guy who sold you an account has a wife and children and is arrested and sentenced to more than 30 years in prison and is extradited to the USA, what will his wife and children be like? 30 years without being able to see their country because they are imprisoned in one country or another very far from where they are, is it really worth it to keep selling accounts and run the risk of being involved in a crime and being arrested? I don't think it's worth it. So my advice: don't sell accounts, don't buy accounts. create accounts legally, respect the sites' TOS, follow and respect the laws",

Of lately with the happenings around the Crypto space one needs to be very much sensitive and cautious as not to let things go wrong because no one can tell if one could be the victim of any occurrences as a result of your actions through sales of account and when the repercussion comes knocking at your door you alone would bear the consequences and can not tell who the hell you sold your verified account to. Wisdom is profitable to direct. It safe not to sell your verified account rather than being caught in the web.",
