      "body": "No one needs a soothsayer to know that AI generally has its good part and also has its disadvantageous part and will surely deprive people of jobs if care is not taken. With the world's population increasing daily, it's paramount to know that more jobs would be needed daily and the effect would be more pronounced if AI is allowed to do too much of human jobs. The effect might however at times be unnoticed just like the way ATM machines took over the work of many people unnoticed. But if carelessly implemented/allowed, it would really be a threat to the labour market.Nonetheless, I believe that AIs are still in their initial stages, and as people/countries clamour for developments and do not want to take the backbeat in this, they would still leave them to practically ascertain these effects (good or bad). It's after then that I believe regulators would allow some, and clamp down on many for the betterment of all.",

But here is the thing, absolutely every innovation that improves our quality of life and makes things easier, always destroys certain job market but there are always space for these people to move on different one.Btw it will be a long journey, people will have to be more educated because manual unskilled labor will no longer be able to do basic work and if they don't move into a skilled labor category, they'll suffer. It will be a painful at start, for a while but over time I think we will achieve a state where people will rarely work and live on pension.",

The bot is used to get job more easier and faster. It is just like the Google assistant, Siri, Bixby or Alexa which are also AI, although ChatGPT is more. I do not see a way it can lead to unemployment than to lead to more employment becusee this AI companies too are employing workers.But the problem are some bots that may be created that can lead to unemployment, this kind of bots will be able to handle the task that people to be employ will render. ChatGPT is somehow among but I do not think it would be to the extent that it would lead to higher employment. The kind of bot that will lead to employment are the ones that will do the work of human without the need of human, example is the bot created for the work if police, security, used in industries and companies to replace humans.Quote from: Fuso.hp on May 29, 2023, 06:08:17 AMIf this technology is used in the workplace, many people will lose their jobs.I think even if it is used in a work places, it would be used by people that are employed.",

Recently IBM boss Arvind Krishna stated that the company will replace 7,800 workers with AI. Amazon, Meta, Dropbox, and Microsoft are all investing heavily in artificial intelligence technologies that will equally make them shift some job functions to bots which will reduce the human workforce. But some economists believe that AI technology will also create more jobs. Every new invention will make some workers obsolete and create more jobs for others. Secondly, these artificial intelligence tools will have to be supervised by humans, so man is still indispensable. AI tools will be effective in carrying out routine tasks and might not be able to reason and handle issues based on specific situations or circumstances. This means humans will always be around because of their ability to reason and be emotional. The best any worker would do is acquire skills that will help him utilize AI tools to make the job simple and effective. Every worker should learn how AI will affect and advance the job specification.",

It will assist humanity in research and development, contributing to advancements and improvements.Moreover, bots have been in existence for several years even prior to the introduction of this technology. Bots have played huge role in aided programmers in accomplishing complex and laborious tasks that would have otherwise been challenging for them.

From reality - yes, only horse-drawn carts were massively replaced, because. the steam engine turned out to be just much more efficient and profitable ...... then there was a transition to an internal combustion engine, and there was hysteria - what to do with the miners, the economy would collapse, ...And many many times we experienced \"machines will replace people\"! These are all turns of evolution and technological progress. So it was, so it is, so it will be!Perhaps some part, and the most inefficient one, will be replaced by AI, but there will be no massive layoffs.There is also a global deterrent: if, for example, we simulate a situation where AI, conditionally tomorrow, replaced 85% of all workers in all industries. What will happen?COLLAPSE.I explain why - a huge number of people will remain on the street without income, and these are CONSUMERS AND BUYERS of goods and services. The question is who will buy and consume? Without this, no economy will work! Both AI and mega technology companies will be left without markets, which will lead to their collapse.

There are definitely certain scenarios where AI could *assist* people in getting the right answers or automating certain processes, but they will often rely on people as backup. That being said, it could put certain jobs out of business entirely, for example brokerages like insurance - they will be able to cover every scenario to find the cheapest coverage options without any person interaction, or maybe even travel agents (where they still exist) can definitely be replaced. It's hard to gauge the full impact of it at the moment because there are some many possibilities but it will run into problems too.",
