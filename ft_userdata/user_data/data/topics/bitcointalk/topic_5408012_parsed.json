I believe that going forward we are not going to have higher returns, so I would expect that in the next cycle, the price will clearly exceed $100k but not break $200k. I would expect a high of around $185k or so, with resistance at $200k which will be difficult to break.This is very hypothetical and if high inflation were to continue over time and go higher, which I don't think it will, as central banks are starting to try to curb it, we could break $200k.What do you think will be the maximum price for the next cycle and why?",

      "body": "Youâ€™re prediction of 185K is fair and probably most of the member here will agree base on the recent price behavior of Bitcoin on previous cycle. The previous ATH before 69K is around 20K so bu doing an estimate growth, the multiplier of growth we looking for is more or less x3.5 of the ATH which means the next psychological target for new ATH will be above 100K and 200K mark. Price prediction above that range is already insane and not logical at all but who knows? We are all lunatics Bitcoin believer when we dream Bitcoin price will go above 20K when the price is less than a grand.",

      "body": "When bitcoiners were anticipating about 10x growth in 2017 from 2013's ATH (~$1200), we got almost 20x. Similarly, when we were expecting another 10x in 2021 from previous ATH, we got only ~3x, thanks to pandemic.I mean always expect the unexpected. When considering the role of institution and retail investors, I foresee at least another 10x in 2025 but the base price seems yet to be set.Yeah, the ATH of current cycle may happen this year as well. This may not sound realistic but when considering the role of bears might have ended already (like Tesla already sold 80% of their bitcoin holding), we may get back to recovery phase now onward which may lead to a new ATH.Like before, I am still confident about getting into $1M level in 2025 as a new ATH.",

We cannot know what will be the economic situation in the world in 2 years when the next halving will already happen, but I think that $100k is the level that many have marked as their exit point and that it will be difficult to maintain it once it is reached.Â However it turns out, it will be difficult to reach a new ATH if we take into account inflation and the seemingly inevitable recession. Less and less money in the pockets of ordinary people reduces their purchasing power, and then all eyes are on whether a new big investor will appear and cause a new big FOMO.",

The same thing happened in this cycle when the price approached USD 20,000, for three times with a big resistance, until it clearly went over. I think the same thing will happen. Big resistance around 100,000 USD, it will probably take several times of approaching to beat that price, but once it is clearly surpassed, I don't think it will be difficult to stay at levels above 100,000 USD.",

In my opinion whole market will act like in 1965-1980 (15 years of going sideways with 4 market cycles up and down, while inflation was jumping Â to >10% and dumping in 3 cycles) - staglation scenario. So in this scenario, if BTC will fallow stocks, we will very soon see a strong recovery even back to 60k and dump back to 20-30k. Push up to 70k and dump to 35k. Something like that for next few years. Other scenario is that BTC will not fallow stocks during next decade of inflation (like in 1980) but will do, what gold did in that period. It pumped from 35$ per ounce to 860$ in 10 years. If that's what we are about to see, it will be possible for BTC to start 10 year long supercycle with ATH a little below 500k$ - which will be like 200k$ of current purchasing power (taking inflation into account)",
