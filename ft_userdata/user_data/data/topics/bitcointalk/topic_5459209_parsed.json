They will require you to create a fresh password, if you wish to. But if your keys are not with you anymore I don't know of any other means of doing recover password on wallets that doesn't require emails to create. Also don't quit yet, think deeply, you may remember your password again, unless you've not been longing into the wallet for a while.",

If you completely lost your password and had no backup, the only way to access your current funds is to brute force the keystore file. There is no other way around.I suggest you consider two options, a simple or hard way.The simple one is to hire services such as Wallet Recovery Services(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=240779.0). That is assuming your wallet contains a significant amount or you bother to spend some fees. The hard one is to manually use a password cracker application that is suited to the Ethereum Keystore file. Both of them require you to remember some information regarding the password. For example, to approximately recall the password characteristics, such as, does it consist of upper case, lower case, number, symbol, etc. and how much of the length?",

If you do this and you don't have backup the recovery phrases of that wallet then it will not possible to get back or recover your wallet. Just remember if there are recovery phrases somewhere. And if it doesn't stay then you give up hope of getting your wallet back. And so that this mistake does not happen in the future, always backup the private key or recovery phrases in advance.",

There are several cracking tools for json file passwords , i am not familiar with the best ones, but you can just google \"ethereum wallet recovery password\" or something similar and choose a github link that looks legit. You can also use google to see who has linked to that github if you can't read the code and want that legit sources have confirmed it.However it isn't guaranteed to crack it. If you have chosen complex enough password it's nearly impossible to crack. But if you remember maybe part of it can use it in your advantage.",

That is devastatingly unfortunate. It is a pity that you enforcing a strong and secure password yet on the other hand you didn't keep up with a backup plan. Certainly, passwords that contain a set of complex characteristics might extremely unlikely to be brute forced or cracked.I do really hope the lost amount is worth the experiences you might receive. A direct distressing experience might help you to force to learn more deeply about how properly safely and securely store a private key, it is essential not to repeat the same mistakes.",

The only way to recover your wallet through privatekey. You can do that if you have one. Have you ever used your wallet in metamask? If you have ever used it and then you can try to reveal the private key of your wallet through metamask. This will help you to sign in your wallet again without password. There's no way to know what's your password. that's why you shall always try to take private key as a back up once you lose your password.",

As long as you know some words that are in it,I think it can be cracked with enough hash power used to crack passwords.I had one blockchain wallet lost from 2014 and I thought to have 10.000 dollars there so I asked Dave here from Wallet Recovery Services and only gave him about 5 letters from a 34 letter password.Unbelievable but true he managed to find out my super complex password which again unfortunately I had confused that wallet with another one and had 0 money in it.The fee for him is 20% if he is successful and he is trusted here,at least he was up until 1 year ago when he stunned me with his performance.",
