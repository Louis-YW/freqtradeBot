  "content": "As we know after the release of Hindenburg report regarding the Adani Enterprises and its inside work, they fell way below 75% than the original stock prices. This was obviously a big shock to the whole trading community. The surprising thing was, there were high class Conglomerates all around the globe specially from USA and Europe continent thus making Adani as valuable enterprise. No wonder Mr Adani became second richest person on the planet with his collaborations and high throughout investments. However, his dreams were shattered to the dust right after his mal-practices were opened up by Hindenburg led report. Note that there are counter reports that were submitted by Adani Group thus as an effect, Adani's few of the collaborations have recovered from the losses they were hitting up since January 24.For example, most of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, and Adani Enterprises have gained 44.1 per cent and 74.9 per cent. There are few others as mentioned in the articles which were recovered by some low amounts but yet it's positive thing for the Adani Group. QuoteShares of Adani Group companies have recovered up to 75 per cent from their recent lows after a scathing report on the conglomerate by US short seller Hindenburg Research. All the 10 publicly-listed Adani stocks have declined up to 75 per cent after the report got released on January 24.Hindenburg Research, in its report, had made several allegations relating to the conglomerate's offshore entities and had raised several questions on its operations. Data available from ACE Equity showed that Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone, and Adani Enterprises have gained 44.1 per cent and 74.9 per cent, respectively, in the past 8 trading sessions till February 15. Earlier, shares of the group’s flagship firm Adani Enterprises plunged to an intra-day low of Rs 1,017.10 on February 3 from Rs 3,442.75 on January 24, 2023. Likewise, Adani Ports shares plummeted to Rs 394.95 on February 3 from Rs 760.85 on January 24.Adani Group's recently acquired cement majors like ACC and Ambuja Cements also witnessed a steep fall since January 24, 2023. On February 15, 2023, ACC was up 9.2 per cent from its low of Rs 1,696.05 on February 3. Shares of the company traded at Rs 2,336.2 on January 24, 2023. Ambuja Cements also recovered 9.3 per cent so far from the low of 315.30, hit on February 2. Shares of the company were trading at Rs 498.55 on January 24, 2023.  Other major Adani Group of companies, Adani Wilmar and New Delhi Television (NDTV), have also recovered 4.4 per cent and 4.7 per cent against their respective lows they hit after the Hindenburg Research report. However, Adani Wilmar and NDTV are still down 33.6 per cent and 33.7 per cent since January 24.  In contrast, Adani Power, Adani Total Gas, Adani Transmission and Adani Green Energy have not shown any sign of recovery so far. Adani Total Gas stock tanked to Rs 1,078.85 on February 15 from Rs 3,885.45 on January 24, indicating an erosion of 72.2 per cent in the past 15 trading sessions.  It was followed by Adani Green Energy, which plunged 67.6 per cent to Rs 620.75, as on February 15 from Rs 1,913.55 on January 24 last month. Adani Transmission and Adani Power crashed 63.1 per cent and 48.7 per cent, respectively, since January 24. Sharing his views on the Adani Group of stocks, independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga said, “I don’t think anyone is questioning the business of the Adani Group. Once the issue gets sorted out they will come back on track but it will take a while. Most of the stocks are still quite expensive,” he said adding Adani Wilmar and Adani Ports look attractive to him at present.There might be other articles about Adani Groups and stuff however this article is most recent one. If you have invested in any of the conglomerate then it's time to push yourself more because they are recovering. Adani had such experiences of downfall al the time and one case study suggest that they are highly managed to recover from such clashes. Adani Enterprises, Adani Ports shares recover up to 75% after Hindenburg-led crash; what lies ahead?",

They have done it earlier and now they are targeting India. probably some wealthy leaders are too jealous by the growth of this conglomerate and that's why such attack has happened on them. It's now the best time to buy Adani stocks as they are selling at a huge discount. Since their fundamentals are strong, I see no reason for not buying their stocks. Adani just needs to reduce their debt which they have already started working on. Hinderburg will learn the lesson soon!",

I must be cautious as usual, but with my preliminary speculations on the 1D and 5D charts of the Adani Enterprise, I discovered that the recovery is real. I will only do my extensive analysis to be sure that it's buyable. This must be doable for holding for the next 6 months as I averagely do in all my asset purchases.Perhaps it would take about 3 years for it to enjoy tangible growth as seen on the higher charts.",

      "body": "The investments of the Adani groups are very diverse, and therefore their performance on paper is better than being dropped easily, and therefore the economic variables will not succeed in undermining them, but the problem remains that these economic costs facilitate the operations of amplifying wealth, and therefore reports of accounting manipulation may be possible, which means that the shares are more inflated Especially with the possibility of buying back shares.Whether they succeed or fail, the group's shares are overvalued.",

Looks like you are listening to the fake media propaganda who is controlled by the same people, when Hindenburg released their earlier reports those companies were shredded because the reports were true and the same with the oligarchy company of Adani. Quote from: avikz on February 15, 2023, 04:53:31 PMIt's now the best time to buy Adani stocks as they are selling at a huge discount. Since their fundamentals are strong, I see no reason for not buying their stocks. Adani just needs to reduce their debt which they have already started working on. Hinderburg will learn the lesson soon! Adani on the other hand will learn his lesson along with the supporting BJP government as they are changing the laws for Adani to flourish according to his demands. The huge loans they acquired from national banks are backed by the shares which were already inflated by the funds they poured from free heavens. If you are really following the stock market you would know that financial institutions from India have fewer investment in Adani simply because they very well know that these stock prices are inflated by multiple folds. The major investment comes from the institutes controlled by the government.Quote from: stompix on February 16, 2023, 04:46:00 PM~When a company plays the nationalist and race card you know they've fucked up so much that they have nothing else to back their story.It is a tried and tested card and the nationalist and race card has won them major elections and hence Adani who is cut from the same cloth is playing the nationalist card thinking it would help him amongst the local investors .",
