The NFT seems like a video. But I don't know how can store a video in just about 50KB space. Who can tell me is it really a video?",

An attack like Ordinals has successfully slowed down the Bitcoin growth over the past year by creating prolonged congestions and increased fees that make using bitcoin increasingly difficult.I call them idiots because preventing bitcoin's growth means they are receiving that reward in bitcoin that is worth $60k instead of it being worth $600k.",

Yea, and it will also help to reduce the unnecesarry traffic on the Blockchain that are causing congestion and higher fees.

The protocol just doesn't have that option. They are scamming people by calling their junk \"token\".QuoteI'm curious to learn more about the impact of this congestion on users and the network's overall performance. How are users navigating through these congestion issues,It depends on the severity of the attack. Basically the longer the attack lasts and the higher the fees go, the harder it is going to be for users to \"use bitcoin\". That means at some point people stop using bitcoin and we could end up with only \"investors\" who are waiting and hoping for the price to go up while the adoption would have had stopped so it won't go up!Quoteand are there any measures being taken to alleviate the strain on the network?Nothing serious...",
