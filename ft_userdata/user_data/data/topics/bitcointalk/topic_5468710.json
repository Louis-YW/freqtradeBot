It used to be worse some days ago but when you're constantly talking bad about something but instead of the subject matter to collapse or get destroyed, it kept going and waxxed stronger, you'd give up because it's obviously a lost game. I could remember anytime Bitcoin is in the news for the wrong reasons, they'd be the first to show up on the forum to talk bad about Bitcoin Â I think they realized this earlier and gave up.

For as long as they are also bringing with them some logic, or at least some sense, in their arguments, it doesn't hurt the forum to have them in certain discussions. It provides some good balance, although some of them are probably not really naysayers like Proudhon. He/she certainly owns Bitcoin and is pro-Bitcoin. He/she's just chilling. They're probably a lot better than many influencers who are always mega-bullish in their TAs as if Bitcoin will just take a straight line to the moon. Many newbies must have been carried away by how they present chart patterns as if something big is always about to come.
