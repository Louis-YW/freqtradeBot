  "content": "Hi - I have my Bitcoin Core node running with the data directory on an external hard drive to save space on my laptop. When I opened Sparrow and connected it to the node the first time, everything was fine. Since then, I get an error from Sparrow that says \"Connection failed: Wallet file verification failed. Failed to create database path '/Volumes/External Hard Drive/cormorant'. Database already exists.\". When I close Sparrow, delete the cormorant folder from the data directory (in the external hard drive) and then reopen Sparrow, a new cormorant folder is created and everything works fine. Any idea how to fix this issue so that I don't have to delete the cormorant folder every time I reopen Sparrow? Thanks in advance!",

I would just change the walletdir path, relaunch Bitcoin Core, and then relaunch Sparrow, and let Sparrow create a new cormorant wallet on your main drive.I assume you have managed to locate the bitcoin.conf file and figured out how to path to your main drive?",
