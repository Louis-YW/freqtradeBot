Coincidence is a big talk though, I'm on OP here being fishy but that's all there is to it, I mean there's people out there that's good in trading and such so I won't be surprised that things like this happen plus it's not really our business if that address really has something to do with the rise in price last night (in my TZ), what you gonna do about it if we know about it early on?

Stop them?It is just speculation and nothing but it, it can easily be that the Wallet owner decides to have a change of wallet address one way or the other or even trying to consolidate all of them here just for his security, properly his recovery phrases seems compromised or he canâ€™t find them and then is taken precautionary measures before anything happens. The other valid reason could be he set out that 25k price target that he is gonna buy this amount when it comes. All this are part of the plan for some investors for the upcoming bull run and probably nothing more than that.",

      "body": "OP be there is nothing fishy about the transaction. There is every possibility that wallet or transaction might belong to and exchange or a whale who is moving his or her assets from and old wallet to a new one as the case maybe. Often times, they change vaults regularly for the safety of their assets because when such amount of assets stays too long in a particular wallet there is every tendency that such wallet would be a target looking at the recent happenings surrounding wallet hacks. So therefore I assume they moved it for safety.Talking strange about a mere movement of assets is just a speculation as that does not explain the main reality of what an transpired but if there is anything attached to this assets movement, do not bother because in less than no time, the truth about such wallet and it's transaction would be revealed to the community.",

Some people claim it's Robinhood, I don't know if that's true or just a speculation however if they are holding this much Bitcoin, most probably it's people's money.",

To put simply, the market is now getting exciting and active for traders to make profit from, they are not going to pull their funds out the exchanges and miss out on all the opportunities of making profit.Apart from that, transactions like this to addresses similar to this are not as uncommon as you'd think.

Well, if you ask another forum user then they would also say that it isn't fishy at all. There are lots of people who store BTC and waited for the bull run to happen.",

This isn't that much and it can be an individual that just recently made a move to sell/dump those as it's visible that there's going to be a sudden pump. Even in the normal days, there will be transfers like this and it has nothing to do with the market. Thanks to those pages that have been monitoring these moves because this now have became a signal to those people that are only looking for transfers if something has been done to the market. It can be a good factor to know the market sentiment but it's not always like what people thinking because it only gives you anxiety when you're in a FOMO.",

Instead on being that too mindful about of these movements then it would be just wise that you should really know on how to ride with the waves and able to utilize if ever you have noticed something in regarding to this.",
