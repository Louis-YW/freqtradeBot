Is Bitcoin a perfect machine or system?What will crash down bitcoin will be able to generate enough hashrates that can reverse many transactions back in a 51% attack. But with the hashrates bitcoin is having, that is not possible. Anyone that wants to do that will only waste time and resources and yet still fail. That is where I see vulnerability can come but which is very hard to do.",

Is Bitcoin a perfect machine or system?I don't believe anything in this life is perfectly built or developed; there are always some errors and things that people won't like about it, or, as I would put it, there will always be a tinny or minor problem that should be there.  When you talk about bugs, I believe the developers have been doing so well in fixing some of the minor bugs on the network, and so far I don't even allow myself to be worried about what is perfect and what's not. At least for the main time, bitcoin has proven worthy of trust, which makes most of us feel relaxed having it as our point of investment.",

What if there's a critical flaw that everyone has overlooked or not noticed and the whole system crashes down? I think the assurance is derived in it's open source nature from the blockchain. Nothing seem to be hidden from any body and that transparency alone gives users rest.If there was any critical flaw as we speak right now the antagonists of bitcoin won't waste a secomd to alarm it just to creat fear that would lead to it's downfall. So since there has not been such alarm even now then there's no such flaw. However we ain't saying bitcoin is perfect. QuoteIs it really impossible? Is Bitcoin a perfect machine or system? just as I said above, nothing of human invention is perfect but when a development is working smoothly we've got to appreciate it for what it is.",

What if there's a critical flaw that everyone has overlooked or not noticed and the whole system crashes down? Is it really impossible? Is Bitcoin a perfect machine or system?There was a bug in 2010, which made 184 billion BTC to be created out of nothingQuoteAn unknown attacker had discovered the bug and used it to generate a ridiculously high number of bitcoins. Had they set their sights on a more modest total, it is possible their exploit might have lain undiscovered for longer than the 90 minutes it took for the scheme to be spotted. Once discovered, it was inevitable that a patch would be rushed through, and so it came to pass. Within two hours of Common Vulnerability and Exposure 2010-5139 striking, Core developers Gavin Andresen and Satoshi Nakamoto were on the case, and the 184 billion BTC transaction was purged from block 74638.https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-history-part-10-the-184-billion-btc-bug/This bug is even documented in the forum, and satoshi himself fixed ithttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=823.0Quote from: satoshi on August 16, 2010, 01:12:05 AMQuote from: trebronics on August 16, 2010, 01:02:35 AMMost people running clients are not reading this message thread.  So...  Silly questions:1) How will this continue to affect version 3.8.1 (pre-catastrophe) clients with bad block chain?2) How will this affect clients that upgrade to 3.8.10 but don't remove their block chain files?1) Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations. 2) If you didn't remove your blk*.dat files, you're not helping to contribute to that 50%, and you'll still show bad transactions until the good chain overtakes the bad chain.",

Is Bitcoin a perfect machine or system?If there is a bug that could crash the full system, there is always the chance to make a hardfork. And bring back the blockchain to the point where the bug hasn't been exploited, and with the correct patch for the bug before running again. It already happened in the past, remember there was a bug that allowed a user to generate 184M bitcoin, and the developers including satoshi, had to fix the bug and make a hard fork. So, if it happens again, there will be a solution, it doesn't mean the end of bitcoin.",

We have discussed this many times in this forum and there are many topics about it. As you can see, the OP is a newbie and I think this topic was created only to increase the activity of the OP.But about the Bitcoin bug. Bitcoin has been launched for more than 10 years and has evolved a lot over the years. But so far no one has been able to create/find a vulnerability in the Bitcoin system. Is more than 10 years not enough time?",

Is Bitcoin a perfect machine or system?Nah, I don't think it's possible that no one till now has not seen the bug if there is any. I once saw a video on IG where the dude asked the other dude that did CIA made the BTC, he said they found some loopholes in the codes (IDK remember the exact term) but then he also mentioned that out of all the codes, Satoshi has made that one part of code not vulnerable to any hack. So it means no one can really get there hands on your BTC.Plus, we all know that Blockchain is made of chain of blocks and a small change in some 12 block, while you are at block 19 or whatever, the whole chain of blocks has to bee validated again from all the validators and miners as well. Which is not an easy thing. So I would say there is nothing to be worried about. Our funds are save, we are not using CBDC's assets. But still quantum computing is being introduced now and many people say the encryptions of BTC are vulnerable to these computers. Which I think it is not.",

Yes, but there is no reason to think the price could not eventually recover, what I do not know is where do you got this idea that the world thinks bitcoin is foolproof or anything close to that, as I do not remember Satoshi or any of the developers making those wild claims.",
