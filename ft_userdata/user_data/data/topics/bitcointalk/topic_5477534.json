      "body": "Personally I think the easiest and most secure option is to publish it here and/or via pastebin.If somebody wants to build a tracker (website, app etc) on top of that data, that's great but not necessary.Problem with any website is, that it can go down again or can be manipulated. Problem with pdf are certain security concerns, afaik pdf is a format that can enable malicious fishing or even hacking attempts - so some malicious actor could create a pdf with the same name and try to spread it.",
