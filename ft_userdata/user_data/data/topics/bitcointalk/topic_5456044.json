Since power is free it will earn about 1.32 usd in btc.Now if you get an antminer L3+ point it to nicehash it will convert the ltc+doge it mines directly into btc.it pulls 750 watts. It will make about 1.0 usd worth of btc.I can give you info on either one. I am USA based So if you are in USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ I could sell you either one.But if you are in Russia I think I canâ€™t safely ship to you. Customs would likely take it away.",
