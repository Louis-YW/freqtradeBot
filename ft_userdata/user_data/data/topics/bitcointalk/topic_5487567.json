I don’t think there is any reason to start another. You could continue this discussion in the most recent thread. I did try and search the word puzzle from forum's Home Page. I got 2 hits, One post was completely irrelevant to this puzzle and one random puzzle post from year 2014. Hence I decided to post it in a new one!I agree that Puzzles are fun, the difficult it is, the more interesting the puzzle If mods think this post need to move please feel free to do so!thanks",

And the rewards are also good for those people who solve such puzzles.So if they remove the private keys from the puzzle page then there might be something behind the scenes. What I think is that the site wants to make puzzles more tough for the users, however I'm not sure about that.",

But you can use the Wayback machine to access those private keys, i will leave the link here:https://web.archive.org/web/20230608025004/https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-txThe only problem is that the newfound private keys will no longer be public unless the finder decides to post them on the forum.",
