I dont know why would he say that but article just comapres the whole stuff with Fed Interest rate hikes and how they are affecting the crypto market, however in reality it's just baseless assumption. How can he say and compare between the market cap of Tesla stocks and crypto market and state that it's easy to manipulate because both of them have mere difference of 350 billions dollars. He thinks, 1 trillion dollar is very small market cap for the crypto and it could be easily manipulated.However, his assumption is based on the volume alone and not the factual analysis. Isn't crypto is also a technological advancement that was invented very recently and also under stringent jurisdiction all over the world? It still makes up most of the market despite the fact that its being boxed up by governments. Another point he forgot to consider is, decentralization. How one can get to manipulate such market which is distributed through public ledger down to the pennies! QuoteAside from Bitcoin, Ether, and a few other cryptocurrencies with a high trading volume, investing in crypto is \"more risky\" than buying penny stocks, according to Ronald AngSiy, COO of CEO.ca, who previously worked as a blockchain expert.\"Any individual can manipulate crypto prices today because of how small the market cap is,\" he observed. \"Once you get to the smaller cryptocurrencies, that's where it's significantly more risky than a penny stock for investors.\"He highlighted that Tesla stock has a market cap of $650 billion, while the entire crypto market only has a market cap of $1 trillion, making crypto \"easy\" to manipulate.\"If you look at the price of a Binance token, versus the price of a Tesla stock, you'll see how small the crypto market is,\" he suggested. \"It's hard, in such a small market, to say how what's happening in the world will directly affect prices today.\"AngSiy spoke with David Lin, Anchor and Producer at Kitco News.Bearish Crypto Trends in 2023AngSiy suggested that there is \"more pain ahead for crypto investors\" in 2023, as the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates.\"How that pain is manifested is hard to exactly say, because the crypto market is so small that you could have one or two front-end entities manipulate the price of whole crypto market,\" he said.He observed that since Bitcoin came into being in 2008, the crypto market has only experienced a \"low interest-rate world,\" with the Effective Fed Funds Rate (EFFR) never rising beyond 2.5 percent until 2022. Currently, the EFFR is around 4.5 percent, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has stated that further hikes are expected until the Fed reaches a terminal rate of around 5 percent in 2023.\"We've never seen it [crypto] in a high and growing interest-rate world, which is what is happening right now,\" he said. \"When you look at low interest-rate environments, it's easier for investors to borrow money, and then to take that money and then allocate a portion of it to crypto… now you're seeing money being pulled back from risk assets [like crypto] and either allocated to safer assets, or you're seeing risk assets being margin called.\" Despite the fact that FED is continuously increasing interest rates I believe bitcoin had null effects during the new year season. In fact opposite of that happened and bitcoin went up pretty good and it's not even full fist quarter. What market he is talking about ? Interest on the bitcoin is not getting increased?",

Please note: he mentions crypto (shitcoins), not Bitcoin and I could agree with that. As to the ability to manipulate Bitcoin, maybe he's also partially right: it can be done, but will be more problematic than manipulating any stock. Why? In order to dump coins, one must have coins. So you'll have to buy a boatload of Bitcoin and there is a possibility that scarcity will kick in and you won't like the price at some moment as more Bitcoiners will want to sell at a higher price or not sell at all. Amount of bitcoins on exchanges is also limited. Easier said than done.",

You should remember that in December of 2017 and January 2018 we were in the top of the bull market and at that exact time they opened the CME. The result of that was an instant crash of bitcoin's price and the beginning of these \"bart simpson\" price patterns. The same patterns with strangely suppressed levels that you're talking about. I've talked about it years ago, that IMO rich people are using high liquidity and low risk of the CME to bet billions of dollars on the bitcoin market and they're teaming up with bitcoin traders and/or miners to coordinate with their orders. Why would they do it? Imagine that  you've got a friend who has a lot of bitcoin left that he got cheap years ago and you both know he's going to sell at some point. He promises to let you know when he decides to sell, so you can bet on futures at that time, you promise to give him a share of your profit. This system allows people who bought and would never buy bitcoin to profit from the same trade together. But it's worse, if introduced near or at the top of the bear market, futures incentivize shorting. You can be sure people who don't want bitcoin exposure, people who despite bull market don't own any bitcoin, will bet hard on it going down, and that's exactly what happened. The timing was perfect for short sellers, and that's why it was chosen by the CME.",

In fact opposite of that happened and bitcoin went up pretty good and it's not even full fist quarter. Pick a graph, go to the dates the FED has released both inflation data (which was a reason for hiking rates) and interest rate itself, and see how Bitcoin has fared on those dates.You have my thread here, 3 times in a row Bitcoin reacted to CPI data the moment it was released, and people anticipated a more drastic reduction of rate hikes. Go to each month on the 12 or 14 when the data was released and you're going to see the jump or the dump exactly at that hour.As for this going up, it's exactly because of it, everyone anticipating a slowdown in FED's reaction.Quote from: Flexystar on February 16, 2023, 05:08:31 PMHowever, his assumption is based on the volume alone and not the factual analysis. Isn't crypto is also a technological advancement that was invented very recently and also under stringent jurisdiction all over the world? And still, when Elon fartered some non-sense on Twitter we went down the same way as Tesla shares, what dictates the price in crypto is the money that's involved and the profit people want to grab out of it, if they see a chance to make a quick 2x in a day they will forget everything about technological advancement and buy it or sell it like there is no tomorrow.Quote from: Flexystar on February 16, 2023, 05:08:31 PMAnother point he forgot to consider is, decentralization. How one can get to manipulate such market which is distributed through public ledger down to the pennies!What part of decentralization stops a publicly traded coin from having the price manipulated?If somebody would drop 3000BTC right now on Biannce it would rash the USDT pair nearly 5k, how could you stop it, and this despite a claimed 11 billion volume. Everything can be manipulated as long as you have the pockets for it, there is no such thing as an asset that would not feel the burn if somebody would dump a huge amount at the right time, and furthermore, this will be all done on centralized exchanges, the whole decentralization is useless when you rely on those for establishing the spot price.",

It's been the reason more people are waiting for Jerome's statement and what the market will do every time he says on the press con. Raising interest rates, however, doesn't just affect crypto but also the stock market. I think its different this time because of the looming debt default which investors are concerned about hedging from inflation because Quantitative easing may happen again in the coming months and the option is crypto apart from gold.",

A lot of rich whales do this everyday with new coins or tokens that are new and have a low market cap.

For me basically, i think the lad has some good point, i might be wrong though, but i think the guy is talking about the interest those who keep their money in the bank earn as APY or APR, and the game play here is that, the more that interest keeps going up, the more it is expected that many investors will pull out their money from crypto currencies to save it in their bank account so they could be earning the said interest on it.And he is also right about Small cap crypto coins being easy to manipulate, aside bitcoin, Ethereum and some other major altcoins with market cap running in billions, i can agree that the rest of the altcoins available can be easily manipulated by really big money, but still, that does not deter true believers from investing in the project they find to have lots of potentials, after all, cryptocurrency is still a growing industry and i believe that with time, a lot of good and quality projects will have their market cap running in trillions and 100s of billions.",
