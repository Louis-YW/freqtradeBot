  "content": "QuoteBerkshire Hathaway (BRK) vice chairman and staunch bitcoin skeptic Charlie Munger has called for the United States to follow in the footsteps of China and ban cryptocurrencies.In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal, Munger attributed the rise of cryptocurrencies to a gap in regulation as crypto assets aren't currencies, commodities or securities.\"Instead, it’s a gambling contract with a nearly 100% edge for the house, entered into in a country where gambling contracts are traditionally regulated only by states that compete in laxity,\" Munger wrote. \"The U.S. should now enact a new federal law that prevents this from happening.\"In 2021, Munger labelled bitcoin's (BTC) relative success, at the time as \"disgusting\" after alluding to how it is used by kidnappers and extortionists. A year later, the 99-year-old called bitcoin an \"investment in nothing\" as he doubled down on his skeptical stance.This isn't the first time Munger or Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, also known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" have gone after crypto with Munger even going as far to say that he wished crypto had “never been invented.\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berkshire-hathaways-charlie-munger-calls-094144939.html....I never understood how wealthy and successful men can sound so negative at times:QuoteThis isn't the first time Munger or Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, also known as the \"Oracle of Omaha,\" have gone after crypto with Munger even going as far to say that he wished crypto had “never been invented.\"For successful billionaire investors to say they wish crypto had never been invented. This sounds serious! Is crypto a big deal for them? Why would such be the case? I get that millennials, generation Z and the youth demographic love crypto and have been known to throw their money at it in the hope of someday becoming millionaires.Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger want investors and the youth demographic to throw all their cash at stocks instead. To keep stock indexes rising and make berkshire hathaway a more profitable venture.Buffett and Munger are upset all of the liquidity directed towards crypto, isn't being thrown at things they own to make them richer. But what would they do if they had additional billions at their disposal? Would it make a significant change to their lifestyle, net worth or holdings? What if Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger both had $200 billion dollars more than they have now. Wouldn't they be saying the exact same thing, doing the same thing they are right now? In which case, why be upset when it wouldn't have a noticeable effect on their lifestyle or standard of living?",

      "body": "Surely the point in sounding negative is to get melleniels, boomers and gen x to give up on the idea of investing in cryptocurrency and move to investing in stocks.\"100% house edge\" is also not something that makes sense. Did they try investing (with a tiny amount) at its peak and are now disappointed they've lost. Are they worried it gives a whole new precident on how people are more solvant than companies in the sector (ftx and others v retail investors). Warren Buffet does claim to prefer investments in the production of assets rather than investments in the underlying asset so it would make sense why they don't like bitcoin.",

Look him up and you won't regret if you're a bitcoin supporter but don't really like altcoins too much. He's got that sarcastic, yet informative way of talking about all the attacks on bitcoin from banks, old farts, scammers and politicians. He's got a video about these two old donkeys: Warren Muppet and Charlie Muppet, as he calls them. Hydrogen pretty much answered the question as to why these guys are against bitcoin. They read about crypto millionaires and feel like the young generation didn't put enough effort into this. They didn't have to do analysis, set up companies, take loans. They just did a few clicks on their computers in 2012 or 2013 and 5 years later were millionaires. That's how these old people see them, like the millenials are making money out of nothing.Sad news for you Muppets. In 10 years bitcoin will be worth $200k+, there will be a lot of young people running around in bitcoin t-shirts with hardware wallets in hand, but you won't live long enough to see it. If you do they'll be feeding you through a tube (Charlie is going to be long gone by then, he's 99, so this bitcoin rant is his last stand). Bottom line, I wouldn't focus on what these old guys are saying. There's a 50/50 chance that they'll live to see the next halving.",

Bitcoin is indeed a currency/commodity/asset (pick whichever you like), Buffet may hate it for not having clear fundamentals, but he's gotta try a different argument to ban it, instead of branding it as \"gambling contract\".",

My father is 85 and I have to often repeat things to get him to understand. He doesn't use a computer, needs a phone with speed dial to call people. I'm saying this because I don't believe Charlie's words are his own. People like that need help getting in and out of bed. He must have people who get him dressed every day and press buttons in the elevator for him. He must also have people who tell him what to say and when. Having an old father and knowing some of his old friends I can tell you that old people get bitter and they look for arguments just to show they can still argue. Charlie talks about bitcoin because there are people willing to argue with him about it.",

It's fascinating how much it matters to people what people like Munger, Buffett, Musk, Gates and the like think about Bitcoin - and it's even more fascinating that despite everything some people persistently want them to change their minds.I can understand to some extent that people like you have certain sympathies for these people because you live in the same country, but they were never important to me, and even less when they started poisoning the public with their statements about Bitcoin. Unfortunately, their opinion as very influential people has a significant influence on the formation of public opinion, and to me that is much more important than anything else.However, as you yourself conclude, their time is slowly running out, and one thing is certain - Bitcoin will outlive them and in the future prove that both of them were wrong.",

They can certainly express their opinions on whether they think it is a good or bad thing, along with the reasoning, but should not be making calls like this. It's better for their business if they keep out of politics like they have for most of their lifetimes and focus on enjoying the later years in life.
