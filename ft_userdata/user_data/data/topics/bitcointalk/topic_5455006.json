Despite whatever the regulation is, bitcoiners are still going to be doing their P2P.",

Na only if one man dey for position wey he see say him fit use him power do something for e selfish reason na him e go take advantage. Remember say na CBN Governor na e use him power put ban for crypto no be federal government,na e make the crypto matter no serious for Naija. Any new president wey enter seat na how to first open office wet he go dey use thief money for himself na him e dey target. So how he won use crypto thief money. For me,I no think say Naija government get any issue with using crypto because so many boys wet dey street dey into crypto. Prayer na everything but we too need to help ourselves before the prayer go work. Imagine arm robber wet dey go rob and he kills in the process of robbing,when he won go rob,he come dey pray for successful robbery. The robber dey play,just dey play",

Op you make me laf oo. Though nothing is impossible. But as it is the government e no get interest on crypto matters. There are some prayers you render that God will not answer too. No be the new government go bring out the crypto related matter dem. Na the Minister of Technology. Dat is why make God put someone who knows Cryptocurrencies. So dat the implementation of cryptocurrency in di kwantri go dey faster than before. If the minister is good then everything go dey stew and marama",

Make we just get ready and full of prayer oooo.I don’t really know but in as much as the government has not accepted the use of bitcoin and we still get to use it on a daily basis and most of us are earning a living from it makes me feel comfortable with it like that. I don’t know if there are other benefits that comes with it if government decides to accept its use in the nation. What I fear most after its acceptance is the regularisation which will follow up with tasks. Nigerians sometimes are not too friendly with collecting task. Especially now that it’s about bitcoin which they know the huge benefits on it, they can just put overzealous price in them and we don’t have choice than to pay.",

Na him still give the former administration of buhari the E-naira idea way make them ban and restrict banks from making any transactions with anything crypto, for him mind mAh the E-naira go replace digital asset like bitcoin. The man been just the introduce and implement policies without any plans and contingency plan ahead to work with just in case things wan go south.But anyhow shaa, as new government don com sit down and unseat the Emiefuele we believe say some those economic restrictions and ban on Crypto them go lift am and from wetin I dey feel, it's like this current administration under balablu fit favour crypto most particularly bitcoin for we country.",
