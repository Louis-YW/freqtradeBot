Workers in developing nations are mainly exploited by employers of labor. In most of these nations, there are minimum policies but they are hardly implemented or obeyed. This is because the government officials that are assigned to enforce these policies are corrupt. These erring firms would normally give these officials bribes and they would fail to carry out their tasks effectively. This has made workers to be paid far below the minimum wage because employees determine the pay and not the government. This exploitation is the main reason why the goal of almost all professionals in these developing nations is to immigrate to developed nations where their rights as workers would be upheld to a large extent.",

Rent is one thing that causes high cost of living in different countries. Those countries that have high and expensive cost of living, check their rent system for houses then you will see it is high. The government should help to reduce cost of building materials and to also have a proper regulations to renting of houses but it starts from cost of buying materials. Also by regulating the age of some houses to how much rent they can attract because old houses are probably built when cost of building was cheaper and they also have less modern facilities in them.Quote from: Fullbear2222 on December 28, 2022, 02:55:12 PMBusiness who dont comply with minimum wage rules should get highest penalty and not allowed to operate anymore.This is important also.

Life is also good when the wages are like this, here in our country 3500$ in Canadian currency is too much, it is equivalent to buying a lot or a house here.",

However, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of such policies, such as a potential decrease in the supply of rental properties or an increase in the cost of housing for property owners!!",

There is in fact nothing like the wage of the Eurozone, as the regions vary greatly in prices and income. Southern Italy, Greece, regions of Spain and even in France allow people to live even with 1200 Euros a month (no luxuries). Some people manage to do so with 900 a month. So those numbers do not make sense as they are.There are thousands of people (I dare to say millions) living in London on less than 2000.Regarding rent prices, restricting is not the solution, but rather building more houses and having social housing.",

Price controls create distortions on the markets and the same is true when it comes to housing.If real estate owners cannot charge the market rate for the rent of their properties and tenants are giving too much power over the real estate they are renting do you know what happens next? They simply stop offering their real estate for rent, this creates a shortage of housing for rent and now all of those people which cannot afford a house cannot find a place to rent at any price.Many scenarios could follow depending on what the governments do to face this problem, if they try to combat this by increasing the number of house owners then this leads to a credit bubble, if governments try to force real estate owners to rent their properties this leads to a crash on the real estate market, if they maintain their posture then a black market will be created in which tenants are wiling to pay more than what the law allows to the landlords in order to get a place to live, and finally they could always revoke those regulations and let the free market sort this out.",
