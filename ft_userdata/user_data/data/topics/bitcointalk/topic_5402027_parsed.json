Many people doesn't understand the reason of holding his Bitcoin until the market back to bullish season, if they're hold shitcoins... then it's make sense they need to sell it. Holding shitcoins will make you rekt since there's a high chance it will turned become dead coin.",

Nevertheless, there are still many who fail and reap losses in investing because market corrections occur almost every time. please respond from all friends..The problem with \"Phenomenon Buy at the lowest price Sell at the high price\" is that no one knows when the price will be low and when the price will be high. We can only talk about events after they happen, but we can never know future events.Unless, of course, you have something like this from the future.In my opinion, all these attempts to predict events in the crypto market using fundamental or technical analysis are doomed to failure due to the fact that it is impossible to evaluate and foresee all the influencing factors. Having missed the sight of at least 1 insignificant \"detail\", all forecasts will be erroneous, which means knowing when the price will be low and when it will not work high.",

There are times that market fails due to global economy just like now. Market is all down on all market and thats inevitable. So crypto does not exempted from it. We can assume that war in russia, covid pandemic, and even Us inflation affects this  blooded market right now.With comparison to technical analysis, some uses fundamental instead of this since they are investors style who are trading bulk to earn from a long term perspective. Which unlike on technical that plays on different time frame.",

      "body": "in theory, buy at the lowest price, sell at high price, in the world of trading is correct. call it trading in real estate, gold, or everyday necessities. but it will be a different story if it is applied in the crypto world. its volatile market makes crypto very difficult to predict and price movements are also uncertain and sometimes uncontrollable. for example, when bitcoin suddenly fell in 2018 from a position of USD 13,657 to a position of USD 3,742. After that, it took years for bitcoin prices to start high again as well as other cryptocurrencies. meaning, the fundamental analysis of the crypto market, the conclusion is that the crypto market is not an instant market that can get big profits in the near future. meaning, it takes longer time for long-term investment and also large capital, and even then there is no 100% guarantee that your assets will be safe.think carefully if you are a new person in crypto and want to enter the crypto world",

But it doesn't matter anymore, because the more important is they serve their purpose as a guide for those who want to apply the information and findings based on those analyses. Anyway, I believe the best way to learn more is through your own knowledge and judgment. after all those so-called analyses are still a theory, but Im not saying that those so-called analysis has no worth or use at all, Im only saying that it's better to rely on your own skills and judgment for the better. because market indicators do not really show all the necessary information because it's a complicated process and of course, it's not magic.",

The bearish market was only good for accumulation but they are thinking once the token gets a small pump and that will make them earn fast money. People never learned from their past experience and they are keep wasting their money to buy high and then sell low, mostly of these already done by newbies. Newbies didn't know how to play with the market. Thist ime people are being so scared to invest in the crypto.",

Many fail be they didn't learn something good for them to learn, if they just do some counter research when they are losing and take action towards bullish and bearish season most provably they can earn more from their trades.",

This is all for sure whether you know how to read both of these analyses if the market suddenly drops a lot, you have no way of stopping it to happen. But you can have ways of avoiding or minimizing your losses. What we must do is be always prepared to any outcome of the market whether it will surprise us with a sudden dump or pump, you know what you must do like buying when it's needed.",

      "body": "\"Buy low, sell high\" are words that are rather easy to say but really hard to predict. The peak and bottom of a season would always remain unknown to us until it passes by, and by then, the golden time for entering to invest is already gone. BUT we can presume the general sentiment and create a broad assumption from there, we don't necessarily need to specify an exact price for the peak and bottom. In addition to this is that if you were to buy say somewhere near the peak, there's no need to sell it at a loss if you have no need to and you're planning to invest in the long term. It's one of the biggest mistakes that new investors do and honestly, sell it or not, you'd already end up at a loss. Might as well take the risk and wait for it to go up to restore your losses and possibly profit more. Only do this on assets you trust to go up in the long term though.",

Most people have it the other way around, they buy when the market is rising and sell their portfolios for next to nothing on corrections.
