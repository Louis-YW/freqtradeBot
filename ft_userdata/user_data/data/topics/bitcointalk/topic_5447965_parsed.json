      "body": "Thanks for the heads up, @ajiz138. I just checked it out and I agree with you - the site looks almost identical to Sinbad mixer. Given that it is a clone site, it is highly likely that it is a scam. We should definitely avoid it.We have seen this happening many times before - scammers creating clone sites to trick people into giving them money. It is always important to be vigilant and to double-check the legitimacy of any site before entering any personal or financial information or depositing money. It is always better to be safe than sorry.",

Anyone who's going to use and deposit on them is likely to receive nothing and that deposit is gone forever. It can also happen into other mixers that these scammers will have their eyes on.",

They should buy all the domains related to their domain name. That wouldn't cost them a lot unless they would try for some popular domain extension.Quote from: ajiz138 on April 08, 2023, 05:07:45 PMI don't know whether this is really their competition or there are scammers who deliberately make it without involving the original, but what is clear is that every time there is a popular mixing site there will be an imitation site and including sinbad which is now known on forums as popular mixing.This won't even be far from the previous mixer scam, which has been cloned a lot, but will the official Sinbad take this action so that its name remains clean from clone sites?I guess no competition; rather it's the scammer we used to see targeting popular mixers all the time.
