  "content": "Hi everyone,I do have an FPGA F1 mini plus miner from HashAltCoin.Its NAND firmware was recovered by this file:https://file12.bitmain.com/shop-product-s3/firmware/4107882a-8be1-4484-940e-bd402d7c0bb0/2022/09/26/14/201904231534-L3%2B-SD-recover-NAND.zipNow, I can not flash the original HashAltCoin firmware for this miner which is available on the:https://firmware-1256910030.cos.ap-hongkong.myqcloud.com/firmware/20200621/upgrade_altcoin_F1-MINI%2B_rootfs.tar.gzBecause I got a signature error message when I want to flash it!Also, I can not connect to its SSH port via Putty because the TCP(22) port is not open on my miner!So, How can I flash my F1 mini plus miner with its original firmware?Thank you all.",

      "body": "That's a pretty bad habit why did you flash it with Bitmain firmware? If you don't experience any issues with your unit don't flash it or only flash it with stock firmware unless you are trying to use other firmware to mine BTC?Most of the Bitmain firmware is SSH and Signature locked you can't just flash it again with different firmware because it's locked there is no way to remove this but you can maybe have a chance if this F1 mini has some pinouts TX, RX, and GND then use supported tools to be able to flash it through these pinouts.You better check the board for the exact model and try to search it on Google to find the service manual and tools that support it.",

      "body": "I’m not sure if this will help, but I once was able to get around the signature lock issue on an antminer miniz by flashing to an older signed firmware, which didn’t require a signature verification, then it let me flash to the version I was trying to get to. The older firmware was on the bitmain firmware archives.  Yes, yes, I know, run on sentence, but I’m not going to fix that issue now… or the caps.",

      "body": "Thank you for your reply.Could you please link me to an old version of NAND recovery that did not verify the signature?Also, about someone who spoke about the bad habit, I should tell that the FPGA control board is from AntMiner company and its NAND model is the same as other AntMiner devices. Please see the AntMiner brand arm on the back of the control board: https://zeusbtc.com/articles/asic-miner-troubleshooting/1757-how-to-remove-viruses-from-the-antminer-l3-control-board",
