  "content": "Hello there. I once made the mistake asking for a loan here without collateral once. I don't likeÂ  to repeat mistakes. I did not like the reactions I had and I don't want to see this happening again.I am not looking for people who don't know me from anywhere. If you don't know who i am or what i'm talking about, just ignore this post and dont't send hatred reactions.In the other case...I can prove i am the account sverelst at blackjack.fun. I wagered more than 200 btc on that site, you can check on the sites homepage. I ask for a loan of 50 mBTC, but I would also welcome lower amounts.What would I give you in return? You can check I am leading a weekly giveaway where the winner gets 50 mBTC. If anyone would lend me 50 mBTC, I would not only pay it back, but i would also give all of what I win from the weekly giveaway to the donator.That means, if you lend me 50 mBTC, I will pay you back 50 mBTC next week for sure. All prize money I get, and that is public so you can track it, will come to you too. In best case this is a 100% win. I am already leading the classification...If you have some crypto to spare, please contact me.Thanks.Best regardsSiemen",

You may have a significant wagering amount on blackjack, and whatever you have there, it won't be considered as valid collateral by most of the popular lenders here, at least I will not consider it as valid. I don't see how a non collateral loan and this loan differ from one another. Both are same.",

And as I said, if you don't know the Bj.fun community, please just ignore this post. But if you do know the community, you will know I am a valued member of the community and I will keep my promise.

And here, you are a noob, a total stranger.So if you are someone in this community, go ask there for a loan. Here you won't get a single satoshi.",
