  "content": "Hello everyone.We started our very first Ripple Faucet in October 2017 and later on we moved on to more and more coins. Today we have 20 faucets in total.About us?First of all our main site Get-Paid.com has been live for over 10 years - you can also see:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1033612.0The reason we mention who we are is because it's important for us to establish trust. We love paying our members and that's what we've been doing for so long.Why BFG?Because it's a very interesting coin - look at this debate in this forum how big & interesting it is when discussing a gambling coin that you can stake:https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5406098.0How does it work?Simply roll the numbers. It's free. Collect BFG and withdraw it when you reach the minimum.If you want to get more value - the big promos are in our social media channels!The site makes money only from ads, we do not ask anyone to deposit money in the site and this is not possible neither.We are trying to maintain a balanced site without too many aggressive ads but on the same time ensure we have a few in order to cover the faucet costs.What's the minimum?100 BFG for withdrawal. It's very doable to reach it, especially if you use our social media promos.Follow us on Twitter:https://twitter.com/cryptosfaucetsFollow us on Telegram:https://t.me/freecryptosfaucetsFollow us on Youtube:https://www.youtube.com/@cryptosfaucetsFollow us on Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/freecryptosfaucets/",

      "body": "Good one bud, you guys are doing a good job to offer the community some ways to earn some free crypto, i could remember back in 2014/2015 when the market was still pretty young and bitcoin a bit cheaper, there were several faucets back then though some where scam, the ones that were genuine were still there and paid, I earned my first 0.01 btc back then through faucets.Unfortunately for fauceters, the rise in bitcoin and general acceptance of cryptocurrencies brought about the death of most of this faucet, only the very strong ones like freebitco are still standing today but the pay is as good as nothing.Like i said before, you guys are doing great offering the community a way to earn free crypto, and the latest listing of BFG token for the gambling community is a welcome development, at least for Betfury, its a free advertisement, I hope you look the way of Owl token soon as well, I think it is another great token belonging to the gambling casino Owl.games, one of my favorite casino.",

So hopefully this will be done in the next few days.",

Also, social media promos are good enough to attract new users. I will try your site and will share my feedback.",
