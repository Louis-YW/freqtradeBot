If you don't have much to invest but have some spare time you could try growing a brand or a company that can then convert its profits into crypto (or find companies that need things doing).Don't invest too much at first and expect the market to go down as well as up. Market price is based on demand, if it drops your bitcoin are still worth the same number of bitcoin.",

Do you have any advice?Cryptocurrency is broad os wide enough for you to get things complicated as a beginner, but it is wise if you choose to have a good ground with choosing bitcoin frombother cryptocurrencies for a start, this is because bitcoin is not just only the first digital currency but also the most reliable cryptocurrency so far with the high expected values and economic benefit that could place you decentralized and shield against other scan projects or coins, learn about bitcoin from the internet and often read the bitcoin discussion board of this forum, be active and always ask relevant questions that had not been discussed already, use the forum search engine and be committed, you will grow with time.",

I've been wanting to start investing in it for a while now, but I feel like I don't know enough about it to make good decisions. Do you have any advice?My advice is to learn as much as you can as fast as you can. And don't take rushed decisions.* Crypto and bitcoin investments are different, with different risk levels. You may want to ignore everything that's not bitcoin until you \"level up\".* Bitcoin price is very volatile. This means that if you don't know what you're doing and you're just rushing it, you can easily buy high and sell low. Now most tell that the price will soon start going up; there's no guarantee it will do so.** Learn the basics and see if you get to indeed trust that bitcoin price will go up** Make sure you invest only money you afford to lose or keep locked in bitcoin for long** Learn about DCA** Learn the difference between Bitcoin and \"whatever Bitcoin\" (various altcoins with Bitcoin in their name)** Learn how to keep your bitcoins safe (learn to use a wallet, transactions and transaction fees, may buy a hardware wallet)** Learn how to withdraw the coins to your custody (not your keys, not your coins)Then you can start enjoying the ride.You can skip or postpone steps, but it's your own decision to make: time (price) vs knowledge and risks to do things wrong. I don't know where the sweet spot is.",

Do you have any advice?all you really need is \"patience\" because your steps to start investing in cryptocurrency are correct, but from the history of the posts you made, I see that you have an interest in NFTs, I advise you to be careful with that, if indeed you are a novice investor who is just learning about cryptocurrencies, you should choose cryptocurrencies that already have a strong foundation like \"Bitcoin\".slowly you should try to explore this forum and read more because there is a lot of knowledge spread in this forum. I hope you can make money as soon as possible from cryptocurrency (but don't make \"money\" which is your main goal in cryptocurrency).",

Do you have any advice?You can bank on the knowledge and experience of a friend and take this opportunity now the price of bitcoin is low to invest, but you will also have to dedicate yourself to learning as much as you can as quickly as you can. I say you should invest and learn along the way because waiting to know enough first can make you miss the opportunity to invest now the prices are low. You can also lose interest if you are waiting to learn everything first, invest now, so you will be dedicated to learning more about where you have put your money.",

Do you have any advice?Now may be the best time to invest, so if you have spare money, start investing in bitcoin after you have learned the basics of using wallets, securing your money, trading, buying bitcoin, and storing seeds securely.Most cryptocurrencies are similar. After you learn about Bitcoin, you know 60% of cryptocurrencies. Wait and start with small amounts,  buy Ethereum. With experiments, you will learn how to benefit from price fluctuations and always withdrawal yuor profits in BTC.Always put an appropriate amount of cash, and plan if the price collapses at any moment so that the minimum price drop will be a gain for you.",

Only when you have good knowledge of the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large you can invest. There will always be an investment opportunity in the market",

It can be hard to keep up with all of the new developments. I've found that reading a variety of sources and comparing them helps me get a more complete picture of what's going on in the industry.For a beginner like OP, Bitcoin should be the start point. Reading varieties of sources will crowd the minds with too much information that might lead to confusion and complexity. A good investor start from simple and reliable investment like Bitcoin and grow from there. Investing in Bitcoin isn't 100% risk free but it has more advantage than other cryptocurrencies, for now the most reliable. Comparison is best done when there is a good  knowledge of one coin and a good start should be Bitcoin for the sake of limited risk. Reading variety of sources when no initial idea or experience is gathered will give the investor multiple choice to chose and most of the times the chance of going for shit coin is  higher.",

Make sure you really understand what cryptocurrency is before you invest, and be cautious.For me, the most important thing is to believe in cryptocurrency as a technology. I have looked into it, and it is pretty awesome, but from the perspective of someone who is not technically minded. It definitely has its unintuitive quirks but that is because it's new and does not fit the systems we have used so far. The best thing for me is that it is not created by any big company, although some have jumped on board! So, I think that blockchain and cryptocurrencies will play an increasing role in how we live in the coming years.",
