  "content": "I have invested $400 in Terra Luna Classic since its collapse in June.I cashed out $100 at $0.00052 when it pumped a few months ago meaning I have $300 left in it giving me 3 million at an average price of $0.0001. Seeing how it has struggled since the pump a few months ago I am left thinking I should have cashed out more at $0.00052 but I am still holding now waiting for another pump. The current price is $0.00029 and I am thinking of cashing in another $100 when the price gets back to $0.00035.I was never one thinking it would reach $1 again , I am happy if it reaches $0.005 but even that is starting to look like a struggle as we have had lots of 'good news' lately and the price is going down not up. I know there are a lot of people against Luna now but for those who are invested and holding , what is your plan?",

Luna used to be a fantastic coin and had even giving people huge profits before that unimaginable fall. Many investors thought this fall was just another opportunity to invest more and the price would go up and they would make more profits, but as we saw it this didn't happen. Then you came in after all that and then got something out of it. With the uncertainty already exhibited by Luna I won't give them my full confidence.",

I invested a day before the crash when the price was around $4 per token.I wonder how long will it take me to get my invested money back if I follow this method of yours ''taking profits when the price increases a little''. To me, Luna is a dead-and-gone coin, removing my mind from it was the best decision I have ever taken. Not regretting it a bit",

      "body": "As far as I've been following the news lately, first: Lunc is run by a spontaneous team from Terra's old team, which means it's no longer related to Dokwon. Second, with the recent news of binance claiming to support the burning of Lunc with the proceeds of Lunc's transaction fees, it shows that they are trying to help Lunc. Personally I believe in binance so what they are doing will benefit Lunc in the short term, so my advice is you can hold Lunc short term and wait for the bigger news, I believe it will pump again.",

You're lucky that you've done good investing in Luna, my investment in Luna is forgettable I lose 90% of my investment here and I don't think I can recover my losses the way it performs in the market I should have sold it earlier, the risk in investing in Luna is very high, a lot of bad things are attached to this coin, there's not even guaranty that there will be another pump, but since you did good in the past and if you're comfortable on whatever losses you may incur then it's up to you to decide if you still want to have it in your portfolio",

If you are truly traders and you do know that if lunc burn will not give any impact until next decade. The daily trade volume was also affecting the result from burn. It's very small right now. You shall become a smart trader, take profit and then try to buy at the dip. This is the best thing that you can do with your money.",

Have only been in crypto 6 months and this is the first time I have had any profit above 3x so wasn't sure what was best to do to be honest. I see it has done well today with a 12% pump but not enough for me to cash out any more of my investment just yet. I will hold for now and hopefully we will have another pump soon, it is just taking a while seems to be steady around $0.00029 mark.",

It will totally affect your self-decision skills. Since you already did some actions, I know you can make up your own strategy on what things are appropriate to do.Remember that those who invested in Terra Luna Classic are expecting a moon price therefore expect the majority of hodlers will only look at the positive side and will ignore any negative hopes on that token. I'm sure that the most common response you will encounter from those believers is to \"just hodl\".",

I invested in Terra when it was around $2 then DCA as it crash, sadly I didn't buy when it bottom since I was sleeping at that time.  When I read the news about the fork.  That was the time I decided to sell my holdings. I somehow recover my investment thanks to cost averaging.  I don't think Luna has a bright future.  There are lots of controversies surrounding the project and the fact that its original developer is wanted by the South Korean authority, I believe Terra Classic is already doomed.I hope the price somehow pumps so you can cash out with a bit of profit or regain your investment at least.  There is no reason to hold Terra Luna Classic, I think it is naive to think that this token will recover.",

I think even though binance supports burning from every piece of trading activity but the increase in Lunc is only used for investment recovery from previous losses so any increase will be easy to dump after the whales take profit and they will buy it again at the lowest price, so you are right that the whales are winners of the manipulation price.",

I was hopeless right after the issue come out and I see many investors/holders selling then which make its price dump more. If you are still holding them, better to make the decision to sell and use that money to buy Bitcoin before this project dies. I'd never see it as ideal to still hold Luna, though we can see a pump happening in the past days something questionable about who does it as it was certainly a sort of manipulation as this will never stay long, and drop back to the bottom.",
