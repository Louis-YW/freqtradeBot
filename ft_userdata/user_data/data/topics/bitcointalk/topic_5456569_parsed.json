  "content": "I met a young and beautiful Asian woman on a dating site. She is 27 years younger than me.She belongs to a professional cryptocurrency organization that provides multi-millionaires with when and what coin to trade. About 3 - 4 trades a week.The reason she belongs to the group is because her Uncle runs it.She said she will give me the trades for free.We have done several video chats so she is real.I used to trade FOREX heavily so I thought Cryptocurrency would be similar.I open a Coinbase account.She tells me to Buy Bitcoin and keep it for 60 seconds and then sell it.I don't know how to work Coinbase but I do see Bitcoin go up and up.So now I'm trying to learn how to trade on Coinbase.She gives me another trade, with the same instructions, Buy and hold on for 60 seconds and then sell. But I don't know how to do that. Bitcoin goes up and up.I'm amazed at how this professional group is able to do this. She said that I can't trade on Coinbase because it doesn't offer the features that her platform does. On her platform, she can Buy and hold on to it and Sell it in 60 seconds. You can't do that with Coinbase.So she wants me to transfer all of my Coinbase money into the platform she uses, which is:BitContractProShe has $100,000 in her account. She averages $10,000 a month.She will teach me how to trade on that platform.",

While reading your story, I've already knew it that it's a scam attempt to you. Didn't you know that even you had someone a video call/chat, there are software that can easily fool you out like split cam and AI voices, etc. These software can make you feel that you're really talking to a woman that's a lot of years younger than you. It's obvious that they want you to trade on that platform that they've made and once you've deposited there, that's the time for you to say goodbye to the money that you've deposited. I don't also understand why that strategy has been told to you to sell at exact 60 seconds after your purchase because it doesn't make sense.",

They want me to create an account on an exchange that I don't know or is not a popular exchange and let them manage your account which if you think it's obviously a scam attempt. There are too many of them not only on the dating site platform, but they are also everywhere on every social media platform like Facebook and Telegram which they're very rampant on this fraudulent activity.

Like someone advised, you should think with your head and not the other way around. I want to believe she must have weighed you properly and concluded that you're naive and wants to capitalize on that to scam you. She's tricking you to transfer your Bitcoin to the site she provided and the moment you do that, your bitcoin will be gone to the great beyond and never to be seen again.
