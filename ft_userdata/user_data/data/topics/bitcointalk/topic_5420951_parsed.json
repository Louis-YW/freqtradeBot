  "content": "First and foremost, let us all know that the idea for this topic emanated from users comments on my previous topic which is related to this subject, that previous topic can be found HERE.Now, would you like a feature that will officially allow you to copy bets from other bettors?, by \"officially\", i mean that it is an official feature opened/implemented by the casino for users who would really like to bet on sports, but their daily jobs and activities would not allow them the time to follow sports and its related news , or even do any kind of research to increase their chance of winning before placing the bet.Think of this as a feature similar to copy trading in forex, where traders who don't know how to trade, or don't have the time to follow the market news or do any research, simply copy trades from other professional traders, and at the close of the trade, the broker takes a certain percentage from the profit made to pay the trader whose trade was copied, as a commission.Now, if this feature will be implemented in betting, then the casino will have to monitor and keep accurate betting stats of the bettor, make their profiles public, and also make public their win and loss ratios/stats in corresponding percentages, and maybe allow bet copiers to rate from 1 to 5( in star) the bettors they copied bets from, this rating should be purely based on the bet copiers experience, did he win the bet he copied?, did he loose the bet?, this will determine the level of rating he will give to the bettor he copied bet from.And this rating, put together with the casino's win and loss stats on every bettors profile will help other bettors who want to copy bets, know who to copy bets from and who not to copy from.And this will also encourage bettors who want their bets copied to work really hard to have a good win rate, so as to have more copiers who will in turn pay commission to him each time they win.And what if I don't want my bets copied?   That's simple, put your profile in private, and the casino should build this feature in a way that if a bettors profile is in private mode, his or her betting stats/log/slip should not appear in the casino's general betting logs/slips/events so other bettors cant copy bets from that bettors that are in private.What is in this for me if i allow my bets to copied, and most of my bets wins because i work hard?More money in your pocket..- in the form of commission.The casino can act as the middle man here, lets say bettor A copies bettor B's bet, and the bet wins, bettor B who is the original owner of the bet gets to keep all his winnings, and the casino will in turn deduct a certain percentage from bettor A's winning/profit and pay it to bettor B as a commission for allowing his bet(s) to be copied.What is in for the casino?This is another way for the casinos to gain more customers and as well make more money, they gain more customers as a lot of people who know nothing about sports or what to bet on will now have a chance at placing some bets and possibly winning some cash, in the other way around, they are definitely not going to win every bet, and in this case, their loss is profit to the casino.If its really necessary, then the casino can decide to take a very small percent from the commissions payed to bettors by their bet copiers, though I personally do not think this is necessary except if the casino is still a very small casino scraping for more money by all means, which I will personally also advice bet copiers to avoid such casinos, i would also advice such casinos not to implement the bet coping feature until they are big enough.So guys, what do you think about a feature like this? I personally think its cool as f**k, take me for an example, I am somebody who really love to bet on sports but my daily job does not give me any atom of chance to follow sports, so as to have ideas on which game or what sports to bet on, and I believe there are thousands, if not millions of my kind out there , a feature like this would be really helpful.Lets discuss.",

As I can be a lead trader, I can never copy someone's trader, I can never be a copy trader. One of my friends and I, last month he told me about his experience, but not in crypto but Forex, as he copied someone on a Forex trading platform and how he first made money but followed by losses. If you do not know how to do something, then do not do it.If I have to tell you the truth, copy trading is even far better than copying bets, but both should be discouraged. Learn how to do it and do it yourself.",

Lolz, let's face reality man, betting/gambling can all be for fun for you, but I tell you the simple truth, the vast majority in it are all doing it for profit, though most times, we try to lie to ourselves that we are just doing it for fun, this is just to make oneself feel alright, and not to regret the lose too much, nobody any where enjoys loosing money, every body needs money and more money...One question I will leave you with, to think about is, if the casinos are in this game for profit, why should the gambler/bettor be in the same game for fun?",

Punters should know that the gambling site will always make money, they provide the services to make more money and the more someone is gambling, the likely and higher the losses can be. But being with friends, having nothing to do, you can just play with it for that period, or do other things like playing video games. But some people just like the fun it brings to gamble with low amount of money.I do not usually have time, I do not bet often, but if I want to bet, I do my analyses appropriately which will take some of my idle time busy for me and also doing that with friends gives me joy. You are not wrong though, one of my friends last week, it has been long we saw each other, he told me about gambling and how he is not making anything from it, the way he talked, he is gambling to make high amount of money, but losing. Although he got the fun that he went to a betting agent, saw some friends, but losing because he is chasing how to make money from. It, but losing. That is why it is important for us to continuing reiterating this, that people should not go for profit because only leading to addiction for like 20%  to 30% of people and loss of money for the remaining people that gamble often because they make it a job which supposed not to be.If you are too busy, you can use prediction sites like https://www.newsoccervista.com to aid your analyses.",

Only this would require some sort of proposal to the casino to implement such a feature. As far as I know, if a user earns a commission, does that mean the casino needs to allocate that commission or is it a percentage result of the users who copy it? For example, I copy your bet and get about 50% of the total bet, so do you get a commission from me or the casino?",

Just like in the previous post that you have. This could be an excellent opportunity for a bot copier or something related to that that would make it easier to get into copy betting.It's hard to do this every time, putting in bets to someone you don't know, but it's best to do it manually.

Rather than directly copying a bet because someone have put a huge amount at stake in that specific bet,I will first control it and see if it fits to what I already predict for that bet,only if it fits with what I think about that specific game only then I am going to copy.I don't want to brag or something as I rarely play sport betting but yesterday I won Heerenven,Lille and Frankfurt draw no bet and I felt like I was the smartest person in the world.I like this option to offer commissions to other people who create these winning bets,sure it will motivate much more person to create at least a couple of bets every weekend as a minimum even those who don't like sport betting that much.",

Copiers may tend to rely much on the bettors knowledge mainly because of their great stats however what if the bettor decided to just YOLO or bet based on he idolised. With these kind of implementation, we may be able to see more gamblers who will be dependent on high rollers with good stats. It's a great feature but I suggest that it'll has some limits.",

Whether you are a copier or the one being copied, there should be an incentive for those that are being copied with their winning bets.Actually, copying bets from other bettors is good, especially if other bettors have had a good journey in placing bets. The more often bettors win, of course, they have a good betting record. This, of course, will attract people to follow the bettor and take part in placing the same bet because they want to get a win too. Those bettors can also get an incentive because they can spread the affiliate thread to people who wish to copy the bettor's bets. This means bettors can also get additional income from the people joining them. Apart from that, that bettor can also get a good reputation among other bettors.If you think about it there are pros and cons on both the bettors and copiers. Copiers may tend to rely much on the bettors knowledge mainly because of their great stats however what if the bettor decided to just YOLO or bet based on he idolised. With these kind of implementation, we may be able to see more gamblers who will be dependent on high rollers with good stats. It's a great feature but I suggest that it'll has some limits.but for the copiers, they should not expect that they will always come out positive from those bets. these bettors are also humans and they are also prone to mistakes or flaws on their bets. they may have good record, but it doesn't mean they will always be on target. just prepare on the possible scenario here. so don't bet big if you can't afford. even if you're seeing that that the bettor you're following is already in the million-dollar bet. just like drake, loss is inevitable. and that was showed from his recent UFC bet.",
