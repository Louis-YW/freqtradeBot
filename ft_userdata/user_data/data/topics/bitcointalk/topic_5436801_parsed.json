  "content": "Facebook and Instagram have restored the accounts of former president Donald Trump.After two years of suspending the social media accounts of the former president of the United States of America Donald trump, today his accounts has been reinstated.In January 2021, he was permanently banned from both sites as a result of his post regarding the disturbances at the US Capitol, he called the thundreds of his supporters that invaded the US capitol complex \"patriot \". That didn't resonate well with a lot of American's, because that invasion lead to the death of about four civilians and a police man. So far that, his social media accounts where all suspended, but today what we are seeing in the news is that, his both account for Instagram and Facebook has been reinstated but for his Twitter account, there hasn't been any news on that yet. Though Some people believes his reinstatement is connected to next year's elections, because fingers are already pointed at him to be a strong contestant, so reinstating his accounts will help him spread his campaign tentacles.  So guys what do you think, is his reinstatement connected to the forth coming elections or not?https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-25/trump-reinstated-to-facebook-instagram-after-two-year-ban",

In terms of his reelection campaign, some of his Truth social posts has been dabbling in the Q-anon stuff. It's in his best interest to stay off social media. MSM doesn't cover his Truth social posts as closely as they did everything else and I'd argue his unhinged Truth posts do nothing beneficial for him even if his staunch supporters like it.",

This information is the most important I have ever posted on my blog and on this website, because it's the very first time I have been able to present the fully assembled puzzle of fraud and deception that has been used for hundreds of years to rob and plunder America under the color of law by the cabal to finance their evil in the world. Anna von Reitz has a unique perspective by her vocation of legal advisor to the \"Popes\" and her access to much information to which most people in the world just don't have access. As a cradle Catholic, I know she is right on the money when it comes to the temporal power she is talking about. I believe she is also right about the solutions, which are spelled out in her articles. Read them in the order presented to get the whole truth and the big picture. There are no other solutions short of all out civil war on American soil, and I am sure you want to avoid that as much as I do, if at all possible. If you want to read my blog, where there are over 2100 articles on these and other subjects, the address is www.montanablog.us or www.paulstramer.net. That blog is also connected to all my business websites as well, where we sell radio communications gear, silver bullion, PRI fuel preservative, portable solar power products, stun guns, and much more.

In the case of war? Biden and Congress are feeding Ukraine. That's a case of war, right? So, what about the war between Biden and Trump campaigning for the presidency? Why is it that Trump got kicked off, and the far more criminally active Biden didn't?",

I have got the impression that Mr. Trump still has a strong grudge against social media, the same that led him to start his own, Truth social. The only way he goes back to mainstream social media is whether he needs the boost of attention next year, to engage more of his base.",

Zuckerberg must be trying to play it safe by unlocking the account before the time of the election, with the fear that when he eventually wins the seat, he will come back for both social media, which he believes have stepped on his right to freedom of speech. I don't see Trump as someone who will even want to make use of those accounts, for whatever reasons. Unless it will be his campaign managers who will want to use his page to promote him on those social media sites. But for Zuckerberg to unlock both his Instagram and Facebook accounts does not guarantee his social platforms' safety. Let's just watch and see what will happen, before or after the election, about whether he will make use of those accounts or not.",

It was a close election by the way and with the current state of their country after Biden was elected, they consider to give him back a chance again.",

The reason we open social media accounts is to express ourselves, so if I can't express myself with a particular social media account then what is the use of that account. If it was me I will never use those account again. So I think Trump don't need those account again.
