  "content": "Now, that the mixers are banned from this forum, I wonder, why do we even need BTC mixers.A non-KYC exchange solves the mixer problem where Bitcoin and Monero are available too.1. If you have bitcoin which is connected to you and you want an untraceable one, you should:i) Go to an (even KYC) exchange, where you change your BTC to XMR.ii) Send the XMR to 'monero_address_1'.iii) Send the XMR from 'monero_address_1' to 'monero_address_2' outside of the exchange.iiii) Send XMR from 'monero_address_2' to a non/KYC exchange and change your XMR to BTC.2. If you have 'dirty' bitcoin and you want a clear one, you should:i) Go to a non-KYC exchange, where you change your BTC to XMR.ii) Send the XMR to 'monero_address_1'.iii) Send the XMR from 'monero_address_1' to 'monero_address_2' outside of the exchange.iiii) Send XMR from 'monero_address_2'q to an (even KYC) exchange and change it to BTC.As I see it, there are non-KYC services where you can change BTC to XMR or XMR to BTC.According to my research, e.g. changenow.io seems a KYC exchange, but they don't ask your documents, only in case of suspicious transactions. Or do you know surely non-KYC echanges with BTC <-> XMR change possibility?What do i miss?",

      "body": "Good thread supporterofpeaceSimple answer: No we don't need mixers. - And what's the problem? people can still use them, but they cant earn money from them on a signature campaign, many users focus on totally wrong thing.No we don't need bitcoin mixers, actually it's very few things we need in life, but we get addicted of stuff because we are humans and that's in our nature and we got that stuck in our brain.So change the question to \"Is mixers a good service?\" \"Should mixers not have been banned from the forum?\" This is a hard question since many users is sad/angry because they lost an income because of the banning, so they will reply with emotions and feelings and that's only make everything wrong but I understand them. But it's better things to earn money from in life then posting posts on a forum but also they can still use mixers if they really need it. So I don't see the problem? And this nonsense that this forum is a decentralized place and everything should be illegal is just stupid, this forum is not a decentralized place since we got moderators that are in charge. A lot of things is about money and greed and every human stand themself closest that's the hard reality and it's nothing wrong with that I just pointing it out, we are humans and our subconscious control what we do to 90%-95% so we need to train to put good things in our subconscious and remove the negativity, and yes I know what I am speaking about and this is hard and take years of practice but it's possible trust me.And if you ask me I hope mixers get banned and shut down from the internet totally because they cause much more bad then good, how many actually using mixers here and for what reason, come on.. you know I know. Â I have no proof or statistic so I only man guessing, but try to see it this way how many using mixers for illegal purposes way and in how many in a legal way? Since all this \"Expert hackers\" using them when they empty innocent's people wallet for millions of millions even billions total worth of dollars using them we at least got some proof that a very high traffic is for illegal activities. So that's why I hope they get shut down completely, it will only make it harder for the scammers to get away with their shit, and yes probably they would find some other way yes, but we should always do what we can do to stop scamming and scammers instead of argue about things we cant affect at all we should focus on things we can affect and build up the crypto community even higher and increase the crypto reputation so more and more want to join it! If more people get into crypto then we all will be winners.And we all here may not like each other or share opinions but we share one thing the love of crypto and decentralized places.. Focus on that instead and make that better instead of focus on things we can affect.But in my opinion mixers don't serve a good purpose. And of course honest and good people using mixers to and I feel sorry for them yes, but sometime you need to give up something for a bigger purposeAnd we humans are smart and always come up with new things and ideas. This will be good at the end! Trust me. Â  So for now, let the negativity out and let's get together as a group and let's start build up the crypto community.Now the reply got quite long, sorry for that. Anyway have a great week everyone! New week and New possibilities.Best regards./ BabyB.",

KYC is not a big problem for me.I get your point, but do we NEED them? or does them make things easier? And it's a very solid point. But I think we need to think bigger. For example: if 95% of the people using mixers doing it because illegal stuff and 5% doing it for legal stuff mixers should get banned from existing. As many other mention here it's many ways around it and if mixers shutdown I assure you it will be hell harder for the scammers to steal millions/billions from innocent people. But as I said I get your point and I agree, but sometimes we need to give up om something good for a bigger purpose, and don't forget humans is smart and creative I am positive something new can come up that can offer some kind of same service but be able to cut off the fucking scammers that stealing huge amounts from innocent people.*But also, people can still use mixers, but they cant earn money from them on this forum so I don't see the problem and this \"decentralized blabla stuff\" is just nonsense IMO. Because this place is not decentralized. We got a moderator that are in charge, tho this is a close as decentralized you can get I think. But people should stop focus on that mixers got banned and focus on find a job or something. Â QuoteIf I am a person who does not care about privacy, mixing services are not in my thinking. KYC is not a big problem for me.Here I am exactly the same. Â QuoteIf I am a person who does not care about privacy, mixing services are not in my thinking. KYC is not a big problem for me.And what is exactly is the problem here? Mixers is still up and active on the internet and everyone can use them!? The difference is that users her on bitcointalk cant make money out of them from a sign campaign. So all this does not make sense at all. Money is something you should earn from work and not from posting on a forum.I think we should pause this discussion for 1-2 months and come back when everyone have lay their feelings behind them.

If you have bitcoin which is connected to you and you want an untraceable one, you should:i) Go to an (even KYC) exchange, where you change your BTC to XMR.If you have forgotten, more KYC exchanges have started to delist privacy coins[1] [2], and I believe that by the end of next year there will be no KYC exchanges that accept these privacy coins, and the government will try to track down the DEXs and may be able to force them not to list any privacy coins.The only service available is P2P DEXs. Here, the government may create hundreds of honeypot accounts, and then, once you deposit, your coins will be blocked.Therefore, we need a decentralized Bitcoin mixer, to which users contribute and whose goal is to enhance customer privacy.Proposed solutions:Â - Enhancing privacy through side networks.Â - Confidential transactions (CT)[3]Â - Find a decentralized way to mix the private key, something like a chipmixer but decentralized.[1] https://www.okx.com/help/okx-to-delist-several-spot-trading-pairs-12-29 [2] Binance to Delist Monero, Zcash, and Other Privacy Coins As Regulatory Pressure Intensifies in Eu[3] https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Confidential_transactions",

I don't think it's right to consider all Monero transactions as suspicious and I think that it would be infeasible to flag them all as suspicious, it would also be difficult track Monero > Other cryptocurrency transactions where a non-kyc service is being used.

If you have bitcoin which is connected to you and you want an untraceable one, you should:i) Go to an (even KYC) exchange, where you change your BTC to XMR.ii) Send the XMR to 'monero_address_1'.iii) Send the XMR from 'monero_address_1' to 'monero_address_2' outside of the exchange.iiii) Send XMR from 'monero_address_2' to a non/KYC exchange and change your XMR to BTC.2. If you have 'dirty' bitcoin and you want a clear one, you should:i) Go to a non-KYC exchange, where you change your BTC to XMR.ii) Send the XMR to 'monero_address_1'.iii) Send the XMR from 'monero_address_1' to 'monero_address_2' outside of the exchange.iiii) Send XMR from 'monero_address_2'q to an (even KYC) exchange and change it to BTC.As I see it, there are non-KYC services where you can change BTC to XMR or XMR to BTC.According to my research, e.g. changenow.io seems a KYC exchange, but they don't ask your documents, only in case of suspicious transactions. Or do you know surely non-KYC echanges with BTC <-> XMR change possibility?What do i miss?I like the number one plan, it is a good approach for those who want their Bitcoin private for security and personal reasons with no strings attached. But what you are missing according to your question is encouraging \"dirty Bitcoin.\" Should I say I detest this? Your insensitivity is what is missing and you should have just limited it to the first suggestion.Bitcoin is a very good project, a near-perfect one for that matter if bad users could be kicked out. And no wonder Monero is a subject of controversy now and some exchanges are beginning to flag it for further studies before they act upon it.",

But I believe if you or anyone owns a lot of bitcoins or huge amount of assets, you will definitely need mixing tools or any tools to enhance your privacy. The majority of investors in the market only focus on making profits rather than focusing on protecting their privacy. So it's not too surprising that mixer services are still not widely used or used much.",
