  "content": "Hello,In the context of presence of biased nonces, I've read in several places that if one doesn't have enough signatures to build a lattice of the required dimension, valid ECDSA signatures should be generated for this purpose.However, I don't understand how this can help as one will generate \"i=1..n\" signatures with \"Ki=ai+ bi*prvkey\" using random (ai, bi) that doesn't provide any informaion about Ki. Are there any hints for properly choosing (ai, bi) ?The most obvious one is to have the same bias of Ki (difficult to achieve) but this is not enough, right ?",
