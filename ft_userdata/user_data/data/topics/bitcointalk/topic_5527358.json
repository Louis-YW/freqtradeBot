After like 4 withdraw, you can move the money back to exchange and withdraw it to a noncustodial wallet. If you withdraw to a noncustodial withdraw like every week, be ready to consolidate your inputs when the transaction fee is low.",

That's his own words. 1 or 6 years? That makes no difference. Nobody counts that. Many people mistake DCA for a method where you send some money to an exchange every week or every month and buy a fraction of bitcoin, but you can always send more money up front and then log in and buy some bitcoin, spending maybe 10% of that money. Whatever platform you choose, going cheap is not a good idea. DCA doesn't mean spending $1 a day on bitcoin. This will never make a difference in your life. On the other hand, if you're planning to buy at least $100 worth of bitcoin every month, you can always save up on fees and withdraw once you get to a larger sum like $500+",

However, if your strategy is for a year from now, you may incur losses.I remember you from when I was active here! Well, CEXes charge around 0.1%-0.2% as taker fees, and transferring accumulated BTC costs about $9-$10 on major platforms. I’ll definitely be DCAing for over a year, which is why I’ve been looking for reliable options. While CEXes seem like a favorable choice, the issue is that I can’t withdraw small accumulations to a hardware wallet as I will end up with non-spendable UTXOs. The main reason for starting this thread was to gather insights from fellow Bitcoiners and explore dependable alternatives.Quote from: moneystery on January 23, 2025, 07:46:23 AMQuote from: xmrhopium on January 22, 2025, 05:30:50 PMQuote from: Tushar Ramani on January 22, 2025, 05:21:35 PMHello, fellow Bitcoiners,Encouraged by some friends, I’ve been thinking about starting a DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) strategy into Bitcoin, but I haven’t been able to get started yet.

Business is good, but it keeps me completely tied up, leaving little time for forums and social media. Yup, consistency is key, and I’m committed to sticking with it. As long as security is concerned, I’ve been using Ledger since 2017, and it remains my go-to choice for storing accumulated sats. Let’s see how far this journey takes me.",
