Alongside this Bitcoin ETF approval, ETH ETF was also approved by the Hong Kong regulators.Quote from: https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/Hong-Kong-approves-first-bitcoin-ethereum-spot-ETFsSHANGHAI (Reuters) -- Hong Kong's securities regulator approved the first spot bitcoin and ethereum exchange traded funds (ETFs) on Monday, a milestone on the way to becoming Asia's first city to accept the popular cryptocurrencies as a mainstream investment tool.In separate statements, the Hong Kong unit of Bosera Asset Management and China Asset Management said they had received regulatory approval from the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) to launch the ETFs.[..]PS: I'm not sure if this is the right place for this thread so since it includes ETH, mods kindly move where it's appropriate. Thanks!",

We probably will hear more of the same news for this bull run.Quote from: Odusko on April 15, 2024, 10:17:38 AMThis is one of those news that could increase the motivations of most bitcoin holders, most especially those that have witnessed the last weekend market bloodbath, I believe this news will trigger a more positive market outlooks and increase investors appetite to keep the price up before the bitcoin halving event which is around the corner, Hong Kong ETF approval is one big News for the market following the first January ETF approval that triggered the recent multiple all-time highs.We've seen the reaction of the market and that's quick. So, with more news that are like this then we're likely to see a continuous price increase but it won't be as easy as how I describe it. But I am moving forward to the halving effect instead of these bitcoin etf news.Quote from: Taskford on April 15, 2024, 10:30:28 AMNot only on bitcoin but also they approve ETH ETF https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/hong-kong-approves-first-bitcoin-ether-spot-etfs which is really good to introduce bitcoin and ethereum as an asset that good to trade.Yes and I've included that into the OP.Quote from: Taskford on April 15, 2024, 10:30:28 AMMaybe this could not give much effect since the hype of ETF is I think done already with its last approval and it didn't give much effect but rather the market collapsed at that time which nobody expect to happen. But let see if there's some changes with this good news happened since we need hype to boost up the effect of halving so we could provably see more better figures for this year.It had an impact and from the weekend, the lowest was $62k. After having this news, it had increased to $66k so there's the impact but compared to the past approved ones, it's not that a lot.",

The Chinese government has repeatedly expressed that it does not want to be friendly to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, but we cannot deny that the cryptocurrency market in China is very large and strong. I think they will not want to become outdated and slow compared to the US, so it is understandable that they return to bitcoin and crypto.",

In most of China, the country's keeping its citizens on a short leash, with a lot of restrictions and surveillance. That, I agree, is incompatible with Bitcoin. But Hong Kong is a different story altogether, a region that has historically been separate and enjoyed a lot more freedom even while being a part of China.

My assumption is based on the fact that China has a lot of control over Hong Kong and allowing them to approve ETF might be an indication that they might change their unfriendly stance in the future. China might be using Hong Kong as a testing ground for Bitcoin adoption.",

I think asking that bitcoin be made a legal tender in different countries is overly big to be requested. I don't think it's what the community wants. Just allow bitcoin be and also fiat be. Then this ETF approval and other related approvals are much good to globalize the adoption. I don't think that bitcoin wearing the legal tender status will perform better.

The approval indicates Bitcoin and Ethereum are trustable digital assets. However, it doesn't mean to have lower risks, they are still high risk assets. So, everyone never forgets that Bitcoin and Ethereum still have the same nature. Whether they are good or not for us, it depends on the way to invest or trade them.Quote from: Taskford on April 15, 2024, 10:30:28 AMMaybe this could not give much effect since the hype of ETF is I think done already with its last approval and it didn't give much effect but rather the market collapsed at that time which nobody expect to happen.

Although it won't suddenly push the prices of Bitcoin and altcoins rising high, but it should bring positive impacts in the market sooner or later. The hype of ETH will never end, it is not like the hype on meme coins. ETF is about the future of crypto coins, it is not for a temporary matter.",

That's good news, it will bring more investors and more funds into the BTC M.cap directly or indirectly. Now I am waiting for China to do something about it, as the USA is imposing tax, and the IMF asked our country to impose tax as well, so I assume China will also make some positive move now if they really make some positive move, then we are seeing BTC crossing $150k easily. Besides I don't think this news it the main reason behind BTC recovery, as this news has been out since afternoon (on my side) as I saw the news when it was out like within minutes, and the market had already recovered from the dip (ATL) so I assume this is not the main reason but it would have helped BTC to recover more than expected. But still I am expecting a correction to $64k But let's hope for good. Which it already did.",
