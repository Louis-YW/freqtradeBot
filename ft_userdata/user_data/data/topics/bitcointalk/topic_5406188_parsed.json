I seriously doubt their mechanisms for determining this risk score will be public so that people can check some type of list and determine for themselves if the coins they have are considered tainted and dirty by ZKSnacks.I wonder how they would rate bitcoin that comes from ChipMixer or our signature payments for that matter?",

Allegedly, their previous jurisdiction (Gibraltar) sent them a notice that they must comply with local regulations and that they must prevent any attempts of money laundering via their default coordinator. In case they can't or aren't willing to introduce AML mechanisms into their protocol, they must leave the jurisdiction and move somewhere else. It is said that they moved to another country of residence with less strict rules regarding money laundering, namely Seychelles, and that allows them to postpone blacklisting. I tried to find them here https://www.registry.gov.sc/BizRegistration/WebSearchBusiness.aspx but to no avail.You can find more information here:https://twitter.com/TheVladCostea/status/1548795330820538370",

Because postponing achieves nothing. I don't care if they are going to censor me next week or next year - I'm never using any wallet or service which thinks that doing so is an acceptable price to pay.Their legal documents from 2020 do indeed state Gibraltar: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi/Legal/Assets/LegalDocumentsWw1.txtWhile the same document updated for 2022 says Seychelles: https://github.com/zkSNACKs/WalletWasabi/blob/master/WalletWasabi/Legal/Assets/LegalDocumentsWw2.txtSo it does seem they have moved jurisdiction already. So if that's the case, why haven't they come out and said they are not going to censor their users? And why even announce the censorship in the first place, given that it is yet to be implemented? They could just have moved jurisdictions without saying anything.I don't believe they have any intentions on reversing their pro-censorship stance, but if they do then I must say they have the stupidest PR department in the world for letting this much fall out go on for so long over something they always planned not to do.",

They could just have moved jurisdictions without saying anything. Maybe the original decision was to start censoring certain transactions for reasons unknown to us. And as things were progressing, someone suggested why don't we move our business to a jurisdiction where this nonsense doesn't have to be implemented at all? Even though they are claiming that no one was forcing them to implement the censorship, I am pretty sure something was going on or they were warned that it would happen in the future. How else can you explain the sudden jurisdiction change around the same time when the taint nonsense began?",

But I don't see what they have to lose from coming out now and saying \"zkSNACKs is moving jurisdiction and will not be implementing blacklisting once the move is complete\". If that is indeed their intention, then they will be announcing that eventually, so why not now? Gibraltar will somehow prevent them from leaving?And even if for some reason they can't be that specific, then why not say \"It is under review/consideration\" or \"We are exploring other options\" rather than doubling down on it and trying to defend censorship as if it's a good thing, and calling the community a bunch of \"whiners\" for being outraged about it? As I said above, if this was their plan all along then they've gone about it in the stupidest way possible.But this is now getting off topic here, so I'll end it there.",

Is it official that they don't make CoinJoins with less than 50 inputs and 58 outputs?The link to this filter was posted by zkSNACKs CEO Max Hillebrand here: https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1541501257386442753 He states that this is a \"roughly accurate\" filter for both 1.0 and 2.0 CoinJoins. I think that \"roughly accurate\" means that false positives or false negatives are possible. I haven't checked the source code of Wasabi Wallet 2.0 yet and don't know what the minimum input count is but from their Twitter you can find that they lowered this number from initial 150 to 100: https://twitter.com/wasabiwallet/status/1537695385925431296 or even less: https://twitter.com/HillebrandMax/status/1538025729786466305Quote from: o_e_l_e_o on July 24, 2022, 03:15:38 PMPostpone, or abandon? Abandon is a too strong word which implies responsibility for what is said or promised. Also, I don't think they will give up on their plans to flirt with regulatory bodies to maximize desirable profit.Quote from: https://stephanlivera.com/episode/364Stephan Livera:Is this a regulatory capture play? So, as we see with the likes of the chain surveillance firms, they are trying to go out there, market themselves to governments and market themselves to exchange compliance teams saying, You need us to help—because they’ll market it like, Look, see, we’re keeping the crypto streets clean. When I think people who know better understand that a lot of the heuristics and this kind of tainting idea is oversold, as we’ve agreed. So is there an angle there that ZKSnacks is almost trying to get into the regulatory capture game to say, Look, see, we’re a regulatory-compliant CoinJoin, so therefore, Mr. Government or Mr. Regulator or Mr. Central Bank, please do not shut me down—or exchanges, please do not blacklist the coins coming out from me, ZKSnacks coordinator, you know?Max Hillebrand:Yeah. That’s certainly a desired outcome.",
