Even their abstract is \"outsourced\", although the original website seems to be already offline [see image 4 for this] Some screenshot for easy view: [1] [2] [3] [4] Notifying the suspect.",

That will prove the team's irreversibility.The same thought crossed my mind when I strolled through their litepaper and crosschecking them with the plagiarism checker, that if only they added bibliography on their last page, their action will be justified --I even checked their last page to see if they did this, which unfortunately they didn't. Nonetheless, the plagiarism of abstract can hardly be acceptable. Copying definition --with proper citation-- and description of things from existing media is acceptable, copying an abstract, though, is something that's entirely different.",
