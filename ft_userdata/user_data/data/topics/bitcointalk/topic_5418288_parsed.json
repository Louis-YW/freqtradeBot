We will see which casino tokens will become the top token casinos very soon and I am sure every casino that owns those tokens will work hard to give their best to their casino tokens.Maybe all those casino tokens will increase in the next altcoin season because almost all altcoins will usually experience an increase, which can impact casino tokens.",

      "body": "The main issue with tokens like brave browsers BAT is the lack of incentive to HODL long term. Most immediately dump and sell every token they have when they receive them expecting the price to diminish over the long term. Developing a viable strategy and format to encourage long term HODL with some form of burning, staking or compounding interest is what is most needed in crypto industries. I was lucky enough to gamble with bitcoin when its price was consistently appreciating. During winning weeks of gambling I would win not only through winning wagers. But also thanks to the value of bitcoin increasing which compounded my gains. That was a great experience. During some losing runs, bitcon's increase in value almost covered my losses. Fun times. I hope gambler's of the future get to experience something similar someday.",

The volume looks so good at this moment compared with another gambling token. The list piled up. I didn't even know they exist. But only few of these gambling tokens are actually listed on different exchanges. The Edgeless (EDG) or the Wagerr (WGR) that has been around since 2017 were not listed on few unknown exchanges making them under this circumstance not a good investment. FUN token is the only that is one binance.There is one that I have supported for a long time, it gives a good profit in receiving shared profit but also not listed in any exchange but on the dex.",

If they focus on casino, the token will followed because the user must open the website and the token will definitely visible. the problem, is the token useable?, if not the fame isn't followed, and even though a casino is great, a token doesn't follow.",

Its usage as a token is basically negligible imo, they are more like a fancy system that is rather similar to the VIP system most casinos have. They're not really valuable in hodling for a long time and they basically die off after the initial hype, with only some avid gambling users of the said casino using them. Even using them as tokens to gamble doesn't really set up the economy for it properly.",

It was advertised here in the forum, that is why I am familiar with it and for sure many of us here do.It is hard for a new casino token to be successful if their devs won't think of unique and new ways to add on its utility because people can just go in casino tokens in which came from a trusted and more older casino.",
