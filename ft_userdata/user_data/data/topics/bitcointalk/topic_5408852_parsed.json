They want to rebuild USSR.Medvedev made a post on VK.com and he quickly deleted this after some minutes but still a lot of people capture the post and posted it in social media.Here is the link: https://t.me/bloodysx/21272Medvedev claimed that his vk account was hacked and the post wasn't made by him. For more information, click here.This is what he says:\"No one should doubt that the mistake that was done at the beginning of the 90s will be fixed. There won't be any sovereignty parade and all the nations that were once living in the great USSR, will live in friendship and mutual understanding again. For this, we will spare no effort or means. We have already begun to move along this path. After clearing up all the territories of Kyiv and Malorussia from gangs and nationalists, that Ukrainians invented themselves, Russia will again become united like it was 1000 years ago. After that with the endeavor of Moscow and the leadership of the Slavic nation, we will go on the next campaign to restore the borders of our countries, that as we all know, don't end anywhere. We aren't going to give them up to anyone. For example, before joining Russia, Georgia didn't even exist. In the 1801 year, the current territory of Georgia consisted of five sovereign political formations: Kartli und Kakheti with capital in Tbilisi, Imereti with capital in Kutaisi, Samegrelo und Guria in black sea beach und Svaneti with hilly districts. So, Russia created Georgia within these borders. Georgia was always seeking toward Russia because it knew that Russia was its only natural ally in very hostile surroundings of Muslims. The same is happening now. Georgia can only be with North, South Ossetia and Abkhazia only in the territory of Russia.",

Medvedev has a big problems with alcohol, is well known information in Russia and border countries. So he could get drunk and write this message with easy, and in the morning after hangover he deleted this. Could he told us \"Guys, I was drunk\". Ofc not. So they (he and his managers ) told us that this is because of \"hackers\"",

And I would even believe in this (hackers like Anonimous is against russian aggression). BUT. Only ONE moment, which I described above. MEDVEDEV IS ALCOHOLIC. He is addicted to alcohol. So. When he get drunk he can write anything. Since you're russian you know what dunk drunk people can do. So I still think that this post is from Medvedev, from his alco side",

I don't know, maybe this time his account definitely got hacked, but rhetoric in this post isn't that much different from his previous statement. I don't know it's alcohol or drugs (or boht) but now he looks and acts like completely different person than when he was presidet or prime.",

Unless they use diplomatic means which is as a result of dialogue and some concessions agreed upon, I doubt other nations observing the ongoing escalations would sit with cross hands only to watch this plan play out. These other countries that have come to enjoy the taste of independence from the former USSR like Georgia, have their diplomatic ties with other countries for peace sake, for trade and investments.

No amount of PR correction-pen will redeem this blunder.[besides, you'd expect VK, the russian social media website, to have enhanced security for high Russian officials. If it really was a hack, then the security of VK for government accounts is laughable, unlike e.g. Twitter].",
