I can't think of anything really needing that much that doesn't have a battery inside it (you can charge a phone from a car pretty sustainably afaik too).",

      "body": "I understand that maybe the impact of the crisis has made some dark eyes on what they have to pay from their full rights to repay services, it must not be a difficult thing.I think reducing salary is not the first solution, throwing money to trade in the market has a fluctuating risk that maybe 50% can change course.In my opinion, this effort is not appropriate, although it may have to be professional, which company assets and personal assets can be thrown to any manager to be developedwhat is your reference link that extends to various sectors for this thread?",
