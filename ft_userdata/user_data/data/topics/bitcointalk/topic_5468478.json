Happy to see that you're interested in the promotion. The wagering for the promotion is also counted toward the welcome offer wagering, so there won't be any conflict. any wagering on Sugar Rush is also counted toward the welcome offer wagering. Our standard welcome offer is 100% up to 1 BTC, with 50x wagering (25xdep+25xbonus) but if you sign up via an affiliate you get 100 free spins on Book of Dead additionally, and lower wagering (40x). That bonus is activated with a bonus code.  Full terms for standard welcome offer here: https://empire.io/promotions/100--welcome-offer-new. Thanks for the welcome, and see you on the reels!",

And for the wagering, if I win 100$ from the free spin, do I need to wager all of that 100$ first, and the winnings will be what I qualify to withdraw, or can I just split the 100$ into 10 different segments so I can meet the wager requirements, which among the above best explained the requirements? And what will happen to the winnings that I might win from the Sugar Rush game? Will this 10-times wager requirement also be applicable to it? I'm asking out of curiosity since this part of the game is what brought the bonus, and I hope the terms also don't affect it.",

After you have wagered that, you can make a withdrawal of your free spins winnings.Hope that helps to clarify things, and I am happy to alter the written terms if you tell me which part is confusing.",

You want to know if they apply to the winnings from the regular game and not only the free spins one? Obviously not, the winnings coming from your bets during the promotion are regular, because if you don't reach the $100 wagering requirement you won't get anything on Monday.",
