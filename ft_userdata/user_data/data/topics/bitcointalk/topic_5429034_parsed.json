  "content": "If they use nuclear they Will make dangerous their own people Also Even If the Putin send nuclear to ukraine it's dangerous to Monaco and switzerland Also Putin own wife and friends and co workers are in switzerland Also it's impossible that he Will put his own people in danger.The countries where Putin can send nuclear are only finland or swden becouse in Europe those countries are not near by any important country where the elite rulers might be residents.Also all this news are like fud to scare investors.But one thing for sure world elite rulers dont Let situation never too bad.Right now everything Are under control world elite knows the war IS only in ukraine and nobody dont want it will cross over the NATO borders Im sure elite rulers Will have enough power to make sure Western countries are fine.World is full of elite rulers Kids and their own people will they put their own people in danger ?? Off course they dont.Until we dont see London rich and Monaco or st tropez rich people going in bunkers no need to worry about nuclear.Also elite rulers need to drink chapagne and eat caviar everyday Fresh air sunny day they never agree to go to smelly Dark underground bunkers.For elite rulers it's cheap they Will hire just someone to take down leader who try to threat them.If anyone think that any dictator or self Made boss can Do what they want in world then here is good examples Look at what happened with Osama bin laden ,ghadarffi, escobar, al capone and all others who was thinking they can go against elite rulers.Nobody cant and elite rulers have enough power to control everything so nuclear attack without consent of elite rulers it's impossible.We know that elite rulers rule and i just did explained why the nuclear attack IS impossible for the Western or Europe countries.That's it guys dont belive corrupted fud news meedia.",

At this stage, with all that has happened, nuclear war might come about by some joker in the military, getting scared and hitting the wrong/right button.",

To understand the future, one would have to know the thinking of Biden,What is the thinking of biden indeedðŸ¤”, guess we are screwed, because it's impossible to know what is on his mind, dooms day is upon usðŸ¤£The answer, of course, is to look to God; He makes the future based on a whole lot of thinking of all people... and His Own desires.Here is what to do. Slowly read the first 100 chapters of Psalms in the Old Testament of the Bible. Then adjust your attitude to match the attitude of those who wrote these chapters. Here is what that attitude is like:1. Understanding that God is real;2. Understanding that God is fully aware of everything and has almighty control over it for good;3. Simple, humble requesting God to help and protect all of us, and the whole world;4. Requests to straighten out the wicked, or destroy them if they will not be corrected;5. Reasons for God doing this are that we are acknowledging Him and worshiping Him.As Revelation in the New Testament says in one place, \"Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!\"Never stop in this your attitude toward God. In fact, find out more about God and obey it.",

And I doubt if God is interested about what biden or others think, He does what wants.I doubt that Biden or anyone for that matter care about your mythologic beliefs and your imaginary friend.I know that you have already decided that what you believe is the only truth and that's it so you cannot even do the basic exercise of thinking if it is correct and if all of it is as they are telling you. Seriously, I respect your right to believe in whatever you want, but if you have even the slightest critical thinking towards Islam, you will see that most of the rules are based on the nomadic life in the desert, old Arabic uses and in precepts that are taken from other mythologies including Hindi, Buddhist, Christian and Hebraic. The worst thing is the type of Islam that we are seeing around. It is one that places all the stress in rules, and little in humanity. Particularly, continuous display of religious symbols in public and a massive discrimination towards the female and many leaders who argue that they are there \"because of God\" and can do whatever they want \"because Gods tells them to\".Â  Being Muslim and female is an everyday punishment for many.Â  It is like Europe in the XVI century, burning witches and killing scientists.I am not sure young Muslims know about how the Islam was just a few decades ago. Much more open, much more relaxed and keen to share and coexist peacefully with others. You should be asking yourself why now Islam is being invasive and confrontational - hint: Money helps a lot spreading a message.",

And I doubt if God is interested about what biden or others think, He does what wants.Please try to think a little deeper about what you read in the Koran. God created everything, right? And He knows everything, right?We know from experience and experiment, that everything operates by cause and effect (Q&E). This means that whatever you do, something happens based on exactly the way you do whatever you did. And it works like this with everything that happens in the world... everything was caused by something else to be the way it is, and everything that happens causes other things to happen in the exact way that it affected them.What does this have to do with God? God made it all to happen at the creation. He set out all of creation so that it works the way it does in perfection. The laws of physics that He created operate without change. And since God knows it all, He was aware right from the beginning of all the causes and reactions that would happen throughout all time.God cares about it all... even what Biden and others think... even about nuclear attacks and every scrap of pandemonium in a nuclear explosion.

There you are.I'll be truthful. I certainly don't understand everything about being a Christian. Some of my understandiong may be a bit mythological. But the basics of Christianity are not mythological.The New Testament is the part of the Bible that we live under today. There is not any Christian violence listed in the NT. There is other violence, but no Christian violence. There are people that are Christians, are mistaken about what Christianity is ( use Christian mythology), and absolutely DO violence. Christianity is about invitation, but not about force.Islam is different. Every place where people don't accept Islam, Muslims will do their best to force people to become Muslims. If you don't see it happening in a land, it's because the Koran tells Muslims not to use force if there is too much resistance to have success in that land.Since this topic is about nuclear attack fakery, it certainly isn't about Christianity. If it were about nuclear defense, then it might possibly be about Christianity as well - self protection. But it could easily be about Islam since, contrary to its popular description as a 'religion of peace', Islam is really a 'religion of violence'.",
