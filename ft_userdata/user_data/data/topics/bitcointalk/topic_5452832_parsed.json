You can always keep abreast of changes in your portfolio and find out in a timely manner about new receipts on the balance of the wallet, while not risking connecting the hardware wallet to a mobile phone (wait, this has not yet been implemented by trezor. about this also a little later) and online. I also see the convenience in that you can easily and quickly generate a new address to provide to the sender. I copied and pasted from this app (if such a function is implemented. In general, how could it be without it in our time) and sent it to social networks or instant messengers (wait, how safe is this and whether malicious programs that got on your phone can change the address wallet).Including the question of security arises about if the smartphone is lost or stolen. By gaining access to the phone, and hence to Trezor Suite Lite, can get complete information about the owner's portfolio, which can be easily identified from the data in the phone. And also, almost everything about the owner of the phone. Compare these data and everything - you are in full view.I assume that this app will be finalized and will be able to interact with trezor (via cable or otherwise), allowing to also send transactions from the wallet. That is, to have the same functionality as in the desktop version. Most likely with the new hardware wallet that will be released. Analog Nano X?",

More importantly, it helps looking at the number of downloads if you know the exact app you are looking for. For example, the Trezor Suite Lite (released recently) already has +1k downloads, which is expected. This number will increase to tens of thousands after a while. On the other hand, the fake one on Google Play Store only has +10. It makes no sense that a Trezor app would have that little interest from customers. And obviously, you should never perform a search on an app store and trust the results shown. You find the correct link on the official website.",

Not only that, the fact the application is on the phone, could easily give a hint to some malicious person on our Bitcoin holdings. If Trezor really wants this app to the a success in the long run, they need to make it more discreet and appealing, beyond being a simple portfolio tracker, which there are already many in this market.  I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt for now, let us see. If all goes as intended, I would gladly connect a Trezor to my phone in the future, easier if there is no laptop at hand reach.",
