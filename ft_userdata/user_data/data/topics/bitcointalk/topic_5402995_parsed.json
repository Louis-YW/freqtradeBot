      "body": "I have been playing online poker for many years now. In the past, I’ve made some good money and I used to get a real thrill from the game but less and less these days. The reality is, the older I get I’ve just come to the realization that I can’t win because there are professionals playing and it’s not an even playing field. For example, it’s kind of like if I jumped into a professional basketball game. Sure the rules are the same but I’m playing against people over a foot taller than I am. At the end of the day, I like a fair game too much and I don’t feel it’s an even playing field anymore.",
