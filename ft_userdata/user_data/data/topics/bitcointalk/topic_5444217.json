  "content": "Hello everyone! Today bitcoin went below 20k and it will probably go even lower I share my opinion on why it will happen.Not too long ago I wrote a post about the best time to invest in bitcoin/crypto and this moment still didn't come.I was saying this before and I will say it again: bitcoin will go down and it MIGHT even go lower than 15k.Disclaimer: I'm not trying to be bearish or say that bitcoin is bad and you shouldn't buy it. I still think that DCA is the best tactic to choose in any circumstance. So keep buying bitcoin, it is the future of money and great technology.But my opinion is that right now it's not the best time to buy bitcoin and it will go lower because of some reasons. The main reasons for me are that the inflation is still too high, the economy is suffering and rates are still high. There is also a statistical fact that all previous times when FED pivots happened, the economy dipped even lower and found a new bottom. We still didn't see this fallout so it's safe to assume that it's coming.Latest statistics also showed that inflation is higher than expected and FED could start hiking rates once again.My advice will be to wait until FED will start lowering rates which will mean that the economy will start recovering and money will flow into crypto and bitcoin. Anyway, keep safe and don't panic, we will get through it.",

Your strong point and analysis to say bitcoin price drop is coming is all about inflation but I don't think that is what will happen to bitcoin only because of that. Are you saying when the inflation is high then people withdraw hodling and to take care of life? But during COVID-19 that was restrictions and low income earning, we saw gradual increase in investment and appreciation of price so inflation should not be the only reason for price drop. Bitcoin has the tradition of fall in price a year before halving.",

No, contrary to what was expected by some, in times of rising inflation BTC did poorly, actually managing a first, that is going below the previous ATH level, and not by a tiny fraction.Technically not every bearish CPI announcement caused another dump, this is just retrospectively what people perceived to have happened. Can give examples if required...There were a few where price had already dumped, so instead price rallied to the upside (last year in particular), or otherwise just went sideways for longer.But everyone only remember the times when priced dumped after the announcement, as opposed to when it didn't or the opposite occured...Quote from: stompix on March 10, 2023, 01:42:52 PMAnd you can see it again now, Silvergate and the FED saying rates will keep going higher and there you have it, 10% in a flash and sub 20k.After rejection from $25K a lot of people saw $20K incoming, as a usual bull market retracement. Obviously within a longer term bear market it looks a lot more severe, as it well could be.Silvergate bankruptcy or not, after $23K broke I was expecting $20K to come next. Maybe Silvergate accelerated that process, but it seemed likely long before that news broke imo.I'm not just saying this in hindsight, I stated numerous times in different threads that either $25K breaks and we go to $30K, or we go back to $20K...Quote from: stompix on March 10, 2023, 01:42:52 PMNo, BTC  doesn't thrive in an inflation either, and for sure not in a looming economic recession, it has ceased to overwhelmingly be a safe haven refuge and is more a tradable asset that moves as stocks do.Maybe you can help to unravel the followings data then, as so far nobody has been able to explain the following:2014-2015 bear market (no high inflation): Bitcoin drops -83% from ATH after approx one year2018-2019 bear market (no high inflation): Bitcoin drops -83% from ATH after approx one year2022-2023 bear market (with high inflation): Bitcoin drops -77% from ATH after approx one yearSo despite the subjectivity of Bitcoin going below previous ATH for first time, or below 200 Week MA - which is more about the lack of blow off top in 2021 than a poor performance in 2022 - why has Bitcoin performed better after 15 months+ in it's 2022-2023 bear market with high inflation than previous bear markets without? Is it because it will do worse eventually, ie more than -83% drop below $12K?For clarity, I'm not questioning why Bitcoin has dropped -77% since ATH, as to me it seems obvious (in hindsight) that this is what Bitcoin does every 4 years and has done so for 12. I'm trying to understand why many are speculating that Bitcoin will do worse in 2023 than previous bear markets and go sub $12K (-83%) when so far after a year since ATH it has performed much better than usual. Anything above $12K isn't worse...The only logical answer I've heard so far is that without the blow-off top in 2021, then price performed better because of that. The lack of blow-off top could be attributed to anticipated inflation, so therefore inflation was priced into the market in 2021, hence Bitcoin didn't do as well as usual or expected, as opposed to 2022? But with the same logic, a recession could well be priced in a year in advance as well.So does this then mean that Bitcoin's rise in 2021 was due to impending high inflation (after post covid19 money printing etc)? I'm not very convinced, again, I think this is just 4-year all over again.Quote from: stompix on March 10, 2023, 01:42:52 PMThis is BTC correlation with Nasdaq, almost the entire year it stayed up closer to 1 than to half a point and din;t go blow zero till the very end finally diverging.This is true, no-one can deny the correlation. But at the same time, I'm not particularly bearish about the S&P or Nasdaq. There was a lot of selling 2022 with the anticipation of a recession and therefore a long-term bear market to follow (like 10 year long or something). But so far this recession hasn't happened yet it seems (even though it obviously still could), and Bitcoin could de-correlate at any point like it has in the past.Quote from: stompix on March 10, 2023, 01:42:52 PMThe bright side in this is that most likely once the whole inflation and recession crap is finally done and gone the increase would probably overshadow everything else on the markets.The irony being that if the high inflation / recession clears up by 2024/2025, then a Bitcoin recovery & bull market would likely be contributed to this factor, rather than it's reliable and unbroken 4-year cycles",

But I hope your prediction is correct because I want bitcoin to be priced as low as possible, I don't want bitcoin to recover and rise again anytime soon. Bitcoin's decline is an opportunity, not a time to panic. Like when we go to the market, an excellent product is being sold at a high discount, which is a good thing. Similarly, if we have a chance to buy bitcoin at a lower price, the profit will be more in the future. Don't forget, the early adopters of bitcoin got rich because they bought bitcoins at super low prices.",

      "body": "Well there were a lot of things that all came together at the same time to cause the drop under $20k. Silvergate going bust, job growth being too strong and inflation didn't go down much in February so FED chairman just said past couple days interest rate raises will probably continue longer and therefore go higher (which doesn't affect Bitcoin directly but it makes investors in general scared of investing in anything because they seem to treat Bitcoin as though its a tech stock cuz they still don't know what Bitcoin is), I think some other collapsed crypto firm just announced it is liquidating as well, plus NY attorney general sued Kucoin over having ETH on their platform with the NY AG claiming ETH is a security, news that the US govt sent $1 billion of Bitcoin to Coinbase causing panic they would just dump it on the open market, Biden announcing in his budget proposal for next year a ridiculous 30% tax on electricity used in Bitcoin mining which implemented would basically drive all US Bitcoin mining companies overseas, and on top of all that of course looming worry of the SEC building up to take tyrannical enforcement against crypto and crypto companies. That's a ton of things all happening at once, and most of those just happened the past few days.Bitcoin absolutely could go lower for sure, as several of these factors are ongoing. But some will fade with the next news cycle so it also wouldn't surprise me if Bitcoin recovers a thousand dollars or two in the near future.",

Of course, it's easy to make statements like you make when the price has lost 20% in a very short time, because why wouldn't it lose another 20% or more? However, although many will blame the FED and their latest statements, I would also take into account the fact that many took profit by selling at a price of around $25k, and they bought exactly when the price was the lowest. The game is always the same, buy low, sell high, and take advantage of any news, whether it's good or bad. In any case, this will be a turbulent year, but that does not mean anything bad, because those who trade will have nothing against profiting 40% or even more a few more times.",

In the end, Bitcoin price is about offer and demand  and nobody escapes one of the most universal laws of economics.Once halving comes through, it would be just matter of time before the price increases in an important amount.

I am taking the opportunity to accumulate at the moment. I don't care if it goes down a little more and as I have said in other speculation threads, I don't expect big rises for 2023, although I would expect that by the end of the year we will close with a higher price than in 2022, which is not difficult, but until then there is a lot of volatility ahead of us, especially as things are in general in the economy.I don't look at what will happen to the price in the next few months, but over the next few years, and what I see happening is that we will look back and see that 20,000 was a very cheap price. So the best thing to do is to accumulate at these levels.",
