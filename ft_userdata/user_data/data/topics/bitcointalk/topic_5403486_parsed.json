  "content": "A wide range of virtual currencies have emerged over the past decade, such as Bitcoin, Lite Coin, PeerCoin, Aurora coin, Dogecoin, and Ripple. The most important of these is Bitcoin. In fact, this article allows to analyze the functionalities of Bitcoin as a new world currency, as well as its characteristics which can hinder its use as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value by comparing Bitcoin to standard currencies. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin has also been characterized by a significant increase in the number of transactions and market capitalization, which exceeded 5 billion US dollars in 2015. This leads to extreme price volatility of Bitcoin against currencies. standards. In order to understand the reasons for such price fluctuation, the authors try to identify the factors of Bitcoin price formation. Ciaian, Rajcaniova and Kancs (2016) analyze time series using daily data for the period 2009-2014. They suggest that Bitcoin's attractiveness indicators and supply and demand function are the most powerful drivers of Bitcoin prices. On the other hand, macro-financial developments do not determine the price of Bitcoin in the long term. Thus, the authors find that Bitcoin price fluctuations are associated with speculative investment decisions. According to what proceeds, Bitcoin will not be able to compete with standard currencies.

      "body": "Bitcoin is an investment, the reason many people are buying it and the adoption continues. Some countries have legalize bitcoin as a legal tender, less than 15 countries in the world totally ban bitcoin as of present. If bitcoin is used in other countries of the world and also even so people in the countries that ban bitcoin are still using it, what currency can we call that? Global or local currency? In my high opinion, the decentralization in bitcoin and its adoption makes it a global currency.",

No. Is it largely acceptable ? No, but its adoption is growing.But if both parts want, it is easy to transfer bitcoin to anyone anywhere in the world.I don't think bitcoin is competing with other currencies.  It is just an alternative, for people who wants more freedom and don't want to be exposed to governments agendas.",

This is the same with gold which was recognized as a currency even long before the first constitutional era was formed.Now you just have to look at the total capitalization of bitcoin and find out if that amount is not enough to call bitcoin a global currency.",

But guess what no government can control or impose any law on Bitcoins.Thanks to the decentralised nature of the coin, for which no one can rule on it.So it’s really hard to make it something like a global currency.",

The popularity of bitcoin today is as a result of few countries that has accepted it as a means of payment and several countries that are yet to adopt it but her citizen still trade with bitcoin because of the freedom they see it. I believe for bitcoin to become a global currency the government of every country will have to accept bitcoin as a means of payment in each country.",

So the question we can ask : can Bitcoin become a global currency?check out https://roz-key.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-digital-agenda-of-virtual.htmlBitcoin by it's very nature is a global currency, so it's a bit of a weird question to ask. Do you really mean, can Bitcoin become the reserve currency of the world and displace US dollars? No, would be the simple answer. It does not have the capacity to support the amount of transactions and is unlikely to ever do so. Maybe another crypto will come along in future, even Satoshi would not be so naive to think that it cannot be improved upon greatly - it was a test bed for this pioneering technology and we should always seek out the next innovation. It may continue to hold a place in the world similar to gold, however it needs to shake out some of the volatility first and find a more regular purpose.",

Maybe it will be a global currency if a country would accept Bitcoin as a means of payment just like what happened in Venezuela. But the problem is most country leaders wouldn't want that to happen because they think different and they value their own local currency which is widely used by most citizens so it's all in a debate if you want to still ask that question even after a hundred years or so.",
