America gets to wield a lot of economic and political leverage by being the dominant reserve currency of the world, but the Saudi Arabian leadership are trying to reduce the potential for outside pressure. They currently have a fairly good position because they are often backed as the counter to Iran in the region, however the Saudi government sometimes does some extremely reprehensible things like the killing of the journalist in the Turkish embassy. America will no doubt keep this in mind with who they choose to support in future but everyone is playing their own geopolitical game.",

It won't kill Petrodollar entirely though since US still has many colonies that will continue using dollar including Saudi regime and even Europe. But it will definitely weaken US dollar over the coming years.As for Saudi reasons, I believe it is just their way of getting some kicks in while seeing US is down on the ground because they won't get any other chance for doing it.They are also putting this type of pressure on US regime because they are angry with their defeat in their invasion of their neighbor which was backed by US and the billions of dollars worth of weapons US sold them proved to be useless. This is also why they are getting closer to US adversary China and are even selling some oil to China using CNY instead of USD.The real question is what would US regime do? Historically they've always invaded and destroyed any country that has tried doing that.....",

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in particular cannot deviate from the will of America. It is also not surprising that some Saudi officials may declare that they are seeking to disengage (dependence), but the decision-makers know that this is almost impossible, at least now.Bin Laden, accused of the September 2001 bombings, is a Saudi. America did not pay attention to this point and went to destroy Afghanistan. To this day, the American administration refuses to acknowledge that Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi Arabia. It can also be said that America protects the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the region.And the Saudis are not stupid to forget that if they abandon the use of the dollar in their foreign exchange, then they will declare direct hostility. It is more likely that Saudi Arabia is only seeking to continue exchanges with China, and not that it really intends to abandon the dollar.",

Practice is where it is.Trading for other currencies than the dollar is not new, and there is nothing strange or scary here. But there are nuances:1. International prices are fixed in dollars. So \"acceptance of other currencies\" will be a simple conversion of the DOLLAR, at a given RATE, into a new currency.2. No one will accept currencies that are either artificially held or have no real backing of the real economy and technology. For example, such currencies include the ruble. But the Indian rupee is quite suitable for an alternative deal. The economy is large, the rupee is provided by the real sectors of the economy and not by the delirium of an elderly crazy under-furrer 3. In addition, such currencies must be highly liquid, must not only be accepted by the currency issuing country, not be subject to noticeable inflation, or be in an area of turbulence, such as the yuan.",
