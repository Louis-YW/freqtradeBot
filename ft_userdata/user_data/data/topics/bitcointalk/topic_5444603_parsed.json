I believe this is still affecting online gambling platforms because this is one of the most common issues that online gamblers are still facing.   As far as I know, there are casinos here in crypto gambling that announce that they do not have KYC for their future players on their gambling website platform, but when a withdrawal of a large amount comes, other casinos suddenly break or destroy what they first announced, that's why gambler is suddenly making accusations against the casino platform.     But there are other casinos that immediately say that you need to submit a kyc, which for me is okay because at least they are transparent and don't hide anything from their future clients. And in this style of casino it has a good impact at least I think.",

Imagine a situation where you have ton of money in it and suddenly there is site crash or let’s say there is hack or something and your money is lost. You can always claim back your funds by show casing validity of your account. Because in above mentioned events things could go south to north quickly and they might start investigating about it. Since you will have your verification done you can prove your identity or in some extreme cases you will be able to file law suit against the casino if they deny the refunds or lost assets. If you don’t wanna get verified then decentralised casinos are there but who knows the validity of same?",

Only casino that is decentralized or doesn’t have e-gaming license offer a no KYC requirements boldly because they doesn’t have any regulators that watching them.Don’t blame casino for the casino because it’s part of the legal process to operate freely without violating any law in most of the country which there consumer are playing.",

I believe this is still affecting online gambling platforms because this is one of the most common issues that online gamblers are still facing.   you have to wonder why exchanges ask for KYC even though they are cryptocurrency exchanges. the principle is the same: they are government rules to combat money laundering. casinos handle money from customers, they handle license and the license provider in their TOS probably requires the casino to ask KYC to their customers, of course crypto casinos don't ask all customers to do KYC when they create an account, they ask for KYC when they detect some suspicious activity, at least that's acceptable, although I hate KYC I did KYC at the casino I like and trust, I'm talking about my signature casinoOf course, I only use one casino, and the reason is simple: I don't want to KYC 2, 3, 4 or dozens of casinos. The problem with KYC is that you like bonuses and want to use many casinos, you will be obliged to deliver documents in many casinos and this makes you very exposed. I don't understand how these guys who created KYC didn't create rules that helped people, all they did was put people in danger, when a person gives his address to the casino, that person can start not to sleep well, a criminal can have access to data and go to that person's house to harm him",

I don't see the KYC thing as something terrible because when am having fun with gambling and I win big,I will love to  withdraw my win easily without a delay or problem.",

But when KYC is made mandatory there is nothing to do. However, many gambling sites do not make KYC mandatory. If any suspicious behavior persists, KYC becomes mandatory. Moreover, it is mandatory for all casino license holders to do so otherwise they may face legal complications. A lot of gambling sites are being added to the crypto casino platform these days so a gambler will find a platform to suit their needs. However, it is very useful to check out the best platforms before gambling.",

The law permits this. And its more profitable for the casino to ignore you (time = money).",

But the way, from conceptual framework of your topic, I will say, nobody is afraid of KYC but the way the casino companies are doing is making people to be scared to use their sites. They only asked when you win a bet and want to withdraw, and if the KYC process is not successful they would block your account. And that is bad. Because the gambler was hoping to win his bet and now the casino has restricted him of redeeming his win from bets.",
