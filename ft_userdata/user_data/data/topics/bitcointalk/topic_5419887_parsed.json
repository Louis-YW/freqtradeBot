  "content": "Hi there,I've been mining Vertcoin on 3 Nvidia RTX2060 using VerthashMiner. I've tried a couple of pools (mining-dutch.nl and suprnova) with basic setups and similar results. With the three GPUs drawing aprox 100W each, I'm getting 1248.94 kH/s total. This translated into roughly 1VTC on my wallet for about 24h mining, which is a ridiculous low amount compared to the expected profitability mentioned in google results.On several google searches, profitability figures with these GPU's for Vertcoin are mentioned to be around 5USD/day for each GPU - I'm making a few cents per day.Is this normal or is there something I'm missing?Thanks",

So the question then is - how is anyone GPU mining if all these altcoins are unprofitable??",

So the question then is - how is anyone GPU mining if all these altcoins are unprofitable??They're either curious with the coins or the purpose is to hold for long term, even though right now they didn't make any profit, but they're believe a miracle might happen in the future. Most GPU miners already quit to mine, they're either sell their GPUs or wait until bull season happen. If you have enough budget, you can buy ASIC miner since it's more profitable than use GPU.",

So the question then is - how is anyone GPU mining if all these altcoins are unprofitable??Google did not provide any mining estimate, maybe you're reading some old articles or old profitability pages.As already said here, whattomine is the best source to at least get closer to real profitabilityAnd yes, mining is not good right now, maybe it's the worst time, it's pure math, with 0.10 USD kWh you'll mine at loss.People will continue to mining and there's a lot of reasons like solar panels, dirty cheap electricity, long term projects, coin supporters or just people mining at a loss, holding the coins to sell next bull run.So, the problem is not you or your GPUs, the market are bad and mining is not giving profits to us home miners.",
