Make sure you learn about them properly before you use them to store your private keys.If you can't afford a hardware wallet and want an easy UI wallet, bitcoin core or electrum is the best. Bitcoin Core will require you to sync with the blockchain history, a time consuming process. So, electrum would be the best fit. However, these are hot wallet. It's always good to use cold wallet.For learning more about wallet, you can visit this section- https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=37.0",

But if you want withdrawing trough Binance P2P you have create Binance account and don't forget with verifying document ID.For wallet recommended I think you can installed metamask on your computer and don't forget to save recovery phrase, I think metamask is easy use for beginner but after you have understand all about wallet kinds you can use hardware wallet. Don't forget to read about some topic about how to secure your address from malware and hacking cases, have many problem when you know about cryptocurrencies and wallet is most important thing for saving and withdrawing your assets.",
