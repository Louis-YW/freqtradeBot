Even rich men don't want to pass their properties and wealth down to their children, they believe it will weaken them and they won't be able to pursue their own dreams, some believe that the children won't know what it takes the parents to acquire wealth, so they will waste it all away. I have seen a lot, but I plan to leave mine with my children, I had a ugly childhood and I plan to give my children the best lessons that will help them when growing up, I believe giving up your keys for the ones you love is the best thing you can do.",

Since I have not thought deeply about that happening, I haven’t decided to will the private key to anyone yet but since my family knows that I am into bitcoin, I will let them know the importance of the private key and how secretive it is that if when disclosed, we can lose everything. Whenever I disclose it to them, they will hold it with all their life and not allow any outsider knows about it. Telling them about it all is okay to me since the money will be for all of them and not for just one person to inherit if something later happens. I wish there’s a better way, but I can’t think of any now, I will also follow up on other’s comments to have an idea about it too.",

Preparing for death in my culture is seen as an abomination but I have seen many losses and problems caused by unprepared deaths.I don't think anybody has the intention of allowing his Bitcoin to be added to the number that has been lost. Even if you don't have any relatives or dependents, it will not be a bad idea to plan to donate it to charity.But in this world that is ruled by greed and selfishness trusting someone is becoming risky and difficult. The news is filled with fearful news of people scamming or even killing people who trusted them with sensitive materials. Some persons might decide to include their bitcoin in wills and put the seed phrase in the custody of a lawyer. Some people also keep it with a trusted custodian for safekeeping. Others who don't care about centralised platforms might decide to put their coin in corporate institutions that offer custodian services. But you could also share the keys with a family member who is trusted. For me, I think who has access to your password or seed phrase should be top secret and shouldn't be discussed in a public forum..",

This is why I think that every investor should plan for their bitcoins like they were to die the next minute. If you cannot trust a close member of your family, Your wife, your husband, your children, your brothers and sisters, then maybe you can get two lawyers who do not know each other and will be bound by law, split your seed phrase between the lawyers to deliver to your next of kin on the occasion of your death, timely or untimely.A timelock can also be set, if you die before the time, and it is passed to your family, they will still need to wait for the time on the lock to elapse before they can assess it.",

I have a spouse who can access my BTC, and I also hope that someone else from the family will be able to figure out how to do it in case something happens to both of us. We trust each other, so it's not really a problem for me. And we similarly have access to each other's bank accounts, so Bitcoin isn't different in that regard.If you don't have anyone you can trust with this, perhaps writing a letter of inheritance and mention the important information in it, so that it can be dealt with when you're gone.",

So I put my trust in passing my Bitcoin to my wife and I also gave my private key to my wife, and I also gave her directions or a way to access it.And another reason is because we both are always open to each other on any issues, including financial issues, and he also knows that I have been involved with Bitcoin for a long time.

      "body": "Your digital wealth, especially your bitcoins, is more than just money. It's a legacy that shows you believe in a future without centralised power. Thus, you need to make a plan soon. Sharing your private keys? Yes, it's risky, but there are safe ways. Think of multi-signature wallets. To authorise a transaction, more than one key is needed, which adds an extra layer of protection.It's still not clear how to plan for the death of digital assets, but things are changing. New services are popping up that combine the technicalities of blockchain with the rules of the law. They can make sure that your bitcoins get to the people you care about without putting your security at risk. You need to be strategic instead of reactive. Even if something goes wrong, your bitcoins shouldn't disappear.Last, those without family can donate. You might want to set up a trust that gives your bitcoins to a good cause. In this way, your purchase will still have an effect after you're gone. The future of your bitcoins is your responsibility, so plan ahead. It's about leaving a digital trace that says, \"I was here, and I made a difference.\"",
