It doesn't appear to make any sense when I try to decode it using UTF-8 or any online tool I could find. I've checked Ordiscan etc. and it doesn't seem to be linked to that. Anyone have any ideas?",

The whirlpool coinjoin server uses the OP_RETURN output to keep track of eligible coinjoin UTXOs, fees paid, and so on. There is no human readable component to these OP_RETURN outputs.Minor quibble. But it IS human readable I can read it. It just has no human discernible data. I deal with this from some database people all the time, I have to keep telling then that the DB admin can read EVERYTHING, so make sure any private data is encrypted BEFORE it hits the database.Or, only be decoded in a way that the people with DB admin access do not have a way to get to.-Dave",
