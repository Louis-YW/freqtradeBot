  "content": "Currently we are destroying any chance of recovery from the coming ice-age, simply because we are adding to it with all our global warming and climate change correction attempts. Ice-age warnings have been sent out since ... ages ago. The original hard-covered science-fiction book \"Fallen Angels\" by Larry Niven, talked about the coming ice-age in a science-fiction format. But at the end of the book was listed a great big bibliography of all kinds of scientists who showed why the ice-age is coming.Solar researcher warns of solar activity decrease, imminent MINI ICE AGE and GLOBAL FAMINE by 2030https://www.naturalnews.com/2023-10-06-researcher-warns-mini-ice-age-famine-by-2030.htmlA Ukrainian solar researcher with a solid academic background has been warning about a dangerous phenomenon that could lead to dramatic climate and weather changes as well as global cooling for years now. Her studies have become controversial over the years because she blames climate changes on the sun's activity and not anything carbon dioxide-related.In a 2019 interview with the award-winning Canadian journalist Stuart McNish on his program \"Conversations That Matter,\" Valentina Zharkova, who authored world-leading research as well as numerous groundbreaking publications, explained that they have been observing signs that since 2015, solar activity has been decreasing in a manner only seen during the Grand Solar Minimum, which last occurred during the Maunder Minimum, also known as the \"prolonged sunspot minimum,\" 400 years ago.She cited National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and other research organizations have noted this trend in various ways but hid the information from the public. According to her, the significantly reduced solar activity will inevitably lead to dramatic climate and weather changes such as a massive global cooling that could be likened to a mini ice age. (Related: NO WARMING AT ALL: Global COOLING continues for eighth straight year, according to NOAA data.)\"Between cycle 25 and 11 years of cycle 26 [the least active cycle], and between cycle 26 and 27, will be the coldest period on Earth, and we will feel it through a lack of vegetation,\" the researcher and lecturer with a doctorate in astrophysics said. This means that starting after the active period during the 'Solar Cycle 25,' from the second half of this decade until the early 2050s, Earth will experience exceptional cold, extreme weather, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Zharkova pointed to 2030 as the year when it will seriously begin, warning that the 2030s will be so cold that it will result in a severe food shortage. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JyyuouPSNEA...",

      "body": "I personally think it is unlikely to happen, but do not mind me, I am not a scientist.Assuming this is a trustworthy theory and indeed we are supposed to expect the planet to cool down to the point of food becoming more scarce, what would our solution be?Perhaps implement more sources or energy which are not dependent on the climate, like nuclear energy or geothermic? Are we supposed to try and stockpile food and develop new types of farms which can withstand the low temperatures which will come? People are rather concerned over high temperatures than low ones, if you have been paying attention.",

Also, I have read somewhere that the idea of spreading some dust to deflect the sunlight back to space has already been proposed by scientist, but if they even tried to implement such plan to cold down the atmosphere, I would bet you would not like it, because you may believe they would be actually poisoning us with some evil virus or weakening agent, so what is the point about debating anymore on what it is good for the planet ?Because in the end of the day, anything said by the scientific community may be perceived as a conspiracy.",

You know that people make agreements all the time. So, I think that we are capable of agreeing, disagreeing, partially agreeing, not considering, etc., etc, on whatever we want.Also, I have read somewhere that the idea of spreading some dust to deflect the sunlight back to space has already been proposed by scientist, but if they even tried to implement such plan to cold down the atmosphere, I would bet you would not like it, because you may believe they would be actually poisoning us with some evil virus or weakening agent, so what is the point about debating anymore on what it is good for the planet ?Because in the end of the day, anything said by the scientific community may be perceived as a conspiracy.Sounds like you have a conspiracy theory about me or some of my thinking, except for one thing. I am only me. And you have to have at least two to have a conspiracy. Are you the other one of my conspiracy?The chemtrail particles being sprayed into the air are not basically there to stop global warming. Rather, they are being sprayed so that the HAARP installations around the world can be used to heat certain areas of the atmosphere at certain times, by the microwaves directed at these areas by the HAARP arrays.Why would any government or military use the HAARP arrays to change atmospheric temperatures in some localized area? Because heating large sections of the atmosphere can cause a gigantic change in weather patterns. Governments can use these changes to cause droughts or floods anywhere in the world, thereby punishing people of the various lands for their (the government's) own purposes. They might even be able to cause earthquakes this way.The accidental side effect will be to help the ice-age to occur... because blocking the sun's rays DOES cause cooling. When they realize what they have done - sometime in the not too distant future - will they, then, try to use nukes to heat the earth?",
