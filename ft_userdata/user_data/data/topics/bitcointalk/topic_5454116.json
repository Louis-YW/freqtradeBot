  "content": "When I tried to insert images hosted on Imgur into my posts, I got this error \"Embedding Imgur links is not supported in new posts\". After reading other posts on the issue I understood that there have been frequent issues with Imgur and this is probably the reason Imgur was restricted on the forum to prevent future issues. So, I decided to create a list of alternatives to Imgur (The list will be updated, I just want to try each of them myself before I include links):imgbb.com. Founded: ?https://postimages.org. Founded: ?talkimg.com - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5450546.0imageshack.com. Founded: 2003",

The issue with imgur is not a frequent one but once a while. I had encountered some issues with imgur before this last one. Though those issues were minor ones that were resolved but this last issue was the main problem that occurred. If the problem was only on their website the thing wouldn't affect people in the forum but as the image were removed from the forum causes the whole thing. Now majority of people are not using it again.",

I hope this is a temporary restriction.Really? I'm curious, can you tell me what's so good about Imgur?I’m with you on this one Mr Robot. They’ve gone down hill big time these last few years. They deleted the mobile version which had more features such as forum image imbedding/bb code , which the app doesn’t have (or didn’t last I checked). I always had issues on desktop too with images not correctly loading as well as image sizes coming out funky, and resizing option didn’t work half the time, also crap like images flipping upside when uploaded for no reason. They clearly cut costs big time across the board. I stopped using them prob close to two years ago, maybe they’ve gotten better since then. But never going back.",

Quote from: theymos on May 24, 2023, 06:24:57 PMIt looks like imgur is no longer blocking the image proxy. I didn't change anything on the forum's end, so imgur must've loosened up their limits. I guess it's not necessary to convert img images into links as long as imgur keeps working. But to prevent this from happening again, you'll get an error if you try to embed imgur images in posts from now on.I'd like to create a page which recommends services for hosting forum images, and mention this in the error message you get when you try to use imgur.

I hope this is a temporary restriction.This could probably be because you haven’t tried out other image uploading sites. But they are certainly some that could just do the work Imgur does for you without problems. Currently the TalkImg is the best fit for the forum. If you are looking for some more sites that could still be used outside the forum then checkout this thread, there are many of them discussed there that could be a better alternative to Imgur for you.",

I hope this is a temporary restriction.I don't think there is a difference between people using imgur and those using other hosting services because actually the purpose of using imgur and using other hosting services is the same to get a link and then paste it on the forum so people can see the image.If you think imgur is much better than others, where does imgur make it better?Ignoring imgur to start posting new images on forums and trying to use other hosting services like TalkImg.com and others are good alternatives.

I don't want to use other ones because there is no need, I had 0 issues with Imgur. What I do is tightly connected to graphics and imagery of any kind. I use different image hosting services for different needs. Often times I have to use something else I used to use. I know what works best for me. Quote from: _act_ on May 26, 2023, 03:49:37 PMIt is not hard to upload images on other sites too like https://www.talkimg.com/ or https://imgbb.comIt is not hard to upload images anywhere. I'm not making a big deal about it, I just like Imgur. It is like arguing about what cheese tastes better. It is subjective.Quote from: _act_ on May 26, 2023, 03:49:37 PMYou can resize your image on this forum if the image uploading site that you are using does not have resizingI can resize images in Photoshop, but with Imgur I don't have to - it gives me a size table I can choose from depending on the need. That's the point.Quote from: _act_ on May 26, 2023, 03:49:37 PMThe speed on other sites are fast too. With what I saw, faster than ImgurIt depends on where the uploader and the servers are located. For me, Imgur is faster. For you, some other service may be faster.I can use \"talkimg\" but it is a new service that can be dead in a couple of years. Besides, it allows embeds only to BitcoinTalk - I don't want to have an image hosting account for each forum/social media site.I have been using Imgbb and a few others but they are slower and less convenient than Imgur. There are probably other alternatives designed for image snippets/screenshots that I haven't tried, but the ones I tried are no good. Most importantly I've never had issues with Imgur and it does what it is supposed to do.",

You probably noticed this already when you started getting traffic to your site since you made it public, so bitcointalk user support for your project should be pretty good so far.Another fact I can say is - the donation address has also started filling up in the last two weeks even though it's only showing 0.002 btc.
