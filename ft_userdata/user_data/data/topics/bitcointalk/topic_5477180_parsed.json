That’s why you see account changing hands or been bought receives tag from members even though it is allowed it is frowned upon. Concerning his portfolio, I hope he actually has discussed that with his family or friends hopeful they can recover the funds, I doubt the forum can do much of a thing about that",

For Bitcointalk forum account then it is not proper to use it because the owner is different since the real owner is now gone. Even though the account isn't used for scamming people but still the account is red tagged if it is ever going active. There will be a neutral feedback in the account and will be changed to negative feedback as I have explained if the account go active or online.",

If it's his children, then they will definitely get access to his fund; if it's also anyone in the family, they should be able to access his crypto asset. In a situation where he did not keep any trace of his crypto asset or left any information behind, that means his asset is lost forever.Then, concerning his BTT account, since the account was created by him and he is not alive any more, whatever legacy he left here will remain. His account is not to be taken upon by anyone because the forum doesn't know what anyone who is going to be in charge of that account can do to destroy the reputation that the original account owner built while they were alive. It might not be a trusted person like the real account owner, and that's why it's advised for a new user to start their own account instead of buying or taking over someone else's.If any of his relatives want to contribute to the forum, they have to start a new account by themselves and introduce themselves as relatives. Assets can be passed down to family and relatives, but not accounts. That's just my opinion.",

Without this the funds are lost. If they keep it on an exchange then there is a possibility of recovery eventually but would be alot of work.For his bitcointalk account, it would be best if it was just not active. A family member wont have the same knowledge as someone who has been a veteran in crypto for years. Its also not good if the account is sold because that usually results in scams.",

Maybe he had a lot more things to give to the forum.But in this context, if you say what will happen to the account of Bitcoin Talk, such a question arose in my mind last year, and I also opened a topic about it, and from there I learned that buying and selling an account in the bitcointalk forum is not illegal, but it is discouraged, I also think that in this case the matter is much the same.But talking about Bitcoin as a portfolio, no there is no option for Bitcoin handover or insurance. But what you can do for your future generations is to follow this method(Using Locktime for inheritance planning, backups or gifts) and send them Bitcoin as a gift. Moreover, once the private key is lost, the wallet will be lost for ever. You know na \"Not your keys, not your coin.\"Quote...Is it possible that a third party can start using the account?What if knowing that death is inevitable, we will our bitcointalk account and our portfolio to someone who will manage after out demise.(.....)This answer could fit -Quote from: DdmrDdmr on July 04, 2022, 06:35:16 PMExcept for on rare occasions, people do not get to know for sure when someone passed away out of those with an account on the forum. As far as I’m concerned, I’m of the opinion that every account should be personal (*), and that there is no point in considering passing on the account to other members of the family – there certainly won’t be a procedure to do so from the perspective of the Forum (imagine needing to forward and deal with death certificates and so forth). An account is not a milking active to pass over to other generations, and even if people did do so by passing on the credentials in some pre-planned manner, it’s pretty likely that someone will spot a complete change in posting style that may lead to some awkward situations at some point. Of course there is no impediment for someone to plan ahead and come accross their own account’s inheritance plan, but it doesn’t seem like something that would come as very top of mind thing when planning ahead for these events. In any case, I’d equate it pretty much to a bought account.(*) There may be some exceptions, namely real business fronted by a given account which could merit a consideration, but likely all falling on the shoulders of the implied, with cero Forum implication.",

Unlikely.Therefore, both then and now, it will be proposed that any heir begin his journey on the forum independently.

This community is just a forum that facilitates interactions about Bitcoin between like-minded people. Accounts in this forum have no financial worth except if the owner offers service to community members or companies that run signature campaigns. So there is no need to transfer the ownership of the account to another person.Let us assume that Light Warrior's legendary account was inherited by his daughter who had no interest in Bitcoin. Now the community will have to cope with a newbie behind a legendary account. Transferring an account to family members or a third party will undermine the reputation and integrity of the account. The account will lose value because the worth of every account is the person behind it and not the rank. Accounts of late members should be tagged to enable members to know that the owner is dead. Any member of the family that is interested in joining the forum should start from the beginning. This will enable such a person to gain knowledge of Bitcoin and the forum and grow naturally.",
