  "content": "I started accumulating Bitcoin after the June crash last year, my average buy is currently $17500. I feel like it is a good time to be accumulating but also lately have been thinking it may be a while until it is worth selling.I think Bitcoin will reach $100k maybe $150k next bull run in 2025 but feel that is not going to be enough for me to sell as I won't have anywhere near 1 full Bitcoin. I invest in Bitcoin weekly but I also have other Altcoins I invest in so it is not a large amount I am able to put into Bitcoin right now. I am thinking of just accumulating till 2029/2030 which should be the next bull run after 2025. Hopefully by this point I will have close to 1 full Bitcoin and the price will be at least $250k which would then be worth selling to me.",

When I bought my first coins for $600 I thought that getting 2x is already good, but I took it slow and one day my investment was 25x at which point I sold some, but when I did I realized that there are no things that I urgently need and can't afford. I made sure I'm well covered, have my ROI cashed out, have at least 20 monthly wages in cash saved up, have a home, a car, that was all that I needed at that point and I still had a lot of bitcoin left. Some years later I could be doing better like I could have a better car, a bigger house, but I don't need it. So if bitcoin went to 100k tomorrow I'd probably sell 10% of what I have just to have some fun in life. I'd throw it away and keep the rest because I don't need fiat that I have to pay tax on and then lose 10% a year in the form of inflation. If somebody would gave me 1 million today I'd do the same.
