Gave my last 0.009 btc to withdraw 0.001 btc, nice, cool. I consider this a SCAM. @nftonspin what do you say to that?",

But already hopes are dying, it's been two days, and still no payment.It's ok to have hope but you should be realistic about your expectation this is a lesson learned that when playing pick the casino with an already established casino, if you are going to test a new casino test it with money that you can afford to lose.This is the first time I read about that platform, but it's good that this early they are exposed if ever they will not pay you, you have done well by sharing your experience, wait one week more if you did not receive anything then change the title to confirmed scam.",

From where did you hear about this site? I haven't seen anything about them previously in the forum. As confirmed by everyone and me that you have been scammed. If you had found about this site from another website or forum then do share. It will only help others as everyone would know about them next time they do a search here or in Google.",

From where did you hear about this site? I haven't seen anything about them previously in the forum.Both of you aren't regular in the gambling board. As a result, both of you aren't aware of them. NFTonSPIN has an ANN thread in the gambling board: NFTonSPIN.com - Leading Crypto Casino With Get Full Refund If Not Satisfied@elley2kk, They are showing fake data of active users, the withdrawal fee is 0.001 BTC, NFTonSPIN doesn't have gambling license. What has attracted you to play at NFTonSPIN by making a deposit? NFTonSpin says that they have automatic withdrawal system, and the withdrawal takes only 10 minutes to be processed. Where you made 9 withdrawals and none of those were processed. NFTonSPIN.com doesn't look like a legit casino.",

      "body": "btw did you check all the terms on that website? like how many wagers do you need to be able to withdraw your bonus? because even if you register there you will get a free 0.0007 BTC and it must be wagered over 40x to be able to withdraw.even skenthal who is able to withdraw the bonus he got from the website says he wouldn't deposit any real money to this site.Quote from: skenthal on May 24, 2023, 03:28:01 PMtbh, i decided to write in here after 4 days of waiting thinking that they might process it due to community pressure in here, and actually they processed it in 1 hour after writing in here and writing them through email, i m not sure, it would be processed if i didnt do something like this and if amount was higher, but in the end they paid it.But imo i wouldnt deposit any real money coz, like many others said, offers are way too good to be true, and still site seems very amateurish (layout, games etc)But again like i said, they PAID it...but in the end, i just wondered why did you deposit that much money to a website that i believe is a scam website?",

It was obvious from their Ann thread that they weren't serious. They didn't even bother to buy a coper membership and post a proper announcement. Besides, it was also obvious that they weren't serious based on the bonuses they were offering, which were too good to be true.My advice is to create a type 3 flag against them and wait for dt members to support it.",

      "body": "That's clearly a scam, the OP shouldn't have waited long to conclude. First the selection of the name of the casino with \"NFT\" where they don't even implement this type of asset on betting (nothing but random branding). Second, I'm not that familiar with the appearance of casinos out there, but on a cursory UI inspection it seems completely unprofessional for a casino that can offer 900% cash back. Thirdly, there is no serious initiative of casino representatives to service and respond to reviews on official threads.",
