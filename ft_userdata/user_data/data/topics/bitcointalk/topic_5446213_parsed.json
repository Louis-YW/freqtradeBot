  "content": "I wasn't very fond of Coin Bureau youtube channel for them being notorious in shilling various altcoins, but they seemed to improve a lot and are doing pretty solid homework on legal and regulatory issues relating to Bitcoin and crypto in general.Here's their recent video on (crypto-friendly) Signature Bank, which shows some nuances that you won't hear in the mainstream media and is related to the wider crypto crack-down (aka operation Choke Point 2.0)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YZ6TG3iXKUShort summary (generated by Merlin tool):✦ Signature Bank, the final pro-crypto bank in the US, was shut down by regulators despite being solvent.✦ Signature bank developed Signet, a platform to transfer US Dollars 24/7 for its crypto clients.✦ Signet and Silvergate are two pro-crypto banks with overlapping client bases, but differences in their service offerings.✦ Signature Bank shut down by NYDFS, causing huge issues for crypto companies.✦ Regulators targeted Signature Bank due to its Signet platform.✦ The FED may be threatened by private sector competition.✦ US regulators are targeting stablecoins as their final crypto competitor to crush.✦ Global Crackdown on crypto may happen this summer.Really good watch and puts things into perspective.",

      "body": "I agree that the US government is trying to mess with crypto, but that's not the whole government, it's the Biden supporters for the most part, because republicans seem to be more pro crypto with states that are considered to be more republican voting for mining to be legal with no restrictions and recognizing cryptocurrencies as assets. To mention a few, Kentucky, Texas and Wyoming are pro crypto, while NY was anti crypto from the start with their extremely restrictive licenses. If you remember Charlie Shrem, he used to run a bitcoin business in NY and ended up in jail for it. IMO the US is divided when it comes to cryptocurrencies, just as it is on abortion, cannabis, capital punishment and many other things but the overlords have overplayed their hand by printing money and this eventually will lead to more inflation, or more bank defaults. In both situations bitcoin will come up on top because it's allowing you to sit on the sidelines and watch it all happen without being involved.",

This is just horrible, a massive crackdown against cryptocurrency usage to sway people into investing into government-sanctioned assets and bonds? That's just disgusting and a foul play at best. I do hope that the general public wins against this arms race but I doubt it considering the choke hold that SEC has over most banks and firms in the country. US will know to realize how beneficial cryptocurrency is to their dying economy if the crackdown ensues and crypto is completely shut off from the country, coz I doubt people and entities that use crypto will retain operations over a country that would like to regulate it for the sake of personal gain. I guess it's time for the cryptocurrency industry to look outside of US and find other countries to support, third-world countries are looking rather ripe right now considering that most of them are cryptocurrency-friendly to begin with.",

The government doesn't want competition to other crypto that's why they are manipulating the flow, deposit and withdraw and etc. It will gives us no freedom, I just hope it will be done soon.",

Policies are the same and so on. The people that work there just have a new name on the top of their paycheck this week. No major policy changes.

They were always very clear on that, when you put money in the earn program, it was no longer under the control of Gemini.The funds to run the day to day operations / the holdings for their GUSD stablecoin / and all those other things are in banks and treasury bills.But in the end when you have banks like Pathward (Metbank) and WebBank and all the others that issue crypto debit cards for companies and all the rest, when someone like the OP comes in saying that the government is shutting down crypto banks I just roll my eyes and point out that they really do need the tinfoil hat.On a side note, Gemini earn was always a joke IMO, they were letting you take your money out of the control of Gemini and putting it in with DCG and then took a very large percentage of the profits for themselves, yes it was easier then doing it yourself but it then put them in this position of looking bad because they had their name on it. But Gemini Earn, does sound a lot better then Gemini is going to take your money invest it in risky things for 12%+ APR and give you 8% I can see the marketing department having an issue with that -Dave",
