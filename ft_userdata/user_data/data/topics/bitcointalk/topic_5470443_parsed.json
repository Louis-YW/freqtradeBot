Op I have noticed you for sometimes that you only bring things that not worth discussing, they are not even politics, not bitcoin or altcoins not even full economy matters. Well thanks for the news but we need bitcoin discussion and not this. Let me see this information from economic and political perspective. From economic perspective, what the governor did is a very good thing because he has successfully created such large number as families and that would become a community. Because it is individuals that formed family and family members form community and Community forms the society and the society forms the nation and nation forms the state (country). This is the birth of a country. So what he did is a perfect one for development of the state and the Region. If I wish all state understand the economic benefits of the empowerment, it would have been a good thing to everyone. According to the Holy Bible, whoever findeth a wife findeth a good thing and God go bless the marriage Proverbs 18;22. And you know the kind Joy wey those boys have right now? They have been struggling to get married but no money. Then let me come to political perspective. I have said a lot in the economic perspective now the political aspect of the whole matter is to buy the mind of the people to support the present governor because the appeal court nullified the February governorship election so the governor is trying to buy the mind of the people so that the people would support him. It is a political game. And a again this is a best practice in politics. There are some build hostels for students in Universities, those are necessary needs of the people and if any leader can do these basic things for the people then he becomes a good leader in the society. The people do not need much but these small small things are needs to enhance the livelihood of human beings. So don't think the otherwise of the matter. It is a good thing that he has done.",

This marriage is indeed a true definition of \"for better and for worst\", well they tried at least they've aided the society to reduce the numbers of unmarried people in our society.  Does the number of married or unmarried people have any impact on the economy crisis we are currently experiencing ? I haven’t seen in any civilized country where government funds citizen marriage, rather they channel that funds to the betterment of their community. Our government like to day do watin no concern them. They channel their energy into the wrong things, instead of tackling unemployment and lack of infrastructure. I want to also ask, will they keep funding this families to meet  up with the standard of living ? Cause looking at the pictures from the link these look like citizens who can barely afford minimum wage.    It’s indeed funny and woo to the people in power that agree to these lame gesture. Government should be wise enough to know what lacking in the society so that they can make proper adjustments to them. Food no be empowerment !!!  They keep shutting our mouth with food because they know how hungry the nation is  and what hungry people can do desperately just to get a share. But deep down we are tired of their strategy, if job opportunities where as free as these food they’re sharing trust me more Nigerians will have more than enough to eat. Illiteracy too follow for all this nonsense way we day see, because If no be illiteracy we for no day accept some kind things way government day do. I don’t see any impact this as made to the economy instead it even diminishing it more, it will be less work and more labour force it may even cause overpopulation when we are trying control the population.  Government can do better please !!!",

      "body": "Some actions and inactions of Nigerian leaders are enough reason to weep bitterly for the country. Despite having everything, Nigeria is still lagging in and lacking everything, all they know is begging the international community that planned their affairs well for help like paupers. The mindset of most of our leaders is shallow, particularly those who are from the northern part of the country. Merely judging by the regular conduct and reasoning of the central and state governments by their belief that giving palliative could substitute for good policies and empowerment.If it were to be a reasonable empowerment, it would have been good in which funds could be used for start-ups, help MSMEs and roll out initiatives and ideas that could help people to tap from and get to be self-dependent financially. But the reverse is the case of what we are seeing today, one is what you've highlighted from the Kano State where the government would organise weddings for people and give many gifts, thereby wasting state resources. Come to think of it, is it the responsibility of government to sponsor citizens weddings? This is a very big shame, and I wonder how the state would develop when their thinking is awkward.Another similar event that has been happening for decades in all states of the Federation including the FCT is the government sponsoring Nigerians for pilgrimage. This is applicable to as many as possible that applied, thereby wasting state resources annually to the tune of billions of Naira on what doesn't concern the government. Other serious countries dare not do this despite being richer than Nigeria. This is so annoying, it is religious tourism for Christ's sake, and if you do not have the money for it, stay in your country, it's never by force.They should have channelled this money into more productive things like agriculture and others. Imagine how this would have helped if states took it upon themselves to engage youths in agriculture with such a huge money wasted on pilgrims annually.I will always pity Nigeria, there can't be hope in a country without visionary leaders, and this is why we find ourselves in an ugly situation.",

Not until they get job before marriage them go tell you say they have big farm or something else doing. Me I know blame the government over this oo what if that is their tradition or the youths have started doing things that are not suppose to do and they hate such behaviors from their side, the government really try with giving them food bed and some money, I believe say if na some of them marry by themselves they won't have bought things like that. You will see an hausa man now with small business having 2 wife's and na them know how they survive, even the young ones that got marry if they tell me say some of them have their own business i won't be surprise, their government try but to wait for better job them no get time for that one.",

I want make you try understand my point, make person no just jump into marriage just because government dey do marriage for people and then still expect government to feed or employ them. Secondly work full everywhere no be only government work dey sustain person, if people dey depend on government job many people for don die for hunger, for example you dey bitcointalk that one no concern government employment, in essence work full for naija wey no involve government employment. Thirldly that place na north area, and northerners no dey too depend on government employment, wetin dey common for that side na farming, na farming them dey use survive. I remember that flood season wey things dey expensive for my state why? Because no road for the Hausas to take supply food stuffs for us, and that particular season onion con cost. so I believe say na the northerners dey hold farming strong for niaja.",

Government in general term is an organization set up by the STATE to provide SECURITY and WELFARE. and I think another people e don talk am before. so weti the Kano government did is part of the provision of the welfare package for the indigenes of the land. There are different welfare packages from the government to it subjects. let me list some of the welfare packages here for you to know. Youth Empowerment by capital investment, education, skill acquisition etcStudent bursaryGiving money to the ageSupporting the poor families in the communityHousing for the citizensHousing for the civil servantsBuilding hostels for studentsHelping householdsHospital bills for the poorSchool feesBuying jamb formsAll the social amenitiespaying bride pricesAttending festivalsInfrastructure There are many to mention but I decided to stop here and all the ones I mention are under the welfare package from the government to the citizens. Apart politics, what the Kano GOVERNOR did is a perfect example of a good governor. Me as I dey like this if any politics say im go marry a woman for me and pay everything, I go happy die. Let me tell una for one thing, empowerment in Nigeria is nothing but to start the hustle. how many empowerment programmes have been launched by nigerian government but nothing come out. There are many youths out there to get married but no money to even plan am and a politician did it for them, he has won the heart of those families. Those who are on the discipline understand what I mean. here now we dey tok about the real definition of government and not the promise and fail politics. I hail the GORVENOR. I believe another package will be unlocked very soon. Obari you are not from the field of study so you would not comprehend it and also you met the local board as bread and butter phase.",

Any government giving food to the masses is more or less looking for how to control the masses that are reliant on the government to survive. Poverty is a powerful tool in the hands of the rich thats why Bitcoin is a solution to those who have understood this and want to stand free to survive and afford the feeding and strength necessary even in food form.",

I have not gotten what you are trying to say here. So who is giving fish to who ? They are talking about employment and empowerment. As for me I don't know what prompt a governnor to do dat kind thing. Now after marriage weti the families go eat. though dem dey happy say dem done marry what about di feeding.",

So why the government no just look for means to give those people jobs rather than to marry wife give them, like we all know say if person dey give us food all the time e go get days way the person go tore to dey give, so the good idea be say make them stop to dey give pipo food but make them also give people means to get the food by them self.",

Of course not.Even if he has offered them job at last but encouraging marriage as a potential to overpopulate the already populated society is a disaster.Some developed countries are trying to limit or taking control of it populations so that they can live a befitting and comfortable society while the governor ad said is sponsoring what I will call suffocation.Imagine just job opportunities was created amongst the 1,800 common citizens, I think their necessary changes would also illuminate the society and it's environment where by 1,800 youths has escaped unemployment.God said we should go and multiply into the world doesn't mean we should bring an offspring with no future of ambitions because the national economic is a threat to to cripple destinies and visions to glow the society.We must not look at the factor that a must be married and have kids. This is such a mentality that dragged out awkwardness to this height of putting to births with no ability and no possessions to to better impact creations of offsprings.",

So in as much as the government feels the need to have people sponsored in marriages they should also do well to to look for an avenue to empower them so that they can be able to take care of there family because one thing is getting married and another thing is the financial responsibility involves.",

The govt will provide them the alternative to feed their children and wives. No government do such thing and abandoned them like that. The Government will empower them with jobs. Go and make research, you go confirm am. Though we all know say na youth empowerment nai sure pass but dem been dey do empowerment before at least some let do arbitrary things. Those people wey the Governor sponsored to get married no be ordinary poor people in the society ohhh. make you k now like that. Na people wey dey help the Governor to win the election and im followers nai get this opportunity oohh. make we no just think say na me and u nai im give wives to marry ooh.This empowerment we dey talk sef no be for those people wey get marry sef but for the di poor but the politicians highjack them whenever they it initiated. The governor know weti im dey do. so make we no bother ourselves.",
